The '''30th''' annual '''[[National Geographic Bee]]''' were held in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[District of Columbia|D.C.]] It is sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society]]. The State Bees were held on April 6, where the 54 finalists will be determined.

==State Bees==
On April 6, 2018, the National Geographic State Bees were held across the 50 states, [[Washington, D.C.]], the Atlantic Territories, the Pacific Territories, and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. Fifty-four State or Territory level Champions were determined. In 2018, the prize for winning the state bee has been raised, as $200 is now given to the winner instead of $100, the old prize. The winners have also received a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Visual Atlas of the World, Second Edition. Second and third place winners received $150 and $100, respectively. The state preliminary rounds (there were 8 total) consisted of rounds about [[Geography of the United States|U.S. geography]], international geography, [[Portal:Current events|current events]], [[List of national birds|national birds]], protecting the environment, Weird but True, and a “GeoChallenge”. The GeoChallenge was a True/False round where a statement would be made about a U.S. state’s population, [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], or size, comparing it to another country, and the student would have to say if it was True or False. For example, one question was “Virginia has a higher GDP than Portugal, True or False?”-the answer is ''true.''

Vishal Sareddy, Georgia 17/20 (8/10 + 9/10)

Ashwin Sivakumar, Oregon 17/20 (8/10 + 9/10)

Nihar Janga, Texas 17/20 (10/10 + 7/10)

*Krishna Kamalakannan, North Dakota also finished with 17 out of 20 points was eliminated by a tiebreaker test the students had taken specifically for the purpose of breaking ties.

==Final Rounds==
The top 10 contestants with the highest scores in the preliminary rounds was held May 23, 2018. Venkat Ranjan from California was the champion, with Anoushka Buddhikot from New Jersey coming 2nd, and Vishal Sareddy from Georgia placing third.
Once the top three had been decided, Sareddy, Ranjan and Buddhikot were asked another "Geochallenge Question." They were asked to choose the best location for a new river clean-up effort. They were asked to choose from the Rhine River, Yangtze River and Niger River. (Yangtze was the correct answer.) After the responses were scored, Buddhikot and Ranjan advanced to the championship round, which was played in sudden death format. The first question: "What country borders the Wetar and Omboi Straits?" was answered correctly (East Timor) by both contestants. Then, a second question: "Lebanon has a population most similar to what South American country?" was answered correctly by Ranjan (Paraguay) and he was declared the winner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2854">An '''achievement test''' is a [[test (student assessment)|test]] of developed skill or knowledge. The most common type of achievement test is a [[standardized test]] developed to measure skills and knowledge learned in a given grade level, usually through planned instruction, such as training or classroom instruction.&lt;ref name=HDE&gt;Hawaii Department of Education. (1999, November 19). ''Assessment Terminology''. Retrieved June 11, 2007, from {{cite web |url=http://www.k12.hi.us/~atr/evaluation/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714030414/http://www.k12.hi.us/~atr/evaluation/glossary.htm |archivedate=2007-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UWS&gt;University of Wisconsin–Stout.

Retrieved June 11, 2007, from {{cite web|url=http://faculty.uwstout.edu/lawlerm/at101/glossary.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210551/http://faculty.uwstout.edu/lawlerm/at101/glossary.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Achievement tests are often contrasted with tests that measure [[aptitude]], a more general and stable [[cognitive]] trait.

Achievement [[test score]]s are often used in an educational system to determine the level of instruction for which a student is prepared. High achievement scores usually indicate a mastery of grade-level material, and the readiness for advanced instruction. Low achievement scores can indicate the need for remediation or repeating a course grade.

Under [[No Child Left Behind]], achievement tests have taken on an additional role of assessing [[Expertise|proficiency]] of students. Proficiency is defined as the amount of grade-appropriate knowledge and skills a student has acquired up to the point of testing. Better teaching practices are expected to increase the amount learned in a school year, and therefore to increase achievement scores, and yield more "proficient" students than before.

When writing achievement test items, writers usually begin with a list of [[content standards]] (either written by content specialists or based on state-created content standards) which specify exactly what students are expected to learn in a given school year. The goal of item writers is to create test items that measure the most important skills and knowledge attained in a given grade-level. The number and type of test items written is determined by the grade-level content standards. [[Content validity]] is determined by the representativeness of the items included on the final test.

'''Andrew Wojtanik''' (born 1989) was the winner of the [[National Geographic Bee]] hosted by [[Alex Trebek]] in [[16th National Geographic Bee|2004]], and the [[National Geographic World Championship]] in 2005. To get to the National Geographic Bee finals, he survived two tiebreakers to advance to the final round against 13-year-old Matthew Wells of [[Montana]], beating him to win a [[U.S. dollar|$]]25,000 scholarship. He credits his success to a 384-page book he compiled, which is now an official study guide for the Bee, called "Afghanistan to Zimbabwe: Country Facts That Helped Me Win the National Geographic Bee", which was published in 2004. A second edition, "The National Geographic Bee Ultimate Fact Book: Countries A to Z", was published in 2011. Andrew lived in [[Overland Park, Kansas]] and in 2008 graduated from [[Blue Valley West High School]]. His family has since moved to [[Florida]].

He attended [[Georgetown University]], majoring in International Politics. There, he served as events director for the Georgetown [[College Democrats]] and was active in many other campus organizations. He now works for the [[Harvard Kennedy School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Wojtanik |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/andrew-wojtanik |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School |accessdate=11 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612203603/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/andrew-wojtanik |archivedate=12 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a research assistant.

Many [[immigrant]] communities in the United States are engaged in [[community organizing]] activities. Of over 50 million immigrants living in the United States&lt;ref name=Camarota&gt;{{cite web|last=Camarota|first=Steven|title=Immigrants in the United States, 2010: A Profile of America's Foreign-Born Population|url=http://www.cis.org/2012-profile-of-americas-foreign-born-population|year=2012|publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; many may experience [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] in the workforce and different forms of [[discrimination]] and challenges in their lives.&lt;ref name=Gabriel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabriel|first=Jackie|title=Si, Se Puede: Organizing Latino Immigrant Workers in South Omaha's Meatpacking Industry|journal=Journal of Labor Research|year=2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=68–87|doi=10.1007/s12122-007-9025-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many voluntary associations that seek to meet the needs of immigrants utilize community organizing methods aiming to mobilize and empower them and advocate for them.

==History==
Community organizing in immigrant communities in the United States began in the 18th century but became more prevalent between the 1860s and World War I.&lt;ref name="Moya 833–864"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moya|first=Jose C.|title=Immigrants and Associations: A Global and Historical Perspective|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|date=September 2005|volume=31|issue=5|pages=833–864|doi=10.1080/13691830500178147}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of community organizing came about as a result of the growing immigrant population in the U.S. over the years. During the nineteenth century, many of the farm workers were Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and Mexican workers.&lt;ref name=UFU&gt;{{cite web|last=Tejado-Flores|first=Rick|title=The United Farmworkers Union|url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/fightfields/cesarchavez1.html|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants often enter the U.S. through traditional gateway cities, such as San Francisco, New York, Boston and Chicago, and since the 1960s, the foreign-born population has more than doubled from 5.4 percent to 12.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Leon|first=Erwin|title=COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION|url=http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/411986_community_based_organizations.pdf|publisher=The Urban Institute|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially, the American environment stimulated the need for this way of organizing.&lt;ref name="Moya 833–864"/&gt; It was important for this population to come together and organize in order to either assimilate into American culture or integrate in respective communities.

Immigrant organizations vary greatly in size and can be well established or unstable.&lt;ref name="Schrover 823–832"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrover|first=Marlou|author2=Vermeulen, Floris|title=Immigrant Organisations|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|date=September 2005|volume=31|issue=5|pages=823–832|doi=10.1080/13691830500177792}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular reasons for the forming of these organizations is defensive — a response to exclusion — and offensive — a way to set themselves apart from others.&lt;ref name="Schrover 823–832"/&gt; Over the years, these organizations have formed to respond to the particular needs of immigrants, such as immigrant rights, worker rights and civic engagement.

==Issues addressed in immigrant community organizing==
Issues addressed in immigrant community organizing include immigrant rights, [[worker rights]], access to higher education and [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref name="Padres &amp; Jovenes Unidos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Padres &amp; Jovenes Unidos|title=Our Vision: The freedom to Learn|url=http://www.padresunidos.org/about-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="centro presente"&gt;{{cite web|last=Centro Presente|title=What We Do|url=http://www.cpresente.org/what-we-do}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYIC&gt;{{cite web|last=New York Immigration United for Justice and Opportunity|title=Issues|url=http://www.thenyic.org/issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a well known community organizing movement in which immigrants participated was the [[Delano grape strike]] and boycott in 1965. This was led by the [[United Farm Workers]] in the effort to improve the treatment of farm workers by the farm labor system.&lt;ref name="Grape Stricke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tavaana|title=Fighting for Farm Workers' Rights: Cesar Chavez, the Delano Grape Strike and Boycott|url=http://tavaana.org/en/content/fighting-farm-workers-rights-cesar-chavez-delano-grape-strike-and-boycott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of organizing in immigrant communities==
There are certain distinctive characteristics of community organizing in immigrant communities, and it is critical for community organizers to do an assessment of the community prior to entering. Studies have shown that motivation for immigrating to the United States is associated with engagement in political and social justice work. For example, immigrants who came to the United States as refugees or asylum seekers are less likely to join organizations fighting for social and economic justice unless they felt their safety has been threatened.&lt;ref name=Ochs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ochs|first=Mary|author2=Peyes Mayron|title=Immigrant Organizing: Patterns, Challenge &amp; Opportunities|journal=Social Policy|year=2004|volume=33|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is very important for community organizers to recognize and understand the diversity in immigrant communities, diversity within countries of origin, reasons for immigration, and challenges they face.

===Language differences===
One distinguishing characteristic of community organizing in immigrant communities is the existence of language differences. The majority of newly arrived immigrants are not native-English speakers.&lt;ref name=Ochs /&gt; For this reason, it is essential for the organizers to have effective means of communication  with the community. An effective approach can be communicating in their native language whenever possible in order to eliminate barriers.&lt;ref name=Gabriel /&gt; There is a high demand for individuals who are bilingual and or multicultural who are capacitated to work with immigrant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacob A. Riss Neighborhood Settlement|title=Advocate/Immigrant Community Organizer|url=http://www.citylimits.org/jobs/10182/advocate-immigrant-community-organizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations have a policy to operate under the leadership of members from that ethnic group.&lt;ref name="centro presente" /&gt;

===Partnership With other organizations and institutions===
Faith-based organizations and other existing cultural, recreational, and social ethnic associations are places where immigrants seek moral and social support.&lt;ref name=Ochs /&gt; Recent immigrants are more likely to be affiliated with these types of organizations.&lt;ref name=Ochs /&gt; In some studies, immigrants have stated that their faith and the support of their faith organization played a central role in overcoming their fears and oppositions when engaged in social and economic justice work.&lt;ref name=Gabriel /&gt; Therefore, reaching out to organizations and institutions that have an established relationship with the immigrant community, whether faith-based or community-based, is found to be beneficial for immigrant community organizers.&lt;ref name=Gabriel /&gt;

===Strategies and social services===
Existing immigrant organizations that focus on organizing place most of their attention and resources on policy advocacy, civic participation, community education and leadership training.&lt;ref name="Padres &amp; Jovenes Unidos" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYIC /&gt; Recent immigrants are often unaware of the American political system and have little political power because of their citizenship status. Hence, organizers aim to build their organization's power through voter registration, voter education, and political campaigns.&lt;ref name="Padres &amp; Jovenes Unidos" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYIC /&gt;

In addition to organizing around issues that affect the population that they serve, organizations also provide community education and social services.&lt;ref name="centro presente" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYIC /&gt; These services range from classes on English for speakers of other languages, workshops on issues and legislation that affect the immigrant community, and legal services for renewal of work permits to assisting in the naturalization process.&lt;ref name="centro presente" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYIC /&gt;

== Educational strategies ==

===Before independence===

Before Namibia's independence, the country's education system was designed to reinforce [[apartheid]] rather than provide the necessary human resource base to promote equitable social and economic development. It was fragmented along racial and ethnic lines, with vast disparities in both the allocation of resources and the quality of education offered.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/na/so2.htm |title=Namibia Africa: Strategic Objectives: Quality Primary Education |accessdate=2008-08-04 |publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] |date=2008-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816151933/http://www.usaid.gov/na/so2.htm |archive-date=2008-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }} ''This article incorporates text from this source which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence===

The new Government of the Republic of Namibia (GRN) set about to create one unified structure for education administration. Currently, Namibia allocates more than 20% of its national budget to education. This represents six to seven percent of Namibia's total GDP and is one of the three countries with the highest percentage of GDP directed toward education in the world.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt; Educational institutions in Namibia and their portfolio are accredited by the [[Namibia Qualifications Authority]] (NQA). This institution evaluates and accredits national institutions and degrees, as well as foreign qualifications of people who wish to demonstrate the national equivalence of their degrees earned abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] opine that the investment is paying off. A new, uniform and learner-centered curriculum for grades one through twelve, finalized in 1998, has received recognition beyond Namibia's borders and significant progress has been made in the use of English (which replaced Afrikaans as the nation's official language) as a medium of instruction. About 95 percent of school age children attend school and the number of teachers has increased by almost 30 percent since 1990. Over 3000 new classrooms have been built. As a result of these improvements, repetition rates in all grades have been reduced. Whereas in 1991, half the learners in grade 1 were repeating the grade, by 2003, over 84 percent of learners were earning their promotions on time. Dropout rates have also plummeted.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

On the other hand, Namibia's former Minister of Education [[Abraham Iyambo]] summarily described the Namibian education system as "crippled",&lt;ref name="NE_Nakale"&gt;{{cite news

A National Conference on Education, running from 27 June to 1 July 2011, was conferred to address the most pressing issues.&lt;ref name="NE_Nakale"/&gt;

The Namibian education system is experiencing many obstacles. It is faced with serious weaknesses in the provision of education to all. Additionally the quality of education, quality of teachers and the performance of learners is unsatisfactory. The Ministry of Education is drafting an improvement program that is known as the ETSIP (Education and Training Sector Improvement Program). The ETSIP aims to align the entire Namibian education system to Namibia’s Vision 2030 and the needs of the Namibian population.&lt;ref name=nied/&gt;

In all government schools, primary education is free since 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Free Primary Education from 2013 | publisher=[[Government of Namibia]] | date=20 December 2012 | url=http://www.moe.gov.na/news_article.php?id=97&amp;title=Free%20Primary%20Education%20from%202013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary education since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Free secondary education in 2016 – Hanse-Himarwa | newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] | date=10 November 2015 | url=https://www.newera.com.na/2015/11/10/free-secondary-education-2016-hanse-himarwa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tertiary educational institutions, both private and public, charge tuition fees.

==Education sectors==

Curriculum development, educational research, and professional development of school teachers is centrally organised by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) in [[Okahandja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nied.edu.na/ |title=National Institute for Educational Development |publisher=Nied.edu.na |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-primary education===

The Namibian government introduced a three-year pre-primary education pilot programme in 2008. This programme was subsequently given a two-year extension and will thus run until 2013. It aims at giving children from poor backgrounds access to pre-primary education and is aimed at children between the ages of five and six. The programme requires the implementation of pre-primary education at primary schools. The progress on the pilot programme thus far:
* [[Khomas Region]] - 21 of the 67 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education.
* [[ǁKaras Region]] - 18 out of 38 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education.
* [[Caprivi Region]] - 24 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education. 
* [[Ohangwena Region]] - 27 of the 138 primary schools have introduced pre-primary education.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com.na/article.php?title=Integration_of_preprimary_education_into_formal_education_system_progressing_well&amp;id=665 |author=Kupulo,C |title=Integration of pre-primary education into formal education system progressing well |publisher=[[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2010-09-25 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary education===
{{main|List of schools in Namibia}}

Compulsory education starts at primary education level at an age of 6. Primary education consists of seven years from Grade 1 to Grade 7 to prepare children for secondary education.&lt;ref name="nied"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nied.edu.na/Bep/en-background.htm |title=The Program Basic Education Namibia |accessdate=2010-09-25 |publisher=NIED |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311184257/http://www.nied.edu.na/Bep/en-background.htm |archive-date=2011-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}} The Namibian Government introduced free primary education in 2013.

===Secondary education===
{{main|List of schools in Namibia}}

Secondary education stretches over a period of 5 years from Grade 8 to Grade 12. Children are presented with a Junior Secondary School Certificate after successful completion of Grade 10.

After successful completion of Grade 12 learners are presented with a Namibia Senior Secondary Education Certificate. This certification can either be the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (IGCSE) or the [[Higher International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (HIGCSE). IGCSE exam papers are set and marked in Namibia, but moderated by [[Cambridge]]. HIGCSE question papers are set, marked and moderated by the [[University of Cambridge]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

Grade 12 cannot be repeated on a full time basis, for learners that wish to pursue further studies they need to obtain a good grade as per the requirements of tertiary institution both locally or abroad. The Evaluation Scale for Grade 12 is:&lt;ref name=nied/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}}
*IGCSE grades: 	A B C D E F G
*Equivalent points: 	7 6 5 4 3 2 1
*HIGCSE grades:	1 2 3 4
*Equivalent points: 	10 9 8 7

===Tertiary education===

====Universities and colleges====
{{main|List of universities in Namibia}}

Namibia has two public tertiary institutions of general education, the [[Namibia University of Science and Technology]] (NUST) and the [[University of Namibia]] (UNAM) and one private University, the [[International University of Management]] (IUM). At NUST admission is based on grade 12 certificate with a maximum of five qualifying subjects with a total score of 25 points or more and a E symbol or better in English.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polytechnic.edu.na/admissions/admis.php |title=Admissions |accessdate=2010-09-25 |publisher=[[Polytechnic of Namibia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234919/http://www.polytechnic.edu.na/admissions/admis.php |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Namibia’s basic requirement for entrance to undergraduate degree programmes is a Namibia Senior Secondary Certificate (NSSC) with a pass in five subjects with a total score of 25 points, on the UNAM evaluation scale, or more in not more than three examination sittings.&lt;ref name="unam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unam.na/applying_unam/admission.html |title= General Admission Criteria for Undergraduate Programmes |accessdate=2010-09-25 | publisher=[[University of Namibia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of specialised tertiary educational institutions such as the [[College of the Arts, Windhoek|College of the Arts]] (Cota) in [[Windhoek]],&lt;ref name="AL"&gt;{{cite news

====Vocational education====
[[File:Namibian plumbing students.jpg|thumb|right|Namibian plumbing students]]

The Namibian Training Authority (NTA) controls seven vocational centers and supports a number of other institutions like Namwater. They offer a range of courses for school leavers, including; Plumbing, Welding, Electrical general, Automotive electrical, Bricklaying, Cabinet making, Technical drawing, Dressmaking, Hospitality, Office management and Automotive mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Vocational students in Namibia are given a small amount of money from the government to assist them in attending Vocational Training Centers.

==Statistics==

In 1997, the gross primary enrollment rate was 130.6 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 91.2 percent. According to the Ministry of Labor’s child labor survey, 80 percent of working children between the ages of 6 and 18 continue to attend school while they are employed.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; In 1998, there were 400,325 Namibian students in primary school and 115,237 students in secondary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio in 1999 was estimated at 32:1, with about 8% of the GDP being spent on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Namibia-EDUCATION.html |title=Namibia – Education |publisher=Encyclopedia of Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the Namibian education system accommodated approximately 600,000 learners of which 174,000 were senior secondary students and below 10,000 were pre-primary pupils.&lt;ref name="NamSpotlight"&gt;{{cite news

Professional development for educators may include [[teacher training]], and is usually considered pre-service, or before beginning teaching. However faculty development ''and'' professional development may both be used to refer to on-going professional learning for educators. Such learning may take place during work hours, such as "in-service" within K-12 settings, or it may be beyond work hours. These learning pursuits may be for credit or noncredit; therefore they may be with a college or university, through a school district, or private consulting agency. Additionally educators may pursue [[self-directed learning]] professional development, although the term faculty development is less commonly applied to this scope of activity.

K-12 faculty development and professional development and higher education faculty development and professional development have very different traditions, practices and terminologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/606752555|title=Keeping pace with technology, vol. 1 : the promise and potential for k-12 educators|last=King|first=Kathleen P.|publisher=Hampton Press|year=2002|isbn=1572734329|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=|oclc=606752555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954710961|title=Keeping pace with technology, vol. 2 : the challenge and promise for higher education faculty|last=King|first=Kathleen P.|publisher=Hampton Press|year=2003|isbn=157273471X|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=|oclc=954710961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education faculty development is beginning to take place not just face-to-face but also online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenthal|first=Patrick R.|date=September 2008|title=Online Faculty Development and Storytelling: An Unlikely Solution to Improving Teacher Quality|url=http://jolt.merlot.org/vol4no3/lowenthal_0908.pdf|journal=MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching|volume=4|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Financial Times]], FutureLearn was the first platform to enable students to earn credits towards a degree from a top UK university from their tablets and [[Smartphone|smartphones]], 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c80a4ec0-225a-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d|title=FutureLearn to enable study on Moocs to count towards a degree|last=Moules|first=Jonathan|date=2016-05-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
FutureLearn's courses span a broad range of topics. The first course opened on 14 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parr |first=Chris |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/pm-hails-new-arrivals-to-futurelearn/2001765.article |title=PM hails new arrivals to Futurelearn &amp;#124; News |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first courses to be made available included "Web science: how the web is changing the world" ([[University of Southampton]]), "Introduction to ecosystems" ([[The Open University]]), "Improving your image: dental photography in practice" ([[University of Birmingham]]), "Causes of war" ([[King's College London]]), "The discovery of the Higgs boson" ([[University of Edinburgh]]), "Discover dentistry" ([[University of Sheffield]]), "Muslims in Britain: changes and challenges" ([[Cardiff University]]), "Begin programming: build your first mobile game" ([[University of Reading]]) and "England in the time of King Richard III" ([[University of Leicester]]).

== Country restrictions ==
In April 2017, FutureLearn blocked their courses for users in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria as a result of US sanctions on those territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/restricted-course-access|title=Restricted course access for learners in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea or Syria |website = FutureLearn |date = |access-date = 22 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions were lifted in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/lifting-restrictions-learners-crimea-cuba-iran-north-korea-syria|title=Lifting restrictions for learners in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria |website=FutureLearn |date=  |access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gratz v. Bollinger''''', 539 U.S. 244 (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Gratz v. Bollinger|link=|volume=539|page=244|pin=|year=2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of United States Supreme Court cases|case]] regarding the [[University of Michigan]] undergraduate [[affirmative action]] [[University and college admissions|admissions]] policy. In a 6&amp;ndash;3 decision announced on June 23, 2003, [[Chief Justice Rehnquist]], writing for the Court, ruled the University's point system's "predetermined point allocations" that awarded 20 points towards admission to underrepresented minorities "ensures that the diversity contributions of applicants cannot be individually assessed" and was therefore unconstitutional.

==Case==
The University of Michigan used a 150-point scale to rank applicants, with 100 points needed to guarantee admission. The University gave underrepresented ethnic groups, including [[African-American]]s, [[Hispanic]]s, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], an automatic 20-point bonus towards their score, while a perfect SAT score was worth 12 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gratz v. Bollinger: Motion for Summary Judgment|url=http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/admissions/legal/gratz/gratsumj.html|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=3 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221121122/http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/admissions/legal/gratz/gratsumj.html|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioners, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, both residents of [[Michigan]], applied for admission to the [[University of Michigan]]'s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). Gratz applied for admission in the fall of 1995 and Hamacher in the fall of 1997.  Both were subsequently denied admission to the university. Gratz and Hamacher were contacted by the [[Center for Individual Rights]], which filed a lawsuit on their behalf in October 1997. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the University of Michigan, the College of LSA, James Duderstadt, and Lee Bollinger. Duderstadt was president of the university while Gratz's application was under consideration, and Bollinger while Hamacher's was under consideration. Their class-action lawsuit alleged "violations and threatened violations of the rights of the plaintiffs and the class they represent to [[equal protection]] of the laws under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]... and for racial discrimination."

Like ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger|Grutter]],'' the case was heard in District Court, appealed to the [[Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]], and asked to be heard before the Supreme Court.

==Issues of standing==
It has been argued by some that Jennifer Gratz lacked [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] to bring this action. Gratz applied in 1995, three years before the University of Michigan adopted its points system. Gratz could not claim injury as a result of the points system, and thus, under traditional legal rules, Gratz lacked standing. Gratz chose not to attend the University of Michigan by declining the university's offer to be placed on a waiting list. Every Michigan student who agreed to go onto the waiting list in the spring of 1995 was admitted to the University of Michigan for the Fall 1995 semester.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, Gratz argues that she did fill out the paperwork for said waiting list, but the University claims it got lost.

The Court's majority found that Gratz and co-plaintiff Hamacher had standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief, relying on ''Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville'', 508 U.S. 656 (1993). Here the "injury in fact" necessary to establish standing in the case was the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, and not in the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.

'''''IT Manager III: Unseen Forces''''' was a web-based [[information technology]] (IT) simulation game from [[Intel]] in which the player managed an IT department in a corporate environment. 
 
There were two aspects to the game. Firstly, the player had to ensure that employees' desktop PCs, laptops and servers kept running smoothly. There were dozens of software and hardware faults to tackle of varying complexity.

As the player's company grew, it placed increasing demands on IT departments, and the player had to ensure that the technologies were rolled out to take the strain. This gave the game a second strategic dimension. Upgraded and new technologies reduced maintenance costs, increased security and made employees happier and more productive.

The game spanned eight levels. Each represented a bigger office than the last, and the IT issues were more challenging. If the player could improve productivity whilst maintaining a good working environment, the company's share price would go up. When it hit its target value, the level would be complete.

IT Manager III is no longer online. In July 2012, it was replaced by its successor, the multiplayer [[IT Manager: Duels]].

== Awards ==

IT Manager III: Unseen Forces was shortlisted for the NMA effectiveness awards in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmaawards.co.uk/Shortlist.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915064920/http://www.nmaawards.co.uk/Shortlist.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the 2009 British Interactive Media Association award in the best business-to-business category&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prlog.org/10425726-mrm-london-wins-2009-bima-award.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the Intel Innovation Grand Prix award 2011, which Intel acknowledges a top supplier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121008/AGENCIES02/310089937/direct-agency-of-the-year-mrm-blends-technology-creativity&amp;template=printart&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4451">'''The International Adult and Continuing Education (IACE) Hall of Fame''' was founded in 1996 "to honor leaders in the fields of continuing education and adult learning and to serve as a record and inspiration for the next generation of continuing education leaders".&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/about.html |title=Homepage Hall of Fame |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, adult and continuing education leaders from around the world are selected for induction into the IACE Hall of Fame.

==History==
The story of the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame officially began in the early 1990s with the desire to provide a mechanism to honor and document contributions of the past to better build the future. Dr. Thurman J. White, a pioneer in the field of continuing education for adult and nontraditional students, contributor to the theoretical base of [[adult education]] and initiator of the Oklahoma College of Continuing Education at University of Oklahoma, initiated this idea in cooperation with current leaders and officers of several associations and organizations in the USA (University Continuing Education Association, [[ASTD|American Society for Training and Development]], AAACE/American Association of Adult and Continuing Education,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaace.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|ECOP/National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges]]).

The Hall was incorporated in the state of Oklahoma on September 20, 1995, as a nonprofit corporation. The Hall of Fame, in the beginning focused mostly to the USA, more and more inducted members from other countries. In  2006 the first induction ceremony took place out of the USA (Bamberg, Germany).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/andragogik/08/andragogik/andragogy/HOF/06-HOF-Bamberg.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Logo of the society:&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;
[[File:IACEHallofFame-header.jpg|center|alt=Logo Header]]

==Structure==
The Hall of Fame operates with a small central staff in the Office of the Vice President for Outreach at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Inducted members elect a Board of Directors, which manages the induction process and organizes symposia and other Hall activities.

==Hall of Fame Members==
Scholars, practitioners, and policy makers reflect the diversity of adult and continuing education practice and scholarship and the increasingly global leadership community that constitutes the IACE Hall of Fame. Anyone may nominate a candidate for induction into the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame. A Selection Committee reviews nominations and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, which selects the final group to be inducted every year. The Nomination Instructions claim: "To be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame, a person must be eminently distinguished in the profession, shall have brought honor or distinction, and shall have contributed to the heritage of adult and continuing education."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/IACEHOF%20Nomination_form%202011.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first induction in 1996, the Hall of Fame has inducted more than 250 members&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/inductees.html&lt;/ref&gt; from 27 nations.

==Location==
The official home for the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame is the University of Oklahoma's Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education (OCCE), Norman, Oklahoma.

==Meetings==
The IACE Hall of Fame typically holds its annual induction ceremony and symposium in conjunction with the annual conference of a major national/international professional association in the field: for example in 2008 in Budapest in conjunction with the Unesco/Confintea-conference, in 2010 in Guadalajara with CREAD/Inter-American Distance Education Consortium, and 2011 in Toronto with [http://www.upcea.edu/ UPCEA/University Professional &amp; Continuing Education Association.]

Widely considered one of the most influential figures in [[new flamenco|nuevo flamenco]]{{cn|date=March 2016}} music, he incorporates elements of [[flamenco rumba]], [[jazz]] and many forms of [[world music]] into his work. He is a [[Juno Award]] winner, ''[[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar]]'' Player's Choice Award silver winner in the Flamenco Category, and a three-time winner of the Canadian [[Smooth Jazz]] award for Guitarist of the Year.

==Life and career==
Born to photographer and filmmaker [[John Cook (filmmaker)|John Cook]] and television director and producer Heather Cook,&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Cook Boulder Theater |url=http://www.bouldertheater.com/event/jesse-cook |website=bouldertheater.com |publisher=Boulder Theater |accessdate=26 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092500/http://www.bouldertheater.com/event/jesse-cook |archivedate= 4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nephew to artist [[Arnaud Maggs]], Jesse Cook spent the first few years of his life moving between Paris, Southern France and [[Barcelona]].

After his parents separated, Cook and his sister accompanied his mother to her birth country, Canada, where he took lessons at Toronto's [[Eli Kassner]] Guitar Academy, and eventually studied under Kassner.{{cn|date=February 2018}} While Cook was still a teenager, his father retired to the French city of [[Arles]] in the [[Camargue]] where his neighbor was [[Nicolas Reyes]], lead singer of the flamenco group the [[Gipsy Kings]]. During frequent visits to Arles, Jesse Cook became increasingly fascinated by the "Camargue sound", the rhythmic, flamenco-rumba approach that could be heard on many corners and cafés in the "gipsy barrio".

Back at home, he continued his studies in classical and jazz guitar at Canada's [[The Royal Conservatory of Music|Royal Conservatory of Music]], [[York University]], and [[Berklee College of Music]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berklee.edu/bt/old_issues/contents/spring1997.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414164103/http://www.berklee.edu/bt/old_issues/contents/spring1997.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has often quipped that he later attempted to unlearn it all while immersing himself in the oral traditions of gypsy music.

After the independent 1995 release in Canada of his debut album, ''Tempest'', he played at the 1995 Catalina Jazz Festival; shortly afterwards, ''Tempest'' entered the American Billboard charts at No. 14.

Cook has recorded eight studio albums, three live DVDs and has traveled the world exploring musical traditions that he has blended into his style of rumba flamenco.

In 1998, Cook was nominated for a Juno Award as Instrumental Artist of the Year.&lt;ref name="Juno"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Summary Jesse Cook|url=http://junoawards.ca/awards/artist-summary/?artist_name=Jesse+Cook&amp;submit=Search|website=junoawards.ca|publisher=The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910061341/http://junoawards.ca/awards/artist-summary/?artist_name=Jesse+Cook&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he received a Juno Nomination for Best Male Artist. In 2001, Cook won a [[Juno Award]] in the Best Instrumental Album category for ''Free Fall''. In 2009, he was [[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar]]'s Player's Choice Award silver winner in the Flamenco category (gold went to [[Paco de Lucía|Paco de Lucia]]).&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt; He is a three-time winner of the Canadian Smooth Jazz award for Guitarist of the Year&lt;ref name="Montalvo"/&gt; and numerous other awards.

'''The Longford Lectures''' are held annually in November at [[Church House, Westminster]]. They aim to provide a national platform for a serious contribution to questions of social and penal reform.

The Lectures are organised by [[The Longford Trust]] which celebrates the achievements and continues the work of [[Lord Longford]]. It was established in 2002 by friends and admirers to further the goals he pursued, particularly in the field of social and prison reform.

The Longford Lectures were sponsored originally by ''[[The Independent]]'' and more recently by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.

In addition to the Lectures, the Trust bestows [[The Longford Prize]] on individuals and organisations who play a prominent role in the field of prison reform.

The broadcaster and journalist [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] chairs the event every year.

== Past Lectures ==

Full transcripts and films of each Lecture is available on the [http://www.longfordtrust.org Longford Trust] website.

'''Mama''' is an [[object-oriented]] [[educational programming language]] designed to help young students start programming by providing all language elements in the student mother tongue. Mama programming language is available in several languages, with both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) language direction support.

A new variant of Mama was built on top of Carnegie Mellon's [[Alice (software)|Alice]] development environment, supporting scripting of the 3D stage objects. This new variant of Mama was designed to help young students start programming by building 3D animations and games.

==History==
The first versions of Mama - 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 - provided simple [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) which contained support to standard elements such as text editor with [[syntax highlighting]], compiler, debugger, output window, etc. Starting at version 1.5, Mama was integrated with the open source Alice IDE to support drag and drop programming and 3D animating. Mama versions are implemented in Java.

The current release of Mama, version 1.5.4, is available both in English and in Hebrew, and it runs on Microsoft Windows.

==Design==
Mama was designed to address the following problems in educational programming:
# Industrial programming languages are designed to be usable for production code, thus introducing additional complexity. Mama is designed solely to teach programming concepts, providing simple and quick development of programs.
# Syntax errors frustrate students when start learning programming - Mama's variant over Alice uses a drag and drop environment to create [[computer animation]]s using [[3D computer graphics|3D models]].

Mama language is a pure [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented language]], while the Alice IDE is [[object based]]. That implies that while writing textual scripts with Mama language supports all object oriented elements ([[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]], [[generic programming]], [[Observer pattern]] style event handling), creating objects and methods with the drag and drop interface is object based - there is no inheritance (and thus no polymorphism). The last observation may confuse beginners - thus it is suggested to use Mama scripts only as advance topics in CS courses.

Mama 1.5 main improvements over Alice version 2.2:
* added Mama programming language as a (rich) scripting language - 3D scene objects can be manipulated using this scripting mechanism
* full Unicode support 
* creation and editing of 3D objects 
* support uploading movies to YouTube and publishing in Facebook
* support for scenery and characters
* tutorial editor tool for instructors
* movie export with audio
* user standalone executables
* better menu logic
* many bug fixes

==IDE Basics==
There are several parts in IDE window: at the top you'll find the main menu and the toolbar, which let you execute commands such as create/open a worlds, import 3D objects into the world, create a standalone application, export the animation to YouTube, etc.

The five windows contained in the main window are:
*'''object tree''' - contains the object list in the current world. 
*'''3D window''' - this is where objects are positioned, moved, turned, etc. 
*'''events area''' - lets you edit what happens upon occur of certain event.
*'''details area''' - contains information about the currently selected object in 3 tabs: properties, methods and functions.
*'''editor area''' (at the bottom) - that's where the program code is written, using drag and drop of instructions.

When in scene editing mode, two of the above parts are replaced:
*'''control panel''' - replaces the events area, and displays various controls that help manipulating objects in  the 3D window.
*'''object gallery''' - replaces the editor area, and displays objects in hierarchic folders to be selected and embedded in the 3D window.

Following are the basic types available in Alice IDE:
*'''Number''' - a numeric type, represents both integers and reals
*'''Boolean''' - a boolean value, accepting either true or false
*'''Object''' - a general Mama object
*'''String''' - a string, a collection of characters
*'''Color''' - an RGB color
*'''TextureMap''' - a texture map
*'''Sound''' - a sound
*'''Pose''' - a captured pose of an object
*'''Position''' - a 3D array defining a position in the 3D space
*'''Orientation''' - a 3D array defining the orientation in the 3D space
*'''PointOfView''' - a combination of a '''Position''' and '''Orientation'''

The control instructions available in the bottom of the editor area are:
*'''doInOrder''' - execute a sequence of instructions sequentially
*'''doTogether''' - execute a sequence of instructions simultaneously
*'''if''' - execute a sequence of instructions sequentially only under a given condition
*'''while''' - execute a sequence of instructions sequentially while a given condition holds
*'''for''' - execute a sequence of instructions sequentially a given number of times
*'''forAllInOrder''' - execute a sequence of instructions sequentially iterating over the given collection
*'''forAllTogether''' - execute a sequence of instructions simultaneously iterating over the given collection
*'''wait''' - wait a given number of seconds
*'''print''' - print the given data to the output console
*'''assert''' - assert that a condition is true, display a message if the condition is false (new in Mama 1.5)
*'''Script''' - add a free Mama script to the program
*'''#''' - add a comment to the program

The '''Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project''' is a program designed to mobilize talented upper-level law students to teach courses on constitutional law and juvenile justice in public high schools.  Headquartered at the [[Washington College of Law]] in Washington, D.C., the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project was founded In the fall of 1999 by Professor [[Jamin Raskin]].  This movement for constitutional literacy is rooted in the belief that students will profit for a lifetime from learning the system of rights and responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution. Many citizens do not participate and feel disengaged from politics. The teaching fellows work with teachers, administrators and lawyers to teach students their rights as citizens, the strategic benefits of voting, how lawmaking occurs, and other fundamental constitutional processes.&lt;ref name="Marshall Brennan Home Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wcl.american.edu/marshallbrennan/|title="We the Students" - Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project - American University Washington College of Law|website=Wcl.american.edu|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project has had chapters in twenty U.S. law schools, with 18 currently in operation.&lt;ref name="Marshall Brennan Home Page" /&gt;

==History of the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project==
The Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project was conceived by law professor Jamin Raskin when he was approached by a group of high school students in Montgomery County, Maryland, who felt their freedom of speech was being violated.  The students were part of a communications academy at their school and helped run a talk show on a local cable television station affiliated with the school.  They had put together a program called "Shades of Gray," during which they interviewed experts on difficult topics of the day.  One particular show included a debate on gay marriage, and the students had lined up two speakers in favor of gay marriage and two against.  The program was taped and approved by the teacher who oversaw it.&lt;ref name="History of Marshall Brennan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=5c574e17f8&amp;view=att&amp;th=137d216dce9733ab&amp;attid=0.2&amp;disp=inline&amp;safe=1&amp;zw&amp;saduie=AG9B_P9XOs-lmW-NMa39DY302Lgh&amp;sadet=1340637786537&amp;sads=iYX2FlfOe4w7d42pnaq7gviSqwM|title=Gmail|website=Mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the show was pulled before it aired.  School officials deemed the show "inappropriate" for the station.  When the students contacted him, Professor Raskin wanted to go straight to court, but the students asked for help in first exhausting all remedies at the school district level before pursuing litigation.  In the end, the students appealed to the school board and won a reversal of the superintendent's censorship of the program.  The program aired six times instead of the one or two times it would have aired had the superintendent allowed it in the first place.&lt;ref name="History of Marshall Brennan" /&gt;

This experience led Professor Raskin to the realization that high school students, especially urban students, are not taught about the Constitution and how it affects their daily lives.  When he compared the resources he had to this need for constitutional literacy, the idea for the project was born.

The project officially started in the fall of 1999 with 20 law students who volunteered to teach in eight public schools in Washington D.C. and Montgomery County.&lt;ref name="History of Marshall Brennan" /&gt;

==Current chapters and leadership==
The Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project currently has twenty-one chapters and is led out of Washington College of Law in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Marshall Brennan Chapters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wcl.american.edu/marshallbrennan/partners.cfm|title=Teaching Partners - "We the Students" - American University Washington College of Law|website=Wcl.american.edu|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current Program Directors===
The Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project is currently directed by Professor [https://web.archive.org/web/20120719065948/http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/ahranjani/ Maryam Ahranjani].  Professor [http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/wermiel/ Stephen Wermiel] currently serves as the faculty adviser to the program.

===Starting New Chapters===
In order to start a new chapter of the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project, seven requirements must be met:&lt;ref name="Marshall Brennan Chapters" /&gt;
*Partnership between a law school(s) and an underserved local public school system or local public high school(s).
*Academic credit: both law students AND high school students earn academic credit for participating in the Marshall-Brennan Project.
*Unified Curriculum: All Marshall-Brennan fellows use one or both of the textbooks (We the Students and/or Youth Justice in America)
*Shared goals: to improve high school students’ oral advocacy skills, cultivate critical thinking skills, and instill understanding of Constitutional cases and concepts.
*Support and supervision by a faculty and/or staff member at the law school.
*Regular communication with the national office at American University Washington College of Law.
*Representation at the annual Directors’ Meetings and National Marshall-Brennan High School Moot Court Competition as much as possible.

==Curriculum==
The Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project utilizes two different text books for its two sets of curriculum: ''Youth Justice in America'' and ''We the Students''.  Both books utilize case law and constitutional analysis to walk students through complex legal issues in an easy to understand fashion.  ''Youth Justice in America'' focuses on criminal law and criminal procedure as they pertain to students, while ''We the Students'' gives students a broad survey of the United States Constitution.

===Youth Justice in America===
''Youth Justice in America'' combines thoughtful commentary with selections from actual federal and state constitutional criminal law cases to explore issues of juveniles and justice. The book addresses tough, important issues that are part of many high school curricula and directly affect today’s young people, including:

*How should we balance liberty with the need for an ordered society?
*How do we enforce order while maintaining constitutional rights?
*Should we treat juveniles differently from adult offenders?&lt;ref name="Youth Justice Website"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050213013508/http://www.cqpress.com/product/Youth-Justice-in-America.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on cases that relate to the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the subject matter comes alive through a unique blend of content, including:

*Selections from key cases that affect students;
*Easy-to-read definitions of important terms and concepts;
*Sidebar features;
*Engaging photos;
*Individual and class exercises;
*Age-appropriate sources for further reading.&lt;ref name="Youth Justice Website" /&gt;

===We the Students===
Filled with real-life examples and exercises, ''We the Students'' helps students gain a greater understanding of constitutional law in an interesting and thought-provoking way.
Designed for students and teachers in regular and A.P. social studies, history, journalism, constitutional law, and government classes, We the Students is full of interesting examples and exercises to provide students with a greater understanding of constitutional law in a way in which they can relate and enjoy.&lt;ref name="We the Students webpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/We-Students-Supreme-Court-Cases/dp/1568025718|title=We the Students: Supreme Court Cases for and about Students|first=Jamin B.|last=Raskin|date=1 April 2000|publisher=CQ Press|accessdate=18 March 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observance of Constitution Day===
In honor of [[Constitution Day]], the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project prepares lesson plans and educational materials to be used by teachers who wish to educate their students about the importance of the U.S. Constitution and its very real effect on the lives of students.  The prepared materials are distributed through the website [https://web.archive.org/web/20130811023202/http://bandofrights.org/about.cfm Band of Rights].

==National Marshall-Brennan High School Moot Court Competition==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Student at National Moot Court Competition.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A student competes at the National Moot Court Competition.|A student from Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School in Washington, D.C. competes in the 2010 National Moot Court Competition hosted by [[Drexel University]].]] --&gt;

The National Marshall-Brennan Moot Court Competition serves as an opportunity for high school students participating in Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project classes to showcase their oral advocacy skills, network, and learn about careers in the law.

Usually held in the Spring, the National Moot Court Competition presents high school students with a unique legal issue each year, ranging from First Amendment violations to Eighth Amendment prohibitions against placing juveniles in prison for life without parole.  Each student is assigned the role of either Petitioner or Respondent and must argue their case in front of a three judge panel composed of law students, law professors, and practicing attorneys.  After advancing through the preliminary rounds, the final rounds are often heard by actual judges who volunteer their time in order to help students garner an understanding of a real appellate level courtroom.&lt;ref name="National Moot Court Site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/marshallbrennan/nat_competition.cfm|title=National Competitions - Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project - American University Washington College of Law|website=Wcl.american.edu|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable Speakers===
During the National Moot Court Competition in 2012, [[Mary Beth Tinker]] of the famous Supreme Court case [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]] spoke to the competitors about the importance of knowing one's rights and of knowing how the justice system can affect their everyday lives.&lt;ref name="National Moot Court Site" /&gt;

==History==
The university began as '''The Agricultural and Mechanical College of the State of Mississippi''' (or '''Mississippi A&amp;M'''), one of the national [[land-grant university|land-grant colleges]] established after [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Morrill Act]] in 1862. It was created by the [[Mississippi Legislature]] on February 28, 1878, to fulfill the mission of offering training in "agriculture, horticulture and the mechanical arts ... without excluding other scientific and classical studies, including military tactics." The university received its first students in the fall of 1880 in the presidency of [[General officers in the Confederate States Army|General]] [[Stephen D. Lee]].

In 1887 [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]], which provided for the establishment of the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1888. The Cooperative Extension Service was established in 1914 by the [[Smith-Lever Act of 1914|Smith-Lever Act]]. The university has since had its mission expanded and redefined by the Legislature. In 1932, the Legislature renamed the university as '''Mississippi State College'''.

In 1958 the Legislature renamed the university as Mississippi State University in recognition of its academic development and addition of graduate programs. The Graduate School had been organized (1936), doctoral degree programs had begun (1951), the School of Forest Resources had been established (1954), and the College of Arts and Sciences had replaced the General Science School (1956).

The university was uneventfully desegregated in July 1965, when [[Richard E. Holmes]], a graduate of [[Henderson High School (Mississippi)|Henderson High School]] in Starkville, became the first African-American student to enroll. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was passed by Congress the year before, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was being debated, and the United States Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salter|first1=Sid|title=Mississippi State's First Black Student Showed Courage|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/07/15/salter-msus-first-black-student-showed-courage/30183439/?from=global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=|accessdate=28 October 2015|publisher=Jackson Clarion-Ledger|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School of Architecture admitted its first students in 1973, the College of [[Veterinary Medicine]] admitted its first class in 1977. The MSU Vet school (commonly referred to as the CVM) is the largest [[veterinary school]] under one roof in the nation. The School of [[Accountancy]] was established in 1979.

The University Honors Program was founded in 1968 to provide more rigorous course curricula for academically talented students and support guest lecture series, forums, and distinguished external scholarships. The program has been vastly expanded and has a separate college. This was made possible by funding by Bobby Shackouls, an MSU [[alumnus]] and retired CEO, who donated [[United States dollar|US$]]10 million to found the Judy and Bobby Shackouls Honors College in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msstate.edu/web/media/detail.php?id=3417 |title=Headlines &amp;#124; Mississippi State University |website=Msstate.edu |date=2017-01-16 |accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSU also started a joint Ph.D. program in engineering with [[San Jose State University]] in  [[California]], allowing an increase in research for both universities, as well as enhancing the stature of both engineering colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSU/SJSU Engineering Ph.D. Gateway Program|url=https://engineering.sjsu.edu/news-and-events/news/msusjsu-engineering-ph-d-gateway-program|website=Engr.sjsu.edu|publisher=SJSU Engineering|accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Mississippi State announced the conclusion of the university's seven-year capital campaign, with more than $462 million received in private gifts and pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msstate.edu/web/media/detail.php?id=4496|title='State of the Future' campaign ends successful run (Mississippi State University)|publisher=Msstate.edu|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MSU Lee Hall.webm|thumb|Lee Hall on the Mississippi State University]]
[[File:MSU Drill Field.webm|thumb|The Drill Field on the campus at Mississippi State University]]

As of Fall 2011, Mississippi State's enrollment was 20,424.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msstate.edu/web/media/detail.php?id=5337 |title=Headlines &amp;#124; Mississippi State University |website=Msstate.edu |date=2017-01-16 |accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has 160 buildings, and the grounds comprise about 4,200 acres (17&amp;nbsp;km²), including farms, pastures, and woodlands of the Experiment Station. The university also owns an additional 80,000 acres (320&amp;nbsp;km²) across the state.

Mississippi State University operates an off-campus, degree-granting center in [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] that offers undergraduate and graduate programs. In cooperation with the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, the College of Engineering offers the Master of Science degree to students in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].

Mississippi State's campus is centered on the main quadrangle, called the ''Drill Field'' (pictured) due to its heavy use by the Corps of Cadets prior to the end of World War II. The Drill Field is defined at its north and south ends by the mirror-image buildings, ''Lee Hall'' (the original University building, now the division of languages building, far left in picture below) and ''Swalm Hall'' (home to the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering, far right in picture below). [[Old Main (Mississippi State University)|Old Main]] was the original dormitory, west of Lee Hall; it burned in a tragic fire, and was replaced by the Colvard Student Union. The largest building fronting the Drill Field is Mitchell Memorial Library.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

From the Drill Field, the campus radiates in all directions. The College of Engineering can be found mostly to the east side of the Drill Field; to the north are the Arts and Sciences, including Computer Science, and the College of Architecture, Art, and Design (CAAD). Humanities are found to the south, while Agriculture dominates the west section. To the west and northwest are also found the athletic facilities, including [[Davis Wade Stadium|Scott Field]] and the [[Humphrey Coliseum]], or ''The Hump''.

Beyond the main campus (and the series of commuter parking lots ringing the main campus) are the North and South Farms. While still used for their original purpose of agricultural research, the Farms are also host to newer facilities, such as the astronomical observatory and Veterinary College (South Farm) and the High Performance Computing Collaboratory (North Farm). At the far west of campus, one finds first the fraternity and sorority houses, and beyond them [[the Cotton District]] and downtown Starkville, Mississippi. The university is also home to the Thad Cochran Research, Technology and Economic Development Park, which host many of the university's research centers, such as the Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems (CAVS) and the nationally recognized [[Social Science Research Center (MSU)|Social Science Research Center]].

The Williams Building, which houses the MSU Police Department and the Faculty Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://map.msstate.edu/map/accessible.php?id=233&amp;cId=2396&amp;mId=54610|title=Mississippi State University|work=map.msstate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by architect [[Emmett J. Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hull, Emmett J.

===Mitchell Memorial Library===
[[File:Ulysses S. Grant 1870-1880.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mississippi State University is home to the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Collection.]]
The Mitchell Memorial Library is in the heart of the campus, on the eastern side of the Drill Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Library Location|publisher = Mississippi State University|year = 2011|url = http://www.msstate.edu/web/maps/index.php?building=0055|accessdate =2012-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The library has a collection of 2,124,341 volumes and 70,331 journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Library Collection|publisher = Mississippi State University|year = 2011
|url = http://library.msstate.edu/overview/index.asp|accessdate = 2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mississippi State is one of the few universities to house presidential papers. In May 2012, on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[Ulysses S. Grant]] Association, Mississippi State University was selected as the permanent location for Ulysses S. Grant's [[Presidential Library]]. President Grant's artifacts are to remain permanently at the Mitchell Memorial Library on the MSU campus. These include Grant's letters and photographs during his presidency, from 1869 to 1877. The MSU library catalogued and cross-referenced 15,000 linear feet of material. Grant's letters have been edited and published in 32 volumes by the Ulysses S. Grant Association and the Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ulysses S. Grant's Presidential Library|publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011| url = http://library.msstate.edu/overview/index.asp#grant| accessdate =2012-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith (May 18, 2012), "Ulysses S. Grant: How 'bout them Dawgs!," ''The Dispatch''&lt;/ref&gt;

The library is also home to the Congressional and Political Research Center, which is on the first floor. This center, established in November 1999, houses the collections of US Senator [[John C. Stennis]] and Congressman [[G. V. Montgomery]], nicknamed "Sonny". Their careers spanned a total of 72 years of service as Congressional leaders. The Center also provides research materials and information on individual US Senators and Representatives, the US Congress, and politics at all levels of government. It has begun to take on a significant research and policy role on a state, regional and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Congressional and Political Research Center| publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011| url = http://library.msstate.edu/overview/index.asp#cprc| accessdate = 2012-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the library's premier collections is that of internationally known author [[John Grisham]], an MSU alumnus who donated his papers to the university in 1989. Grisham's collection, now consisting of over 42 cubic feet, has also attracted national attention to the library. Materials from the Grisham papers are on display in Mitchell Memorial Library's John Grisham Room (3rd floor), which opened in May 1998. The libraries also receive his published works, including foreign-language translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Grisham Collection| publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011| url = http://library.msstate.edu/overview/index.asp#grisham| accessdate = 2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Charles H. Templeton Collection, which includes over 200 nineteenth- and twentieth-century music instruments, 22,000 pieces of sheet music, and 13,000 records, was transferred to the Libraries. According to world-renowned author and musicologist [[David A. Jasen]], the Templeton Collection contains the most complete collection of [[Victor Talking Machines]] from their debut in 1897 to 1930. This Collection, valued at over $495,000 in 1989, serves as one of the libraries' premier collections. Items from the collection are on display at the Templeton Music Museum on the 4th floor of Mitchell Memorial Library. In 2001, a digitization project was established to digitize and provide access to the entire sheet music collection. To date, the project has digitized, archived and cataloged over 6,000 pieces of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Grisham Collection| publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011
| url = http://library.msstate.edu/overview/index.asp#templeton| accessdate = 2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library hosts the Charles Templeton Ragtime Jazz Festival, an annual event including lectures and live performance of historic and contemporary ragtime. The festival debuted in March 2007, the first of its kind in Mississippi. The multi-day event features seminars, tours of the Templeton Music Museum, and concerts by some of the world's most renowned ragtime and jazz musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ragtime Jazz Festival| publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011| url = http://library.msstate.edu/overview/index.asp#rag| accessdate = 2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Junction===
[[File:MSU The Junction.webm|thumb|The Junction on the campus of Mississippi State University]]
Formally a convergence of five often-congested streets (or points), this student-inspired concept got its name from the term "Malfunction Junction," the informal name many gave the traffic crossroads.
 
Anchored by Davis Wade Stadium, Barnes &amp; Noble Bookstore and the University Welcome Center, the Junction is the focal point of a pedestrian-friendly central campus and a significant gathering place for students, alumni and visitors. It is linked by paved walkways and green space to the university's other manicured "lawn", the historic Drill Field.

Old Main, originally called the Main Dormitory, was the first building on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msstate.edu/web/maps/index.php?building=UR032|title=Campus Map (Mississippi State University)|date=13 February 2007|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213042200/http://www.msstate.edu/web/maps/index.php?building=UR032|archivedate=13 February 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first section of Old Main was built in 1880. Additions were constructed in 1901, 1903, 1906, and 1922. It is considered to have been the largest college [[dormitory]] in the [[United States]]. The building was destroyed by fire on the night of January 22, 1959. Henry Williamson, one of the dorm's 1,100 residents, died in the fire. Bricks salvaged from the fire were used to build the Chapel of Memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msstate.edu/web/maps/index.php?building=0099|title=Campus Map (Mississippi State University)|date=11 December 2006|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211033425/http://www.msstate.edu/web/maps/index.php?building=0099|archivedate=11 December 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bricks from Old Main were also dumped in the area that became the band practice field for many years behind the Industrial Educational Building.

[[Roy Vernon Scott]], [[professor emeritus]] of history at MSU, is the author of ''Old Main: Memories of a Legend''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/3943947|title=''Old Main: Memories of a Legend''|publisher=library.thing.com|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the university began construction of a new academic building located at the corner of George Perry Street and Barr Avenue, behind the YMCA building. This building includes architectural elements that are similar in style to the Old Main Dormitory previously located on the west side of the Drill Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alumnus.msstate.edu/fall15/classroombuilding.html|title=''New Building Echoes Spirit of Old Main: Creates Future Teaching, Learning Blueprint ''|publisher=Mississippi State University Alumnus Magazine|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be named the "Old Main" Academic Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://map.msstate.edu/map/?id=233#!ct/6665,7602,2396,2398,2399,2401,2400,7257,2397,7090,7088,2402,5465,8935?m/73896|title=''MSU Campus Map - Old Main Academic Center ''|publisher=Mississippi State University|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student organizations==
MSU has over 300 student organizations. Prominent groups include the Student Association, Famous Maroon Band, MSU Road Runners, Alumni Delegates, Maroon VIP,  [[Lambda Sigma]], Orientation Leaders, 18 fraternities and 11 sororities, the Residence Hall Association, the Black Student Alliance, the Mississippi State University College Democrats and Republicans, Music Maker Productions, the Baptist Student Union, the Engineering Student Council, [[Arnold Air Society]], the Stennis-Montgomery Association and ChallengeX.

===Student media===
Mississippi State's local radio station is [[WMSV]].

Prior to WMSV, Mississippi State had a student-run radio station, WMSB, which went off the air permanently at the end of the spring semester of 1986. WMSB was a low-power FM station with studios on the top floor of Lee Hall. WMSB was begun in the fall semester of 1971 in a freshman dorm room on the third floor of Critz Hall, utilizing an FM stereo transmitter that was designed and built as a high school science fair project by one of the station's founders. The station's original call letters were RHOM. Later, funding was solicited from the Student Association. Funding was approved, the low-power RCA FM transmitter was ordered and the call letters WMSB were issued by the FCC. The station was moved to studios on the top floor of Lee Hall that were formerly occupied by a student-run AM station.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The student newspaper is the ''[[Reflector (newspaper)|Reflector]]'', published twice per week on Tuesday and Friday. The publication was named the #1 college newspaper in the South in 2007 by the Southeast Journalism Conference. In previous years, the ''Reflector'' consistently ranked in the top 10 among college newspapers in the southern United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Music scene===
Mississippi State is home to WMSV, the campus radio station, which routinely plays older alternative mainstream rock and pop from the 1990s. Much of the music on the radio station comes from syndicated radio programs from Public Radio International, but the station's homegrown music programs on Sunday afternoons and evenings emphasize jazz and blues classics.

Mississippi State and the city of Starkville play host the annual "Bulldog Bash", considered the largest outdoor concert in the state. The event is free and held in the Starkville Cotton District.

During the spring semester the Old Main Music Festival takes place, it is also free to the public, and is held on the Mississippi State Campus it has featured artist such as Trey Songz, Sugarland and OneRepublic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Old Main| publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011| url = http://www.sa.msstate.edu/event/main/| accessdate =2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Starkville and the Mississippi State campus have been a tour stop for many artists such as 2 chainz, Bon Jovi, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Artists| publisher = Mississippi State University| year = 2011| url = http://www.mmp.org.msstate.edu/aboutus.html| accessdate = 2011-01-14| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120603230458/http://www.mmp.org.msstate.edu/aboutus.html| archivedate = 2012-06-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most famously Johnny Cash in 1965.

==Athletics==
{{main|Mississippi State Bulldogs}}

[[File:Davis Wade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Davis Wade Stadium]] at its record-setting capacity of 58,103 against Alabama]]

Mississippi State University's sixteen athletic teams are known as the Bulldogs, which was adopted in 1961. Previous nicknames included the Aggies and the Maroons. Since 1935, the official mascot for Mississippi State has been a live English Bulldog named [[Bully (mascot)|Bully]]. They compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and the western division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). The Bulldogs have garnered a total of 28 conference championships (14 SEC). Mississippi State's most successful sport is [[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|baseball]]. The Diamond Dogs have won 17 conference championships (11 SEC) and 6 SEC tournament championships, while making 28 NCAA Tournament, and 9 College World Series appearances, including a 2nd-place finish in 2013. The Diamond Dogs play home games at [[Dudy Noble Field, Polk-DeMent Stadium]], which holds the NCAA record for the largest single on-campus baseball attendance at 15,586 (April 12, 2014, vs. Mississippi).

Mississippi State [[Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball|men's basketball]] has won 10 conference regular season championships (6 SEC), 4 conference tournament championships, and 7 divisional championships. The Bulldogs have made 10 NCAA Tournament appearances, highlighted by 3 Sweet Sixteen appearances and a trip to the Final Four in 1996. Both MSU men's and women's basketball teams play home games at [[Humphrey Coliseum]], nicknamed "The Hump", one of the most intimidating places to play in the SEC with a seating capacity of 10,500.

Bulldog [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|football]] is also a favorite among the MSU faithful. The Bulldogs play their home games at [[Davis Wade Stadium]], the second oldest Division I-FBS football stadium in the nation, with a seating capacity of 61,337. Bulldog fans are known throughout the nation for bringing cowbells to "ring" Mississippi State on to victory. Cowbells became part of Mississippi State tradition in the 1970s, and were banned by the SEC in 1977, defined as "artificial noisemakers". For over 30 years, fans would secretly sneak their cowbells into the stadium, while security guards carefully "inspected" fans' possessions, continuing the unique tradition. In 2010, the SEC officially lifted the ban on artificial noisemakers, allowing fans to "ring responsibly" during pregame, timeouts, halftime, and Bulldog touchdowns. Mississippi State's first SEC championship came in 1941, as the Bulldogs finished with an 8-1-1 record. The Bulldogs also appeared in the [[1998 SEC Championship Game]] after winning the SEC Western Division championship, before falling to eventual national champion Tennessee 14-24. Overall, MSU has appeared in 17 postseason bowl games, highlighted by trips to the Orange Bowl in 1937, 1941, and 2015. The official fight song and battle cry of Mississippi State is "[[Hail State]]", which is played by the [[Famous Maroon Band]], the university's marching band.

'''Mountain Day''' refers to three different and unrelated events:
(1) Mountain Day, a student celebration in some colleges in the United States in which classes are cancelled without prior notice, and the student body heads to the mountains or a park,
(2) International Mountain Day, held each year on 11 December, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 2003 to encourage [[sustainable development]] in mountains, and 
(3) Mountain Day, a national holiday in Japan as of 2016.

==Mountain Day in the United States==

Mountain Day dates back to at least 1838, when the students of [[Mount Holyoke College#Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke College]] headed off to [[Mount Holyoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/961004/mtday.html| title=Heading for the Hills on Mountain Day: It's Been a Mount Holyoke Tradition Since 1838| publisher=mtholyoke.edu| date=| accessdate=2006-09-01| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304210709/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/961004/mtday.html| archivedate=2006-03-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smith College]] declared its Mountain Day in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2009/10/08/News/Mountain.Day.Builds.On.A.History.Of.Changing.Customs-3795836.shtml Mountain Day Builds on a History of Changing Customs]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juniata College]] established its Mountain Day in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mountain Day|url = http://legacy.juniata.edu/life/traditions/mountainday.html|website = [[Juniata College]] - Campus Life - Campus Traditions|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Williams College]] students have been climbing [[Mount Greylock]], the highest mountain in Massachusetts, to celebrate Mountain Day since the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/mountain-day.php "Williams College Mountain Day"] [[Williams College]]. Retrieved March 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Colby-Sawyer College]]'s Mountain Day is stated to have started in the 1850s, although the first account of it in the student newspaper is not listed until June 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://haystack.colby-sawyer.edu/items/show/10239| title=Colby Academy Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Mountain Day==
December 11, "International Mountain Day", was designated by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2003. The General Assembly "encouraged the international community to organize events at all levels on that day to highlight the importance of sustainable mountain development."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/mountainday/ International Mountain Day, 11 December]&lt;/ref&gt;

International Mountain Day is "observed every year with a different theme relevant to sustainable mountain development. [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] is the U.N. organization mandated to lead observance of International Mountain Day.

The theme for International Mountain Day 2010 was "Mountain minorities and [[indigenous peoples]]." It aims to [[consciousness raising|raise awareness]] about indigenous peoples and [[minority group|minorities]] who live in mountain environments and the relevance of their [[cultural heritage]], traditions and customs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/mnts/intl_mountain_day_en.asp International Mountain Day 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain Day in Japan ==
In May 2014, it was announced that Mountain Day will be celebrated as a public holiday every August 11, beginning in 2016. Supporters of the holiday included legislator [[Seishiro Etō|Seishiro Eto]] and the Japanese Alpine Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''NanoPutians''' are a series of organic molecules whose [[structural formula]]e resemble human forms.&lt;ref name="nanoputian"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chanteau | first1 = S.

([[Rice University]]) designed and synthesized these compounds in 2003 as a part of a sequence on [[chemical education]] for young students.&lt;ref name="nanoputian2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chanteau | first1 = S.

Tour and his team at Rice University used the NanoPutians in their NanoKids educational outreach program. The goal of this program was to educate children in the sciences in an effective and enjoyable manner. They have made several videos featuring the NanoPutians as anthropomorphic animated characters.

Construction of the structures depends on [[Sonogashira coupling]] and other synthetic techniques. By replacing the 1,3-dioxolane group with an appropriate ring structure, various other types of putians have been synthesized, e.g. NanoAthlete, NanoPilgrim, and NanoGreenBeret. Placing [[thiol]] (R-SH) functional groups at the end of the legs enables them to "stand" on a [[gold]] surface.

"NanoPutian" is a [[portmanteau]] of [[nanometer]], a unit of length commonly used to measure chemical compounds, and [[lilliputian]], a fictional race of humans in the novel [[Gulliver's Travels]] by [[Jonathan Swift]].

==Background==

===NanoKids Educational Outreach Program===
While there are no chemical or practical uses for the NanoKid molecule or any of its known derivatives outside of the classroom, [[James Tour]] has turned the NanoKid into a lifelike character to educate children in the sciences. The goals of the outreach program, as described on the NanoKids website, are:
*“To significantly increase students’ comprehension of chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science at the molecular level."
*"To provide teachers with conceptual tools to teach nanoscale science and emerging molecular technology."
*"To demonstrate that art and science can combine to facilitate learning for students with diverse learning styles and interests."
*"To generate informed interest in nanotechnology that encourages participation in and funding for research in the field.”&lt;ref&gt;“Welcome to Nanokids.” Accessed May 6, 2013. http://cohesion.rice.edu/naturalsciences/nanokids/.&lt;/ref&gt;
To accomplish these goals, several video clips, CDs, as well as interactive computer programs were created. Tour and his team invested over $250,000 into their project. In order to raise the funds for this endeavor, Tour used unrestricted funds from his professorship and small grants from Rice University, the [[Welch Foundation]], the nanotech firm [[Zyvex]], and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. Tour also received $100,000 in 2002 from the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program, a division of the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;“C&amp;EN: EDUCATION – ‘NANOKIDS’ TRY TO GET INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL.” Accessed May 10, 2013. http://pubs.acs.org/cen/education/8214/8214nanokids.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characters in the videos are animated versions of the NanoKid. They star in several videos and explain various scientific concepts, such as the [[periodic table]], [[DNA]], and [[covalent bonding]].

Rice conducted several studies into the effectiveness of using the NanoKids materials. These studies found mostly positive results for the use of the NanoKids in the classroom. A 2004–2005 study in two schools districts in Ohio and Kentucky found that using NanoKids led to a 10–59% increase in understanding of the material presented. Additionally, it was found that 82% of students found that NanoKids made learning science more interesting.&lt;ref&gt;“NanoKids - Mission.” Accessed May 6, 2013. http://cohesion.rice.edu/naturalsciences/nanokids/mission.cfm?doc_id=3039.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis of NanoKid==

===Upper body of NanoKid===
To create the first NanoPutian, dubbed the NanoKid, [[1,4-dibromobenzene]] was [[iodinated]] in [[sulfuric acid]]. To this product, “arms”, or 3,3-Dimethylbutyne, were then added through [[Sonogashira coupling]]. Formylation of this structure was then achieved through using the [[organolithium reagent]] [[n-butyllithium]] followed by quenching with [[N,N-dimethylformamide]] (DMF) to create the aldehyde. 1,2-Ethanediol was added to this structure to protect the aldehyde using [[p-toluenesulfonic acid]] as a [[catalyst]]. Originally, Chanteau and Tour aimed to couple this structure with alkynes, but this resulted in very low yields of the desired products. To remedy this, the [[bromide]] was replaced with [[iodide]] through lithium-halogen exchange and quenching by using [[1,2-Diiodoethane|1,2-diiodoethane]]. This created the final structure of the upper body for the NanoKid.&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt;
:[[File:Synthesis of a NanoPutians Upper Body FIXED -2.png|750px|Center]]

===Lower body of NanoKid===
The synthesis of NanoPutian’s lower body begins with [[nitroaniline]] as a starting material. Addition of Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in [[acetic acid]] places two equivalents of [[bromine]] on the [[benzene]] ring. NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[electron donating group]], and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[electron withdrawing group]], which both direct bromination to the meta position relative to the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substituent. Addition of [[sodium nitrite|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[ethanol|EtOH]] removes the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substituent. The [[Lewis acid]] SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[reducing agent]] in THF/EtOH solvent, replaces NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is subsequently replaced by iodine upon the addition of NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and KI to yield 3,5-dibromoiodobenzene. In this step, the [[Sandmeyer reaction]] converts the primary amino group (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to a diazonium leaving group (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is subsequently replaced by iodine. Iodine serves as an excellent coupling partner for the attachment of the stomach, which is executed through Sonogashira coupling with [[trimethylsilylacetylene]] to yield 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene. Attachment of the legs replaces the Br substituents with 1-pentyne through another Sonogashira coupling to produce 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl) benzene. To complete the synthesis of the lower body, the TMS protecting group is removed by selective deprotection through the addition of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, MeOH, and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene.&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt;
:[[File:NanoPutians Lower Body ACS 2(FIXED).png|800px|Center]]

===Attachment===
To attach the upper body of the NanoKid to the lower body, the two components were added to a solution of [[bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride]], [[copper(I) iodide]], [[Triethylamine|TEA]], and [[THF]]. This resulted in the final structure of the NanoKid.&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt; 
:[[File:Chemdraw Attachment upper body lower body.png|900px|Center]]

==Derivatives of NanoKid==

===Synthesis of NanoProfessionals===
NanoProfessionals have alternate molecular structures for the top of the head, and possibly include a hat. Most can be synthesized from the NanoKid by an [[acetal exchange]] reaction with the desired 1,2- or 1,3- diol, using [[p-toluenesulfonic acid|''p''-toluenesulfonic acid]] as catalyst and heated by [[microwave irradiation]] for a few minutes. The ultimate set of products was a recognizably diverse population of NanoPutians: NanoAthlete, NanoPilgrim, NanoGreenBeret, NanoJester, NanoMonarch, NanoTexan, NanoScholar, NanoBaker, and NanoChef.&lt;ref name="nanoputian2" /&gt;

:[[Image:Chemdraw Nanokid.png|850px|Center]]

The majority of the figures are easily recognizable in their most stable [[conformational isomerism|conformation]]. A few have as their stable conformation a less recognizable shape, so these are often drawn in the more recognizable but less stable way. Many liberties were taken in the visual depiction of the head dressings of the NanoPutians.&lt;ref name="nanoputian2" /&gt; Some products are formed as a mixture of [[diastereomers]]—the configuration of the "neck" compared to parts of the "hat".&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt;

:[[Image:Nanoprofessional table2.png|800px|Right]]

===Synthesis of the NanoKid in upright form===
[[File:NanoPutian Standing.png|thumb|Stick Figure NanoPutian in its Energy Minimized Conformation. Determined Using Spartan.]]
3-Butyn-1-ol was reacted with [[methanesulfonyl chloride]] and [[triethanolamine]] to produce its [[mesylate]]. The mesylate was displaced to make thiolacetate. The thiol was coupled with 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene to create a free alkyne. The resulting product, 3,5-(4’-thiolacetyl-1’-butynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl)-benzene, had its trimethylsilyl group removed using [[tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride]] (TBAF) and AcOH/Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in THF. The free alkyne was then coupled with the upper body product from the earlier synthesis. This resulted in a NanoKid with protected thiol feet.&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt;

To make the NanoKid “stand’, the acetyl protecting groups were removed through the use of [[ammonium hydroxide]] in THF to create the free thiols. A gold-plated substrate was then dipped into the solution and incubated for four days. [[Ellipsometry]] was used to determine the resulting thickness of the compound, and it was determined that the NanoKid was upright on the substrate.&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt;

:[[File:Synthesis of the NanoKid with Thiol Feet, in Protected Form (FIXED) 2.png|700px|Center]]

===Synthesis of NanoPutian chain===
{{confusing|section|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- what is the difference between the two dimer products? The third product appears to be a single molecule; what is "n" about it (or is it actually a polymer--diagram mistake)? --&gt;
Synthesis of the upper part of the NanoPutian chain begins with 1,3-dibromo-2,4-diiodobenzene as the starting material. Sonogashira coupling with 4-oxytrimethylsilylbut-1-yne produces 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-1,4-di-bromobenzene. One of the bromine substituents is converted to an aldehyde through an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction with the strong base, n-BuLi, and THF in the aprotic polar solvent, DMF to produce 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-4-bromobenzaldehyde. Another Sonogashira coupling with 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene attaches the lower body of the NanoPutian. The conversion of the aldehyde group to a diether “head” occurs in two steps. The first step involves addition of ethylene glycol and [[trimethylsilyl chloride]] (TMSCl) in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solvent. Addition of TBAF in THF solvent removes the silyl protecting group.&lt;ref name="nanoputian" /&gt;

The '''Nelson–Denny Reading Test''' was created in 1929 by M.S. Nelson and E.C. Denny, both of whom were on the faculty of [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]] Teacher's College. The purpose of the test is to measure [[reading (process)|reading]] ability among high school and college students. It is not appropriate for the clinical evaluation of reading disorders, however it may be used to identify students in need of [[remedial instruction|remedial reading instruction]]. The Nelson–Denny includes two subtests ([[Vocabulary]] and [[Reading comprehension|Comprehension]]) both with [[multiple choice question]]s, and yields four scores.  The most recent revision was published in 1993 and is available from [[Riverside Publishing]] in [[Itasca, Illinois]].

The Nelson–Denny can be administered in a group format. Total administration time is about 45 minutes which includes time spent instructing examinees.

The Nelson–Denny includes two subtests and yields four scores. The first subtest, Vocabulary, consists of 80 multiple-choice items, each with five response options. The words were drawn from high school and college textbooks and vary in difficulty. The second subtest, Comprehension, requires examinees to read five short passages (also drawn from high school and college textbooks) and to respond to 38 multiple-choice questions about the contents of these passages. Approximately half of these items relate to specific factual content, while the other half are more [[inference|inferential]] in nature. A total reading score is derived by summing the Vocabulary score with the Comprehension score. (The latter score is doubled so as to compensate for the larger number of items on the first subtest.) Part way through the first passage in the Comprehension subtest, [[reading rate]] is also assessed.

The primary uses of the Nelson–Denny are as a screening test for [[Reading disability|reading problems]], as a predictor of academic success, and as a measure of progress resulting from educational interventions. These functions overlap to some degree. The last-mentioned use is facilitated by the existence of two parallel forms of the Nelson–Denny (Form G and Form H). It is not appropriate for the clinical evaluation of reading disorders, however it may be used to identify students in need of [[remedial instruction|remedial reading instruction]].

The test has been revised and updated several times under the direction of James I. Brown of the [[University of Minnesota]]. The most recent revision was published in 1993. It is available from [[Riverside Publishing]] in [[Itasca, Illinois]].

(p. 126)|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''obscurantism'' derives from the title of the 16th-century satire ''[[Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (1515–19, ''Letters of Obscure Men''), that was based upon the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispute between the German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] and the monk [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]] of the [[Dominican Order]], about whether or not all [[Judaism|Jewish]] books should be [[Book burning|burned]] as un-Christian heresy. Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the [[Talmud]] ([[Jewish law]] and [[Jewish ethics]]) known to be in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (AD 926–1806); the ''Letters of Obscure Men'' satirized the Dominican arguments for burning "un-Christian" works.

In the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers applied the term ''obscurantist'' to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] from the "more subtle" obscurantism of the [[critical philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and of modern [[philosophical skepticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] said: "The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, F. (1878) ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' Vol. II, Part 1, 27. Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (November 13, 1996). {{ISBN|978-0-521-56704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In restricting knowledge to an [[Elite|élite]] ruling class of "the few", obscurantism is fundamentally [[anti-democratic]], because its component [[anti-intellectualism]] and [[elitism]] exclude the people as [[intellect]]ually unworthy of knowing the facts and truth about the [[government]] of their [[City-State]].&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M.

In 18th century monarchic France, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as a [[political science|political scientist]], documented the [[aristocracy]]'s obscurantism about the social problems that provoked the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that deposed them and their [[List of French monarchs|King]], [[Louis XVI of France]].

In the 19th century, the [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[William Kingdon Clifford]], an early proponent of [[Darwinism]], devoted some writings to uprooting obscurantism in England, after hearing clerics—who privately agreed with him about evolution—publicly denounce [[evolution]] as un-[[Christianity|Christian]]. Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of thought independent of theologic allegiance. The distinction is that fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief, whereas obscurantism is based upon minority manipulation of the popular faith as political praxis; cf. [[Censorship]].&lt;ref name = Obs&gt;Syed, I. (2002) [http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_51_100/obscurantism.htm "Obscurantism"]. From: ''Intellectual Achievements of Muslims''.

=== Leo Strauss ===

==== Political philosophy ====
In the 20th century, the American conservative [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Leo Strauss]], for whom philosophy and politics intertwined, and his [[Neoconservatism|Neo-conservative]] adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that [[intellectuals]], dating from [[Plato]], confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace "interfering" with government, or if it were possible for [[Value (ethics)|good]] politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the [[Noble Lie]] necessary in securing public acquiescence. In ''The City and Man'' (1964), he discusses the myths in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the State belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the [[accident of birth]] in the City-State. Thus, in the ''New Yorker'' magazine article ''Selective Intelligence'', [[Seymour Hersh]] observes that Strauss endorsed the "[[Noble Lie]]" concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml|date=2008-07-25}}, ''[[Reason Online]]'' July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shadia Drury]] criticized Strauss's acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as "the peculiar justice of the wise", whereas Plato proposed the Noble Lie as based upon [[Morality|moral]] good. In criticizing ''Natural Right and History'' (1953), she said that "Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-iraqwarphiloshophy/article_1542.jsp|title=Noble lies and perpetual war: Leo Strauss, the neocons, and Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Esoteric texts ====
Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of "esoteric" meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the "ordinary" intellect. In ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'' (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of [[Maimonides]], [[Al Farabi]], and [[Plato]], proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher's esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phædrus]]'', Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing's political dangers is students' too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of [[Socrates]], wherein the relationship with [[Alcibiades]] was used to prosecute him.

For Leo Strauss, philosophers' texts offered the reader lucid "exoteric" (salutary) and obscure "esoteric" (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader's more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the "[[exoteric]]&amp;nbsp;– [[esoteric]]" dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically. 

=== Bill Joy ===
[[File:Bill joy.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Bill Joy]]]]
In the ''Wired'' magazine article, "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]" (April 2000), the computer scientist [[Bill Joy]], then a [[Sun Microsystems]] chief scientist, in the sub-title proposed that: "Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech[nology]—are threatening to make humans an endangered species"; in the body, he posits that:

:"The experiences of the atomic scientists clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). "The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering", ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. {{ISBN|0-309-09271-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy's proposal for limiting the dissemination of "certain" knowledge, in behalf of preserving society, was quickly likened to obscurantism. A year later, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in the ''Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001'', published the article "A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists", wherein the computer scientists [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid countered his proposal as technological tunnel vision, and the predicted technologically derived problems as infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non-scientists upon such societal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-31 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and- Gloom Technofuturists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to emotion ==
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;The economist [[Friedrich August von Hayek]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the essay "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (1960), the economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]] said that political [[conservatism]] is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person’s inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term ''obscurantism'' differently, to denote and describe the [[denial]] of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable [[Morality|moral]] consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.

== Deliberate obscurity ==
The second sense of ''obscurantism'' denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a [[polemics|polemical]] term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her [[intellectualism|intellectual]] vacuousness. Philosophers who are neither [[empiricism|empiricists]] nor [[positivism|positivists]] often are considered obscurantists when describing the abstract concepts of their disciplines. For philosophic reasons, such authors might modify or reject verifiability, falsifiability, and logical non-contradiction. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful and philosophically considered.&lt;ref name=Rorty&gt;Rorty, Richard (1989) ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 6: "From Ironist Theory to Private Allusions: Derrida". {{ISBN|0-521-36781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristotle]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Aristotle ===
In contemporary discussions of [[virtue ethics]], [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (''The Ethics'') stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the [[education]] of a cultured governing [[elite]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;Lisa van Alstyne, "Aristotle's Alleged Ethical Obscurantism." ''Philosophy,'' Vol. 73, No. 285 (July, 1998), pp. 429–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Cogitata I," §&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially [[Karl Marx]], have been accused of obscurantism. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] and [[Logical positivism|positivistic]] philosophers, such as [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and the [[Critical Rationalism|critical-rationalist]] [[Karl Popper]], accused Hegel and [[Hegelianism]] of being obscure. About Hegel's philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is: "...&amp;nbsp;a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur (1965). ''On the Basis of Morality'', trans. E.F.J. Payne. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes "Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel: A Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel was aware of his obscurantism, and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay "Who Thinks Abstractly?", he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as [[:wikt:given|givens]] that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian [[concept]]s, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman.

=== Marx ===
[[File:Marx4.jpg|thumb|120px|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Karl Marx]] in 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]

In his early works,&lt;ref&gt;See his ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1844), ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845), and ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially [[German Idealism]], for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism.&lt;ref&gt;See, Dallmayr, Fred R., "The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (and Habermas)", ''PRAXIS International'' (4/1988), pp. 377–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher [[György Lukács]] and social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], followed with similar arguments of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]]'s ''The Destruction of Reason''; [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy as obscurantist (however, see [[#Appeal to emotion|above]] for Hayek's particular interpretation of the term).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. O., Levine, A., &amp; Sober, E. (1992). ''Reconstructing Marxism: essays on explanation and the theory of history''. London: Verso, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]], and those influenced by him, such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Frankfurt School of critical theory]]. Of Heidegger, [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote, "his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|pages = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is Russell's complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801485649|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derrida ===
In their obituaries, "Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74" (10 October 2004) and "Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual" (21 October 2004), ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies in Paris at 74|date=10 October 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320|title=Jacques Derrida|date=21 October 2004|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989), [[Richard Rorty]] proposed that in ''The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond'' (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. [[Différance]]), and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Rorty /&gt;

Derrida's philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the [[University of Cambridge]] awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[René Thom]], and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, arguing that "his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith et al., "Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University," ''The Times'' [London], 9 May 1992. [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/varia/Derrida_Letter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''New York Review of Books'' article "An Exchange on Deconstruction" (February 1984), [[John Searle]] comments on [[Deconstruction]]: "... anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mackey| first = Louis H.| title = An Exchange on Deconstruction (Reply by John R. Searle)| journal = New York Review of Books| volume = 31| issue = 1| date = February 2, 1984| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5964| accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacan ===
[[Jacques Lacan]] was an [[intellectual]] who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students' complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: "The less you understand, the better you listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Xw4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22The+less+you+understand,+the+better+you+listen%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20less%20you%20understand%2C%20the%20better%20you%20listen%22&amp;f=false | title = The ego in Freud's theory and in the technique of psychoanalysis, 1954–1955 | isbn = 978-0-521-31801-3 | author1 = Lacan | first1 = Jacques | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1973 seminar ''Encore'', he said that his ''Écrits'' (''Writings'') were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences.

=== Sokal Affair ===

The [[Sokal Affair]] (1996) was a publishing [[hoax]] that the professor of physics [[Alan Sokal]] perpetrated on the editors and readers of ''[[Social Text]]'', an [[academic journal]] of [[postmodernism|post-modern]] [[cultural studies]] that was not then a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing [[publishing|editorial]] integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn if ''Social Text'' would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name = Physicist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html| title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies| accessdate= April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| work = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| date =May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal's fake article was published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of ''Social Text'', which was dedicated to the [[Science Wars]] about the conceptual validity of [[scientific objectivity]] and the nature of scientific theory, among [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and postmodern critics in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate= 3 April 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| date = Spring–Summer 1996 |origyear=1994 (original version published 1994-11-28, revised 1995-05-13)| work = [[Social Text]]|issue= 46/47| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070326153354/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal's ''raison de guerre'' ("war reason") for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the [[scientific method]] and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to "[[Appeal to Authority|Academic Authority]]" (the Author-Professor) prompted the editors of ''Social Text'' not to fact-check Sokal's manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist.

Later, concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in ''Social Text'' magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' journal, in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", in which he (Sokal) announced that his transformative hermeneutics article was a [[parody]], submitted "to test the prevailing intellectual standards", and concluded that, as an academic publication, ''Social Text'' ignored the requisite [[intellectual rigor]] of verification and "felt comfortable publishing an article on [[quantum physics]] without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject".&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinguaFranca"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sokal| first = Alan | title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies | pages = 2| newspaper = Lingua Franca| date = May–June 1996| url = http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/01-07-17sokal-lingua-franca-experiment.pdf| accessdate =27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, as a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Sokal said his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the [[social sciences]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, my concern over the spread of [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, independent of the hoax, as a pseudoscientific [[Masterpiece|opus]], the article "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" is described as an exemplar "[[pastiche]] of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Cant (language)|cant]], fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense, centered on the claim that physical reality is merely a social construct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harrell| first = Evans| title = A Report from the Front of the "Science Wars": The controversy over the book ''Higher Superstition,'' by Gross and Levitt and the recent articles by Sokal| journal = Notices of the American Mathematical Society| volume = 43| issue = 10| pages = 1132–1136| date =October 1996| url = http://www.ams.org/notices/199610/comm-harrell.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2016}}
{{Merge to|Optical mark recognition|date=April 2018}}{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}
An '''optical answer sheet''' or '''bubble sheet''' is a special type of [[form (document)|form]] used in [[multiple choice question]] [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s. [[Optical mark recognition]] is used to detect answers. The most well known company in the United States involved with optical answer sheets is the [[Scantron Corporation]], although certain uses require their own customized system. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Optical answer sheets usually have a set of blank ovals or boxes that correspond to each question, often on separate sheets of paper. [[Bar code]]s may mark the sheet for automatic processing, and each series of ovals filled will return a certain value when read. In this way students' answers can be digitally recorded, or identity given.

==Reading==

The first optical answer sheets were read by shining a light through the sheet and measuring how much of the light was blocked using [[phototubes]] on the opposite side.&lt;ref name=HowEverythingWorks.org&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloomfield|first=Louis A|title=Question 1529: Why do scantron-type tests only read #2 pencils? Can other pencils work?|url=http://howeverythingworks.org/wordpress/2006/05/29/question-1529|publisher=HowEverythingWorks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some phototubes are mostly sensitive to the blue end of the [[visible spectrum]],&lt;ref&gt;Mullard Technical Handbook Volume 4 Section 4:Photoemissive Cells (1960 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; blue pens could not be used, as blue inks reflect and [[Transmittance|transmit]] blue light. Because of this, [[number two pencils]] had to be used to fill in the bubbles—[[graphite]] is a very [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] substance which absorbs or reflects most of the light which hits it.&lt;ref name=HowEverythingWorks.org /&gt;

Modern optical answer sheets are read based on reflected light, measuring lightness and darkness. They do not need to be filled in with a number two pencil, though these are recommended over other types due to the lighter marks made by higher-number pencils, and the smudges from number 1 pencils. Black ink will be read, though many systems will ignore marks that are the same color the form is printed in.&lt;ref name=HowEverythingWorks.org /&gt; This also allows optical answer sheets to be double-sided, because marks made on the opposite side will not interfere with reflectance readings as much as with opacity readings.

Most systems accommodate for [[human error]] in filling in ovals imprecisely, as long as they do not stray into the other ovals and the oval is almost completely filled

==Errors==

It is possible for optical answer sheets to be printed incorrectly, such that all ovals will be read as filled.  This occurs if the outline of the ovals is too thick, or is irregular.  During the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], this occurred with over 19,000 [[absentee ballot]]s in the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] county of [[Gwinnett County|Gwinnett]], and was discovered after around 10,000 had already been returned.  The slight difference was not apparent to the [[naked eye]], and was not detected until a test run was made in late October.  This required all [[ballot]]s to be transferred to correctly printed ones, by [[:wikt:sequester|sequestered]] workers of the [[board of elections]], under close [[observation]] by members of the [[Democrat (US)|Democrat]]ic and [[Republican (US)|Republican]] (but not [[third party (politics)|other]]) political parties, and county [[sheriff]] [[Deputy sheriff|deputies]].  The transfer, by law, could not occur until [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] (November 4).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==History==
Primrose Schools was founded as Primrose Country Day School in 1982 in [[Marietta, Georgia]] by Paul and Marcy Erwin.&lt;ref name=30years/&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/history|title=Our History|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Jo Kirchner, the company's current president and CEO, was hired as a consultant to help shift the then half-day preschool to a full-day model, as well as to assist in the launch of the Primrose franchising concept.&lt;ref name=30years&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/press-releases/primrose-schools%C2%AE-celebrates-30-years-excellence-education/2012-09-04-0000-0|title=Primrose Schools Celebrates 30 Years of Excellence in Education|publisher=Primrose Schools|date=2012-09-04|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kirchner&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbnonline.com/2012/03/how-jo-kirchner-uses-feedback-to-adapt-and-innovate-at-primrose-schools/?full=1|first=Jessica|last=Hanna|title=How Jo Kirchner uses feedback to adapt and innovate at Primrose Schools|work=Smart Business|date=2012-03-02|accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth Primrose school opened that year, and it was the first to be franchised.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Kirchner officially joined Primrose as its vice president in 1990 and continued to assist the Erwins in the rollout of the Primrose franchising concept in Georgia and the development of the corporation's school assessment model.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 1996, Primrose became the first childcare and early childhood education company to receive accreditation from the [[Commission on International and Trans-Regional Accreditation]] (CITA), the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI), and the [[North Central Association]] Council on Accreditation and
School Improvement (NCA CASI).&lt;ref name=presskit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/sites/default/files/Primrose-Schools-Press-Kit_10-06-14.pdf|title=Primrose Schools® Press Kit|publisher=Primrose Schools|page=4|accessdate=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Erwins retired in 1999 and sold Primrose Schools to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]-based [[Security Capital Corporation]], after which Kirchner was named president and CEO of Primrose.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; In 2001, Primrose launched its Balanced Learning curriculum, which used child development research to improve its existing proprietary curriculum.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

American Capital Strategies acquired Primrose from Security Capital in 2006 for approximately $63 million.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; Kirchner continued her role as president and CEO, and over the next two years, Primrose signed its 250th franchise agreement and expanded and improved its curriculum programs, particularly in the areas of language and technology.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; Primrose's Education Advisory Board was established in 2008 and is made up of early childhood education and childhood development experts who assist in improving and enhancing Primrose's curriculum and methodologies.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

Primrose continued to expand and innovate, doubling its system revenues from 2004 to 2009, and opening its first urban school in 2010.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;  The Primrose School of Education was also established in 2010 and provides professional support and educational resources for Primrose franchise owners and school leadership teams.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; [[AdvancED]] selected Primrose to help develop and test its new Standards for Quality Early Learning Schools in 2012, and Primrose became the first to be awarded AdvancED's Corporation Systems Accreditation under the new standards.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

==Curriculum==
Primrose offers full early childhood education and care for children ages 6&amp;nbsp;weeks to 6&amp;nbsp;years and after-school programs for children up to age 12.&lt;ref name=Omaha&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20120718/MONEY/707189962/1697|first=Leia|last=Mendoza|title=Primrose Schools to expand in Omaha|newspaper=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|date=2012-07-18|accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primrose schools employ the company's proprietary Balanced Learning curriculum, which combines traditional, teacher-guided learning with more child-initiated play.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt; The curriculum also incorporates current research on child development and emphasizes building character in students.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iammodern.com/the-primrose-school.html|first=Jessamyn|last=Ayers|title=The Primrose School|newspaper=I AM Modern|date=2012-09-28|accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=franchisingusa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchisingusamagazine.com/special-feature/important-investing-tomorrows-workforce-society/|title=What is More Important Than Investing in Tomorrow’s Workforce and Society?|publisher=Franchising USA|date=2014-03-10|accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primrose Schools' learning philosophy consists of four major components&amp;mdash;theme-based learning, which uses topics of interest to children to place concepts in context; an academic curriculum which focuses on school readiness in math, language, and literacy; enrichment programs, which include music, arts, gardening, and foreign language, among other activities; and character development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/curriculum/learning-philosophy|title=Balanced Learning Philosophy|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community outreach is a central part of the character development component of the Primrose curriculum. For example, each year, students in Primrose schools throughout the country participate in food drives in which children are encouraged to complete extra chores at home in order to earn money to shop for items to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagenewsonline.com/node/10711|title=Preschoolers raise $180 to help serve holiday feast to local families|newspaper=Village News|date=2013-01-02|accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbc12.com/story/20157687/students-shop-to-donate-to-area-food-bank|title=Students shop to donate to area food bank|first=Karla|last=Redditte|work=NBC 12|date=2012-11-21|accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primrose also places an emphasis on parent communication in order to foster the connection between home and school, which creates continuity in the children's educational experience. Schools provide orientation sessions for parents of new students, a variety of parenting and educational resources online, and regular communication with parents through newsletters, conferences, and school events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/our-schools/partnership-with-parents|title=Partnership with Parents|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social responsibility==
Primrose emphasizes community service and social responsibility at all levels of its organization, from its corporate culture to its curriculum. Defined as one of the corporation's core values, "giving without expecting" is central to the overarching Primrose Promise initiative, which includes programs such as the Primrose Children's Foundation and the Helping Hands Program, as well as numerous independent community service efforts at individual schools.&lt;ref name=comserv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/community-service|title=Teaching Social Responsibility through Community Service Projects|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=al/&gt; Through the Primrose Children's Foundation, Primrose Schools has supported and partnered with several organizations that focus on the health, welfare, education, and overall support of children, including [[Children's Miracle Network]] and [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]].&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/childrens-foundation|title=Children's Foundation|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Primrose raised over $500,000 for charity, including over $340,000 for its current charitable partners, [[Reach Out and Read]] and [[Save the Children]].&lt;ref name=franchisingusa/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundraising&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.13abc.com/story/27631561/primrose-schools-reports-record-breaking-fundraising-year|title=Primrose Schools® Reports Record-Breaking Fundraising Year|publisher=WTVG 13ABC|date=2014-12-15|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primrose Children's Foundation===
Founded in 2005, the Primrose Children's Foundation is a non-profit organization that combines the fundraising efforts of Primrose Schools across the country to make a larger national impact through charitable support that advances child advocacy and education efforts.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundraising/&gt;&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2013/05/primrose_school_raises_more_th.html|last=Rodriguez|first=Ana|title=Primrose School raises more than $2,000 at Spring Fling fundraiser for needy families|publisher=Alabama Media Group|date=2013-05-15|accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the foundation's first partnerships was Reach Out and Read, an organization that focuses on the promotion of early literacy. Since 2005, the Primrose Children's Foundation has donated more than $1.4 million to Reach Out and Read.&lt;ref name=fundraising/&gt; In 2014, Primrose announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Save the Children through the Primrose Children's Foundation that focuses on the sponsorship of at-risk children in underserved communities within the United States, providing educational resources to those communities and developing relationships between sponsored children and children in Primrose classrooms.&lt;ref name=stc/&gt;&lt;ref name=partnership&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/save-the-children|title=For A More Promising Future|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
Primrose is accredited through several organizations and also has an internal quality assurance system.&lt;ref name=accred/&gt; In 1998, Primrose received its first Corporate Accreditation from AdvancED, and in 2012 the organization was the first to earn AdvancED Corporation Systems Accreditation under the new Standards for Quality Early Learning Schools, which is the highest level of accreditation available for preschools.&lt;ref name=accred/&gt; Primrose Schools was also the first early learning institution to require all of its schools to be individually accredited through either the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI) or the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI).&lt;ref name=accred/&gt; In addition to external accreditations, each Primrose school undergoes internal reviews three times annually under the company's Service Excellence Assurance (SEA) quality assurance program.&lt;ref name=accred/&gt;

==Organization==

===Locations and franchising===
[[File:Primrose Schools Locations.png|thumb|right|Primrose operates over 301 schools in 23 states as of 2015.]]
Each Primrose school is independently owned and operated by franchise owners who undergo training at both the Primrose corporate campus in Georgia and with experienced franchise owners before opening a school. Franchise owners are provided with a system of support via field consultants and ongoing training opportunities.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;&lt;ref name=franchise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primrosefranchise.com/support-leadership-primrose-schools-franchise|title=Primrose Franchise Owner Support|publisher=Primrose Schools|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primrose currently operates over 301 Primrose schools in more than 20&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;ref name=bts/&gt;&lt;ref name=franchise/&gt; As of 2014, its largest markets include the metropolitan areas of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas]]; [[Houston, Texas]]; and [[Denver, Colorado]].

Primrose primarily targeted [[suburban]] markets for franchising until 2010, when the company opened its first urban prototype school in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood after recognizing a lack of child care options in the urban setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/business/day-care-centers-find-room-to-grow-in-city/nQkXX/|last=Welch|first=Mary|title=Day care centers find room to grow in city|newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Primrose urban school concept has since expanded to include a franchise in Houston, Texas, with additional urban locations in Denver, Dallas, and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/press-releases/primrose-schools®-expands-child-care-franchise-opportunity-major|title=Primrose Schools® Expands Child Care Franchise Opportunity in Major Metropolitan Areas, Opens Second Urban Model in Houston|publisher=Primrose Schools|date=2013-01-30|accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Primrose opened its first California school in Pleasanton and its first Boston-area school in Burlington.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/press-releases/primrose-schools®-reports-record-2013-system-revenue-it-expands-coast-coast|title=Primrose Schools® Reports Record 2013 System Revenue As It Expands Coast-to-Coast with First Primrose California Preschool|publisher=Primrose Schools|date=2014-02-11|accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primroseschools.com/about-us/press-releases/primrose-schools®-opens-first-location-boston-and-identifies-30-area-markets|title=Primrose Schools® Opens First Location in Boston and Identifies 30 Area Markets for Further Expansion|publisher=Primrose Schools|date=2014-04-22|accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the company began extending financial incentives to potential franchise owners in an effort to double its number of franchises by 2020. Primrose is on pace to open its 500th school by 2020.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

'''Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner''' (27 (or 25) February 1861&lt;ref&gt;Steiner's autobiography gives his date of birth as 27 February 1861. However, there is an undated autobiographical fragment written by Steiner, referred to in a footnote in his autobiography in German (GA 28), that says, "My birth fell on 25 February 1861. Two days later I was baptized." See Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', [[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt]] 1992, {{ISBN|3-499-50500-2}}, p. 8.

In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between [[science]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Bruce Elder, ''Harmony and dissent: film and avant-garde art movements in the early twentieth century'', {{ISBN|978-1-55458-028-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ408vKWZ14C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical work of these years, which he termed "[[spiritual science]]", sought to apply the clarity of thinking characteristic of Western philosophy to spiritual questions,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;{{rp|291}} differentiating this approach from what he considered to be vaguer approaches to mysticism. In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, the movement arts (developing a new artistic form, [[eurythmy]]) and architecture, culminating in the building of the [[Goetheanum]], a cultural centre to house [[Gesamtkunstwerk|all the arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Sokolina, Anna, ed.

Steiner advocated a form of ethical [[individualism]], to which he later brought a more explicitly spiritual approach. He based his [[epistemology]] on [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s world view, in which "Thinking… is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rudolf | last = Steiner | title = Goethean Science | id = GA1 | year = 1883}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent thread that runs from his earliest philosophical phase through his later spiritual orientation is the goal of demonstrating that there are no essential limits to human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Helmut | last1 = Zander | first2 = Schweizer | last2 = Fernsehen | title = Sternstunden Philosophie: Die Anthroposophie Rudolf Steiners | language = de | type = program | date = 15 February 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and education ===
[[File:Rudolf Steiner Geburtshaus,Donji Kraljevec, Croatia.JPG|thumb|left|The house where Rudolf Steiner was born, in present-day [[Croatia]]]]
Steiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829 – 1910), left a position as a [[gamekeeper]]&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Rudolf Steiner Publ. Penguin 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the service of Count [[House of Hoyos|Hoyos]] in [[Geras, Austria|Geras]], northeast [[Lower Austria]] to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 [[Horn, Austria|Horn]] – 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Murakirály ([[Donji Kraljevec|Kraljevec]]) in the ''[[Muraköz]]'' region of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austrian Empire]] (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the [[Medjimurje|Međimurje]] region of northernmost [[Croatia]]). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to [[Mödling]], near [[Vienna]], and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to [[:de:Pottschach|Pottschach]], located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian [[Alps]] in [[Lower Austria]].&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

Steiner entered the village school, but following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of [[:de:Neudörfl|Neudörfl]] and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the [[realschule]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].&lt;ref name=Auto&gt;Rudolf Steiner [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/English/APC1928/GA028_index.html Autobiography: Chapters in the Course of My Life: 1861–1907], Lantern Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chap. 2}}
[[File:Rudolf Steiner als Abiturient.jpg|right|thumb|Rudolf Steiner, graduation photo from secondary school]]
In 1879, the family moved to [[Inzersdorf (Vienna)|Inzersdorf]] to enable Steiner to attend the [[TU Wien|Vienna Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;In Austria passing the ''[[matura]]'' examination at a [[Gymnasium (school)]] was required for entry to the University.[http://www.superfarm.net/pedagogika/images/stories/2007-5-eng/2007_05_eng_07-dr_tadej_vidmar-the_gymnasium_as_a_general.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; where he enrolled in courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[mineralogy]] and audited courses in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, at the end of which time he withdrew from the Institute without graduating.&lt;ref name=Zander2&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', Göttingen, 2007, {{ISBN|3-525-55452-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122,443,446,456,503}}&lt;ref name=ZanderBio&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Rudolf Steiner: Die Biografie|year=2011|publisher=Piper|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, [[:de:Karl Julius Schröer|Karl Julius Schröer]],&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c03.html Chap. 3]}} suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Ahern, Sun at Midnight, Publ. Cambridge, Clarke 2010 Rev Ed. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Heidenreich]], [http://southerncrossreview.org/36/heidenreich.htm Rudolf Steiner – A Biographical Sketch]&lt;/ref&gt; a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications.&lt;ref name=ZanderBio/&gt;{{rp|43}}

Before attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Fichte]] and [[F. W. J. Schelling|Schelling]].&lt;ref name = CorrDoc&gt;Steiner, ''Correspondence and Documents 1901-1925'', 1988, p. 9. {{ISBN|0880102071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early spiritual experiences ===
[[File:Steiner als Student.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner as 21-year-old student (1882)]]
When he was nine years old, Steiner believed that he saw the spirit of an aunt who had died in a far-off town asking him to help her at a time when neither he nor his family knew of the woman's death.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner. ''Esoteric Lessons 1904–1909''. SteinerBooks, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner later related that as a child he felt "that one must carry the knowledge of the spiritual world within oneself after the fashion of geometry ... [for here] one is permitted to know something which the mind alone, through its own power, experiences. In this feeling I found the justification for the spiritual world that I experienced ... I confirmed for myself by means of geometry the feeling that I must speak of a world 'which is not seen'."&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;

Steiner believed that at the age of 15 he had gained a complete understanding of the concept of time, which he considered to be the precondition of spiritual [[clairvoyance]].&lt;ref name="CorrDoc"/&gt; At 21, on the train between his home village and [[Vienna]], Steiner met an herb gatherer, Felix Kogutzki, who spoke about the spiritual world "as one who had his own experience therein".&lt;ref name="Auto"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, GA 262, pp. 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Kogutzki conveyed to Steiner a knowledge of nature that was non-academic and spiritual.

=== Writer and philosopher ===
In 1888, as a result of his work for the Kürschner edition of [[Goethe]]'s works, Steiner was invited to work as an editor at the Goethe archives in [[Weimar]]. Steiner remained with the archive until 1896. As well as the introductions for and commentaries to four volumes of Goethe's scientific writings, Steiner wrote two books about Goethe's philosophy: ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/ "Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception"], also translated as ''Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview''&lt;/ref&gt; which Steiner regarded as the [[epistemological]] foundation and justification for his later work,&lt;ref&gt;Preface to 1924 edition of [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_pre1924.html ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception, with Specific Reference to Schiller''], in which Steiner also wrote that the way of knowing he presented in this work opened the way from the sensory world to the spiritual one.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Goethean Science'', Mercury Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-936132-92-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-936132-92-1}}, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA001/English/MP1988/GA001_index.html link]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also collaborated in complete editions of the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the writer [[Jean Paul]] and wrote numerous articles for various journals.

[[File:Rudolf Steiner um 1891.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rudolf Steiner around 1891/92, etching by Otto Fröhlich]]
In 1891, Steiner received a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]], for his dissertation discussing 
[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte's]] concept of the ego,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His thesis title was ''Die Grundfrage der Erkenntnistheorie mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Fichte's [[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]] – Prolegomena zur Verständigung des philosophierenden Bewusstseins mit sich selbst''.&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to [[:de:Heinrich von Stein|Heinrich von Stein]], whose ''Seven Books of Platonism'' Steiner esteemed.&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c14.html Chap. 14]}} Steiner's dissertation was later published in expanded form as ''Truth and Knowledge: Prelude to a Philosophy of Freedom'', with a dedication to [[Eduard von Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA003/index.php ''Truth and Knowledge'' (full text)]. {{lang-de|Wahrheit und Wissenschaft – Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Freiheit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he published ''Die Philosophie der Freiheit'' (''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]'' or ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity''—Steiner's preferred English title) (1894), an exploration of [[epistemology]] and ethics that suggested a way for humans to become spiritually free beings. Steiner later spoke of this book as containing implicitly, in philosophical form, the entire content of what he later developed explicitly as [[anthroposophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prokofieff, ''May Human Beings Hear It!'', Temple Lodge, 2004. p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Steiner.jpg|upright|thumb|Marie Steiner 1903]]
In 1896, Steiner declined an offer from [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] to help organize the Nietzsche archive in [[Naumburg]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Her brother]] by that time was ''[[non compos mentis]]''. Förster-Nietzsche introduced Steiner into the presence of the [[catatonic]] philosopher; Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'' Garber Communications; 2nd revised edition (July 1985) {{ISBN|978-0893450335}}. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA005/English/GC1985/GA005_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner later related that:

:"My first acquaintance with Nietzsche's writings belongs to the year 1889. Previous to that I had never read a line of his. Upon the substance of my ideas as these find expression in ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'', Nietzsche's thought had not the least influence....Nietzsche's ideas of the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal recurrence]]' and of '[[Übermensch]]' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the 19th century....What attracted me particularly was that one could read Nietzsche without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of Nietzsche's."&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c18.html Chap. 18]}}

In 1897, Steiner left the [[Weimar]] archives and moved to Berlin. He became part owner of, chief editor of, and an active contributor to the literary journal ''Magazin für Literatur'', where he hoped to find a readership sympathetic to his philosophy. Many subscribers were alienated by Steiner's unpopular support of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Tarcher/Penguin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the journal lost more subscribers when Steiner published extracts from his correspondence with anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]].&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Dissatisfaction with his editorial style eventually led to his departure from the magazine.

In 1899, Steiner married Anna Eunicke; the couple separated several years later. Anna died in 1911.

=== Theosophical Society ===
{{Main article|Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society}}
[[File:Steiner mit Annie Besant.jpg|right|thumb|Rudolf Steiner in Munich with Annie Besant, leader of the Theosophical Society. Photo from 1907]]
In 1899, Steiner published an article, "Goethe's Secret Revelation", discussing the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale ''[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]''. This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] on the subject of Nietzsche. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902 without ever formally joining the society.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravagli/&gt; It was also in connection with this society that Steiner met and worked with [[Marie von Sivers]], who became his second wife in 1914. By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [[Annie Besant]] to be leader of the Theosophical ''Esoteric Society'' for Germany and Austria. In 1904, Eliza, the wife of [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], became one of his favourite scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer| first1= Thomas|title= Helmuth von Moltke, Light for the new millennium: Rudolf Steiner's association with Helmuth and Eliza von Moltke: letters, documents and after-death communications''|publisher= Rudolf Steiner Press|place= London|year= 1997|ISBN= 1-85584-051-0|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Through Eliza, Steiner met Helmuth, who served as the [[German General Staff|Chief of the German General Staff]] from 1906 to 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.it/books?isbn=0521791014|title= Helmuth Von Moltke and the Origins of the First World War|first1= Annika|last1= Mombauer |date= April 19, 2001|ISBN= 9780521019569|website= Google Books|language= en|access-date= Jun 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In contrast to mainstream Theosophy, Steiner sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his [[spiritual science]]. During this period, Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing [[H. P. Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]'s terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of [[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant|Besant]]'s claim that [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] was the vehicle of a new ''Maitreya'', or world teacher,&lt;ref&gt;See Lutyens, Mary (2005). J. Krishnamurti: A Life. New Delhi: Penguin Books India. {{ISBN|0-14-400006-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a formal split in 1912/13,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the [[Anthroposophical Society]]. Steiner took the name "Anthroposophy" from the title of a work of the Austrian philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann]], published in Vienna in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann's ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft.: Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage'': Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'', 11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]. Steiner took the name but not the limitations on knowledge which Zimmerman proposed. Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his departure from the Theosophical Society, Steiner maintained his interest in Theosophy throughout his life.&lt;ref name=RSLib&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37618538/The_Library_of_Rudolf_Steiner_The_Books_in_English The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English], Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthroposophical Society and its cultural activities ===
[[File:RudolfSteiner.jpeg|right|thumb]]
The [[Anthroposophical Society]] grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by [[Edouard Schuré]] and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first [[Goetheanum]] building, in [[Dornach]], Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once World War I started in 1914, the Goetheanum volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction. Steiner moved from [[Berlin]] to Dornach in 1913 and lived there to the end of his life.&lt;ref  name=HausHansi&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36947843/The_Home_of_Rudolf_Steiner_Haus_Hansi The Home of Rudolf Steiner: Haus Hansi], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 126:19-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous [[#Breadth of activity|practical institutions and activities]], including the first [[Waldorf schools|Waldorf school]], founded that year in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. At the same time, the Goetheanum developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1922/1923, the building burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|752}}&lt;ref name=GA259&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rudolf Steiner |title=Das Schicksalsjahr 1923 in der Geschichte der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft: vom Goethanumbrand zur Weihnachtstagung: Ansprachen, Versammlungen, Dokumente, Januar bis Dezember 1923 |publisher=Rudolf Steiner Verlag |pages=750–790 (esp. 787)|year=1991 |isbn=978-3-7274-2590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|796}} Steiner immediately began work designing a [[Goetheanum|second Goetheanum]] building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.

At a "Foundation Meeting" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas, 1923, Steiner spoke of laying a new [[:Wikisource:Foundation Stone meditation|Foundation Stone]] for the society in the hearts of his listeners. At the meeting, a new "General Anthroposophical Society" was established with a new executive board. At this meeting, Steiner also founded a School of Spiritual Science, intended as an "organ of initiative" for research and study and as "the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science''.

Temple Lodge 2006. p.xiii, {{ISBN|1902636805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This School, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, [[Waldorf education|education]], [[Anthroposophical medicine|medicine]], performing arts ([[eurythmy]], speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts. Later sections were added for the social sciences, youth and agriculture.&lt;ref name=GoethRestruct&gt;[https://www.goetheanum.org/Overview.481.0.html?&amp;L=1 1923/1924 Restructuring and deepening.

=== Political engagement and social agenda ===
Steiner became a well-known and controversial public figure during and after World War I. In response to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, he proposed extensive social reforms through the establishment of a [[Threefold Social Order]] in which the cultural, political and economic realms would be largely independent. Steiner argued that a fusion of the three realms had created the inflexibility that had led to catastrophes such as [[First World War|World War I]]. In connection with this, he promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of [[Upper Silesia]], claimed by both Poland and Germany. His suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Zeitung'', 4 March 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner opposed [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s proposal to create new European nations based around ethnic groups, which he saw as opening the door to rampant nationalism. Steiner proposed as an alternative "'social territories' with democratic institutions that were accessible to all inhabitants of a territory whatever their origin while the needs of the various ethnicities would be met by independent cultural institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Werner (2011), "Rudolf Steiner zu Individuum und Rasse: Sein Engagement gegen Rassismus und Nationalismus", in ''Anthroposophie in Geschichte und Gegenwart''. trans. Margot M. Saar&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks, illness, and death ===
The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] gained strength in Germany after the First World War. In 1919, a political theorist of this movement, [[Dietrich Eckart]], attacked Steiner and suggested that he was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Uwe Werner, ''Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus'', Munich (1999), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Adolf Hitler]] attacked Steiner on many fronts, including accusations that he was a tool of the Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defendingsteiner.com/sources/hitler-steiner.php ''Völkischer Beobachter'', 15 March 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; while other nationalist extremists in Germany called for a "war against Steiner". That same year, Steiner warned against the disastrous effects it would have for Central Europe if the National Socialists came to power.&lt;ref name="Werner" /&gt;{{rp|8}} In 1922 a lecture Steiner was giving in Munich was disrupted when stink bombs were let off and the lights switched out, while people rushed the stage apparently attempting to attack Steiner, who exited safely through a back door.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''The Esoteric Aspect of the Social Question: The Individual and Society'', Steinerbooks, p xiv and see also Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'', pp. 769–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Riot at Munich Lecture", New York Times, 17 May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to guarantee his safety, Steiner's agents cancelled his next lecture tour.&lt;ref name=GL/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Marie Steiner, Introduction, in Rudolf Steiner, ''Turning Points in Spiritual History'', Dornach, September 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich led Steiner to give up his residence in Berlin, saying that if those responsible for the attempted coup [Hitler and others] came to power in Germany, it would no longer be possible for him to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesberger, [http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html Die Krise der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft 1923] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606014838/http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 on, Steiner showed signs of increasing frailness and illness. He nonetheless continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently. Many of these lectures focused on practical areas of life such as education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lindenberg, Christoph, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'' Vol. II, Chapter 52. {{ISBN|3-7725-1551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rudolf Steiner Grabmal Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Steiner's gravestone at the Goetheanum]]
Increasingly ill, he held his last lecture in late September, 1924. He continued work on his autobiography during the last months of his life; he died on 30 March 1925.

=== Spiritual research ===
Steiner first began speaking publicly about spiritual experiences and phenomena in his 1899 lectures to the Theosophical Society. By 1901 he had begun to write about spiritual topics, initially in the form of discussions of historical figures such as the [[mysticism|mystics]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. By 1904 he was expressing his own understanding of these themes in his essays and books, while continuing to refer to a wide variety of historical sources.

"A world of spiritual perception is discussed in a number of writings which I have published since this book appeared. ''The Philosophy of Freedom'' forms the philosophical basis for these later writings. For it tries to show that the experience of thinking, rightly understood, is in fact an experience of spirit." (Steiner, Philosophy of Freedom, Consequences of Monism)

Steiner aimed to apply his training in [[mathematics]], science, and philosophy to produce rigorous, verifiable presentations of those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenberg, "Schritte auf dem Weg zur Erweiterung der Erkenntnis", pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that through freely chosen [[ethics|ethical]] disciplines and [[meditation|meditative training]], anyone could develop the ability to experience the [[spirit|spiritual world]], including the higher nature of oneself and others.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Steiner believed that such [[discipline]] and training would help a person to become a more [[morality|moral]], [[creativity|creative]] and [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] [[individuality|individual]] – free in the sense of being capable of actions motivated solely by love.&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt; His philosophical ideas were affected by [[Franz Brentano]],&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; with whom he had studied,&lt;ref&gt;Steiner described Brentano's ''Psychology from the Empirical Standpoint'' (1870) as symptomatic of the weakness of a psychology that intended to follow the method of natural science but lacked the strength and elasticity of mind to do justice to the demand of modern times: Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Fichte, [[Hegel]], Schelling, and Goethe's [[Goethean science|phenomenological approach to science]].&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockemühl, J., ''Toward a Phenomenology of the Etheric World'' {{ISBN|0-88010-115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelglass, S. et al., ''The Marriage of Sense and Thought'', {{ISBN|0-940262-82-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner followed [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] in using the term ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'', usually translated as "spiritual science".&lt;ref&gt;Dilthey had used this term in the title of one of the works listed in the Introduction to Steiner's ''Truth and Science'' (the doctoral dissertation) as concerned with the theory of cognition in general: ''Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften, usw.'', (Introduction to the Spiritual Sciences, etc.) published in 1883.{{cite web |url=http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417102908/http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner used the term to describe a discipline treating the spirit as something actual and real, starting from the premise that it is possible for human beings to penetrate behind what is sense-perceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0058/19091014p01.html "The Mission of Spiritual Science"], lecture 1 of ''Metamorphoses of the Soul: Paths of Experience'', Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that psychology, history, and the humanities generally were based on the direct grasp of an ideal reality,&lt;ref&gt;''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'', ch XIX&lt;/ref&gt; and required close attention to the particular period and culture which provided the distinctive character of religious qualities in the course of the evolution of consciousness. In contrast to William James' pragmatic approach to religious and psychic experience, which emphasized its idiosyncratic character, Steiner focused on ways such experience can be rendered more intelligible and integrated into human life.&lt;ref&gt;''William James and Rudolf Steiner'', Robert A. McDermott, 1991, in ReVision, vol.13 no.4 [http://www.ciis.edu/Documents/Academic%20Departments/PCC/McDermott_William%20James%20and%20Rudolf%20Steiner.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner proposed that an understanding of reincarnation and karma was necessary to understand psychology&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Reincarnation and Karma: Concepts Compelled by the Modern Scientific Point of view'', in ''Lucifer Gnosis'' 1903.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/ReinKarma/ReKarm_e01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the form of external nature would be more comprehensible as a result of insight into the course of karma in the evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA235/English/RSP1972/Karm01_intro.html Introductory note to ''Karmic Relationships'']&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1910, he described aspects of karma relating to health, natural phenomena and free will, taking the position that a person is not bound by his or her karma, but can transcend this through actively taking hold of one's own nature and destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner ''Manifestations of Karma'' 4th edition 2000 {{ISBN|1855840588}}. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ManfKarma/ManKar_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In an extensive series of lectures from February to September 1924, Steiner presented further research on successive reincarnations of various individuals and described the techniques he used for karma research.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These lectures were published as [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA235/English/RSP1972/Karm01_index.html Karmic Relationships: Esoteric Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric schools===
{{see also|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner was founder and leader of the following: 
* His independent ''Esoteric School'' of the Theosophical Society, founded in 1904. This school continued after the break with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] but was disbanded at the start of World War I.
* A lodge called ''Mystica Aeterna'' within the [[Ancient and Primitive Rite|Masonic Order of Memphis and Mizraim]], which Steiner led from 1906 until around 1914. Steiner added to the Masonic rite a number of Rosicrucian references.&lt;ref&gt;Ellic Howe: ''The Magicians of the Golden Dawn'' London 1985, Routledge, pp 262 ff&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The School of Spiritual Science of the Anthroposophical Society, founded in 1923 as a further development of his earlier Esoteric School. This was originally constituted with a general section and seven specialized sections for education, literature, performing arts, natural sciences, medicine, visual arts, and astronomy.&lt;ref name=GoethRestruct/&gt;&lt;ref name="wn.rsarchive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisabeth Vreede]], who Steiner had nominated as the first leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section, was responsible for the posthumous 1926 edition of Steiner's astronomy course, concerning this branch of natural science from the point of view of Anthroposophy and spiritual science, under the title ''The Relationship of the various Natural-Scientific Subjects to Astronomy'', [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA323/English/LR81/AstCrs_foreword.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner gave members of the School the first Lesson for guidance into the esoteric work in February 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenther Wachsmuth]], ''The Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner from the Turn of the Century to his Death.'' p.53. Translated by Olin D. Wannamaker and Reginald E. Raab. 1955, Whittier Books (New York), 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Though Steiner intended to develop three "classes" of this school, only the first of these was developed in his lifetime (and continues today). An authentic text of the written records on which the teaching of the First Class was based was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science: The First Class'', Temple Lodge Publishing, 2006, p.xii. The detailed account is given in chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breadth of activity ==
After the First World War, Steiner became active in a wide variety of cultural contexts. He founded a number of schools, the first of which was known as the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]],&lt;ref&gt;IN CONTEXT No. 6, Summer 1984&lt;/ref&gt; which later evolved into a worldwide school network. He also founded a system of organic agriculture, now known as [[biodynamic agriculture]], which was one of the very first forms of, and has contributed significantly to the development of, modern [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/biodynamic.html ATTRA – National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Anthroposophic medicine|work in medicine]] led to the development of a broad range of complementary medications and supportive artistic and biographic therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. and Rodger, I. ''Anthroposophical Medicine: Treating Body, Soul and Spirit''&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous homes for children and adults with [[developmental disabilities]] based on his work (including those of the [[Camphill movement]]) are found in Africa, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://camphill.net/silo/files/camphill-international-directory.pdf Camphill list of communities]&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings and drawings influenced [[Joseph Beuys]] and other modern artists. His two [[Goetheanum]] buildings have been widely cited as masterpieces of [[modern architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;Both Goetheanum buildings are listed as among the most significant 100 buildings of modern architecture by Goulet, Patrice, ''Les Temps Modernes?'', L'Architecture D'Aujourd'hui, December 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Rudolf_Steiner.html Rudolf Steiner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051601/http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Rudolf_Steiner.html |date=24 September 2015 }}, Great Buildings Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brennan, [http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/reviews/brennan/brennan3-18-98.asp rudolf steiner], ''Artnet''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hortola, Policarp.

Steiner's [[literary estate]] is correspondingly broad. Steiner's writings, published in about forty volumes, include books, essays, [[Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas|four plays]] ('mystery dramas'), mantric verse, and an autobiography. His collected lectures, making up another approximately 300 volumes, discuss an extremely wide range of themes. Steiner's drawings, chiefly illustrations done on blackboards during his lectures, are collected in a separate series of 28 volumes. Many publications have covered his architectural legacy and sculptural work.

=== Education ===
[[File:Ecole Steiner-Waldorf Verrieres2.jpg|thumb|The Waldorf school in [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (France)]]
{{main article|Waldorf education}}
As a young man, Steiner was a private tutor and a lecturer on history for the Berlin ''Arbeiterbildungsschule'',&lt;ref name=zander2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Anthroposophie in Deutschland|year=2007|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational initiative for working class adults.&lt;ref name=njacobs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nicholas|title=The German Social Democratic Party School in Berlin, 1906–1914|journal=History Workshop|date=Spring 1978|volume=5|pages=179–187|doi=10.1093/hwj/5.1.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, he began to articulate his ideas on education in public lectures,&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt; culminating in a 1907 essay on ''The Education of the Child'' in which he described the major phases of child development which formed the foundation of his approach to education.&lt;ref&gt;The original essay was published in the journal ''Lucifer-Gnosis'' in 1907 and can be found in Steiner's collected essays, ''Lucifer-Gnosis 1903-1908'',
GA34. This essay was republished as an independent brochure in 1909; in a [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/EduChild/EduChi_note.html Prefatory note to this edition], Steiner refers to recent lectures on the subject. An English translation can be found in [http://waldorfcurriculum.com/FREE/THE%20EDUCATION%20of%20the%20child.pdf ''The Education of the Child: And Early Lectures on Education''] (first English edition 1927, Second English edition 1981, London and New York, 1996 edition {{ISBN|978-0-88010-414-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of education was influenced by the [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbartian]] pedagogy prominent in Europe during the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name=zander2007/&gt;{{rp|1362, 1390ff}}&lt;ref name="Ullrich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullrich|first=Heiner|title=Rudolf Steiner|year=2008|publisher=Continuum International Pub.

In 1919, [[Emil Molt]] invited him to lecture to his workers at the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart. Out of these lectures came a new school, the Waldorf school. In 1922, Steiner presented these ideas at a conference called for this purpose in [[Oxford]] by Professor [[Millicent Mackenzie]]. He subsequently presented a teacher training course at [[Torquay]] in 1924 at an [[Anthroposophy]] Summer School organised by [[Eleanor Merry]].&lt;ref name=Torquay&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36404489/Torquay_In_the_Footsteps_of_Rudolf_Steiner Torquay: In the Footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 125 (Mar): 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Conference and the Torquay teacher training led to the founding of the first Waldorf schools in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain]. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3 (1): 53–66.&lt;/ref&gt; During Steiner's lifetime, schools based on his educational principles were also founded in [[Hamburg]], [[Essen]], [[The Hague]] and London; there are now more than 1000 [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] worldwide.

=== Biodynamic agriculture ===
{{Main article|Biodynamic agriculture}}
In 1924, a group of farmers concerned about the future of agriculture requested Steiner's help. Steiner responded with a lecture series on an [[ecological agriculture|ecological]] and [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] approach to agriculture that increased soil fertility without the use of [[chemical fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref name="BD1924"/&gt; Steiner's agricultural ideas promptly spread and were put into practice internationally&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.oalib.com/paper/2894417 "The secrets of Koberwitz: The diffusion of Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course and the founding of Biodynamic Agriculture"], ''Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy'', 2(1):19–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biodynamic agriculture]] is now practiced in Europe,&lt;ref name=olympiad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|title=Organics Olympiad 2011: Global Indices of Leadership in Organic Agriculture|journal=Journal of Social and Development Sciences|year=2011|volume=1|issue=4|pages=144–150|url=http://orgprints.org/18860/1/Paull2011OlympiadJSDS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America, South America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/06/biodynamic-coffee-in-brazil|title=Biodynamic coffee farming in Brazil|last=Purvis|first=Andrew|date=2009-12-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenafricadirectory.org/listing/biodynamic-agricultural-association-of-southern-africa/|title=Biodynamic Agricultural Association of Southern Africa - Green Africa Directory|work=Green Africa Directory|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Asia&lt;ref name="olympiad"/&gt; and [[Australasia]].&lt;ref name=Koberwitz&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.organic-systems.org/journal/Vol_6(1)/pdf/6(1)-Paull-pp27-41.pdf "Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924–1938"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2011, 6(1):27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodynamics.com/regional.html Groups in N.

A central aspect of biodynamics is that the farm as a whole is seen as an organism, and therefore should be a largely self-sustaining system, producing its own [[manure]] and [[Fodder|animal feed]]. Plant or animal disease is seen as a symptom of problems in the whole organism. Steiner also suggested timing such agricultural activities as sowing, weeding, and harvesting to utilize the influences on plant growth of the [[moon]] and [[planets]]; and the application of natural materials prepared in specific ways to the [[soil]], [[composting|compost]], and crops, with the intention of engaging non-physical beings and elemental forces. He encouraged his listeners to verify his suggestions [[scientific method|empirically]], as he had not yet done.&lt;ref name="Koberwitz"/&gt;

=== Anthroposophical medicine ===
{{Main article|Anthroposophical medicine}}
From the late 1910s, Steiner was working with doctors to create a new approach to medicine. In 1921, [[pharmacist]]s and physicians gathered under Steiner's guidance to create a pharmaceutical company called [[Weleda]] which now distributes natural medical products worldwide. At around the same time, Dr. [[Ita Wegman]] founded a first anthroposophic medical clinic (now the Ita Wegman Clinic) in [[Arlesheim]].

=== Social reform===
{{main article|Threefold Social Order}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was active as a lecturer on social reform. A petition expressing his basic social ideas was widely circulated and signed by many cultural figures of the day, including [[Hermann Hesse]].

In Steiner's chief book on [[social reform]], ''Toward Social Renewal'', he suggested that the cultural, political and economic spheres of society need to work together as consciously cooperating yet independent entities, each with a particular task: political institutions should establish [[Equality before the law|political equality]] and protect [[human rights]]; cultural institutions should nurture the free and unhindered development of science, art, education and religion; and economic institutions should enable producers, distributors and consumers to cooperate to provide efficiently for society's needs.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', Harper San Francisco 1984 {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw such a division of responsibility, which he called the [[Threefold Social Order]], as a vital task which would take up consciously the historical trend toward the mutual independence of these three realms. Steiner also gave suggestions for many specific social reforms.

Steiner proposed what he termed a "fundamental law" of social life:

{{Quote|The well-being of a community of people working together will be the greater, the less the individual claims for himself the proceeds of his work, i.e. the more of these proceeds he makes over to his fellow-workers, the more his own needs are satisfied, not out of his own work but out of the work done by others.|Steiner|The Fundamental Social Law&lt;ref name=Fundamental&gt;Steiner (1917), [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/FuSoLa_index.html "The Fundamental Social Law"], translated in ''Selected writings
of Rudolf Steiner'' (1993), Richard Seddon (Ed.), Rudolf Steiner Press, Bristol. {{ISBN|1 85584 005 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He expressed this in the motto:&lt;ref name=Fundamental/&gt;
 The healthy social life is found 
 When in the mirror of each human soul 
 The whole community finds its reflection, 
 And when in the community 
 The virtue of each one is living.

His primary sculptural work is ''The Representative of Humanity'' (1922), a nine-meter high wood sculpture executed as a joint project with the sculptor [[Edith Maryon]]. This was intended to be placed in the first Goetheanum.

=== Performing arts ===
{{See also|Eurythmy}}
Steiner wrote four [[mystery plays]] between 1909 and 1913: ''The Portal of Initiation'', ''The Souls' Probation'', ''The Guardian of the Threshold'' and ''The Soul's Awakening'', modeled on the esoteric dramas of Edouard Schuré, [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] 'On Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas, Four Lectures Given in Spring Valley, 1948' {{ISBN|0-936132-93-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's plays continue to be performed by anthroposophical groups in various countries, most notably (in the original German) in Dornach, Switzerland and (in English translation) in Spring Valley, New York and in Stroud and Stourbridge in the U.K.

In collaboration with Marie von Sivers, Steiner also founded a new approach to acting, storytelling, and the recitation of poetry. His last public lecture course, given in 1924, was on speech and drama. The Russian actor, director, and acting coach [[Michael Chekhov]] based significant aspects of his method of acting on Steiner's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/viewFile/5054/5759 |title=On Rudolf Steiner's Impact on the Training of the Actor |author=Anderson, Neil |journal=Literature &amp; Aesthetics |date=June 2011 |volume=21|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Solomon, [http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf Michael Chekhov and His Approach to Acting in Contemporary Performance Training] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803154254/http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf |date=3 August 2016 }}, MA thesis University of Maine, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Marie von Sivers]], Rudolf Steiner also developed the art of [[eurythmy]], sometimes referred to as "visible speech and song". According to the principles of eurythmy, there are archetypal movements or gestures that correspond to every aspect of speech – the sounds (or [[phonemes]]), the rhythms, and the grammatical function – to every "soul quality" – joy, despair, tenderness, etc. – and to every aspect of music – tones, intervals, rhythms, and harmonies.

=== Goethean science &lt;!--linked from 'Goethean science'--&gt;===
{{See also|Goethean science}}
In his commentaries on Goethe's scientific works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in nature, rather than theory- or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886) and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach from the physical sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required to find the biological archetypes (''Urpflanze''), and postulated that Goethe had sought but been unable to fully find the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=Hemleben&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 37–49 and pp. 96–100 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the [[intermaxillary segment|intermaxillary bone]] in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; Steiner defended [[Goethe's theory of color|Goethe's qualitative description of color]] as arising synthetically from the polarity of light and darkness, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s particle-based and analytic conception.

=== Knowledge and freedom ===
{{See also|Philosophy of Freedom}}
Steiner approached the philosophical questions of [[epistemology|knowledge]] and [[Free will|freedom]] in two stages. In his dissertation, published in expanded form in 1892 as ''Truth and Knowledge'', Steiner suggests that there is an inconsistency between Kant's philosophy, which posits that all knowledge is a representation of an essential verity inaccessible to human consciousness, and modern science, which assumes that all influences can be found in the sensory and mental world to which we have access. Steiner considered Kant's philosophy of an inaccessible beyond ("Jenseits-Philosophy") a stumbling block in achieving a satisfying philosophical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Storr]], ''Feet of Clay'', Free Press-Simon and Schuster, 1996. Storr quotes Steiner p72, "If, however, we regard the sum of all percepts as the one part and contrast with this a second part, namely the things-in-themselves, then we are philosophising into the blue. We are merely playing with concepts."&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner postulates that the world is essentially an indivisible unity, but that our [[consciousness]] divides it into the [[senses|sense]]-perceptible appearance, on the one hand, and the formal nature accessible to our [[thinking]], on the other. He sees in thinking itself an element that can be strengthened and deepened sufficiently to penetrate all that our senses do not reveal to us. Steiner thus considered what appears to human experience as a division between the spiritual and natural worlds to be a conditioned result of the structure of our consciousness, which separates [[perception]] and thinking. These two faculties give us not two worlds, but two complementary views of the same world; neither has primacy and the two together are necessary and sufficient to arrive at a complete understanding of the world. In thinking about [[perception]] (the path of natural science) and perceiving the process of thinking (the path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] training), it is possible to discover a hidden inner unity between the two poles of our experience.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 4}} [[Truth]], for Steiner, is paradoxically both an objective discovery and yet "a free creation of the human spirit, that never would exist at all if we did not generate it ourselves. The task of understanding is not to replicate in conceptual form something that already exists, but rather to create a wholly new realm, that together with the world given to our senses constitutes the fullness of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Truth and Science'', Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', Steiner further explores potentials within thinking: freedom, he suggests, can only be approached gradually with the aid of the creative activity of thinking. Thinking can be a free deed; in addition, it can liberate our will from its subservience to our [[instinct]]s and [[motivation|drive]]s. Free deeds, he suggests, are those for which we are fully conscious of the motive for our action; freedom is the spiritual activity of penetrating with consciousness our own nature and that of the world,&lt;ref&gt;"To be conscious of the laws underlying one's actions is to be conscious of one's freedom. The process of knowing ... is the process of development towards freedom." Steiner, GA3, pp. 91f, quoted in Rist and Schneider, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and the real activity of acting in full consciousness.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|133–4}} This includes overcoming influences of both heredity and environment: "To be free is to be capable of thinking one's own thoughts – not the thoughts merely of the body, or of society, but thoughts generated by one's deepest, most original, most essential and spiritual self, one's individuality."&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner affirms [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s and [[Haeckel]]'s [[evolution]]ary perspectives but extended this beyond its [[materialism|materialistic]] consequences; he sees human [[consciousness]], indeed, all human culture, as a product of natural evolution that transcends itself. For Steiner, nature becomes self-conscious in the human being. Steiner's description of the nature of human consciousness thus closely parallels that of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', {{ISBN|0-7126-7332-6}}. Cf. Solovyov: "In human beings, the absolute subject-object appears ''as such'', i.e. as pure spiritual activity, containing all of its own objectivity, the whole process of its natural manifestation, but containing it totally ideally – in consciousness....The subject knows here only its own activity as an objective activity (sub specie object). Thus, the original identity of subject and object is restored in philosophical knowledge." (''The Crisis of Western Philosophy'', Lindisfarne 1996 pp. 42–3)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritual science ===
{{See also|Anthroposophy|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}
[[File:Steiner Berlin 1900 big.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner 1900]]
In his earliest works, Steiner already spoke of the "natural and spiritual worlds" as a unity.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; From 1900 on, he began lecturing about concrete details of the spiritual world(s), culminating in the publication in 1904 of the first of several systematic presentations, his ''Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos''. As a starting point for the book Steiner took a quotation from Goethe, describing the method of natural scientific observation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/RSP1965/GA009_c01.html ''Theosophy'', Chapter I: The Essential Nature of Man]&lt;/ref&gt; while in the Preface he made clear that the line of thought taken in this book led to the same goal as that in his earlier work, ''The Philosophy of Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;''Theosophy'',
from the Prefaces to the First, Second, and Third Editions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/AP1971/GA009_c01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1903–1908 Steiner maintained the magazine "Lucifer-Gnosis" and published in it essays on topics such as initiation, reincarnation and karma, and knowledge of the supernatural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA034/ Articles from "Lucifer-Gnosis," 1903–1908]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were later collected and published as books, such as ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' (1904/5) and ''Cosmic Memory''. The book ''An Outline of Esoteric Science'' was published in 1910. Important themes include:
* the human being as body, [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]];
* the path of spiritual development;
* spiritual influences on world-evolution and history; and
* [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].

Steiner emphasized that there is an objective natural and spiritual world that can be known, and that perceptions of the spiritual world and incorporeal beings are, under conditions of training comparable to that required for the natural sciences, including self-discipline, replicable by multiple observers. It is on this basis that [[spiritual science]] is possible, with radically different epistemological foundations than those of natural science. He believed that natural science was correct in its methods but one-sided for exclusively focusing on sensory phenomena, while mysticism was vague in its methods, though seeking to explore the inner and spiritual life. Anthroposophy was meant to apply the systematic methods of the former to the content of the latter&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Christianity as Mystical Fact and the Mysteries of Antiquity'', Anthroposophic Press 2006 {{ISBN|0880104368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of Steiner's teachers, Franz Brentano, had famously declared that "The true method of philosophy can only be the method of natural science" (Walach, Harald, "Criticism of Transpersonal Psychology and Beyond", in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology, ed. H. L. Friedman and G. Hartelius. P. 45.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Steiner, the cosmos is permeated and continually transformed by the creative activity of non-physical processes and spiritual beings. For the human being to become conscious of the objective reality of these processes and beings, it is necessary to creatively enact and reenact, within, their creative activity. Thus objective spiritual knowledge always entails creative inner activity.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Steiner articulated three stages of any creative deed:&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|Pt II, Chapter 1}}
* Moral intuition: the ability to discover or, preferably, develop valid ethical principles;
* Moral imagination: the imaginative transformation of such principles into a concrete intention applicable to the particular situation ([[situational ethics]]); and
* Moral technique: the realization of the intended transformation, depending on a mastery of practical skills.

Steiner termed his work from this period onwards ''[[Anthroposophy]]''. He emphasized that the spiritual path he articulated builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent [[judgment]]; for the results of spiritual research to be appropriately presented in a modern context they must be in a form accessible to [[logic]]al understanding, so that those who do not have access to the spiritual experiences underlying anthroposophical research can make independent evaluations of the latter's results.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädagogik'', {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual training is to support what Steiner considered the overall purpose of human evolution, the development of the mutually interdependent qualities of love and [[free will|freedom]].&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, "Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, p. 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steiner and Christianity ===
In 1899 Steiner experienced what he described as a life-transforming inner encounter with the being of Christ; previously he had little or no relation to Christianity in any form. Then and thereafter, his relationship to Christianity remained entirely founded upon personal experience, and thus both non-denominational and strikingly different from conventional religious forms.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; Steiner was then 38, and the experience of meeting the Christ occurred after a tremendous inner struggle. To use Steiner's own words, the "experience culminated in my standing in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography, Chapters In The Course Of My Life: 18611907, Rudolf Steiner, SteinerBooks, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christ and human evolution ====
Steiner describes Christ as the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and human history, redeeming [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] from [[Paradise]].&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte, Volume 27, {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, especially Chapters 1.3, 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the Christ as a being that unifies and inspires all religions, not belonging to a particular religious faith. To be "Christian" is, for Steiner, a search for balance between polarizing extremes&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;{{rp|102–3}} and the ability to manifest love in freedom.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Central principles of his understanding include:
*The being of Christ is central to ''all'' religions, though called by different names by each.
*Every religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born.
*Historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed in our times in order to meet the ongoing evolution of humanity.

In Steiner's [[esoteric cosmology]], the spiritual development of humanity is interwoven in and inseparable from the cosmological development of the universe. Continuing the evolution that led to humanity being born out of the natural world, the Christ being brings an impulse enabling human consciousness of the forces that act creatively, but unconsciously, in nature.&lt;ref&gt;An Outline of Esoteric Science, Anthroposophic, SteinerBooks, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divergence from conventional Christian thought ====
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include gnostic elements.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; However, unlike many gnostics, Steiner affirms the unique and actual physical Incarnation of Christ in Jesus at the beginning of the Christian era.

One of the central points of divergence with conventional Christian thought is found in [[Anthroposophy#Nature of the human being|Steiner's views on reincarnation and karma]].

Steiner also posited two different Jesus children involved in the Incarnation of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; He references in this regard the fact that the [[genealogy|genealogies]] in these two gospels list twenty-six (Luke) to forty-one (Matthew) completely different ancestors for the generations from [[King David|David]] to Jesus. See [[Genealogy of Jesus]] for alternative explanations of this radical divergence.

Steiner's view of the [[second coming]] of Christ is also unusual. He suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but rather, meant that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, in the "[[Etheric plane|etheric]] realm" – i.e. visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life – for increasing numbers of people, beginning around the year 1933. He emphasized that the future would require humanity to recognize this Spirit of Love in all its genuine forms, regardless of how this is named. He also warned that the traditional name, "Christ", might be used, yet the true essence of this Being of Love ignored.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;

==== The Christian Community ====
In the 1920s, Steiner was approached by [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], a [[Lutheran]] pastor with a congregation in Berlin, who asked if it was possible to create a more modern form of Christianity. Soon others joined Rittelmeyer – mostly Protestant pastors and theology students, but including several Roman Catholic priests. Steiner offered counsel on renewing the spiritual potency of the sacraments while emphasizing [[freedom of thought]] and a personal relationship to religious life. He envisioned a new synthesis of Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious life, terming this "modern, [[John the Evangelist|Johannine Christianity]]".&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

The resulting movement for religious renewal became known as "[[The Christian Community]]". Its work is based on a free relationship to the Christ, without dogma or policies. Its priesthood, which is open to both men and women, is free to preach out of their own spiritual insights and creativity.

Steiner emphasized that the resulting movement for the renewal of Christianity was a personal gesture of help to a movement founded by Rittelmeyer and others independently of his anthroposophical work.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; The distinction was important to Steiner because he sought with Anthroposophy to create a scientific, not [[faith]]-based, spirituality.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; He recognized that for those who wished to find more traditional forms, however, a renewal of the traditional religions was also a vital need of the times.

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has said of Steiner that "Some of his ideas on education – such as educating the handicapped in the mainstream – are worth considering, although his overall plan for developing the spirit and the soul rather than the intellect cannot be admired".&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepdic.com/steiner.html| title= The Skeptic's Dictionary: Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925)|date=12 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2010| author=[[Robert Todd Carroll]]| work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's translators have pointed out that his use of ''Geist'' includes both mind and spirit, however,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Amrine and Konrad Oberhuber (trans.), in Rudolf Steiner, ''The Boundaries of Natural Science'', Spring Valley, NY: Anthroposophic Press. {{ISBN|0-88010-018-4}}. p. 125, fn. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as the German term ''Geist'' can be translated equally properly in either way.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Organized by [[Vitra Design Museum]], the traveling exhibition presented many facets of Steiner's life and achievements, including his influence on architecture, furniture design, dance ([[Eurythmy]]), [[Waldorf education|education]], and agriculture ([[Biodynamic agriculture]]).&lt;ref name=SteinerExhibition&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code//32607416 Rudolf Steiner - Alchemy of the Everyday - Kosmos - A photographic review of the exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition opened in 2011 at the [[Kunstmuseum Stuttgart|Kunstmuseum]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany,&lt;ref name=Kosmos&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19512/1/Paull2011KosmosJBDT.pdf "A Postcard from Stuttgart: Rudolf Steiner's 150th anniversary exhibition 'Kosmos'"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 103 (September ), pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientism ===
{{see also|Anthroposophy#Scientific_basis|l1=Anthroposophy: Scientific basis}}
[[Olav Hammer]] has criticized as [[scientism]] Steiner's claim to use scientific methodology to investigate spiritual phenomena that were based upon his claims of [[clairvoyant]] experience.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; Steiner regarded the observations of spiritual research as more dependable (and above all, consistent) than observations of physical reality. However, he did consider spiritual research to be fallible&lt;ref name=Zander2/&gt;{{rp|p. 618}} and held the view that anyone capable of thinking logically was in a position to correct errors by spiritual researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner: "It may even happen that a researcher who has the power of perception in supersensible realms may fall into error in his logical presentation, and that someone who has no supersensible perception, but who has the capacity for sound thinking, may correct him."[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_c04-01.html Occult Science, Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[Waldorf education]]--&gt; 
Steiner's work includes both universalist, humanist elements and historically influenced racial assumptions.&lt;ref name=Staud&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Staudenmaier|title=Race and Redemption|journal=Nova Religio|publisher=University of California Press|date=February 2008|pages=4ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the contrast and even contradictions between these elements, "whether a given reader interprets Anthroposophy as racist or not depends upon that reader's concerns".&lt;ref name=Zander&gt;"Es hängt dabei von den Interessen der Leser ab, ob die Anthroposophie rassistisch interpretiert wird oder nicht." Helmut Zander, "Sozialdarwinistische Rassentheorien aus dem okkulten Untergrund des Kaiserreichs", in Puschner et al., Handbuch zur "Völkischen Bewegung" 1871–1918: 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner considered that by dint of its shared language and culture, each people has a unique essence, which he called its soul or spirit.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; He saw race as a physical manifestation of humanity's spiritual evolution, and at times discussed race in terms of complex hierarchies that were largely derived from 19th century biology, anthropology, philosophy and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. However, he consistently and explicitly subordinated race, ethnicity, gender, and indeed all hereditary factors, to individual factors in development.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; For Steiner, human individuality is centered in a person's unique biography, and he believed that an individual's experiences and development are not bound by a single lifetime or the qualities of the physical body.&lt;ref name=Ravagli&gt;Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Zanders Erzählungen'', Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8305-1613-2}}, pp. 184f&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically:

* Steiner occasionally characterized specific [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s, nations and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] in ways that have been termed [[racism|racist]] by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Frank, "Einschüchterung auf Waldorf-Art", ''Die Tageszeitung'' 4 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes descriptions by him of certain races and ethnic groups as flowering, others as backward, or destined to degenerate or disappear.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; He presented explicitly hierarchical views of the spiritual evolution of different races,&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Treitel, ''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern'', Johns Hopkins Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-7812-8}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; including—at times, and inconsistently—portraying the [[white race]], [[European culture]] or Germanic culture as representing the high point of human [[evolution]] as of the early 20th century, although he did describe them as destined to be superseded by future cultures.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;
* Throughout his life Steiner consistently emphasized the core spiritual unity of all the world's peoples and sharply criticized racial prejudice. He articulated beliefs that the individual nature of any person stands higher than any racial, ethnic, national or religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;&lt;!--CL, p.55--&gt; His belief that race and [[ethnicity]] are transient and superficial, and not essential aspects of the individual,&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; was partly rooted in his conviction that each individual [[reincarnation|reincarnates]] in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives, and that each of us thus bears within him or herself the heritage of many races and peoples.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Blume, "Joseph Beuys". In Kugler and Baur, ''Rudolf Steiner in Kunst und Architektur'', {{ISBN|3-8321-9012-0}}, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his life, Steiner predicted that race will rapidly lose any remaining significance for future generations.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; In Steiner's view, culture is universal, and explicitly not ethnically based; he saw Goethe and [[German idealism|idealist philosophy]] in particular as the source of ideas that could be drawn upon by any culture, and he vehemently criticized imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Myers, "Colonial consciousness: Rudolf Steiner's Orientalism and German Cultural Identity", ''Journal of European Studies'' 36(4): 387–417&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of his ethical individualism, Steiner considered "race, folk, ethnicity and gender" to be general, describable categories into which individuals may choose to fit, but from which free human beings can and will liberate themselves.&lt;ref name=Ravagli/&gt;

==== Judaism ====
During the years when Steiner was best known as a literary critic, he published a series of articles attacking various manifestations of [[antisemitism]]&lt;ref&gt;''Mitteilungen aus dem Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitismus'', '''11'''(37):307-8, 11 September 1901. [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/abwehr/Blatt_bsb00000905,00315.html Article]. ''Mitteilungen'', '''11'''(38):316, 18 September 1901. [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/abwehr/Blatt_bsb00000905,00324.html Article]. Cf. GA31 for a complete list and text of articles.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticizing some of the most prominent anti-Semites of the time as "barbaric" and "enemies of culture".&lt;ref name=HuH&gt;[http://db.swr.de/upload/manuskriptdienst/wissen/wi20041122_2812.rtf "Hammer und Hakenkreuz – Anthroposophie im Visier der völkischen Bewegung"], ''Südwestrundfunk'', 26 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On a number of occasions, however, Steiner suggested that Jewish cultural and social life had lost all contemporary relevance&lt;ref&gt;Thesenpapier von Dr. Jan Badewien zur Veranstaltung: Antijudaismus bei Rudolf Steiner?, [http://groups.uni-paderborn.de/berufspaedagogik/lehrstuhl/forum-thesen-badewien.html Universität Paderborn], 23.01.02.&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted full [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] of the Jewish people into the nations in which they lived. This stance has come under severe criticism in recent years.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;

Steiner was a critic of his contemporary [[Theodor Herzl]]'s goal of a [[Zionism|Zionist]] state, and indeed of any ethnically determined state, as he considered ethnicity to be an outmoded basis for social life and civic identity.&lt;ref&gt;"The need to overcome nationalism was one of the central themes of [Steiner's] social agenda": Hans-Jürgen Bracker, "The individual and the unity of humankind". in ''Judaism and Anthroposophy'', ed. Fred Paddock and Mado Spiegler. Anthroposophic Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0880105100}}. p. 100. See also "Humanistischer Zionismus", in Novalis 5 (1997): "Steiner generell die allmähliche Überwindung und Auflösung von Stammes-, Volks-, Nationen- und »Rasse«-grenzen vertrat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of Steiner's life and after his death, there were massive defamatory press attacks mounted on him by early [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] leaders (including [[Adolf Hitler]]) and other right-wing nationalists. These criticized Steiner's thought and [[anthroposophy]] as being incompatible with National Socialist racial ideology, and charged him of being influenced by his close connections with Jews and even that he himself was Jewish.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuH/&gt;

==History==
The School of Politics and International Relations at Nottingham was established in 1965 and was initially housed in the old Engineering Building. Richard Pear was the first Professor of Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324050255/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Politics/About-the-School/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics had previously been taught as early as 1959 as part of the Department of Social Science where Politics formed part of a joint degree in Politics and Economics.

In 1971 the Sir Francis Hill chair was established following an endowment from the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company and Frank Stacey, an expert in local government was appointed. In 1981 [[Dennis Kavanagh]] joined the school. Kavanagh is best known for his work on the [[Nuffield Election Studies]]. The School moved to the 'Orchards' Building during the 1980s. Several new degrees were introduced during the 1980s including an MA in Political Economy and Political Culture and a joint BA in Politics and History and an MA in International Relations.

In 1994 the head of department Dr David Regan committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]  and cited his treatment by the University of Nottingham in a suicide note. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/pressure-for-nottingham-suicide-inquiry-continues/98080.article|title=Pressure for Nottingham suicide inquiry continues|date=3 February 1995|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999 moved to the Law and Social Sciences Building (LASS) and changed its name to the ‘School of Politics and International Relations' in 2005.
In 2011 the school gained national media attention following the arrest of two  student one of whom was completing a PhD related to terrorism.  Dr Rod Thornton published a paper critical of the department’s handling of the incident and was subsequently suspended. Thornton later left by “mutual consent”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307143141/http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |archive-date=2014-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===David Regan===
In 1994 the then head of the department [[David Regan (academic)|David Regan]] killed himself in a protest against decisions made by management at the University of Nottingham which he disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/suicide-was-sacrificial-1448829.html|title=Suicide 'was sacrificial'|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University rejected calls for a public inquiry into the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/academics-call-for-inquiry-into-sacrificial-suicide-1571725.html|title=Academics call for inquiry into `sacrificial' suicide|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nottingham Two===
{{main|Nottingham Two}}
The School received international media attention in 2011 when an academic in the department [[Rod Thornton]] published an academic paper critical of the department and the [[University of Nottingham]]'s handling of the arrest of a student called [[Rizwaan Sabir]] who was completing a PhD thesis on terrorism. Mr Sabir downloaded a copy of an Al-Qaeda training manual from a US government website and was wrongly arrested on terrorism charges. The University of Nottingham described the paper as defamatory to a number of Thornton's colleagues in the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-13350702|title=Chomsky concern over 'suspension'|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=18 October 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton later apologized for inaccuracies in his paper and left his job by mutual consent.

===Miwa Hirono visa controversy===
In 2015 [[Times Higher Education]] reported that the Home Office had refused a visa for the academic [[Miwa Hirono]], an expert on Chinese foreign policy,  on the basis she had spent around 200 days in the past five years resident in China researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Matthew Humphrey, head of Nottingham’s School of Politics and International Relations said that the policy was “vindictive and bone-headed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/visa-refusal-for-china-expert-miwa-hirono-is-pure-madness/2019182.article#.VQo4JuTMIac.twitter|title=Visa refusal for China expert Miwa Hirono is ‘pure madness’|date=19 March 2015|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[School uniform]]''' is a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the [[Christ's Hospital]] school in London in 1552 was the first [[school]] to use a uniform for its [[student]]s.&lt;ref&gt;see https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29047752&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ordered the wearing of the ''cappa clausa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite  book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of wearing school uniform has been adopted by many other countries, and is now common in many parts of the world. Uniforms can be regarded as promoting social equality among students and an [[esprit de corps]], but have also been criticised for promoting a form of uniformity characteristic of militarism.

The decision as to whether to implement school uniform policy or not is a controversial one and also polarised in societies and countries. In countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa and a number of Asian nations, school children have to wear approved school uniforms that conform to the uniform policy of their school. In modern Europe, Britain and Ireland stand out as the only countries where school uniform is widely adopted by state schools and generally supported by national and local governments, although there is no legislation governing school uniform in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Australia ==
[[File:Barack Obama at Campbell High School.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3| Former U.S. President Obama with students at an Australian school in 2011.]]
In Australia, each school or school system can set its own uniform policy. Wearing a uniform is compulsory in most Australian private and all Catholic schools, as well as in most public schools, although it is sometimes less enforced in primary schools that have uniforms. Uniforms usually have a color scheme based on the school colors. Uniform and appearance are generally strictly enforced in private and Catholic schools, although public schools are beginning to become increasingly strict about their uniforms. Most, if not all, public and private schools have the school logo incorporated in the uniform ensemble, typically on the necktie and the blazer breast pocket.

For boys, the uniforms generally include a button-up or polo shirt with either [[short pants|shorts]] (especially for summer wear) or long trousers, usually in grey or navy blue or the school colour. Some schools allow boys to wear shorts only in younger years, and they must wear long trousers once they are a senior (17-18). At others, even older boys wear shorts in summer due to the heat.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.dobsons.com.au/static_site/pdf/St%20Kevins%20College.pdf School uniform price list] making a distinction between summer uniform and winter uniform.&lt;/ref&gt; Where short trousers are to be worn, socks in school colors (more commonly white) are often required. Girls' uniforms generally include a checkered or striped dress (usually sleeveless or short-sleeved) worn over a blouse for summer and, in most secondary schools, girls wear a skirt as well as a button-up or polo shirt in winter with a blazer and tie. In a number of schools, girls are also permitted to wear a button-up or polo shirt and dark trousers.

In public schools, the uniform is usually a polo shirt for juniors and a different one for seniors and  trousers or skirt. This set may be complemented by a school [[necktie]] and, typically, a v-neck jumper (pullover or sweater) or a blazer. In the summer, boys usually do not wear ties, pullovers, or blazers. Instead, they wear a short-sleeved version of the shirt and short trousers. A neck-tie, blazer, and hat are also common in private and Catholic schools.

In most high schools a PE uniform is the norm for sports days only. At many high schools, children are required to change into and out of their PE uniform around the PE lesson. The PE uniform usually consists of shorts and a polo shirt, as well as a light weatherproof rain jacket (mainly at private or Catholic schools), usually made of polyester, for winter and wet weather and sometimes a netball skirt for girls. It is common for students in their final year of primary school or secondary school to have their own jersey, jumper or jacket to denote their final-year status.

== Brazil ==

There is no legal requirement for school uniforms in Brazil. On a state-by-state or city-by-city basis, governments may issue uniforms to public school pupils but may not require their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/educacao/um%20em%20cada%20quatro%20alunos%20de%20escola%20estadual%20recebe%20uniforme/n1238146989999.html|title=Um em cada quatro alunos de escola estadual recebe uniforme|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private schools are free to set their own uniform policy.

Brazilian school uniforms can vary widely by school. There are many schools that opt for a more elegant outfit, while others opt for a simpler one (social shirt, shorts). Some schools use "intelligent uniforms" embedded with locator chips that allow computers to automatically record whether pupils have arrived in school or not. If pupils do not turn up for school or classes, an automated message is sent to inform the parents accordingly. The benefit of the automated system is to curb absenteeism and class skipping. &lt;ref&gt;see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23rfid-chip-brazil-student_n_1374886.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this country, where schools have set a uniform, it is the student's obligation to wear it.

Most schools in Brazil choose the use of uniforms. The average Brazilian school uniform for boys is a T-shirt with the school's logo, sweatpants or bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt or hoodie. The uniform for girls is very similar, but instead leggings or short shorts are worn, although ballerina pants are also highly popular. Younger girls may have the choice to wear a skirts with shorts underneath. Most schools require sneakers.

== Burundi ==

School uniforms are compulsory for school children in [[Burundi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.org/projects/2112-educational-for-street-children-in-burundi|title=Bildungschancen für Straßenkinder in Burundi|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burundi, like most African countries, has a compulsory school uniform policy. Burundi's school uniform policy dates back to the colonial days. During those days, chiefs' sons wore a white uniform and all other children wore khaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/2008/Burundi.pdf|title=IIEP UNESCO|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform policy is still in force in Burundi to date. However, schools decide on what uniform the pupils wear. It is also argued that the cost of buying the school uniform and poverty, especially in the rural areas, negatively affect school enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine-burundi-terimbere.com/contact/school-uniform-and-little-sun.html|title=SCHOOL UNIFORM AND LITTLE SUN|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cambodia ==
[[File:Écoliers au Cambodge.jpg|thumb|School children wearing uniforms in [[Cambodia]]]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
In Cambodia, students of all ages (pre-school to college) wear school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctnz.org.nz/education-projects|title=- The Cambodia Charitable Trust|date=13 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniforms differ by school and age level. Generally, boys wear a white dress shirt and a pair of shorts. The colour and length of the shorts varies at each school.  Male college students wear the same kind of uniform, but instead of shorts, they wear black dress trousers. Girls usually wear white blouses and a skirt. Their skirts vary in colour and length depending upon the school and their ages. Generally, the younger students wear long skirts that almost reach their ankles and older students, particularly in college, wear shorter ones. Skirts are generally blue or black but may be other colours as well, depending on the school. Some schools also have alternative uniforms which students of both genders wear every other day. These often consist of a coloured shirt and slacks. High school girls must wear black or blue long skirts. High school boys wear long black or blue trousers. The white shirt can be short-sleeved or long-sleeved for both genders. High school students are also required to wear name tags on the left hand side of their shirts.

==Canada==
[[File:Maison Piacente highschool uniforms.jpg|thumb|right|Highschool uniforms on sale at a warehouse store in [[Montreal, Quebec]].]]
In Canada, school uniforms are not required in most public schools or [[separate schools]], except in exceptional circumstances such as school performances or international field trips. However, the majority of Catholic high schools in [[southern Ontario]] (Grade 9-12) do require uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/2010/01/19/st-marys-committee-asks-parents-about-uniforms&lt;/ref&gt; These uniforms generally have long- or short-sleeved shirts with the school logo or crest near the collar and trousers or kilted skirts. Schools often allow girls the option of choosing to wear the skirt or trousers. Some schools also mandate dress shoes and a particular type and length of socks to go with the uniform. A cardigan sweater, vest, or blazer may be part of the ensemble, particularly in winter. Additionally, as of 2011, the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] has implemented an ''Appropriate Dress Code'' of navy blue and white in all elementary separate schools which do not already have their own uniforms.&lt;ref name=TCDSB&gt;{{cite web|title=Dress Code in TCDSB Schools|url=https://www.tcdsb.org/FORPARENTS/DressCode/Pages/default.aspx|website=TCDSB|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniforms are used in most private schools, and also in special or alternative programs of public and Catholic schools, such as the Traditional Learning Centres, a program that takes a [[liberal arts]] approach, while focusing on high levels of academic excellence. In [[Quebec]], most metropolitan anglophone school boards require a uniform.

== Chile ==

{{Main article|Chilean school uniform}}
In Chile, most schools have a uniform.

Until 1930, it was uncommon for students to wear a uniform. Under the government of [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], all students became obliged to wear a school uniform. During the administration of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], a unified uniform was introduced for all public and private schools and other education centers. Today, these uniforms have disappeared in private schools, who prefer to use a customised one.

== China ==
[[File:School uniforms in China - 03.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese high school students in their summer school uniforms.]]
Uniforms are a common part of the schools in China. Almost all secondary schools as well as some elementary schools require students to wear uniforms. Uniforms in mainland China usually consist of five sets: 2 formal sets and 3 everyday sets. A formal set is worn on Mondays or special occasions (school anniversaries, school ceremonies, etc.) They consist of a white collared shirt with a sweater on top and a skirt for girls or a suit for boys. There is one formal set for summer and one set for winter. Everyday uniforms for boys in the winter usually consist of a zippered [[sweater]] and trousers and a collared shirt (usually white). Thinner materials are worn in the spring and fall and short or long trousers may be worn in the summer. The everyday uniforms for girls are very similar to the boys' uniform. It is relatively common for there to be some kind of sponsored advertisement on some non-formal school uniform shirts, though this trend has fluctuated in recent years.

== Colombia ==
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Colombian primary school students with their teacher.]]
In Colombia, all students are required to wear uniforms in public and private schools. Uniforms in Colombia consist of two sets, one for everyday use and a sports one for physical education. Everyday uniforms for girls generally include a knee-length skirt, a white T-shirt with a vest, and white calf-length socks. For boys, the uniform generally includes dark-coloured long trousers and a short- or long-sleeved shirt. The shoes for both girls and boys are black lace-up shoes (sometimes the shoes may be dark blue or wine-coloured, depending on the uniform colours) and the shirts usually have the school's symbol at the left side. The sports uniform includes sweat pants, a collared T-shirt, and white sports shoes. The designs and the colours of the uniforms depend on the school's colours and the principal's preference.

== El Salvador ==
[[File:Independencia desfile Santa Tecla 2012.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Salvadoran school students celebrating independence day]]
In El Salvador, all students from public schools  and private schools are required to wear uniforms.  Uniforms vary depending on the school.

== France ==

Since 1968, uniforms have not been enforced in French schools, with a few exceptions (such as [[Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur]], les Écoles TUNON, and Vatel).  [[Xavier Darcos]], a former teacher and [[Department of Education|Minister of Education]] from 2007 to 2009, is an advocate of the reintroduction of uniforms:  "This is not outrageous. This removes the visible differences in social status or wealth. This is an additional factor of integration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2009/01/17/525744-Darcos-ressort-l-uniforme-du-placard.html|title=Darcos ressort l'uniforme du placard|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2012, the students of the Boarding School of Excellence [[Sourdun]] wear a uniform with the insignia of their establishment.

Les lycées de la défense, formerly known as [[Military school#France|military schools]], require their students to wear uniforms.  At some universities, the [[academic dress]] is becoming popular.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the [[French Antilles]] ([[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]), as well as French Guiana, a uniform has been required since September 2008.

== Germany ==

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Waldgrundschule Schulkleidung.jpg|thumb|German school children wearing voluntary "Schulkleidung" (2009).]]

There is no tradition of wearing school uniforms in Germany, and today, almost all students of state schools, private schools or universities do not wear school uniforms. However, certain garments have been common to students in former times:

From the 16th century, students (especially of secondary or grammar schools and similar institutions) were often subject to regulations that prescribed, for example, modest and not too stylish attire. In many cases these regulations were part of wider laws concerning the clothing of all citizens of certain social classes.

A blue coat became a widespread obligatory status symbol of students of secondary schools; it fell out of use during the latter half of the 18th century. In more recent times, school uniforms in any real sense did not exist outside of convent schools and private boarding schools. At times, certain fashions became so widespread that they approached uniform status; this is true in particular for so-called student hats (''Schülermützen'') that became widespread from the 1880s on and remained somewhat popular until they were banned by the Nazis. Their wearing was advocated by teachers and the students themselves and occasionally made mandatory, but never on a national or statewide level. Another instance are the [[sailor suits]] that became fashionable around the turn of the 19th century. These, too, were not usually a prescribed uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Handbuch der Geschichte des Bayerischen Bildungswesens
| author = M. Freyer
| chapter = Geschichte der Schulkleidung
| editor = H. Liedtke
| pages = 273 ff.
| volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis banned student hats – the last remaining, if voluntary, form of unified student clothing – because they considered them an attribute of class society. They did, however, institute mandatory membership in the uniformed [[Hitler Youth]] (''HJ'') from 1936 until their fall. HJ uniforms were worn in the HJ training academies and in the [[National Political Institutes of Education|Napolas]]; students of other schools sometimes wore them to school at their own discretion.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In recent times, the introduction of school uniforms has been discussed, but usually the expression "uniform" (the word is the same in German) is avoided in favour of terms like "school clothing" ("Schulkleidung"). School clothing has been introduced in a small number of schools, for example in [[Hamburg]]-Sinstorf in 2000, and in [[Friesenheim (Baden)|Friesenheim]] and [[Haag in Obb|Haag (Oberbayern)]] in 2005. In these cases the clothes are collections of shirts, sweaters, and the like, catering to contemporary fashion senses. Uniforms in a more traditional sense are almost never proposed in earnest.

The debate on mandatory school uniforms intensified in Germany when two Muslim girls dressed in burkas arrived at a school in Bonn in 2006. The girls' actions were interpreted as political action and were subsequently suspended from school. Then-Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries  in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag stated that the simple solution to the issue under consideration is mandatory introduction of school uniforms for boys and girls across Germany. She further argued that school uniforms would help to prevent conflicts arising from religious or political differences.  Her stance was supported by then-Minister Of Education Annette Schavan. The proposal was met with opposition from the teacher union and opposition political parties. The teacher union argued that school uniforms are not the solution for integration problems nor the issue of fashion obsession. The leader of the teacher union  Heinz-Peter Meidinger also added that the school uniforms have been a controversial issue in Germany over the years.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4753623.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - School uniform row grips Germany|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to school uniforms===
A senior member of the Green Party, Krista Sager, also said that the introduction of school uniforms would be unacceptable state interference in religious matters. She then proposed that individual schools have to find their own solutions and rejected solutions imposed by government. She further noted that school uniforms are no longer up to date and their imposition would be rejected by the current generation of students. The Conference of Education Ministers, a body which decides on school policies, also kicked back against school uniforms. They cited historical reasons dating back to WWII with memories of Hitler Youth's uniform still fresh in people's minds. They also concluded that the imposition of school uniforms would be excessive government encroachment on personal liberty of pupils and parents.&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/in-germany-veiled-students-stir-up-uniform-debate/a-1996295|title=In Germany, Veiled Students Stir Up Uniform Debate - Germany - DW.COM - 08.05.2006|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, a number of schools sell branded clothing that can be worn as a sign of school pride.&lt;ref name="dw.de"/&gt;

The [[Bildungsstreik]] movement fights against school uniforms due to their belief that it represents some kind of [[militarism]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Ghana students.jpg|thumb|left| Students in [[Ghana]] wearing their uniform]]

All children have to wear school uniforms in [[Ghana]]. Pupils in public schools have the same type of school uniform with the school's emblem is imprinted on the left chest. This helps to distinguish pupils of one school from the other. Private schools determine which uniforms their pupils wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4690000/newsid_4697700/4697717.stm |title=Worksheets: My school is linked with Africa |date=19 July 2005 |work=CBBC Newsround |publisher =BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201012210852.html |title= North Tongu District Distributes Free School Uniforms, Exercise Books to 40 Schools |work =The Ghanaian Chronicle |location =Accra |date=18 December 2010 |author= Agebewode, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/globalcafe/peacecorps/ghana/ghana_nicholas5.html |title= Nicholas's Story |publisher=PBS |work=NewsHour |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana like most African countries is characterised by low incomes and high levels of poverty. Hence the cost of school uniforms acts as one of the barriers to educational access.  In an effort to achieve universal primary education the government, as part of its educational policy, initiated free school uniform distribution throughout the country in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Ghana/Ghana_MDG_Report_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to government data, a total of 170,221 pupils were supplied with free school uniforms in 2013 and it planned to supply 10,000 uniforms in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/2012-02-08-08-24-49/ministry-of-education&lt;/ref&gt; There are public programs to offer poor families financial help to buy uniforms. Over 8,000 school uniforms have been distributed by the government to needy students in the communities from the Tarkwa Nsuaem municipality, one of the mining districts in Ghana, which is severely affected by poverty. This is part of a program instituted in 2010 to supply disadvantaged  children with school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/ghana-education:-over-8,000-school-uniforms-distributed-to-pupils-of-tarkwa-nsuaem-201102111143.html |title= Over 8,000 school uniforms distributed to pupils of Tarkwa Nsuaem |date= 10 February 2011 |work= The Ghanaian Chronicle |location= Accra |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120606164557/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/ghana-education:-over-8,000-school-uniforms-distributed-to-pupils-of-tarkwa-nsuaem-201102111143.html |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hong Kong ==

[[File:Cheungsamuniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Cheongsam]] as School Uniform. Note- uniform is plain - markings are [[signatures]] of owner's classmates.]]
The vast majority of schools in the former British colony adopted uniforms similar to that of British schools, while Catholic schools in Hong Kong usually follow the tradition of  [[Catholic school uniform]]s. A number of older Christian girls' schools established before WWII, however, retain the heritage of using the Chinese [[cheongsam]] as their uniform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/hsc/evrev/cheungsam.htm|title=Evolution and revolution: Chinese dress 1700s-1990s - Cheungsam|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[St. Stephen's Girls' College]], [[True Light Middle School of Hong Kong|True Light Middle School]] and [[Heep Yunn School]]. [[Sailor suit]]s are also used as uniforms in some kindergartens for boys and girls, and secondary schools but for girls only, for example the [[Bishop Hall Jubilee School]] and [[New Method College]].

== India ==

[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|upright|Schoolgirls in Delhi, India. As seen here, Indian schoolgirls can have uniform of both shirt and skirt, as well as ''[[shalwar kameez]]''.]]
Uniforms are compulsory in India in both public and private schools. The boys' uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually blue, white or black, and those of the girls are often a shirt and a skirt. At the state level, the secondary schools are required to use a [[Shalwar Kameez]]. This is not compulsory but they do have certain specific dress code.

Many schools require students to wear shoes, ties and ID cards, and comb their hair down and keep it clean and short. Long hair is tied in braids. Uniform is one of the most important components of school life and is taken very seriously in India.

Some institutions also require the use of a tie, especially the schools run by [[Christian]] missionaries, and the Indian government does not prohibit the children to have religious symbols, so the [[Muslim]] girls can wear the veil (hijab) ([[burqa|burka]]) and [[Sikh]] boys a [[turban]] in addition to the uniform. However, most of the schools, whether public or private, prohibit students to have a ponytail or dyed hair.

== Indonesia ==

In [[Indonesia]], school uniforms are mandatory for every student. They can be simply described as below for each stage of education:
[[File:Anak SD di Ciwidey.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|An elementary school student.]]
* Primary schools or ''Sekolah Dasar'' (''SD'') students wear a white short-sleeve shirt with red shorts for male students, and below-knee skirts for females.
* Lower secondary schools or ''Sekolah Menengah Pertama'' (''SMP'') require navy blue shorts or trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt for male students. Females wear a below-knee-length or long navy blue skirt and short-sleeve white shirt.
* Upper secondary schools ''Sekolah Menengah Atas'' (''SMA'') require blue-grey trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt. Females wear a below-knee-length or long blue-grey skirt, and wear short-sleeve or long-sleeve white shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pendidikan.jogja.go.id/index.php?pilih=hal&amp;id=9|title=Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Education: School Uniforms|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Public schools in Indonesia tolerate religious freedoms. For example, [[Muslim]] girls may opt to wear long-sleeve shirts, longer skirts, and [[jilbab]] to cover their heads. Most schools in Indonesia also have a [[batik]] uniform, usually worn on Thursday or Friday. This kind of uniform consists of a batik short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt, with long or short trousers for SMA and below-knee or long skirts for females. The motifs and colours of batik depend on the school. Some schools tend to issue neckties and/or vests for their students. These neckties and vests may vary from school to school in colour and sewing pattern, even among public schools.

Nowadays, with the increase of private schools in Indonesia, most private schools have their own signature school uniform. Most consist of shirts with shorts or trousers for males, and skirts for females, only with differences on the colour.

Every school has its own standard grooming. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Accessories are also normally prohibited for males, except for watches. Females are usually allowed to use simple accessories such as watches, earrings, and sometimes bracelets. All students are prohibited from colouring their hair or having tattoos.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Wearing nail polish is usually not allowed.

Most schools pay attention to the shoes that can be worn. Black or white sneakers with white laces are the most common shoes. Few higher-level students, such as in ''SMA'' or ''SMK'', are normally required to wear black leather shoes.

The school badge is usually put on the right sleeve of a shirt, consist of school's name and location, and some have their own school's logo. Others prefer to wear the school's logo as a lapel or breast plastic or metal pin. The emblem of OSIS (''Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah''), or School's Intern Student Organization, is put on the shirt's left pocket. Students' names are usually on the right side of the shirt and embedded by sewing, ironing or as a detachable badge. Some schools (usually "SMP" and "SMA") distinguish the grade of their students by stripes on the official neckties issued or an emblem below the school emblem (it can be stripes, chevrons or numbers). Nowadays some schools require the students to wear an Indonesian flag school badge sewn on top of their left pocket. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The [[scouts]] (pramuka) uniform is used in many schools in Indonesia at least once a week. It consists of light-brown short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts, with dark-brown shorts or trousers, and below-knee skirts or longer for females. The common day to wear the scout uniform usually falls on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. Furthermore, on certain occasions (usually on ceremonies or competitions), the uniform should be worn as full dress, with red and white scarf/necktie, dark brown beret, rope, dagger and scout's stick.

The scout uniform has two breast pockets. Above right pocket is the student's name. The [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]] (Indonesian Scout Movement) logo is sewn on the left pocket (for male students). On the right sleeve there are scouting organization's location, number and logo, while on the left sleeve usually are the student's scouting team logo and chevrons denoting his/her grade. Male students wear International Scout Organization logo above their name and female students on their lapel.

== Israel ==

According to former Education Minister [[Limor Livnat]], about 1,400 Israeli public schools require pupils to wear uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111 Israel QA File news, Israel diplomatic map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403111140/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=111 |date=2009-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

School uniforms used to be the norm in the state's early days, but have since fallen out of favour. However, in recent years, the number of schools using school uniforms has been increasing once more. Many teachers, parents and students are in favour of returning the school uniform to common use to prevent the deepening of the gap between affluent children and those less well-off. Nowadays school uniforms are mainly associated with "national religious" schools within the [[Education in Israel|Israeli system of education]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zvi Zameret, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/Fifty%20Years%20of%20Education%20in%20the%20State%20of%20Israel ''Fifty Years of Education in the State of Israel''], Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools for [[Arab citizens of Israel]]  also frequently require uniforms: for girls, it is often a [[pinafore]] to be worn over trousers and shirt.

In the [[Haredi]] or ultra-Orthodox school system, uniforms are compulsory in essentially all girls' schools. In the vast majority of these, the style adopted by the [[Bais Yaakov|Beit Ya'akov]] network is used: a sky-blue, button-down, open-collar, loose-fitting blouse with an Oxford-blue, pleated skirt which comes to just below the knee and dark stockings. In cold weather, a Yale-blue sweater may be added. A small fraction of schools alter the color scheme to pink and burgundy, while otherwise retaining the same overall appearance. In boys' schools there is usually not an identifiable school uniform, distinct from what is considered acceptable for ordinary street wear. However, the standards of acceptable street wear for boys and men in Haredi communities are so precise and exacting that in almost all cases all of the boys in a particular school will be dressed identically.

In non-Haredi schools today, school uniforms in Israel consist only of a shirt with the school logo. In the summer, the uniform shirt is a simple T-shirt, while in the winter, the shirts worn are warm or hooded sweaters. Although the shirts are uniform, they usually come in various colours, and allow students to customise and express themselves even while wearing a uniform. The shirts sell for a very small amount of money, so that even the less well-off can acquire them.

== Italy ==

In Italy, school uniforms are uncommon, partially because child uniforms are associated with the era of [[Benito Mussolini]] before World War II when children were placed according to their age into [[Italian Fascist]] youth movements and had to wear uniforms inside and outside school.

However, until the early 1960s many high schools required girls to wear black ''grembiule'' (resembling a doctor smock) on top of their clothes: no uniform was required for boys. Perhaps this was because at one time high schools were the only public schools to admit both sexes (as opposed to junior schools and elementary), and girls may be required to "cover up" not to distract their male counterparts. Indeed, this policy was highly disputed during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s and later abolished.

Nowadays, many pre-schools advise parents to dress their children with a ''grembiulino'', i.e., a small ''grembiule'', usually shorter and more colourful, that can be purchased cheaply.

Some elementary schools advise some kind of ''grembiule'' for the younger pupils. Sometimes girls are required to wear a pink or white ''grembiulino'', while boys may be required to wear a short cotton jacket, usually blue or black. In other cases both boys and girls may be required to wear a more neutral blue ''grembiule''.

Some parents send their children to school in a ''grembiule'' even if the school does not require it.

Poet and children's writer [[Gianni Rodari]] has described adult life as "a school without ''grembiule'' and school desk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi "la scuola dei grandi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120550/http://tuttomio.splinder.com/post/10825033/la+scuola+dei+grandi |date=2011-07-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the Italian chapter of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] warned that synthetic ''grembiuli'' were harmful to pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573 "WWF: attenti ai tessuti di grembiuli e abitini per bambini"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821185319/http://www.vita.it/articolo/index.php3?NEWSID=47573# |date=2006-08-21 }}, ''VITA'' magazine, 13 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008 Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini proposed the re-introduction of the compulsory smock in public schools, provoking a debate in the Italian press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6137276 |title= Students Protest as Italian Senate Passes Reforms |work=ABC News |location =New York |date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japan ==
{{main article|Japanese school uniform}}

[[file:制服 (5346443876).jpg|thumb|[[Arashiyama]] schoolgirls in [[loose socks]]]]
Japan introduced school uniforms in the late 19th century. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems. They are also used in some women's colleges. The Japanese word for uniform is {{Nihongo|''seifuku''|制服}}.

In the majority of elementary schools, students are not required to wear a uniform to school. Where they are required, many boys wear white shirts, short trousers, and caps. Young boys often dress more formally in their class pictures than they do other days of the school year. Girls' uniforms might include a grey pleated skirt and white blouse. Occasionally the sailor outfit is used for girls. The uniform codes may vary by season to work with the environment and occasion. It is common for  boys and girls to wear brightly coloured caps to prevent traffic accidents. It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas. However, this is going out of fashion and many students are wearing casual dress.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Japanese junior- and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a [[Gakuran|military style]] for boys and a [[Japanese school uniform#Sailor outfit|sailor outfit]] for girls. These uniforms are based on [[Meiji era]] formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfit replace the undivided [[hakama]] (andon bakama 行灯袴) designed by [[Utako Shimoda]] between 1920 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~kaibara-hs/gaiyo/100nen/33.htm|title=制服でたどる百年|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this style is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern [[parochial school]] uniform styles. They consist of a white shirt, tie, [[blazer]] or [[sweater vest]] with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same colour as the blazer or sweater vest) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and [[tartan]] skirt for girls.

Much like the male uniform, the [[gakuran]], the sailor outfit bears a similarity to military-styled [[naval]] uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a [[blouse]] attached with a sailor-style collar and a [[pleat]]ed [[skirt]]. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include [[necktie]]s, [[bolo tie]]s, [[neckerchief]]s, and bows. Common colours are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black.
[[File:ギリギリ短 (15580964194).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] culture: [[Miniskirt]] used as school uniform in Japan, including during winter season.]]

Shoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. The socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black [[penny loafer]]s. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as [[loose socks]], knee-length stockings, or similar) are commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits.

Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version (usually consisting of a white dress shirt and dark slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and shorts for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of their school, students may wear seasonal and activity uniforms in the same classroom during the day. Students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing them incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large [[loose socks]] or badges.

Miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the [[Kogal]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/11/12/business/man-who-gave-us-loose-white-socks-eyes-comeback/|title=Man who gave us loose white socks eyes comeback|first=Taiga|last=Uranaka|date=12 November 2003|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html|title=Japan's schoolgirls set the trend|date=23 November 1997|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lebanon ==

In Lebanon, all private schools require uniforms. Most of the uniforms are made of a skirt, a shirt, and a pull-over for girls, and for boys it's made of trousers, a shirt, and a pull-over.

== Malaysia ==
{{main article|Malaysian school uniform}}
In [[Malaysia]], school uniforms ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Pakaian Seragam Sekolah'') are compulsory for all students who attend public schools. Western-style school uniforms were introduced to present-day Malaysia in the late 19th century during the British colonial era. The present design was standardised beginning in January 1970. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems.

The uniforms at Malaysian public schools are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 1997. ''Surat Pekeliling lkhtisas Bil. 3/1983 - Pakaian Seragam Murid-murid Sekolah''. Retrieved 4 June 2007. Available online at http://www.pibg.net.my/pekeliling.e.php&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malaysia Primary School Girls.jpg|thumb|Malaysian school girls in tunics]]

Students are required to wear white socks and white shoes with the above uniform. For modesty reasons, most schools require female students who wear the [[baju kurung]] to wear a plain-coloured [[camisole]] underneath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabah.edu.my/smkperempuan_sdk/peraturan_sekolah.pdf SMK Perempuan Sandakan.

In addition to these, schools usually have badges which must be sewn or ironed on to the uniform &amp;mdash; generally at the left chest. Some schools require students to sew their name tags in addition to the badge. For upper forms, students generally have to wear a school-specific tie, except those who are wearing the baju kurung.

In Malaysia, Muslim girls tend to wear the baju kurung. Most of them start wearing a white ''tudung'' (Malaysian version of the Muslim headscarf or hijab) upon entering secondary school, for religious reasons. Non-Muslim girls tend to wear the pinafore. Some non-Muslim girls wear the baju kurung.
[[File:Sandakan Sabah School-boys-in-their-school-uniform-01.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian secondary school boys uniform.]]
Muslim boys may wear [[baju melayu]] at school on Fridays, often with a [[songkok]] hat, to be dressed for going to the mosque for prayers at lunchtime.

Girls who choose to wear the pinafore, especially those attending co-ed schools, usually wear shorts under their pinafore to allow for carefree movement as the skirt only covers up to the knee. Those who wear the baju kurung tend not to wear shorts under their long skirt as their skirt covers their legs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[Neckties]] are often worn by prefects, class monitors, librarians, and other students of rank. Some schools have neckties as standard issue; even then, the neckties are generally reserved for school events and public appearances, and are not part of the everyday school uniform. The tropical climate makes them uncomfortable.

The [[hairstyle]] of students is given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pibg.net.my/pekeliling.e.php Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 1997. ''Surat Pekeliling lkhtisas Bil. 2/1976 - Potongan Rambut Murid-murid']'. Retrieved 5 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools do not allow students to colour their hair. For boys, there is usually a maximum length allowed, for example, the hair must be a few centimetres above the collar, and no sideburns are allowed. Violation of boys' hair regulations is often punished with a [[caning]]; some offer the alternative of an enforced haircut at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/mysc9808.htm "Students get a trimming from their peers"], ''The Star'', Kuala Lumpur, 12 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[hair gel]] is prohibited in some of the stricter schools, to prevent excessive hairdressing. Girls' long hair must be properly tied up, often into a [[ponytail]]. Some schools dictate the colour and type of hair accessories that can be used. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair. Wearing [[make up]] in school is prohibited.

Schools usually enforce their uniform code thoroughly, with regular checks by teachers and prefects. Students who fail to comply may be warned, given demerit points, publicly punished, sent home from school, or [[School corporal punishment|caned]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ppk.kpm.my/article.cfm?id=110 Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 2003.

School uniforms in Mauritius are generally compulsory. Mauritius being a former British colony, has been using the system from back then. The students have to wear uniforms from primary school until higher secondary level. However, there are a few private schools that are based on the French system and do not require the student to wear school uniform.

In Mexico, students from all public (and most private) schools are required to wear uniform (except on special days and/or occasions like holidays in which the school allows students to wear normal clothing rather than the uniform). The uniforms have the school's logo and colors. Most Mexican schools have 2 types of uniforms; one for P.E. and another for regular school days. Uniforms usually consist of the following (but may vary by school):
* '''Regular''' 
** '''Boys'''
*** Polo shirt
**** Vest or sweater
**** Cloth pants
**** Socks
**** Shoes
** '''Girls'''
*** Polo shirt
*** Vest or sweater
*** Pleated skirt (plaid most of the time)

Traditionally, many New Zealand [[Middle school|intermediate]] and [[high school]]s, and [[state-integrated school|state-integrated]] and private [[primary school]]s, have followed the British system of school uniforms,&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Webster, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cos/2008/00000042/00000001/art00012 "New Zealand School Uniforms in the Era of Democracy: 1965 to 1975"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024010817/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cos/2008/00000042/00000001/art00012 |date=2012-10-24 }} in ''Costume'', Volume 42, Number 1, 2008 , pp. 169-183 (15).&lt;/ref&gt; although it is common in state schools for the boy's uniform to have a jersey and grey [[short trousers]] rather than a blazer with tie and long trousers. This usually consists of a variety of the following apparel: for boys, a business-style shirt with an official school tie, and long or short trousers; and for girls, a blouse, and a plain and/or [[Plaid (pattern)|plaid]] (usually [[tartan]]) skirt, and in some schools, especially in the [[South Island]], kilts. Both sexes wear an 'official' school jersey. Blazers and jackets are of varied colours according to the school - dark or light blue, grey, crimson, scarlet, green or black. Some follow the British practice of having contrasting colours edging the lapels and jacket fronts. Caps have generally been discarded since the 1970s but in many primary schools there is a compulsory broad-brimmed floppy hat, in the school colours, to help prevent sunburn. Where short trousers are worn, boys are usually required to wear long dark socks, which may require garters to hold them up.&lt;ref&gt;Pictured at [http://histclo.com/Schun/hist/schun-hist.html The History of School Uniforms].&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 an increasing number of school include sandals as the standard summer footwear.

During the 1980s and 1990s there was a tendency for the traditional uniform to be replaced by cheaper and more 'modern' options: [[polo shirt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.lphs.school.nz/files/Uniform.pdf Uniform rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529200611/http://www.lphs.school.nz/files/Uniform.pdf |date=2009-05-29 }} at Logan Park High School.&lt;/ref&gt; [[polar fleece]] tops, or a complete doing away with uniforms in favour of mufti. Intermediate schools usually provide the option of skirts or culottes for girls and sometimes shorts while boys will wear shorts. Bike shorts or tights are sometimes worn under girls' skirts and dresses.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some high schools have introduced trousers as an option for girls instead of skirts, however demand is low with several [[Christchurch]] high schools estimating only 1% of girls at their respective schools wear trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/6020025/Are-school-uniforms-too-short |title= Are school uniforms too short? |work= [[Stuff.co.nz]] |first= Jane |last= Dunbar |date= 24 November 2011 |accessdate= 15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pakistan ==
[[File:Schoolgirls in Shalwar Kameez, Abbotabad Pakistan - UK International Development.jpg|thumb|left|Schoolgirls in [[Pakistan]]|278x278px]]
The school uniforms are compulsory in most schools in Pakistan. Both the public and the private schools have mandated uniforms. Boys uniforms are often made of a light-coloured shirt, long trousers usually brown or blue. The girls often wear Shalwar Qameez suit or in some schools shirt and skirt.

==Philippines==

School uniforms ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''uniporme'' or ''kasuotang pampaaralan'', "school attire"), much like Mexico, are commonplace in public schools and required in private schools. In some private schools, there are specified days when students can wear civilian clothing, typically in special occasions like a holiday or last day of school. There is usually no uniform in universities and progressive schools except for uniforms used in P.E classes, and in specific schools such as the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

Public school uniforms for primary levels are typically white, short-sleeved, buttoned-up shirts, with long skirts for girls and light brown knee-length trousers for boys. Uniforms for public high schools and private schools vary widely in pattern and colour, but most often are in the official school  colours. Muslim girls in some higher institutions are often required to wear a white [[hijab]] versus other colours. Some school uniforms in the Philippines can bare resemblance to Japanese school uniforms 

The material for these usually loose uniforms is often light and suited to the country's tropical climate (e.g. cotton).

In 2008, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] ordered that students are no longer required to wear uniforms. This was to allow poorer families to save money for basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deped.gov.ph/index.php/issuances/deped-orders/2008/document/dos200846pdf?limit=20&amp;format=raw&amp;start=20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080603-140499/DepEd-No-more-uniforms-for-public-school-students&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==

School uniforms are not compulsory in Poland and absent from the vast majority of Polish schools. The idea of school uniforms in Poland did not exist before the early 20th century. In the [[People's Republic of Poland]], uniform ceased to be compulsory in most schools during the 1980s due to economic issues. Since then, there has been made only one effort to reintroduce uniform into Polish schools - by the former minister of education [[Roman Giertych]], in 2006. It was then decided that school uniform would not be enforced by the state onto the whole country, but would be a matter decided upon by the [[head teacher|principal]] of each school respectively. Initially this was meant to permit only a [[dress code]], but this was later modified in 2007 to address school uniform. From 2007, all [[primary school]]s and [[Gimnazjum#Countries with gymnasium schools|middle schools]] were to enforce compulsory uniform, whilst [[Liceum#Poland|high schools]] and other forms of further education were given the choice to decide on their own. The appearance of school uniform was decided upon locally, which meant that "uniform" in most schools consisted of a jacket or shirt only - selected by the school management purely to avoid breaking regulations (the rest of clothing was still up to the students to decide). By mid-2008, compulsory school uniforms were repealed and it remains so to this day.

== Republic of Ireland ==

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], almost all primary and secondary schools require the wearing of a compulsory uniform. These can vary from school to school but for the most part include a trousers for males and a skirt or pinafore for female students a shirt a jumper and a necktie. In recent years many schools offer the option of trousers also for female students. Some schools require blazers rather than jumpers. Some primary schools now let their pupils wear a school tracksuit rather than a formal uniform.

In recent years there has been criticism, including by the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]] of the requirement a school uniform jumper must have the school crest or name imprinted onto it and of the practice, where a schools uniform can only be bought from a certain supplier, which can markedly increase the price of a uniform. As well as rules regarding the wearing of a uniform many schools have regulations regarding hair, footwear, the growth of facial hair for males, the wearing of makeup and the length of school skirts. Since the late 90s students are no longer required to wear uniform during state examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/department-issues-guidelines-on-wearing-of-uniforms-for-exams-1.26079|title=Department issues guidelines on wearing of uniforms for exams|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-09-24|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russia ==
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], a standardised "universal" school uniform was worn by all schools. Originally of a military style with peaked cap and high collared tunic, by the 1980s boys wore a functional dark blue pattern with shoulder patches identifying the school. For formal occasions such as the first day of term, girls wore white lace collars and aprons dating back to the reign of [[Catherine the Great]]. During the initial post Soviet period from 1994 to 2013, the mandatory uniform policy was abandoned and pupils generally wore casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. However, uniforms were reintroduced under a new education law in September 2013.&lt;ref name="one-europe.info"&gt;http://one-europe.info/school-uniform-the-russian-experience&lt;/ref&gt; Among the supporters of the new uniform law of 2013, arguments included tackling social inequality, but also putting an end to the controversial problem of whether school students are allowed to wear traditional religious clothing to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/opinions/762985|title=Mandatory school uniform stages comeback in Russia|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each school can now choose its own uniform.&lt;ref name="one-europe.info"/&gt;. Also, there are many instances in which schools do not enforce the rules on school uniform

== South Africa ==

[[File:Carl Redelinghuis Sentrum.jpg|thumb|Typical example of an assembly in a South African school. All students are in uniform, with a sharp difference between the sexes.]]
[[File:Gr 12A Feb 2013.JPG|thumb|left|Students of [[Sinenjongo High School]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].]]
As in many other former British colonies, all South African private and public schools have a uniform, and it is compulsory in all public schools and in the vast majority of private schools for children above pre-school level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/services/education/edufacts.htm#21 "A parent's guide to schooling"], SouthAfrica.info.&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform types vary less between public and private schools than they do across regions, where schools in more rural areas tend to forgo the daily wearing of ties and/or blazers for boys and girls regardless of their public or private nature. However, many of these same schools will have a "number ones" uniform for special occasions which include such items. In cities such as Cape Town, on the other hand, it is more common to see formal apparel required in public and private schools on a daily basis.

Many schools across South Africa also provide the choice between a summer and winter uniform, with khaki uniforms and brown shoes being very common in the summer. South African law has not required gender neutrality in school dress codes and a distinction between girls' and boys' uniforms remains. Boys of all ages are normally required to wear grey or khaki long or [[short trousers]] with socks, and the socks are usually long when worn with shorts, as in the illustration (right). Until recently, the straw boater was a common accessory in affluent public and private high schools, although these have now become optional in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/rules2.htm#zaschools Picture of senior high school boys in blazers, short trousers and straw boaters].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all schools, public or fee paying, have sports' kits (uniforms) that require bare feet for health reasons, regardless of the season.

== South Korea ==
{{Main article|Korean school uniform}}
[[File:Jin Jung-seon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|South Korean school uniform]]
Almost all South Korean [[Education in South Korea#Secondary education|secondary]] students wear a uniform called "''gyobok''" ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 교복, 校服). The majority of elementary schools, except some private ones, do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly monitored from the start of middle school and up. Based on Western-style ones, the South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys.

More recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.

Name tags that are worn usually have different colors per grade. Oftentimes the writing is in black or white, whereas the background is colored.

== Spain ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In Spain the use of school uniforms is not compulsory in the public school at any stage. Their use depends on school councils involving parents. However, it is customary to wear uniforms in private schools, where typically girls wear uniform shirt and jersey skirt and boys wear white shirt and tie and sometimes jacket.

== Sri Lanka ==
It is mandatory for Sri Lankan school students to wear a uniform regardless of them attending a government, semi-government or private school. In most government and semi-government schools, boys will wear a short-sleeved white shirt and a navy blue short when they are in the junior grades. This will later transition to white shorts and then to white trousers towards the latter part of the school life. A tie is not always worn, but may be worn for special school events along with a long-sleeved shirt. Proper black dress shoes and socks are also a part of this uniform. Certain schools also require the uniform to have the school's insignia stitched to a corner of the pocket of the shirt.

Girls who attend government and semi-government schools will wear a white one-piece dress. This may or may not have sleeves. Certain schools make wearing a tie mandatory for girls and some may have a plastic badge or the school's insignia stitched to the dress. Proper dress shoes and socks are mandatory in most schools.

On special occasions, students who bear a post in a sports team, club or association, would wear a blazer which would normally be white and having accents based on the school colors.

In privately run schools, the suit is very similar but the colors might differ. They range from khaki and dark green to bright blue.

== Taiwan ==

As Taiwan experienced a long period of Japanese colonial rule, it is influenced by Japanese culture and the uniform style can be said to be close. However the school uniforms in the two regions are not identical.

There are a total of 471 Taiwanese high schools. All schools have two sets of uniforms, a summer uniform and an uniform for winter. According to the provisions, sportswear is worn.

'''Summer'''

Primary school：White short pants and shirts are most common for the boys, while girls will wear a pleated skirt

Secondary school：Males wear short-sleeved shirts with shorts. Females wear shirts with pleated skirts or skirt pants. Some schools have sailor uniforms.

High school：Short sleeved shirts with long pants for males, pleated skirts or shorts for females in public schools; private schools will always have skirts

'''Winter'''

Long pants and long sleeved shirts are worn in most schools.

In the past, many schools had khaki uniforms but this has been phased out with the exception of a few schools.

== Thailand ==
:{{Main article|School uniforms in Thailand}}
:: ''{{wikisource-inline|Student Uniform Act, BE 2551 (2008)}}''
[[File:ปัจฉิมโรงเรียนศรีวิชัยวิทยา 01.jpg|thumb|Students in [[Thailand]].]]
Uniforms are compulsory for all students with very few variations from the standard model throughout the public and private school systems, including colleges and universities.

The dress code in primary and secondary grades for boys comprises dark blue, khaki, or black shorts with a white open-collar short-sleeved shirt, white ankle socks or long dark socks, and brown or black trainers. Female students, wear a knee-length dark blue or black skirt, and a pale white blouse with a loosely hanging bow tie. The bow tie is dropped in favour of an open-necked pale blue shirt from Matthayom 4.

The girls' uniform is complemented by white ankle socks and black school shoes. The student's name, number, and name of the school are often embroidered on the blouse or shirt. Some independent or international schools have uniforms more closely resembling British school uniform standards, and boys in senior high school grades may be allowed to wear long trousers. The standard dress for children in kindergarten is a red skirt and white blouse for girls, and red short trousers and a white shirt for boys. In all Thai schools, one day per week, usually Wednesday, is dedicated to scouting, when beige scout uniforms for boys and dark green guide uniforms are the rule, both wearing yellow neckerchiefs.

The hairstyle of students is also given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/95321/thailand-whats-hair-got-to-do-with-childrens-rights/ |title=Thailand: What has hair got to do with children's rights? |author= Saksith Saiyasombut &amp; Siam Voices  |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oknation.net/blog/print.php?id=165611 |script-title=th:เผด็จการเนียน ๆ ในโรงเรียน |author= "หนึ่งลมหายใจ" |date= November 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2013|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of accessories is prohibited for males, while females are sometimes allowed to use simple accessories. Some schools dictate the colour and type of hair accessories that females can use. All students are prohibited from colouring their hair or having tattoos on any part of the body.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Thailand however has a few international schools which do not require uniforms.

== Tonga ==

In Tonga all schools require a uniform. Uniforms are usually in the colours of their respective churches and Red for Government Schools. Catholic schools are usually light blue, Wesleyan (Royal Blue), Anglican (Navy Blue) and LDS Schools (Green). A [[Ta'ovala]] bordered with school colours and a tupenu are usually worn by boys with a white button-up shirt. Primary school students usually wear shorts and a white button up shirt. Nearly all Tongan secondary schools require girls to wear a pinafore dress with a white shirt except for Catholic schools which allow a striped blouse and skirt. Students are usually required to wear Roman sandals in English-medium schools and thongs in most other schools.

== Turkey ==

[[File:08913-Perspective Run.jpg|thumb|Turkish school uniforms.]]

School uniforms were used in all public and private institutions. There were several exceptions and most kindergartens did not require school uniforms. The uniforms varied in their appearance; primary schools used one-piece blue uniforms, while in secondary and high schools boys wore dark grey trousers with white shirts, jackets and a tie. Girls had skirts and shirts coloured like the boys' uniform, plus a tie. Most private institutions have their own uniforms. School uniforms for primary schools were black until the 1990s. None of the universities or higher-education institutes have uniforms.

School uniforms abolished in 2012 and schools gave an poll to families to select uniform or casual cloths. Dress code says that students' shoulder should be covered, girls cannot wear leggings or miniskirts. This caused a controversy in Western cities since some students were wearing mini's, shorts and leggings. New law says that students can wear hijabs at school but it's prohibited to wear makeup, tattoos, piercings, dye ın hair etc.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

School uniforms have a long history in Turkey. They were first introduced because normal clothing would give hints about the child's family's economic situation. In order to prevent groupings amongst children from different social classes, uniforms were accepted.

However, school uniforms were officially abolished on 27 November 2012, when the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Education]] suddenly abolished the nationwide uniform requirement in schools (international/foreign schools are excluded) and lifted the headscarf ban for religious imam-hatip schools, prompting fierce criticism from opposition parties, unions and educators. Opponents claim that economic differences cause pedagogical traumas for children and that permitting headscarves harms secular education. Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] defended the move, saying education in uniform has drawn complaints for many years. But students attending minority schools (Greeks, Jews and Armenians), which are also part of the Turkish Ministry of Education, have been excluded from this change, and are still required to wear school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/145198/obligatory-school-uniforms-abolished-amid-criticisms.html "Obligatory School Uniforms Abolished amid Criticisms"]. ''Hürriyet Daily News''. 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Arab Emirates ==

Uniforms are compulsory in many schools across the United Arab Emirates.

In June 2013, the Abu Dhabi Education Council standardised the uniforms for pupils in public school across Abu Dhabi. [http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/education/abu-dhabi-school-pupils-wear-a-whole-new-look-1.1380600]  Earlier, each school had its own uniform. 
Uniforms include options for varying weather conditions. [http://www.adec.ac.ae/en/MediaCenter/Pages/Downloads.aspx]
Boys in Kindergarten and Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) can wear either a long-sleeved shirt and trousers or a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. Tie, winter blazer, and cardigan are optional.
Boys in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a [[kandoora]] (traditional white robe) and [[ghetra]] (head scarf). Pullover sweater or blazer are optional
Girls in Kindergarten or Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) wear a long sleeved shirt with either a school dress or skirt. Cardigan, blazer, and scarf are optional.
Girls in Cycle 2 or 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a long sleeved shirt with a choice of a skirt or two different styles of dress plus a scarf. Cardigan or blazer are optional. These are only for the schools with the Arabic curriculum, not the other schools.

Private schools in the UAE require a school uniform. It can range from a T-shirt or a simple white/black polo bearing the school logo to a more complete uniform with a button up shirt worn with a skirt, shorts or trousers. In the British schools, there is a blouse and either a skirt or trousers for the girls or a button up shirt with trousers. Shirts bear the school logo. Certain schools have certain codes on the use of makeup (some don't condone it at all) and the sporting of bracelets/jewellery.

== United Kingdom ==
While school uniform is common in the United Kingdom, there is no legislation enforcing it in any of the three separate legal jurisdictions of England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and enforcement of school uniform policy and dress codes is generally for individual schools to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCourt|first1=Laura|title=School Uniform Policy in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland briefing paper 48/13|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2013/education/4813.pdf|website=Northern Ireland Assembly|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, schools do have to take into account Equality legislation in dress policies to prevent discrimination on grounds such as age, sex, race, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The schools provisions of the Act|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/private-and-public-sector-guidance/education-providers/schools-guidance/introduction/schools-provisions-act|website=Equality and Human Rights Commission|publisher=EHRC|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; School uniforms are required to be similar in cost for both boys and girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514978/School_Uniform_Guidance.pdf|title=School uniform: Guidance for governing bodies, school leaders, school staff and local authorities|last=|first=|date=September 2013|website=education.gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be reasonably low cost, and to tolerate religious freedoms, e.g. allowing male Sikhs to wear turbans and female Muslims to wear headscarfs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/2003/school_uniform/newsid_3181000/3181847.stm "School uniform"], ''CBBC Newsround'', retrieved on 28 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure that policies are fair and non-discriminatory schools are expected to consult widely with staff, pupils, parents and governors when introducing or amending dress policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bircham Dyson Bell|title=School uniform policies and the Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cc30c04f-9785-49ef-b0bd-c0f9b07904b7|website=Lexology|publisher=Globe Business Publishing|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England ===

[[File:School uniforms GBR.jpg|thumb|English girls in modern school uniform.]]
{{Main article|School uniforms in England}}

In 2011, more than 90% of English secondary schools had a compulsory uniform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results&lt;/ref&gt; School uniforms were first introduced on a large scale{{fact|date=June 2018}} during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/schun/hist/schun-hist.html|title=The History of School Uniforms|publisher=Historical Boys Clothing|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniforms of the time were referred as "bluecoats", as they consisted of long trench-coat-style jackets dyed blue. Blue was the cheapest available dye and showed humility amongst all children. The first school to introduce this uniform was [[Christ's Hospital]] in London (now in Sussex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/Blcoat.htm|title=Bluecoat Schools|publisher=Boys School Uniform |accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070708213229/http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/Blcoat.htm |archivedate = 8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] introduced free primary education for all children. The popularity of uniforms increased, and eventually most schools had a uniform.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; During this period most uniforms reflected the trends of the age, with boys wearing [[short trousers]] and blazers until roughly the age of puberty and then long trousers from about 14 or 15. Girls mainly wore [[blouse]]s, tunic dress and pinafores.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I{{cite web|url=http://www.objectlessons.org/ol/index.php?mod=PageMod.showComponent&amp;component_id=137|title=Victorian Girls' School Uniform|publisher=Object lessons|accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427090834/http://www.objectlessons.org/ol/index.php?mod=PageMod.showComponent&amp;component_id=137 |archivedate = 27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; worn together with a blouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php|title=School uniforms in the UK|publisher=Album 1900|language=English|accessdate=3 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021151611/http://www.album1900.com/uk/0005_ukschooluniform/0005_ukschooluniforms_girls.php#|archive-date=2016-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These uniforms continued until the 1950s when after the [[Education Act 1944|Butler reforms]] secondary education was made free and the school leaving age was raised to 15. These reforms encouraged schools to implement uniform codes which were similar to other schools. Distinct "summer" and "winter" uniforms were sometimes required, particularly for girls, for whom dresses were mandated for summer and gymslips for winter.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

In the 21st century, the typical primary school uniform is fairly casual while secondary school uniform is often formal. Uniform in primary school is generally a polo shirt or [[T-shirt]], a jumper with the school logo, and trousers or shorts or a skirt. The typical secondary school uniform is a blazer, white shirt or blouse, a tie, trousers or skirt, and black shoes. Some primary schools have more formal uniform, with tie and blazer, and for secondary schools to require only a jumper. Uniforms sometimes match the school colours, but are most commonly found in blue, black and grey.

[[File:Schoolshorts.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A school uniform worn in Scotland – [[Marr College]] in [[Troon]] &lt;small&gt;(socks and shorts are not part of the uniform, pupils can wear either trousers or skirts and shorter socks)&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[Scottish law]] is not specific on the question of school uniform. Generally, the school must provide information on its policy on clothing and uniform and the Education Authority must provide written information on its general policy on wearing school uniform. Some Education Authorities do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities.&lt;ref name="Gourock High School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |title=Authority Strategic Statement of Inverclyde Education Service |publisher=Gourock High School |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064212/http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |archivedate=March 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children cannot be disciplined for not wearing a uniform if their parents do not want their child to wear it. However, a child that simply refuses to wear the school uniform can be disciplined by the school if it thinks that academic or disciplinary problems might be caused by the refusal. Many schools do have a policy covering the wearing of school clothing. The policy may state that certain items must be worn and that other items cannot be worn, for example, jeans. Schools must take religious and cultural requirements into account when drawing up a school uniform policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the way that the uniforms are worn is usually not an issue, some state schools may have regulation on the subject (e.g. height of ties, whether the shirt is tucked in or not), the selection of clothes worn, whether they follow the policy, can be very strict. For example, in black and white uniform schools, wearing colours such as grey or wearing white shoes is forbidden. However, in schools that only use a basic uniform (e.g. jumper and trousers) the policy is often less strict.

=== Wales ===

The [[Welsh Assembly Government]] issued detailed guidance to governing bodies on uniform and appearance policies that begins by making explicit, "There is no education legislation specifically covering the wearing of school uniform or other aspects of appearance such as hair colour and style, and the wearing of jewellery and makeup. However, as part of its responsibility for the conduct of the school, a governing body can specify a uniform which pupils are required to wear and other rules relating to appearance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/dcells/publications/publications/guidanceandinformation/uniformandappearance/guidanceschooluniforme.pdf?lang=en Guidance to Governing Bodies on Uniform and Appearance Policies]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Welsh Government. 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Ireland ===

The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] supports poor families with the cost of paying for school uniforms with a £35 primary school uniform allowance. This is claimed via local Education and Library Boards for parents in receipt of income support. At the end of August 2009, there were 24,135 successful applications for the grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-de/news-de-september-2009/news-de-150909-ruane-welcomes-new.htm | title = Ruane welcomes new uniforms for the new school term | date = 15 September 2009 | publisher = Northern Ireland Executive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common secondary school uniform in Northern Ireland is a shirt, blazer and sweater with a tie and a skirt or trousers. The uniform (most likely the sweater and tie) may change after Year 12. The uniform in primary school is similar to those used in the Republic of Ireland.

== United States ==
Most schools in the United States do not require uniforms, but instead enforce a [[dress code]] delineating what types of clothing are appropriate and inappropriate for students to wear to school. Dress codes vary from school to school, but are normally based on broader policies set by the school district's elected school board. Private schools and other specialized schools sometimes require uniforms.

A study conducted in 2000 found that only 23% of public, private, and sectarian schools had any sort of uniform policy in the United States at or before 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationbug.org/a/public-school-uniform-statistics.html|title=Public School Uniform Statistics - Education Bug|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, more public schools, specifically those in urban areas, have instituted stricter dress codes; roughly half the public schools in the United States have these more limiting dress codes.&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/crimeindicators2011/tables/table_20_1.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools that do require uniforms, or a more common [[standardized|standard]] [[dress code]] in towns and suburbs, tend to be more casual than those in Britain or other commonwealth nations. Commonly, students wear collared, buttoned shirts, with a tie for boys and a tie for girls, worn with khaki trousers, and a belt, depending on the age of the school's student body. Skirts of a modest length are occasionally an option for girls.

For instance, red, white or blue polo shirts, with a logo, with navy or khaki bottoms and a belt, was the uniform policy imposed at Palmer Elementary School in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/25/us/dress-for-success-public-school-uniforms.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times |title=Dress for Success: Public School Uniforms |date=25 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools may also have polo shirts and trousers as a uniform. Dress codes vary widely among private schools, although a [[Catholic school uniform]] tends to keep the shirt and tie.&lt;ref name="naesp.com"&gt;http://www.naesp.com/articles/American_school_uniforms.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2013, almost one fifth of all American schools required their students to wear uniforms (Flam). This 20 percent of schools requiring uniforms is six percent higher than in 2003, the U.S. Department of Education reported.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The uniform requirement is more common in lower socio-economic schools, where more than three-fourths of the school's student population receives free or reduced lunch ("Fast"). Forty-seven percent of low income schools require uniforms, whereas only about six percent of high socio-economic schools require uniforms ("Fast").{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Research studies and legislation ===

The National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) conducted a phone survey of 755 principals in 2000, which revealed that 21% of public schools had a uniform policy; 23% had firm plans to create one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationbug.org/a/public-school-uniform-statistics.html Public School Uniform Statistics]. Retrieved on 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this only accounts for those with school uniform policies and not for standardised dress codes, which provide for allowable student dress but are slightly more lax: For instance, instead of requiring everyone to wear the same shirt, or set of shirts, they may specify "any solid collared three-button polo/oxford shirt" and leave more specific details up to the parents. In 2007-2008, 55% of public school principals said their schools enforce a strict dress code, requiring students at least wear a collared shirt and trousers with an acceptable belt to school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=50 NCST Fast Facts - School Uniforms]. Retrieved on 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolfo Santos, a political science professor at the [[University of Houston–Downtown]], stated that many [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic communities in the United States]] choose uniforms because many immigrants originate from countries with schools requiring uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Viren, Sarah. "[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4416999 Demographics may dictate uniformity]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. 3 September 2007. A1. Retrieved 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvan I. Alleyne, Velma LaPoint, Jennifer Lee and Harold W. Mitchell of ''[[The Journal of Negro Education]]'' stated that little empirical research exists regarding how effective school uniforms are in enhancing academic performance and social environments, and that little research exists regarding teachers' beliefs regarding issues related to dress codes, especially so regarding racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Alleyne418"&gt;Alleyne et al 418&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, literature regarding public school student clothing and behavior cites anecdotal viewpoints from teachers. The literature discussed opinions on faculty, staff, and other employees on how to deal with student dress issues.&lt;ref name="Alleyne418419"&gt;Alleyne et al 418-419&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 article of ''The Journal of Negro Education'' said that research and reports regarding the beneficial impact of school uniforms was not conclusive. Despite the [[federal government of the United States]] issuing a set of guidelines encouraging school uniforms in public schools, as of 2003 political support varied.&lt;ref name="Alleyne419"&gt;Alleyne et al 419&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[Long Beach Unified School District]], in [[Southern California]], required school uniforms in all elementary and middle schools. This began a trend for uniforms in American [[Primary education|elementary]] public schools, especially in [[Urban area|urban]] school districts. [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] praised the idea in his 1996 [[State of the Union Address]], saying that "if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms."[http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/other/sotu.html] The adoption of school- or district-wide uniform policies (or "standardised dress codes", less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters) has been motivated by a need to counter "[[gang signals|gang clothing]]" or the pressure for families to purchase upscale-label clothing (to avoid the ostracism of their children by "fashion cliques"), as well as to improve [[morale]] and [[school discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The proportion of U.S. public schools requiring uniforms had increased from 3% in 1996 to 25% in 2010.

In [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Department of Education]] requires all students to wear school uniforms, with only medical exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.de.gobierno.pr/dePortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf VOLANTE SUPLETORIO REGLAMENTO GENERAL DE ESTUDIANTES DEL SISTEMA DE EDUCACIÓN PÚBLICA DE PUERTO RICO QUE DEROGA EL REGLAMENTO NÚMERO 5364 DE 17 DE ENERO DE 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053940/http://www.de.gobierno.pr/DEPortal/Descargas/REGLAMENTOCONDENSADO20042005.pdf |date=2009-09-02 }}," ''[[Puerto Rico Department of Education]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vietnam ==

Most schools in [[Vietnam]] requires uniform, and the rules on uniform vary from schools and areas. The most common type of uniform consists of a white shirt with school logo on left sleeve and navy/black trousers, with a [[red scarf]] for students from grade 3 to grade 9. This kind of uniform is often seen in public schools in North Vietnam or in rural areas, and there is no differences between boy's and girl's uniforms. However, many schools (private or famous public schools) have their own designed uniforms, which often replace trousers with skirts for girls or include bows, ties or vests/blazers.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of different school uniforms in Vietnam http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=305508&amp;st=0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KHAIGIANGLSTS.jpg|thumb|School uniforms of Lawrence S. Ting School in 7th District, [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]]]

The white [[áo dài]] is also a tradition uniform for high school girls in Vietnam, but most schools in [[Northern Vietnam]] only require it for important events or ceremonies, since wearing áo dài is uncomfortable for daily use. Otherwise, áo dài is very familiar with school girls in [[Mekong Delta]], where it is "daily uniform" of all them. The image of a high school girl with [[nón lá]] and white áo dài on a bike is still considered symbolic nowadays.

[[File:Bicycle of Ho Chi Minh City.jpg|thumb|left|Two highschool girls in áo dài in HCMC]]

There are also uniform for [[Physical Education]] in Vietnam schools, usually includes T-shirt and [[tracksuit]], which the T-shirts have school logo on them. The tracksuit jacket is popular and often used as winter uniform, even out of gym activity.

There are no specific [[shoes]] for Vietnamese students, however flip-flops, slippers and high heels are forbidden. Sandals and boots are allowed, although students would wear sneakers or flats to school. [[Dyeing hair]], nail polish and make-up are banned in many schools.

== Venezuela ==

School uniforms are used in [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualcampuses.eu/index.php/Venezuela|title=Venezuela - Researching Virtual Initiatives in Education|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Venezuelan decree, uniforms are required at all schools in all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_ve.htm|title=Venezuela - Post Report - e Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys wear navy trousers and girls wear navy skirts or trousers, depending on the school. The shirts have short sleeves and the colour varies by the level in which the student is. Students in nursery wear yellow shirts, while students in kindergarten wear red shirts. From first to sixth grade, students wear white polo shirts. From seventh to ninth grade they wear light blue polo shirts, and from tenth to eleventh grade they wear beige polo shirts. These shirts are to be stuffed inside the trousers with a black belt. Black dress shoes are the norm in public school, however some private schools can be more flexible with the shoes to be worn.

The '''Science.ie''' portal provides all sorts of information about careers in [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (STEM).

== Overview ==

Science.ie is an initiative of the Irish Government’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme in [[Ireland]].  DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].

The careers-related information on Science.ie has been moved to a new DSE website - [http://www.mysciencecareer.ie My Science Career] - which was launched in early October 2009. On MyScienceCareer.ie is:

*Profiles of people currently working in STEM in [[Ireland]] 
*Information on famous Irish scientists 
*Links to many other career resources

A redeveloped Science.ie was also launched in October 2009. The site has been redesigned and includes social media bookmarking and RSS feeds.

Science.ie provides more general information on science in [[Ireland]]. This includes listings of science links, news and events. Its "Resources" section gives information on activities and visitor centres where you can learn about [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2000/1212/00121200185.html Received "Site of the Week" from The Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/going-to-college-75789.html Science.ie featured in the Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also provides a free newsletter relating to Irish science, technology and innovation news, events, research and facts which is issued monthly by email.

In November 2009 Science.ie launched a Twitter channel. [https://twitter.com/irelandscience Follow Science.ie on Twitter.]

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[My Science Career]], [[Project Blogger]], [[Science Week Ireland]] and [[Discover Primary Science]].

'''Saint Mary's School''', commonly known as just '''Saints''', is a [[Private school|private]] [[Boys' school|boys']] [[Day school|day]] school owned by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi]]. It is a combined [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] school, which offers [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education|KCPE]], [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education|KCSE]], [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] and [[IB Diploma Programme|IBDP]] certification. As a boys' school, female students are only allowed to enroll for the IB Diploma Programme.

The school's motto is ''"Bonitas, Disciplina, Scientia"'', which is [[Latin]] for "Goodness, Discipline, Knowledge".

==History==
[[File:St Mary's School student 1949.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An early student of the school with his parents in 1949.]]
St. Mary's School was founded in the [[Parklands, Nairobi|Parklands]] area of [[Nairobi]] in 1939 from [[Blackrock College]] in Dublin, Ireland.

In 1946, the school was moved to a temporary structure on an 85-acre site on the land belonging to the St. Austin's Mission in the Muthangari area of [[Westlands]]. The present-day school buildings were completed in 1954, including the twin towers that stand at the school's quadrangle and the St. Austin's Catholic Church, which sits beside the school's parking area. In between the towers is the staff room where teachers convene for meetings and take their breaks, which used to be the school's library.

==Present day==
From the outset, Saints has always had a combined primary and secondary school. Although only boys are admitted to the primary and secondary schools, girls (along with boys) are admitted to the [[International Baccalaureate]] diploma course which is a post-[[GCE Ordinary Level|O-level]] programme offered by the school since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibo.org/school/000236/ International Baccalaureate]&lt;/ref&gt; Entrants are chosen on the basis of their [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education|KCSE]] and [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] results. The school year runs from January to November.

The school is near its neighbouring [[sister school]], Loreto Convent Msongari, separated only by a fence and a gate, and is situated about 1,000 metres away from rival [[Strathmore School]].

Students are encouraged to participate in extra curricular activities, which include sports, clubs, music and drama. All the school's sports teams are nicknamed "Saints", also the school's nickname.

===Theatre===
Since 1971, the school has been staging a musical every year, open to the general public. The musical week runs on specific dates from Tuesday to Saturday. The school has staged its own productions of famous plays such as ''[[The Mikado]]'', ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'',''[[The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Sarafina! (musical)|Sarafina!]]'', ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'',  ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[The Music Man]]'', ''[[Ipi N'tombi]]'', ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'',''[[Zambezi Express]]'',''[[Amazing Grace (the musical)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarys.ac.ke/portal/index.php?page=arts Arts | St. Mary's School Nairobi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable guests who have attended the school's shows in the past include former [[Prime Minister of Kenya]] [[Raila Odinga]].&lt;ref name="Raila"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201403110803.html |date=11 March 2014 |title=Kenya: St Mary Musical Thrills  |author=Patrick Vidija |publisher=allAfrica.com |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/RailaOdinga/status/441595827233226752 @RailaOdinga on Twitter: "Arriving at St. Mary's School to watch the musical play "Aida" performed by the students."] (6 March 2014). Retrieved 21 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===

====Rugby====
In line with its Irish origins, rugby is a central concern and a key activity designed to forment "spirit". Their [[rugby football|rugby]] team have recently won the [[Prescott Cup]] twice in a row (2008–09) but lost to [[Mang'u High School]] in the 2010 finals. They also host and have won the [[Blackrock Rugby Festival]] 10 times so far (1994–99, 2004–05 and 2010–11) and have been runners-up 7 times so far (1988–89, 1992, 2000, 2002–03 and 2006), recently winning the 28th edition final, alongside many other cups.
They also won the 2014 [[Nairobi]] county rugby championship against bitter rivals [[Nairobi School]] at Upperhill school [[Nairobi]], under head coach Thugana Riunga and Assistant coach Anthony Nyandigisi. It was a good time for the team considering the teams poor performance between 2012-2013.

However, the rugby team was relegated to [[Damu Pevu Cup]] from [[Prescott Cup]] in early 2015 due to the poor performances in the 2014 Prescott season.

====Football====
[[Association football|Football]] is also a popular sport in the school, with recent honours in the recent past, such as the [[Keele Cup|Keele Plate]] runner-up finish in 2010 and the Strathmore Under-11 Football Cup win for the under-11 team in 2008.

'''''The Corporate Machine''''' (known in Europe as '''''Business Tycoon''''') is a [[strategy video game|strategy]] [[computer game]] from [[Stardock]] in which the goal is to create a [[corporation]] in one of four [[industries]] ([[automobile]]s, [[aircraft]], [[computer]]s, or [[soft drink]]s) and eventually dominate rival companies. To win the player must dominate the chosen market (getting 55% to 65% of the market share depending on the number of opponents). The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon, which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur, all developed by Stardock.

== Gameplay ==

=== Starting Out ===
When starting a game, the player picks a company specialty. Three specialties are available: [[marketing]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and [[research]]. Each specialty doubles productivity in that area. After picking a specialty, the start screen allows choice of how many opponents to be faced, the difficulty of the game, what map will be used (both real and fictional maps are available), starting funds, and what industry is to be competed in.

=== Exploring ===
The game is started at the home site (which is randomly chosen on the map) and with one sales executive. To introduce and sell the product to other regions, the region must be investigated. This process can take from 3 to 10 weeks depending on how far they are from the sites. After an area is explored, the player will know the market leader, if opponents have sites or units there, if the region has a resource, as well as statistics like what the targeted area desires in a product, their concerns with price, and how rich the region is.

=== The Sales Executives ===
The sales executives increase market penetration (the percentage of stores carrying the product) in their regions and all regions up to two spaces away from each executive. The sales executive can be moved around the map freely by plane; however, while in transit he will not grant any penetration benefit. To gain more sales executives the profit must be increased to a certain level by the end of a year. This gets harder later on as the amount to gain a new executive increases. It is also possible to get them through the use of Direct Action Cards.

=== Your Company Sites ===
These places are the player's base of operations. Manufacturing, research, and marketing buildings can be built and upgraded. Additional sites can be purchased but they become progressively more expensive. On the player's first site there will be a sales office and a garage, but every site after will only have a sales office and everything else has to be built. Other buildings include an intelligence facility, which will generate and display information in the form of graphs. Company stores can be built at any site to decrease employee expenses (and therefore lower employee cost).

To get better performance a training center will increase employee efficiency. Employee happiness becomes a factor as well, as an unhappy employee's performance will suffer, so a recreation center will boost morale. If market leadership is lost in an area where a site is, the employees' morale will drop sharply. Marketing, manufacturing, and researching buildings can be accessed in order to make adjustments to the multiple operations within the company. Sales buildings act similarly to sales executives that cannot be moved from region to region.

=== The Marketing Department ===
When a marketing building is built, it will be possible to hire and fire marketers. Marketing associates can be used to create marketing campaigns. As campaigns are created, marketing associate availability drops and the player is forced to build more marketing buildings in order to have more campaigns. These buildings can be upgraded to have more employees and to have more powerful marketing campaigns. Positive campaigns will boost the qualities of the player's product, or negative marketing campaigns to decrease the appeal of an opponents product. For media, there are advertisements to print, and radio and television campaigns. Marketing campaigns can be moved from region to region similarly to a sales executive.

=== The Manufacturing ===
Starting with a simple garage, the player can upgrade to factories. Larger factories, and hire of additional employees, increase efficiency. Employees can be hired or fired as demand rises or falls. The production screen is where the price of the product is set. If the product is better compared to other companies then an overcharge can be made. The price should not be raised too far as demand will drop quickly if there are different companies in the same area and market leadership could be lost.

=== Research ===
This is where scientists develop new technologies to upgrade the product. The bigger the research building, the more scientists can be hired. Four projects can be queued so the player does not have to constantly have to come back to the screen and choose new technologies. Different projects also give different bonuses, such as decreasing the cost to manufacture or increase the appeal to consumers.

=== Direct Action Cards ===
Different regions may or may not have a resource in them. There are five resource types: Labor, Government, Intelligence, Marketing, and Underworld. Every year that a region is controlled that has a resource is one resource point. Having resource points allows the play of direct action cards.

The game is started with two cards and an additional card is received every year. Direct action cards cost resources, and may have a monetary cost in addition. Cards have effects such as receiving money from the government, a research boon, revealing large blocks of regions, twisting the desires of consumers, physical destruction of competitors assets, cutting costs through illegal activities, and publicity boosts. The direct action card system has been likened to the card game [[Magic: The Gathering]].

== Community ==
The Corporate Machine’s popularity has decreased over the years since the game was first introduced. Recently a fan of the game (known as Money) has tried to reunite the TCM community by creating a forum, tutorials, help, and support.

The problem that the community is facing is that Stardock's TCM server (which allows users to play online) is down often, disabling internet play.

The community is considering creating a new, more reliable server on which to play (see external links).

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Mis-Education of the Negro''''' is a book originally published in 1933 by Dr. [[Carter G. Woodson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Woodson, Carter Godwin |title=The Mis-education of the Negro |publisher=Africa World Press |location=Trenton, N.J |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-86543-171-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of Dr. Woodson's book is that [[African American|blacks]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of his day were being culturally indoctrinated, rather than taught, in American schools. This conditioning, he claims, causes blacks to become dependent and to seek out inferior places in the greater society of which they are a part. He challenges his readers to become autodidacts and to "do for themselves", regardless of what they were taught:

&lt;blockquote&gt;History shows that it does not matter who is in power... those who have not learned to do for themselves and have to depend solely on others never obtain any more rights or privileges in the end than they did in the beginning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here is a quote from the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his 'proper place' and will stay in it. You do not need to send him to the back door. He will go without being told. In fact, if there is no back door, he will cut one for his special benefit. His education makes it necessary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aalbc.com/books/miseducation.htm Aalbc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The title of Lauryn Hill's 1998 best-selling album ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'' is a reference to the book's naming.

'''''The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America''''' is a 2006 book by conservative American author and policy advocate [[David Horowitz]]. Contending that many academics in American colleges hold anti-American perspectives, Horowitz lists one hundred examples who he believes are sympathetic to terrorists and non-democratic governments.

==Argument==
Following the [[Ward Churchill]] [[Ward Churchill September 11 attacks essay controversy|September 11 attacks essay controversy]], Horowitz argued that there were many "careers like Ward Churchill’s". He wrote that "Not all of the professors depicted in this volume hold views as extreme as Ward Churchill’s, but a disturbing number do" and "it would have been no problem to provide a thousand such profiles or even ten times the number." Horowitz uses quotes from the professors he names, and argues that two controversies involving former Harvard University President [[Lawrence Summers]] show that administrators refrain from challenging radicals. Horowitz devoted three pages to the defense of former Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], a defense that criticized [[Victor Navasky]], the former longtime editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' and now professor of journalism at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]].

== Free Exchange on Campus report ==
Horowitz's accusations were reviewed by Free Exchange on Campus, a coalition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeexchangeoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The organizations that make up Free Exchange on Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; of organizations that came together to "protect the free exchange of speech and ideas on campus." Disputing Horowitz's book, the report, ''Facts Count: An Analysis of David Horowitz’s The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America'', states the following in a footnote to the executive summary.

{{quote|Mr. Horowitz’s apologia for the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy appears in his chapter on Professor Victor Navasky (292–95). Mr. Horowitz writes, “It is now known, except for holdouts like Professor Navasky, that McCarthy underestimated the extent of Soviet infiltration in the American government and that virtually all individuals called before congressional committees were involved in a conspiratorial network controlled by the Kremlin” (294).

Mr. Horowitz bases this statement on a book on Soviet intelligence by historians Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kyrill M. Anderson (Yale University Press, 1998) which does not make this claim. The Venona intercepts are a set of secret Soviet cables that were declassified in the mid-1990s. Many mainstream historians agree that they appear to provide further evidence implicating Alger Hiss and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as Soviet spies. However, Mr. Horowitz’s much broader claim that the intercepts implicate “virtually all individuals called before congressional committees” as being “involved in a conspiratorial network controlled by the Kremlin,” is false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeexchangeoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;Itemid=25 ''Facts Count – An Analysis of David Horowitz’s The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America'' by Free Exchange on Campus May 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jacob Laksin, managing director at FrontPageMag, in turn made a series of detailed responses to this report. He concluded:&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Laksin [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=4039 Discounting the Facts] FrontPageMagazine.com, June 15, 2006. – [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/articles/readarticle.asp?ID=22871&amp;p=1 Part II] – [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?GUID=85663fbc-f30e-47ff-bff9-af8d1a6ddd9c&amp;p=1 Part III] – [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=4036 Part IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In sum “Facts Counts” identifies a handful of trivial errors in a 112,000 word text, supplies many similar errors of its own, adds blatant falsehoods, misrepresents differences of opinion as matters of fact, and indulges in numerous ad hominem assaults on its author including the claim that he is “sloppy in the extreme” and that his work is characterized by inaccuracies, distortions, and manipulations of fact – including false statements, mischaracterizations of professors’ views, broad claims unsupported by facts and selective omissions of information that does not fit his argument.” On examination, none of these charges is sustained. Simply stated, “Facts Count” is an intellectually sleazy and inept attempt to discredit a book whose opinions the authors dislike.}}

==Responses by persons mentioned==

Horowitz accuses [[Eric Foner]], former president of the [[American Historical Association]] of being an "apologist for American Communism." Foner said, "Mr. Horowitz's 'chapter' on me is full of errors, beginning with the long quote with which he opens, which was written by someone else, not me. This is a fair example of the reliability of his work. But to get into a debate about Horowitz is a waste of time, and accords his attacks a legitimacy they do not deserve."

Horowitz wrongly attributed to Foner a statement by the late author and journalist, [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]].&lt;ref&gt;Alec Magnet, ''[http://www.nysun.com/new-york/nine-professors-at-columbia-are-deemed-dangerous/27850/ Nine Professors At Columbia Are Deemed 'Dangerous']'' ''New York Sun'', February 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to his book, Horowitz said the profiles were written by 30 researchers he had hired. He wrote: "I have revised and edited all of the profiles contained in this text and rewritten many . . . I am ultimately responsible for their judgements and accuracy." On his blog, Horowitz admitted wrongly attributing material to [[Eric Foner]], blamed the error on the 30 researchers, and went on to say that the errors in his book are "inconsequential."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/dangprofs//2006_02_27_archive.html|title=Reply to Critic: Not as Serious as a Heart Attack|last=Horowitz|first=David|date=February 27, 2006}} – (Archived original at [https://web.archive.org/web/20060510200036/http://dangerousprofessors.net/2006_02_27_archive.html Dangerous Professors – Most dangerous academics in America])&lt;/ref&gt;

Horowitz accused [[Dana L. Cloud]], associate professor of communication studies at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin]], as an “anti-American radical” who “routinely repeats the propaganda of the Saddam regime” and, along with all of the 99 other professors in his book, Horowitz accuses her of the “explicit introduction of political agendas into the classroom.” (pp.&amp;nbsp;93, 377)

Cloud replied in ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' that her experience demonstrates that Horowitz does real damage to professors' lives – and that he needs to be viewed that way, not just as a political opponent.

{{quote|Horowitz's attacks have been significant. People who read the book or his Web site regularly send letters to university officials asking for her to be fired. Personally, she has received – mostly via e-mail – "physical threats, threats of removing my daughter from my custody, threats of sexual assaults, horrible disgusting gendered things," she said. That Horowitz doesn't send these isn't the point, she said. "He builds a climate and culture that emboldens people," and as a result, shouldn't be seen as a defender of academic freedom, but as its enemy.&lt;ref name="IHE"&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/02/19/horowitz "Communicating About David Horowitz"] in ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', February 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Horowitz also alleged that professor [[Michael Bérubé]]'s classes "often have little to do with literature," and that Bérubé believes "religious people were to be regarded as simply irrational."

Bérubé, who teaches at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]] and sits on the National Council of the [[American Association of University Professors]], replied that Horowitz "knows nothing about my classroom demeanor or my record as a faculty member. If he were a college student and tried to get away with this garbage, he would indeed be flunked – not for his conservatism, but for his [[mendacity]]."&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;  Bérubé was also invited to comment at Horowitz's magazine, and Bérubé wrote a response to questions provided by Horowitz's assistant.  Horowitz published only an excerpted version of his response, prompting accusations of dishonesty from Bérubé.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/why_horowitz_hates_professors/ Penn State Professor tells of Horowitz's dishonesty in defense of his book.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

The review in the industry news digest ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated that Horowitz's "intention to expose the majority of these professors as 'dangerous' and undeserving of their coveted positions seems petty in some cases, as when he smugly mocks the proliferation of departments dedicated to peace studies or considers 'anti-war activist' as a character flaw... the most egregious crimes perpetrated by the majority of these academics is that their politics don't mesh with Horowitz's."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-89526-003-1 "Nonfiction review: The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America"] ''Publishers Weekly''.  Jan 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the book was released in January 2006, Neil Gross, assistant professor of sociology at [[Harvard University]], wrote a review for the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' calling it poor scholarship and criticizing it for being one-sided, noting that Horowitz was especially eager to criticise Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/02/26/neil_gross/ "Right, left, and wrong: David Horowitz's latest attack on America's left-leaning college professors doesn't add up"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', February 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist [[Rosa Brooks]] wrote that Horowitz's real agenda was to marginalize or eliminate "academics who deviate from the right-wing party line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rosa Brooks |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-brooks15sep15,0,5829330.column |title=Rosa Brooks: Students, Beware Professor Osama |work=Los Angelos Times |date=September 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127091044/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-brooks15sep15,0,5829330.column |archivedate=2012-01-27 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[USA Today]]'' article, citing the report by Free Exchange on Campus mentioned above, stated that "The book profiles faculty who Horowitz says represent the kind of disorder going on in college classrooms today. But professor by professor, the report cites errors, fabrications and misleading statements, and concludes that Horowitz's research is "manipulated to fit his arguments. Citing the report's findings, the newspaper said Horowitz accuses sociology senior lecturer [[Sam Richards (sociologist)|Sam Richards]] of reinforcing class lessons "with 'out-of-class' assignments that include the viewing of left-wing propaganda films, such as "The Oil Factor", from which students learn that the 'war in Afghanistan has turned into a bloody quagmire,' ... and Occupation 101, about the horrors of Israel's 'occupation' of [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] terrorists,'" Richards responded, in the report, to the book's claims, saying Horowitz "disingenuously fails to note that students also receive credit for attending 'conservative' events, including a talk by none other than David Horowitz!"&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;Lawrence Jackson, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2006-05-31-horowitz-cover_x.htm Ex-liberal navigates right], ''Associated Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles McGrath, reviewing the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote "you have to wonder what Mr. Horowitz is so worried about. If indeed there is a professorial cabal dedicated to converting American students to Marxism, or worse, it is manifestly failing. The country is more conservative than it has been in decades, and by far the most popular undergraduate major these days is business." McGrath wrote that Horowitz is concerned with "a pervasive liberal bias at American universities" and that "Academic freedom is being so abused by such people, Mr. Horowitz believes, that he has drawn up an ''[[Academic Bill of Rights]]'' that, if its conservative supporters have their way, would put the state, and not the university, in charge of reviewing what professors are entitled to say."&lt;ref name="mcgrath"&gt;Charles McGrath, "A Liberal Education? Depends on Who's Looking", ''[[New York Times]]'', November 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[National Review]]'', Alston B. Ramsay wrote: "For anyone who has monitored higher education's pulse rate even cursorily during the last three decades, the central premise of The Professors will come as no surprise: Our universities have been hijacked by a band of rabid, anti-intellectual liberals more concerned with advancing ideological agendas – usually of the "social justice" variety – than with educating students. (Predictably, both the ACLU and the National Education Association have blasted the book.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-144980070/take-back-schools-professors.html Take back the schools]. May 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/research/200604180011 Review of Horowitz's book and his extensive attacks on his critics.]&lt;/ref&gt; the progressive group [[Media Matters for America]] stated that Horowitz mentioned "nothing but out-of-class activities" and [[free speech|speech]] in 52 of the 100 profiles in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200604180011|title=David Horowitz debunks David Horowitz: a Media Matters analysis of The Professors|work=Media Matters for America|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Weyrich]] of the conservative Free Congress Foundation commented that "Horowitz estimates that there are about 60,000 of these radical professors in every part of the nation... We are not talking about liberals here. Horowitz is clear that while he thinks liberals are wrong they are entitled to their opinions. Rather, we are talking about the most vile, America-hating [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist-style professors who will accept no dissent. They preach tolerance and then practice the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/guest-column/the-professors-the-101-most-dangerous-academics-in-america/|title=The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America|work=Accuracy In Media|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2007 debate with Horowitz, [[American Association of University Professors]] President [[Cary Nelson]] told the author: "That’s largely a book in which for many of those people their primary works of scholarship are simply set aside and ignored. Occasional political comments are taken out of context sometimes, letters to the editor, you know, occasional political interventions and their entire lives – and their meaning and their presence in American culture is evaluated on the basis of those occasional statements. That to me, as a scholar, was a fundamental violation of fairness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cary-nelson.org/nelson/horowitz-nelson-debate.html|title=Cary Nelson : Syllabus: Holocaust Poetry|work=cary-nelson.org|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thesis circle''' involves a number of [[students]] and at least one [[professor]], [[lecturer]] or instructor who collaborate in supervising and coaching final ([[undergraduate]] or [[MSc]]) projects. This tool for supervising students working on their thesis, also known as "thesis rings", was developed in the 1990s at [[Maastricht University]] (Romme &amp; Nijhuis, 2000).

== Overview ==
Participants in a thesis circle meet regularly to discuss the progress of work on (mostly individual) final projects. Students are in charge of planning and [[chairing]] the sessions as well as managing and distributing [[information]] (e.g. draft chapters). The professor brings his/her disciplinary [[expertise]] and [[knowledge]] into the meetings of the thesis circle.

An important characteristic of thesis circles is the principle of switching [[roles]]: students participating in thesis circles frequently switch between their role as writer of a thesis (final project) and their role as co-supervisor of the other students in the circle (Romme, 1999). Research has demonstrated that role switching is a valuable source of learning between peers (McDougall &amp; Beattie, 1997; Dochy, Segers &amp; Sluijsmans, 1999). This mechanism serves to accelerate and deepen [[learning]] on key issues and challenges encountered in doing a final project (Romme &amp; Nijhuis, 2000). In an educational sense, thesis circles are a particular form of [[collaborative learning]], inspired by the [[sociocracy|sociocratic circular approach]] as well as [[Vygotsky]]'s theory of the [[zone of proximal development]]. In terms of organizational theory, thesis circles are also inspired by the notion of the [[Learning organization|Learning Organization]] (e.g., Mazen, Jones &amp; Sergenian, 2000).

Thesis circles appear to have a positive effect on both the quality of the supervision process and the performance of the students involved (Rompa &amp; Romme, 2001; Romme, 2003). For example, a former participant in a thesis circle at Tilburg University observed that "the concept of a master thesis circle is an excellent idea to promote feedback among students and thus create a truly collaborative environment" ([http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/faculties/fsw/students/degree/graduate/organisationstudies/interview/os2008/ source]).

Many thesis circles accomplish a [[culture]] of reflective (i.e. non-rhetorical) [[question]]ing and [[dialogue]] (Damen, 2007; Van Seggelen-Damen &amp; Romme, 2014). The supervision style of the [[professor]] appears to have a strong impact on whether this culture of reflection comes about: in thesis circles with a [[coaching]] rather than instruction oriented supervisor, more reflective questioning and dialogue was observed (Van Seggelen-Damen &amp; Romme, 2014). Furthermore, reflective questioning among participants in thesis circles enhances learning in terms of so-called multi-perspective cognitive outcomes (Suedfeld et al., 1992; Curşeu and Rus, 2005). Moreover, students with a stronger [[need for cognition]] (Cacioppo et al., 1996) and more [[openness to experience]] (McCrae &amp; Costa Jr., 1997) engage more in reflection (Van Seggelen-Damen &amp; Romme, 2014).

Thesis circles have been set up, for example, in [[Maastricht University]], [[Tilburg University]], [[University of Utrecht]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], [[Open University (Netherlands)|Open University of the Netherlands]], [[University of Twente]], [[Rotterdam School of Management]] and [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7950">Bilingual educational theory that states that [[child]]ren can most easily acquire [[fluency]] in a [[second language]] by first acquiring fluency in their [[first language|native language]].  Fluency is defined as linguistic fluency (such as speaking) as well as literacy (such as reading and writing).  This approach to bilingual education is among those most commonly implemented in public schools across the United States.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ramirez, David J., Yuen, Sandra D., and Ramey, Dena R. "Final Report: Longitudinal Study of Structured English Immersion Strategy, Early-Exit and Late-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education Programs for Language Minority Children." Aguirre International, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of transitional bilingual education is to help transition a student into an English-only classroom as quickly as possible.  A bilingual teacher teaches children in subjects such as math, science, and social studies in their native language so that once the transition is made to an English-only classroom, the student has the knowledge necessary to compete with his peers in all other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt; Gersten, Russell; Woodward, John. "A Longitudinal Study of Transitional and Immersion Bilingual Education Programs in One District." The Elementary School Journal. Volume 95, Issue 3, Jan. 1995, pp. 223-239.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitional Bilingual Education programs are introduced in kindergarten and can continue up to grade six or seven.  Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can easily be transferred to the second language later.  This research reflects greater academic progress made by students in Transitional Bilingual Education programs in comparison with those enrolled in many [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) programs.  However, it also shows the relative ineffectiveness of Transitional Bilingual Education programs when compared with other bilingual models such as [[Dual language|dual-language immersion]].  ESL courses are sometimes incorporated to provide supplemental instruction.  The application of this educational model ultimately came about as a result of an effort to officially recognize Chicano and Latino identities with the passage of the [[Bilingual Education Act]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transitional Bilingual Education programs are divided into two categories: early-exit and late-exit.  Early-exit programs begin with strong support in the students' native language; nevertheless, this support is rapidly diminished.  Late-exit programs, on the other hand, maintain strong support in the primary language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Spolsky, Bernard; Hult, Francis M. The Handbook of Educational Linguistics. Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental difference between these two models is the length of the program.

==Early-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education==
The main goal of early-exit programs is to expedite the acquisition of the second language so that language learners can be integrated into classrooms with native speakers.  Less emphasis is placed on progress made in other subjects.  There is not much importance assigned to the continued development of first-language skills.  After one to three years in the program, students are expected to have acquired enough knowledge in the second language to be transferred to classes in which only the second language is used as a medium of instruction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In early-exit programs, a near-native proficiency in the target language is required of instructors.  Institutions may vary in the amount of first-language instruction that is utilized.&lt;ref&gt; Dolson, David P.; Mayer, Jan. “Longitudinal Study of Three Program Models for Language-Minority Students: A Critical Examination of Reported Findings.” Bilingual Research Journal, vol. 16, no. 1 &amp; 2, 1992, pp. 105-157.&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree to which the children's first language is spoken in the classroom depends on the proficiency level of the students, who generally require more instruction in their mother tongue at earlier ages.  In kindergarten, the average length of instruction in the first language is approximately one hour each day.  The amount of time spent teaching in the first language is greatly reduced in grades 1 and 2.&lt;ref&gt; Jacobson, Rodolfo and Faltis, Christian. Language Distribution Issues in Bilingual Schooling. Clevedon, Avon, England; Philadelphia: Multilingual Matters, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students are first instructed in the grammar and composition of the first language, for it is claimed that knowledge of the first language aids the acquisition of knowledge in the second language;&lt;ref&gt; August, Diane; Garcia, Eugene E. Language Minority Education in the United States: Research, Policy and Practice. C. C. Thomas, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; they may also be instructed in the language arts of both first and second languages simultaneously.  Instruction in reading in the second language doesn't typically begin until students meet the standards for reading in their first language.  The students' primary language is used to a lesser extent in the instruction of other subjects.  As students make progress in the second language, it becomes increasingly incorporated into the curriculum, gradually taking the place of the first language.  Cultural knowledge is imparted through classroom activities and materials.

==Late-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education==
The focus of late-exit programs is to ensure understanding of all content areas while maintaining use of the students' native language, allowing a greater transitional period during which students acquire the second language at a slower pace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As is the case with early-exit programs, teachers in late-exit programs are required to have native-like proficiency in the second language.  Likewise, both languages are used in the classroom, although a minimum of half of the class time is to be spent using the students' first language.  Unlike early-exit programs, instruction in content areas is primarily conducted in the first language.  Students receive instruction in the language arts of their native tongue before being introduced to those of the target language.  A key difference between early- and late-exit programs is that late-exit programs generally span five to seven years,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; whereas students may be released from early-exit programs in as little as one to two years.  Again, cultural knowledge is transmitted through classroom activities and materials.  It is commonly held by proponents of the late-exit strategy that prolonged instruction in one's native tongue provides the student with a greater understanding of its structure, which through contrastive analysis can be used to gain more information regarding the second language.

==Issues in Transitional Bilingual Education==
In many Transitional Bilingual Education programs, language ideologies can greatly influence children's learning outcomes.  A student's intelligence is often equated with his or her level of proficiency in the second language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Palmer, Deborah. "The Discourse of Transition: Teachers' Language Ideologies within Transitional Bilingual Educational Programs." International Multilingual Research Journal. Volume 5, Issue 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers with assimilationist ideologies often encourage students to abandon their native language as it is thought to have little value if any.  Instructors may be more inclined to reduce the amount of instruction in the students' native language because they believe that the easiest way to transition to the second language is through consistent use of that language.  Another issue encountered in TBE classrooms is  that instructors seldom provide an environment in which students can produce the target language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
A group of academics and businessmen led by Don José Ortega Romero, founded Universidad del Valle de México. It opened on November 16, 1960, with 212 students, 23 teachers and 14 administrative staff, offering elementary, secondary, highschool and the undergraduate programs in Accounting and Business Administration.  It soon quit its education in the first two levels to concentrate on the remaining.

In 1968, the institution was consolidated.

Since 1976, the Universidad started to expand by opening new campus located in Mexico City and the surrounding areas, and in other places in Mexico.

UVM's relationship with [[Laureate International Universities]] allowed the school to offer academic international exchanges, multiple country titles, a vast opportunity to Exchange knowledge and experiences among the 80 institutions in the Laureate network, and others.

Laureate expanded UVM to several cities in Mexico: Aguascalientes (2001), Puebla (2002), Toluca (2003), Guadalajara Sur, Saltillo e Hispano  (2004), Hermosillo y Torreon (2005), Nogales, Mexicali y Cuernavaca (2006), Monterrey Norte, Guadalajara Norte, Ciudad Victoria, Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Tampico y Reynosa (2007), Mérida, Zapopan y Monterrey Cumbres y Coyoacan (2008) y Chihuahua y Veracruz (2011). The Nuevo Laredo campus was closed in 2015 due to gang threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/mexico-university-campus-shuttered-over-gang-threats-172615682.html?ref%3Dgs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011231918/https://www.yahoo.com/news/mexico-university-campus-shuttered-over-gang-threats-172615682.html?ref=gs |archivedate=2016-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University College of Teacher Education Styria''' ({{lang-de|Pädagogische Hochschule Steiermark}}) is a teacher training university in Graz, Austria awarding undergraduate and masters degrees. It also operates continuing education programs. 

==Status==
The University College of Teacher Education Styria is an Austrian educational and research institution in the tertiary sector. It specialises in teacher education degrees and programs, and research into development and improvement of the education system. It trains primary and secondary teachers, and vocational teachers. There are also continuing courses for practicing teachers. 

==Background==
The oldest component college was the former Teachers' Educational Institute dating from 1870, and was located at Burggasse 13 in Graz. It relocated to the current main building on Hasnerplatz in Graz-Geidorf and was reopened in 1909 by the governor of Styria, Manfred von Clary and Aldringen (1852-1928), in the presence of Governor Edmund von Attems-Heiligenkreuz (1847-1929) and the mayor of the city of Graz, Franz Count (1837-1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{ANNO|gre|05|10|1909|05|AUTOR=|Die neue Lehrer- und Lehrerinnenbildungsanstalt|ZUSATZ=Morgen-Ausgabe, Nr. 453/1909 (XLII. Jahrgang)|ALTSEITE=5, Spalte 2.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Teacher Education Act (Hochschulgesetz, HG) of 2005 established 9 public university colleges of teacher education (Pädagogische Hochschule) in place of the post-secondary colleges for teacher training (Akademien für Lehrerinnen- und Lehrerbildung). University colleges of teacher education operate teacher training programmes (Lehramtsstudien) as bachelor and master degree programmes as well as further-education programmes (weiterbildende Lehrgänge).&lt;ref&gt;https://bmbwf.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Kasparovsky/HsSystem_201602_E_BF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The University College was founded on 1 October 2007 from a merger of the Federal Education Academy in Styria, the Graz Vocational Education Academy and the Pedagogical Institute Styria, giving it several buildings in Graz.

Activities are managed by a Rector, a Hochshule Council (Hochschulrat), and curriculum committees (Studienkommission).  All matters regarding the university colleges of teacher education come under the competence of the Federal Minister of Education and Women's Affairs (Bundesministerin bzw. Bundesminister für Bildung und Frauen), and not the Federal Minister of Science, Research and Economy (Bundesministerin bzw. Bundesminister für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft) as for the PhD-awarding public universities.&lt;ref&gt;https://bmbwf.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Kasparovsky/HsSystem_201602_E_BF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core misson==
The aims of the University College are:

* Teaching: Science-based and professionally oriented education, training and furthercontinuing education of teachers
* Research: Occupational and applied research in education and practice 
* Development: Development of quality in schools and other educational institutions

== Teaching ==
Teacher training courses consist of four-year Bachelors and one to two-year Masters courses, and some summer and continuing education courses. Applicants for teaching courses in Austria must be fluent in German, among other criteria.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Georg_Krammer/publication/319392707_Die_Validitat_von_Zulassungsverfahren_Befunde_der_Padagogischen_Hochschule_Steiermark/links/59a7c5164585156873d1e74e/Die-Validitaet-von-Zulassungsverfahren-Befunde-der-Paedagogischen-Hochschule-Steiermark.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Fees are set federally, and are free or no more than 400 euro per semester (more for students coming from outside the EU). Courses include:

* Secondary education general education degree (with 26 general education disciplines and 2 specializations)
* Secondary Education Vocational Training -  Dual Education and Technical-Industrial Education, nutrition, information and communication 
* There are Masters degree in Health Promotion and Health Education (fee paying), Primary School Education, and Emotional and Social Development among other topics.

Secondary teacher education takes place in cooperation with colleges and universities in Styria, Carinthia and Burgenland, particularly the [[University of Graz]], which is situated on the same street and where students obtain some disciplinary instruction.

== Research ==
The main focus is on the analysis of teaching and learning processes in school and extracurricular areas. Ongoing research at the University College involves a wide range of cooperating institutions and schools.  There are eight research centres, and two Federal research centres; the Federal Center for Interculturality, Migration and Multilingualism (BIMM) and the Federal Center for Professionalization in Educational Research (BZBF).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.phst.at/phst/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.phst.at/forschung/forschungsaktivitaeten/forschungsprojekte/&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of qualified academic staff attain the title of Professor with a permanent contract, and complete a mid-career [[Habilitation]] degree. However this is an individual title - they do not chair university-funded research groups of junior staff and PhD students, as in the larger Austrian universities or in Germany. Their time for research may be more constrained than in the public universities.

The institution was founded in 1978 as the Corporation School of Veterinary Medicine. In 1983, the name was changed to the University of Agricultural Sciences Corporation (CUDCA). In 1992, the Agricultural Engineering program was started, and in the following year the Sport Sciences program. In 1994, The Marketing Sciences program changed its name to Commercial Engineering. In 1995, the university again changed its name to "The University of Applied and Environmental Sciences Corporation", (UDCA). New programs were introduced in veterinary medicine, animal science and geographic engineering specializations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proyecto Educativo Institucional|date=May 2007|publisher=Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Ambientales|pages=3|url=http://www.udca.edu.co/proyecto-educativo-institucional.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the corporation received recognition as a university. In 2005, it adopted the name of The University of Applied and Environmental Sciences (also UDCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDCA - Acuerdo No 3 de Febrero 2005|date=May 2005|publisher=Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Ambientales|pages=3|url=http://www.udca.edu.co/documentos/estatutos/estatuto-general.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the university also features The School of Economics, Management and Finance (EEAF), Business Administration, Accounting, and Marketing and Finances.
