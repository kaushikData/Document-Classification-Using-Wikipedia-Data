'''{{mp|(192642) 1999 RD|32}}''', provisional designation {{mp|1999 RD|32}}, is an eccentric [[asteroid]] and suspected [[Contact binary (small Solar System body)|contact binary]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 8 September 1999, at a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of 18, by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] program using its 1-meter telescope at the [[Lincoln Laboratory|Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPEC1999-R32"/&gt; The asteroid is likely of [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] composition and has a [[rotation period]] of 17.08 hours.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurve-plot-Warner}}

== Description ==

{{mp|1999 RD|32}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–4.7&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 4 months (1,571 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 2.64&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has a high [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.77 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 7[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The asteroid's [[observation arc]] begins with a [[precovery]] taken at [[Palomar Observatory]] in January 1995.&lt;ref name="MPC-object"/&gt; It is known that {{mp|1999 RD|32}} passed {{convert|0.0093|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth on 27 August 1969.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; During the 1969 close approach the asteroid reached about [[apparent magnitude]] 8.8.&lt;ref name="NEODyS1969"/&gt; The similarly-sized [[4179 Toutatis]] also reached that brightness in September 2004. It passed less than {{convert|0.007|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from asteroid [[29 Amphitrite]] on 17 January 1939.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt;

[[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] [[radar astronomy|radar]] observations on 5–6 March 2012 showed that {{mp|1999 RD|32}} is approximately {{convert|5|km|0|sp=us}} in diameter&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; and has an estimated [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] of only 0.04.&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; Other sources calculate a smaller diameter of 1.63 kilometers based on a dated assumption, that the object is a [[S-type asteroid|stony]] rather than a [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] asteroid.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; The two visible lobes suggest that {{mp|1999 RD|32}} is a tight [[binary asteroid]] or [[Contact binary (asteroid)|contact binary]].&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; About 10–15% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters are expected to be [[Contact binary (small Solar System body)|contact binary asteroids]] with two lobes in mutual contact.&lt;ref name="Busch-2012"/&gt;

In February 2014, an [[Eden, North Carolina]] facility owned by [[Duke Energy]] spilled 39,000 tons of [[coal ash]] into the [[Dan River]]. The company later pled guilty to [[criminal negligence]] in their handling of coal ash at Eden and elsewhere and paid substantial fines. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has since been responsible for overseeing cleanup of the waste. EPA and Duke Energy signed an administrative order for the site cleanup.

== Incident ==
[[File:Dan River coal ash spill - shoreline - 2014-02-09.jpg|thumb|Coal ash deposits on the [[Dan River]] shoreline, downstream from the spill]]
On February 2, 2014 a drainage pipe burst at a coal ash containment pond owned by [[Duke Energy]] in Eden, North Carolina, sending 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River. In addition to the coal ash, 27 million gallons of wastewater from the plant was also released into the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dan River Coal Ash Spill |url=https://www.cerc.usgs.gov/orda_docs/CaseDetails?ID=984|website=Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration Program - Case Document Library |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken pipe was left unsealed for almost a week before the draining coal ash was stopped.&lt;ref name=CNN-Shoicet/&gt; The ash was deposited up to {{convert|70|mi|km}} from the site of the spill and contained harmful metals and chemicals.&lt;ref name=EPA-Enforcement&gt;{{cite web |title=Case Summary: Duke Energy Agrees to $3 Million Cleanup for Coal Ash Release in the Dan River |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/case-summary-duke-energy-agrees-3-million-cleanup-coal-ash-release-dan-river |website=Enforcement |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC|date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This catastrophe occurred at the site of the [[Dan River Steam Station]], a retired coal power plant which had ceased operation in 2012.&lt;ref name="Duke-Dan River"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/about-us/power-plants/dan-river-steam-station |title=Dan River Steam Station |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Power Plants |publisher=Duke Energy Corporation |location=Charlotte, NC |access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke Energy apologized for the incident and announced detailed plans for removal of coal ash at the Dan River site.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/about-us/power-plants/ash-management/our-progress&lt;/ref&gt; Workers were only able to remove about ten percent of the coal ash that was spilled into the river, but cleanup is ongoing and Duke Energy plans to spend around 3 million dollars to continue the cleanup efforts.&lt;ref name=EPA-Enforcement/&gt;

[[CNN]] reported that the river was turned into an oily sludge. The river is a [[drinking water]] source for communities in North Carolina and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=CNN-Shoicet&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shoicet |first1=Catherine E. |title=Spill spews tons of coal ash into North Carolina's Dan River |url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/09/us/north-carolina-coal-ash-spill/index.html |website=CNN |date=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediate tests showed increased amounts of [[arsenic]] and selenium,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greensboro.com/news/dan_river/dan-river-coal-ash-disaster-most-ash-settled-up-to/article_363fdca7-bb76-5072-9c6d-43ddcde131ec.html&lt;/ref&gt; but the river was deemed by state officials to be a safe source for drinking water. The coal ash immediately endangered animals and fish species that lived in or around the river. Six days after the spill Duke Energy announced that the leakage had been stopped and they pledged to clean up the coal ash.&lt;ref name=CNN-Shoicet/&gt;

== Reasons for spill ==
The cause of the ash spill was described by EPA as a limited structural flaw.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.greensboro.com/news/dan_river/dan-river-coal-ash-disaster-environmental-impact-could-take-years/article_fed5e6e8-0150-528d-a35e-c4355ba8aa88.html |title=Dan River Coal Ash Disaster: Environmental impact could take years to determine |last=taft.wireback@news-record.com |first=Taft Wireback/News &amp; Record |work=Greensboro News &amp; Record |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A storm pipe nearby the deposits of a coal ash slurry containment area broke and allowed for the leakage.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dan River Coal Ash Spill Assessment Plan |first= |publisher=Dan River Natural Resource Trustee Council |year=2015 |isbn= |location= |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal ash slurry is produced during the process of burning coal. It is the left over impurities that stick around after burning coal for electricity.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southwings.org/our-work/coal-slurry-ash/|title=Coal Slurry and Coal Ash|date=2014-02-18|work=SouthWings|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal companies have found that the cheapest way to store this waste is to mix it with water and store it in a pond. These ponds have been found to have leaks that can dispose hazardous material into surface water among other things.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This material was released into the Dan River because of the collapse of a 48 inch drain pipe.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The pipe was made of concrete and corrugated metal and reason for the fracture cannot be identified.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; What resulted was 39 thousand tons of coal ash and 27 million gallons of ash pond water were deposited into the Dan River.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
EPA has been collecting dissolved contaminant concentration data in the Dan River (from the VA/NC state line to midway between Danville and South Boston) since the coal ash spill.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=9065|title=Site Profile - Eden NC Coal Ash Spill - EPA OSC Response|website=response.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has been periodically comparing the retrieved water/sediment chemistry data to ecological risk screening levels (ERSLs) to assess risk to aquatic and plant life.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Coal ash is made up of various materials after the burning of coal takes place. These include silica, arsenic, boron, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Certain contaminants that were measured exceed the screening levels, necessitating that the water/sediment chemistry must continue to be monitored.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Fly ash|Coal ash]] can coat and degrade the habitats of aquatic animals as well as cause direct harm to certain organisms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Dan River Coal Ash Core Sampling USFWS.jpg|thumb|USFWS responders take core samples of Dan River sediment following the spill]]
The latest surface water sampling results were released by EPA in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dukeenergy-coalash/sampling-results-duke-energy-coal-ash-spill-eden-nc |title=Sampling Results for Duke Energy Coal Ash Spill in Eden, NC |publisher=EPA |access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All surface water chemical concentrations were found to be below the ERSLs except for lead.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dukeenergy-coalash/frequently-asked-questions-faqs-about-duke-energy-coal-ash-spill-eden-nc|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Duke Energy Coal Ash Spill in Eden, NC |publisher=EPA |access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest sediment sampling results were also released in July 2014.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; All sediment chemical concentrations were found to be below the ERSLs except for aluminum, arsenic, barium, and iron.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The latest soil sampling results were released in June 2014.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; All soil chemical concentrations were found to be below the ERSLs except for aluminum, barium, iron, and manganese.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The coal ash will never be fully removed from the river.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This is due to samples passing human health screening, the potential for historical contamination to become re-suspended, and removal being more detrimental to certain endangered species than the coal ash itself.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In addition, the coal ash is already mixed in with existing sediment, complicating its removal further.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[File:Dan River Steam Station - aerial - 2014.png|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Dan River Steam Station]], site of the 2014 coal ash spill]]
The ''New York Times'' reported that the [[North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality]] (NCDEQ; formerly the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) was directed to minimize its regulatory role prior to the accident by Governor [[Pat McCrory]].{{sfn|Gabriel|2014}} Prior to being Governor, McCrory had worked for Duke Energy for nearly three decades.{{sfn|Gabriel|2014}}{{sfn|Katz|2014}}&lt;!-- Sources disgree whether 28 or 29 years --&gt; At the time, it was the third largest coal ash spill to have occurred in the United States.{{sfn|Chakravorty|Gopinath|2015}}{{sfn|Broome|2016}}{{sfn|Martinson|2014}} Prior to the incident, environmental groups had attempted to sue Duke Energy three times in 2013 under the [[Clean Water Act]] to force the company to fix leaks in its coal ash dumps. Each time, the groups were blocked by NCDEQ, which eventually fined the company $99,111.{{sfn|Broome|2015}}{{sfn|Henderson|2016}} Federal prosecutors found this fine to be suspiciously low, and investigated both Duke Energy and the state regulators.{{sfn|Stahl|2014}} Many newspaper editorials alleged that Duke Energy's environmental safety controls were lax and that the company "bullied" regulators.{{sfn|Stahl|2014}}

After the incident, Duke Energy was prosecuted by a number of agencies, and substantial evidence was presented indicating that company officials knew about numerous coal ash leaks in various plants including the Eden facility and declined to resolve it or provide local plant administrators the funds they were requesting to monitor and mitigate the problems.{{sfn|Broome|2015}}{{sfn|Henderson|2016}} At the federal level, Duke was prosecuted by the [[United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division]] and pled guilty to nine charges of [[criminal negligence]] under the Clean Water Act. Duke agreed to pay $102 million in fines and restitution, the largest federal criminal fine in North Carolina history.{{sfn|Broome|2015}} Duke also agreed to pay fines to North Carolina and Virginia ($2.5 million).{{sfn|Henderson|2015}}

== Outcomes ==
Largely as a result of the attention brought to Duke Energy's handling of coal ash ponds by the 2014 disaster, the North Carolina state legislature ordered Duke Energy to close its 32 ash ponds in the state by 2029. On May 2nd 2014, Duke Energy and the EPA agreed to a 3 million dollar cleanup agreement.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/case-summary-duke-energy-agrees-3-million-cleanup-coal-ash-release-dan-river |title=Case Summary: Duke Energy Agrees to $3 Million Cleanup for Coal Ash Release in the Dan River |website=Enforcement |publisher=EPA |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the agreement is having Duke Energy identify areas of necessary cleanup on the Dan River that is estimated to cost around 1 million dollars.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The other 2 million dollars is allocated to the EPA to address future response methods needed in order to clean up the Dan River.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Spokesperson with Duke Energy has announced that they plan on getting out of the coal ash business all together.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.greensboro.com/news/dan_river/dan-river-coal-ash-disaster-environmental-impact-could-take-years/article_fed5e6e8-0150-528d-a35e-c4355ba8aa88.html |title=Dan River Coal Ash Disaster: Environmental impact could take years to determine |last=taft.wireback@news-record.com |first=Taft Wireback/News &amp; Record |work=Greensboro News &amp; Record |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associates have said that well before the Dan River incident they had allocated 130 million dollars to transitioning plants to handle fly-ash dry and manage it in lined landfills.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Duke Energy said that they have also created an advisory group of researchers to help with cleaner coal combustion in their facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In February 2016 EPA proposed a $6.8 million settlement, which Duke Energy immediately appealed. In September the corporation accepted a settlement just shy of the original amount at $5,983,750 to be paid for fines, restitution, cleanup assessment, removal, and community action initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2016/09/23/duke-energy-agrees-to-pay-6-million-fine-in-the.html |title=Duke Energy agrees to pay $6M fine in the Dan River coal ash spill case|last=Downey |first=John |date=2016-09-23 |website=Charlotte Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the initial settlement cost listed above, EPA sends periodic bills to Duke Energy accounting for direct and indirect costs incurred by EPA, its contractors, and the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cleanup efforts ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Dan River coal ash spill - impoundment cleanup - 2014-02-09.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Cleanup activities at the collapsed coal ash impoundment in 2014]]
To keep the energy provider accountable, under the Administrative Settlement Agreement &amp; Order on Consent for Removal Action (AOC) as of May 2014, the Respondent, Duke Energy, was required to submit a number of plans to EPA, including a scope of work, public health, post-removal site control, and engineering plans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The work plan includes descriptions and a schedule of actions required by the settlement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The public health plan ensures protection of public health during on-site removal projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The post-removal site control plan provides the EPA with documentation of all post-removal arrangements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The engineering report describes steps executed by Duke to improve the structural durability of post-release impoundments and storm sewer lines running under their coal ash impoundments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within these plans, Duke Energy is responsible for creating and implementing a Site Assessment that includes but is not limited to ecological analysis, surface water and sediment assessment as well as post-removal monitoring protocols to calculate the extent of pollution in the [[Dan River]] in North Carolina and the [[Kerr Lake|Kerr Reservoir]] and Schoolfield Dam in [[Danville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These assessments were approved by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] in consultation with the affected states agencies including NCDEQ and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Following the spill and written into the AOC are monitoring protocols in which the EPA will sporadically authorize the NCDEQ and VDEQ to take split or duplicate [[Water quality#Sampling and measurement|water samples]] to ensure consistent quality after removal of the [[coal ash]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=In the Matter of Eden Ash Spill (a/k/a/ Duke Coal Ash Spill), Eden, Rockingham County, North Carolina.

Prior to the discovery of the crane at Trapaing Thmor, there were thought to be fewer than 1,000 of the birds left alive in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/05/25/26500.htm?site=galileo&amp;topic=latest|title=Khmer Rouge dam refuge for endangered bird|date=25 May 1999|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and access ==
The crane sanctuary is located in north western Cambodia, not far from the border with [[Thailand]]. The entire 10,000 hectares of the protected area is contained within [[Phnom Srok District]] of [[Banteay Meanchey Province]]. Phnom Srok district shares a border with Siem Reap and Oddar Meanchey Provinces. Reading from the north clockwise, Phnom Srok borders with [[Banteay Ampil]] and [[Chong Kal]] districts of [[Oddar Meanchey]] province to the north. The eastern border of the district is shared with [[Srei Snam]] and [[Kralanh]] districts of Siem Reap province. To the south the district shares a border with [[Preah Net Preah District]] of Banteay Meanchey. The western border of the district joins with [[Svay Chek]] and [[Thmor Pouk]] districts also of Banteay Meanchey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moc.gov.kh/national_data_resource/Provincial%20Resources/Banteay%20Meanchey/Index.htm |title=Banteay Meanchey Provincial Resources |publisher=Ministry of Commerce |accessdate=2009-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105212344/http://www.moc.gov.kh/national_data_resource/Provincial%20Resources/Banteay%20Meanchey/Index.htm |archivedate=5 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The sanctuary can be accessed by road from Sisophon (70&amp;nbsp;km) or [[Siem Reap (city)]] (90&amp;nbsp;km) via [[National Highway 6 (Cambodia)|National Highway 6]] initially then via smaller unsealed district roads to Ang Trapaing Thmor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambodia Road Network |publisher=Ministry of Public Works and Transport|year=2001|edition=Version 03-00}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sarus crane ==
The sarus crane, ''Grus antigone'' is an all-year resident breeding [[bird]] in northern [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] (especially Central India and the Gangetic plains), [[Nepal]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It is a very large [[Crane (bird)|crane]], averaging 156&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft) in length, which is found in freshwater [[marsh]]es and [[plain]]s.&lt;ref name="Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=2787&amp;m=0|title=Sarus Crane - BirdLife Species Factsheet (Grus Antigone)|year=2008|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other fauna ==
Ang Trapaing Thmor sanctuary is also an important conservation area for a number of other threatened species. One globally threatened primate species, the [[long tailed macaque]] (''Macaca fascicularis'') is found within the sanctuary. One globally threatened ungulate species—the [[Eld's deer]] (''Rucervus eldii'')—and three globally threatened turtle species—the [[Asian box turtle]] (''Cuora amboinensis''), the [[Malayan snail-eating turtle]] (''[[Malayemys subtrijuga]]''){{contradiction-inline|date=December 2014}}, and the [[elongated tortoise]] (''Indotestudo elongata'')—are also found within Ang Trapaing Thmor.&lt;ref name="KH001 ATT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birdlifeindochina.org/birdlife/iba_cambodia/SiteAccountT/PDF/English/kh001.pdf|title=Directory of Important Bird Areas - KH001 Ang Trapaing Thmor|year=2003|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=2009-03-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318022146/http://birdlifeindochina.org/birdlife/iba_cambodia/SiteAccountT/PDF/English/kh001.pdf| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''antiproton''', {{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}}, (pronounced ''p-bar'') is the [[antiparticle]] of the [[proton]]. Antiprotons are stable, but they are typically short-lived, since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be [[annihilation|annihilated]] in a burst of energy.

The existence of the antiproton with −1 electric charge, opposite to the +1 electric charge of the proton, was predicted by [[Paul Dirac]] in his 1933 Nobel Prize lecture.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Dirac received the Nobel Prize for his previous 1928 publication of his [[Dirac equation]] that predicted the existence of positive and negative solutions to the Energy Equation (&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt;) of Einstein and the existence of the [[positron]], the antimatter analog to the electron, with positive charge and opposite spin.

The antiproton was first experimentally confirmed in 1955 at the [[Bevatron]] particle accelerator by [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[physicist]]s [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]], for which they were awarded the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In terms of [[valence quark]]s, an antiproton consists of two up [[antiquark]]s and one down antiquark ({{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down antiquark}}). The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment that are the opposites of those in the proton. The questions of how matter is different from antimatter, and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the [[Big Bang]], remain open problems—open, in part, due to the relative scarcity of [[antimatter]] in today's universe.

==Occurrence in nature==
Antiprotons have been detected in [[cosmic ray]]s for over 25 years, first by balloon-borne experiments and more recently by satellite-based detectors. The standard picture for their presence in cosmic rays is that they are produced in collisions of cosmic ray [[proton]]s with nuclei in the [[interstellar medium]], via the reaction, where A represents a nucleus:

{{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + A → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + A

The secondary antiprotons ({{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}}) then propagate through the [[galaxy]], confined by the galactic [[magnetic field]]s. Their energy spectrum is modified by collisions with other atoms in the interstellar medium, and antiprotons can also be lost by "leaking out"{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;!--this makes little sense as is, please provide more details...--&gt; of the galaxy.

The antiproton cosmic ray energy spectrum is now measured reliably and is consistent with this standard picture of antiproton production by cosmic ray collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Dallas C. |date=2000 |title=Cosmic Ray Antiprotons |journal=[[Proc. SPIE]] |volume= 2806|pages= 113 |arxiv=astro-ph/0003485 |doi=10.1117/12.253971 |series=Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Detectors, Techniques, and Missions }}&lt;/ref&gt; These experimental measurements set upper limits on the number of antiprotons that could be produced in exotic ways, such as from annihilation of [[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[dark matter]] particles in the galaxy or from the [[Hawking radiation]] caused by the evaporation of [[primordial black hole]]s. This also provides a lower limit on the antiproton lifetime of about 1-10 million years. Since the galactic storage time of antiprotons is about 10 million years, an intrinsic decay lifetime would modify the galactic residence time and distort the spectrum of cosmic ray antiprotons. This is significantly more stringent than the best laboratory measurements of the antiproton lifetime:

* [[LEAR]] collaboration at [[CERN]]: {{val|0.08|u=years}}
* [[Antihydrogen]] [[Penning trap]] of [[Gerald Gabrielse|Gabrielse]] et al.: {{val|0.28|u=years}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caso |first=C. |date=1998 |title=Particle Data Group |journal=European Physical Journal C |volume=3 |pages=613 |url=http://pdg.ihep.su/1999/s041.pdf |doi=10.1007/s10052-998-0104-x |bibcode = 1998EPJC....3....1P |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* APEX collaboration at [[Fermilab]]: {{val|50000|u=years}} for {{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}} → {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Muon}} + anything
* APEX collaboration at Fermilab: {{val|300000|u=years}} for {{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}} → {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Gamma}}

The magnitude of properties of the antiproton are predicted by [[CPT symmetry]] to be exactly related to those of the proton. In particular, CPT symmetry predicts the mass and lifetime of the antiproton to be the same as those of the proton, and the electric charge and magnetic moment of the antiproton to be opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to those of the proton. CPT symmetry is a basic consequence of [[quantum field theory]] and no violations of it have ever been detected.

==Modern experiments and applications==
[[File:Antiproton accumulator at Femilab.jpg|thumb|Antiproton accumulator (center) at Fermilab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagaslaev|first1=V.|title=Antiproton Production at Fermilab|date=17 May 2007|url=http://indico.cern.ch/event/41044/session/44/contribution/404/attachments/831012/1149286/04_-_Nagaslaev.pdf|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Antiprotons were routinely produced at [[Fermilab]] for collider physics operations in the [[Tevatron]], where they were collided with protons. The use of antiprotons allows for a higher average energy of collisions between [[quark]]s and [[antiquark]]s than would be possible in proton-proton collisions. This is because the [[valence quark]]s in the proton, and the valence antiquarks in the antiproton, tend to carry the largest [[Parton (particle physics)|fraction of the proton or antiproton's momentum]].

Their formation requires energy equivalent to a temperature of 10 trillion [[Kelvin|K]] (10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K) and this does not tend to happen naturally. However, at [[CERN]], protons are accelerated in the [[Proton Synchrotron]] to an energy of 26 [[giga|G]][[electron volt|eV]], and then smashed into an [[iridium]] rod. The protons bounce off the iridium nuclei with [[mass-energy equivalence|enough energy for matter to be created]]. A range of particles and antiparticles are formed, and the antiprotons are separated off using magnets in [[vacuum]].

In July 2011, the [[ASACUSA]] experiment at CERN determined the mass of the antiproton to be {{val|1836.1526736|(23)}} times more massive than an [[electron]].&lt;ref name=Mhori&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | volume=475 |issue=7357 | pages=484–8 | date=2011 |last=Hori |first=M. |last2=Sótér | title=Two-photon laser spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium and the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio |doi=10.1038/nature10260 | first2=Anna | last3=Barna | first3=Daniel | last4=Dax | first4=Andreas | last5=Hayano | first5=Ryugo | last6=Friedreich | first6=Susanne | last7=Juhász | first7=Bertalan | last8=Pask | first8=Thomas | last9=Widmann | first9=Eberhard | displayauthors=8| pmid=21796208| arxiv=1304.4330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as the mass of a proton, within the level of certainty of the experiment.

Antiprotons have been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/pbar_med.pdf |title=Antiproton portable traps and medical applications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822150631/http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/pbar_med.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary difference between antiproton therapy and proton therapy is that following ion energy deposition the antiproton annihilates depositing additional energy in the cancerous region.

In October 2017, scientists working on the [[BASE experiment]] at [[CERN]] reported a measurement of the antiproton [[magnetic moment]] to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. et al. |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24048.html |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |pages=371–374 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |accessdate=26 October 2017 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is consistent with the most precise measurement of the [[proton]] magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of [[CPT symmetry]]. This measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.

'''Butcher Gap Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the [[Limestone Coast]] of [[South Australia]] overlooking [[Lacepede Bay]] about {{convert|6|km|abbr=off}} south of the town of [[Kingston SE, South Australia|Kingston SE]].  The conservation park was proclaimed under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' in 1990.  

The following statements from the conservation park’s management plan summarises its conservation significance:&lt;blockquote&gt;The park comprises the foredune and associated swale system surrounding a {{convert|40|ha|abbr=off}} wetland area (including Salt lake and Butchers lake), bisected by the Butcher Gap Drain…  The wetland supports an association of dense South Australian swamp paperbark (''Melaleuca halmaturorum'') over marine meadow, while the remainder of the Park is a coastal scrub association.  A lease of the area of Butcher Gap drain that bisects the Park has been negotiated with the South Eastern Water Conservation and Drainage Board.  The park is an important seasonal habitat for migratory bird species.  The wetlands support a variety of waterfowl, including some migratory waders, however, its value to these species is not well understood…  The park is recognised as suitable habitat for the endangered [[orange-bellied parrot]] (''Neophema chrysogaster''), which has been observed feeding on [[Cakile maritima|two-horned searocket]] (''Cakile maritima'') near the beach and in the extensive samphire habitat around Salt Lake.&lt;ref name=MP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite book|title= Small Coastal Parks of the South East Management Plan|date=1994|publisher=National Parks and Wildlife Service, Department of Environment and Planning, South Australia|pages=16–18|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/b92dc434-54d2-410c-b414-9e4f00b1f557/PARKS_PDFS_SML_COAST_PKS_SE_MP.pdf|edition=|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CHIPSat''' ('''Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer satellite''') is a now-decommissioned, but still-orbiting, [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]].  It was launched on January 12, 2003 from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a [[Delta II]] with the larger [[ICESat]], and had an intended mission duration of one year. CHIPSat was the first of [[NASA]]'s University-Class Explorers (UNEX) mission class. It performed spectroscopy from 90 to 250 angstroms (9 to 26&amp;nbsp;nm), extreme ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/chips.html Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121000528/http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/chips.html |date=2013-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the science team, led by Principal Investigator Mark Hurwitz, was to study the million-degree gas in the local [[interstellar medium]].  CHIPSat was designed to capture the first spectra of the faint, extreme ultraviolet glow that is expected to be emitted by the hot interstellar gas within about 300 light-years of the Sun, a region often referred to as the Local Bubble. Surprisingly, these measurements produced a null result, with only very faint EUV emissions detected, despite theoretical expectations of much stronger emissions.

It was the first U.S. mission to use [[TCP/IP]] for end-to-end satellite operations control.

The [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] served as CHIPSat's primary groundstation and manufactured the CHIPS [[spectrograph]], designed to perform all-sky [[spectroscopy]]. Other ground network support was provided by groundstations at Wallops Island, Virginia and Adelaide, Australia. CHIPSat's spacecraft platform was manufactured by [[SpaceDev]].

In September 2005 the spacecraft was converted to a solar observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/news.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818131148/http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/news.html |archivedate=2012-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 3, 2006 to April 5, 2008 CHIPsat performed 1458 observations of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/ARCHIVE/solar_archive.html CHIPS Solar Science Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813132840/http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/ARCHIVE/solar_archive.html |date=2011-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite operations were terminated in April 2008.

[[Image:Capsella bursa-pastoris Sturm23.jpg|thumb|left|rosette (a), pointed leaves, flowers (c–e), pods (i, k)]]
''C. bursa-pastoris'' plants grow from a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] of lobed leaves at the base.  From the base emerges a stem about {{convert|0.2-0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, which bears a few pointed leaves which partly grasp the stem.  The flowers, which appear in any month of the year in the [[British Isles]],&lt;ref name=CTW&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clapham |first1=A.R. |last2=Tutin |first2=T.G. |last3=Warburg |first3=E.F. |date=1981 |title=Excursion Flora of the British Isles |edition=Third |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521232906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} are white and small, {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, with four petals and six stamens.&lt;ref name=CTW/&gt; They are borne in loose [[raceme]]s, and produce flattened, two-chambered seed pods known as [[siliques]], which are triangular to heart-shaped, each containing several seeds.&lt;ref name="neltje" /&gt;

Like a number of other plants in several plant families, its seeds contain a substance known as [[mucilage]], a condition known as myxospermy.&lt;ref name="western"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Plant Physiology | date = February 2000 | volume = 122 | pages = 345–355 | title = Differentiation of Mucilage Secretory Cells of the Arabidopsis Seed Coat |author1=Tamara L.

''Capsella bursa-pastoris'' is closely related to the [[model organism]] such as ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and is also used as a model organism, due to the variety of genes expressed throughout its life cycle that can be compared to genes that are well studied in ''A. thaliana''. Unlike most [[angiosperm|flowering plants]], it [[phenology|flowers]] almost all year round.&lt;ref name="neltje" /&gt;&lt;ref name="china"/&gt; Like other annual ruderals exploiting disturbed ground, ''C. bursa-pastoris'' reproduces entirely from seed, has a long [[soil seed bank]],&lt;ref name=Preston2002/&gt; and short generation time,&lt;ref name=Aksoy1998/&gt; and is capable of producing several generations each year.

==Taxonomy==
It was formally described by the Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his seminal publication '[[Species Plantarum]]' in 1753, and then published by [[Friedrich Kasimir Medikus]] in ''Pflanzen-Gattungen'' (Pfl.-Gatt.) on page 85 in 1792.&lt;ref name="Plantlist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.)

''Capsella bursa-pastoris'' subsp. ''thracicus'' (Velen.) Stoj. &amp; Stef. is the only known subspecies.&lt;ref name="Plantlist"/&gt;

[[William Coles (botanist)]] wrote in his book, 'Adam in Eden' (published in 1657), "It is called Shepherd's purse or Scrip (wallet) from the likeness of the seed hath with that kind of leathearne bag, wherein Shepherds carry their Victualls [food and drink] into the field.""&lt;ref name=Readers&gt;{{cite book |year=1981 |title=Reader's Digest Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain |page=54 |publisher=[[Reader's Digest]] |isbn=9780276002175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In England and Scotland, it was once commonly called 'mother's heart', which is derived from a child's game/trick of picking the seed pod, which then would burst and the child would be accused of 'breaking his mother's heart'.&lt;ref name=Readers/&gt;

[[File:Canova-Three Graces 0 degree view.jpg|thumb|''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]'' by [[Antonio Canova]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], a '''Charis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|r|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Χάρις}}, {{IPA-el|kʰáris|pron}}) or '''Grace''' is one of three or more minor goddesses of charm, beauty, nature, human creativity, and fertility, together known as the '''Charites''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ᵻ|t|iː|z}} ({{lang|grc|Χάριτες}} {{IPA-el|kʰáritɛːs|}}) or '''Graces'''. The usual list, from youngest to oldest, is [[Aglaea]] ("Splendor"), [[Euphrosyne (mythology)|Euphrosyne]] ("Mirth"), and [[Thalia (Grace)|Thalia]] ("Good Cheer"). In [[Roman mythology]] they were known as the '''{{lang|la|Gratiae}}''', the "Graces". In some variants, Charis was one of the Graces and was not the singular form of their name.

The Charites were usually considered the daughters of [[Zeus]] and [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]], though they were also said to be daughters of [[Dionysus]] and [[Aphrodite]] or of [[Helios]] and the [[naiad]] [[Aegle (mythology)|Aegle]]. Other possible names of their mother by Zeus are [[Eurydome]], [[Eurymedousa]], and Euanthe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus|Cornutus]], ''Compendium of Greek Theology'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] wrote that they were part of the [[retinue]] of Aphrodite. The Charites were also associated with the [[Greek underworld]] and the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

The river [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Cephissus]] near [[Delphi]] was sacred to the three goddesses.

==Mythology==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Three Graces in Primavera.jpg|thumb|The Three Graces, from [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' in the [[Uffizi Gallery]].]]

Although the Graces usually numbered three, according to the [[Sparta]]ns, [[Cleta]], not Thalia, was the third, and other Graces are sometimes mentioned, including [[Auxo]], [[Hegemone]], [[Peitho]], [[Phaenna]], [[Pasithea]]  and [[Charis (mythology)|Charis]] or [[Kale (mythology)|Cale]]. An ancient [[vase painting]] attests the following names as five: [[Antheia]] ("Blossoms"), [[Eudaimonia]] ("Happiness"), Paidia ("Play"), Pandaisia ("Banquet"), Pannychis ("Night Festivities")—all referring to the Charites as patronesses of amusement and festivities.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] interrupts his ''Description of Greece'' (book 9.xxxv.1–7) to expand upon the various conceptions of the Graces that had developed in different parts of mainland Greece and [[Ionia]]:

:"The [[Boeotia]]ns say that [[Eteocles (son of Andreus)|Eteocles]] was the first man to sacrifice to the Graces. Moreover, they are aware that he established [[3 (number)|three]] as the number of the Graces, but they have no tradition of the names he gave them. The [[Laconia|Lacedaemonia]]ns, however, say that the Graces are two, and that they were instituted by [[Lacedaemon]], son of [[Taygete]], who gave them the names of [[Cleta]] ("Sound" or "Renowned") and [[Phaenna]] (“Light” or “Bright”). These are appropriate names for Graces, as are those given by the Athenians, who from of old have worshipped two Graces, [[Auxo]] ("Increase" or "Growth") and [[Hegemone]] ("Leader" or "Queen"), until [[Hermesianax]] added [[Peitho]] ("Persuasion") as a third.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Thomas Swinburne. A manual of classical mythology; or, A companion to the Greek and Latin poets, designed chiefly to explain words, phrases and epithets, from the fables and traditions to which they refer. p. 139 {{ISBN|9781290153911}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from [[Eteocles (son of Andreus)|Eteocles]] of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] that we learned the custom of praying to three Graces. And [[Angelion]] and [[Tectaus]], sons of Dionysus, who made the image of [[Apollo]] for the [[Delos|Delians]], set three Graces in his hand. Again, at Athens, before the entrance to the [[Acropolis]], the Graces are three in number; by their side are celebrated mysteries which must not be divulged to the many. [[Pamphos]] (Πάμφως or Πάμφος) was the first we know of to sing about the Graces, but his poetry contains no information either as to their number or about their names. [[Homer]] (he too refers to the Graces) makes one the wife of [[Hephaestus]], giving her the name of Charis ("Grace"). He also says that Sleep was a lover of [[Pasithea]] ("Hallucination"), and in the speech of Sleep there is this verse:

::''Verily that he would give me one of the younger Graces.''

:"Hence some have suspected that Homer knew of older Graces as well. [[Hesiod]] in the ''[[Theogony]]'' (though the authorship is doubtful, this poem is good evidence) says that the three Graces are daughters of Zeus and Eurynome, giving them the names of Aglaia, Euphrosyne and lovely Thalia. The poem of Onomacritus agrees with this account. Antimachus, while giving neither the number of the Graces nor their names, says that they are daughters of Aegle and the Sun. The elegiac poet Hermesianax disagrees with his predecessors in that he makes Persuasion also one of the Graces."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias.

Westmoreland (2007). Ancient Greek Beliefs, p. 112, {{ISBN|0-9793248-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult==
The Charites was most commonly depicted in the sanctuaries of other gods, but they did have their own temples as well, and at least four temples exclusively to them are known from Greece. The two main cult centres of the Charites were the town of Orkhomenos ([[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]]) in northern Boiotia, and the Aegean island of Paros. 

There were temples to the Charites in Hermione,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 34. 10&lt;/ref&gt; in Sparta&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 14. 6 (trans. Jones)  &lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Elis]]: 
:"There is also a sanctuary to the Kharites [at Elis, Elis]; the images are of wood, with their clothes gilded, while their faces, hands and feet are of white marble. One of them holds a rose, the middle one a die, and the third a small branch of myrtle. The reason for their holding these things may be guessed to be this. The rose and the myrtle are sacred to Aphrodite and connected with the story of Adonis, while the Kharites (Graces) are of all deities the nearest related to Aphrodite. As for the die, it is the plaything of youths and maidens, who have nothing of the ugliness of old age. On the right of the Kharites is an image of Eros, standing on the same pedestal."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 6. 24. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple regarded as their perhaps most important was the Temple of the Charites in Orkhomenos, where their cult was thought to have originated: 
:"The Boiotians say that Eteokles [king of Orkhomenos, Boiotia] was the first man to sacrifice to the Kharites. Moreover, they are aware that he established three as the number of the Kharites, but they have no tradition of the names he gave them . . . It was from Eteokles of Orkhomenos that we learned the custom of praying to three Kharites.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 35. 1&lt;/ref&gt; (trans. Jones) [...] At Orkhomenos [in Boiotia] is a sanctuary of Dionysos, but the oldest is one of the Kharites. They worship the stones most, and say that they fell for Eteokles out of heaven. The artistic images were dedicated in my time, and they too are of stone."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 38. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Strabo]] wrote :
:"Eteokles, one of those who reigned as king at Orkhomenos, who founded a temple of the Kharites, was the first to display both wealth and power; for he honored these goddesses either because he was successful in receiving graces, or in giving them, or both. For necessarily, when he had become naturally inclined to kindly deeds, he began doing honor to these goddesses; and therefore he already possessed this power."&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography 9. 2. 40 (trans. Jones)&lt;/ref&gt;

The river [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Cephissus]] near [[Delphi]] was sacred to the three goddesses.

==In art==
[[File:Muses.jpg|thumb|upright|The Graces in a 1st-century [[fresco]] at [[Pompeii]]]]
On the representation of the Graces, Pausanias wrote,

:"Who it was who first represented the Graces [[naked]], whether in sculpture or in painting, I could not discover. During the earlier period, certainly, sculptors and painters alike represented them draped. At [[Smyrna]], for instance, in the sanctuary of the [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemeses]], above the images have been dedicated Graces of gold, the work of Bupalus; and in the Music Hall in the same city there is a portrait of a Grace, painted by [[Apelles]]. At [[Pergamon|Pergamus]] likewise, in the chamber of [[Attalus I|Attalus]], are other images of Graces made by Bupalus; and near what is called the Pythium there is a portrait of Graces, painted by Pythagoras the Parian. [[Socrates]] too, son of [[Sophroniscus]], made images of Graces for the Athenians, which are before the entrance to the Acropolis. Also, Socrates was known to have destroyed his own work as he progressed deeper into his life of philosophy and search of the conscious due to his iconoclastic attitude towards art and the like. All these are alike draped; but later artists, I do not know the reason, have changed the way of portraying them. Certainly to-day sculptors and painters represent Graces naked."

[[File:Raffael 010.jpg|upright|thumb|By [[Raphael]]]]
During the [[Renaissance]], the Roman statue group of the three graces in the [[Piccolomini]] library in [[Duomo di Siena]] inspired most themes.

The Charites are depicted together with several other mythological figures in [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[Primavera (Botticelli)|Primavera]]''. [[Raphael]] also pictured them in a [[Three Graces (Raphael)|painting]] now housed in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] in [[France]]. Among other artistic depictions, they are the subject of famous sculptures by [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].

A group of three trees in the [[Calaveras Big Trees State Park]] are named "The Three Graces" after the Charites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search3.famsf.org:8080/view.shtml?keywords=three%20graces&amp;artist=&amp;country=&amp;period=&amp;sort=&amp;start=1&amp;position=2&amp;record=6820 |title="The Three Graces", Calveras Big Tree State Park |publisher=Search3.famsf.org:8080 |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724043501/http://search3.famsf.org:8080/view.shtml?keywords=three%20graces&amp;artist=&amp;country=&amp;period=&amp;sort=&amp;start=1&amp;position=2&amp;record=6820 |archivedate=2009-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charleston Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] in the locality of [[Charleston, South Australia| Charleston]] in the [[Adelaide Hills]] state government region about {{convert|32|km}} east of the state capital of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] and about {{convert|7|km}} north of the town centre in [[Lobethal, South Australia| Lobethal]].&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRE"&gt;{{cite AHD|7606| Charleston Conservation Park – listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate |date=1980|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation park consists of land in section 3943 in the cadastral unit of the [[Hundred of Onkaparinga]].  It was proclaimed under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' on 8 April 1976. &lt;ref name="SAGG-1976"/&gt;  As of 2016, it covered an area of {{convert|54|ha}}.&lt;ref name="ReserveList"/&gt;

In 1980, it was described as follows:&lt;ref name="NRE"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Charleston Conservation Park preserves a pristine remnant representative of the transition between the wetter stringy bark forests on the western side of the Mount Lofty Ranges and the drier mallee woodlands to the east.  A large diversity of flora and fauna are represented in the park including at least seventy-six bird species.  An area of gently undulating relief featuring three main woodland associations.  These being, a ''[[Casuarina stricta]]'' association with scattered ''[[Eucalyptus leucoxylon]]'' / ''[[Eucalyptus viminalis |E. viminalis]]'', a ''[[Eucalyptus leucoxylon |E. leucoxylon]]'' association and a ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' association.  The understorey is dominated by ''[[Acacia pycnantha]]'' with occasional thickets of ''[[Leptospermum myrsinoides]]'' and ''[[Xanthorrhoea semiplana]]''.  Small, regenerating stands of ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]'' and ''[[Callitris preissii]]'' are of interest.  Charleston Conservation Park is in a near pristine condition despite its cultural surrounds, having never been grazed…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2016SASum/&gt;  In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref name="NRE"/&gt;

'''Dynamic Demand''' is the name of a semi-passive technology for adjusting [[Demand response|load demand]]s on an electrical [[Electrical grid|power grid]]. (It is also the name of an independent not-for-profit organization in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] supported by a charitable grant from the [[Esmée Fairbairn Charitable Trust|Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]] dedicated to promoting this technology.) The concept is that by monitoring the [[frequency]] of the power grid, as well as their own controls, intermittent domestic and industrial loads switch themselves on/off at optimal moments to balance the overall grid load with generation, reducing critical power mismatches.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file41011.pdf page3 domestic and industrial&lt;/ref&gt; As this switching would only advance or delay the appliance operating cycle by a few seconds, it would be unnoticeable to the end user. This is the foundation of dynamic demand control. In the United States, in 1982, a (now-lapsed) patent for this idea was issued to power systems engineer Fred Schweppe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4317049.html US-Patent No. 4,317,049: Frequency adaptive, power-energy re-scheduler]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other patents have been issued based on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7010363.html US Patent No. 7,010,363: Electrical appliance energy consumption control methods and electrical energy consumption systems, Mar 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7149605.html US Patent No. 7,149,605: "Electrical power distribution control methods, electrical energy demand monitoring methods, and power management devices," Dec 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7420293.html US Patent No. 7,420,293: "Electrical appliance energy consumption control methods and electrical energy consumption systems," Sep 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8073573.html US Patent No. 8,073,573 B2; "Electric Power Distribution Control Methods, Electrical Energy Demand Monitoring Methods, and Power Management Devices," Dec 2011. ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dynamic demand is similar to [[demand response]] mechanisms to manage domestic and industrial consumption of electricity in response to supply conditions, for example, having electricity customers reduce their consumption at critical times or in response to prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/42/] Description of French EJP demand reduction tariff&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed, whereas demand response mechanisms respond to transmitted requests to shut off,

==The need for spinning reserve==
The [[Electrical utility|power utilities]] are able to predict to a reasonable accuracy (generally to within one or two percent) the demand pattern throughout any particular day. This means that the [[free market]] in [[electricity]] is able to schedule just enough [[Base load power plant|base load]] in advance. Any remaining imbalance would then be due either to inaccuracies in the prediction, or unscheduled changes in supply (such as a [[power station]] fault) and/or demand. Such imbalances are removed by requesting generators to operate in so called ''frequency response mode'' (also called ''frequency control mode''), altering their output continuously to keep the frequency near the required value.

The grid frequency is a system-wide indicator of overall power imbalance. For example, it will drop if there is too much demand because generators will start to slow down slightly. A [[Electrical generator|generator]] in frequency-response mode will, under [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] conditions, run at reduced output in order to maintain a buffer of spare capacity. It will then continually alter its output on a second-to-second basis to the needs of the grid with [[droop speed control]].

This [[Peaking power plant|spinning reserve]] is a significant expense to the power utilities as often [[fuel]] must be burned or potential power sales lost to maintain it. The kind of generation used for fast response is usually [[fossil fuel]] powered which produces emissions of between 0.48 and 1.3 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent for every [[megawatt hour]] (MWh) generated. Thus a significant environmental burden, in the form of increased [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, is associated with this imbalance.

==Local load control==
[[File:Dryer with smart load control switch.jpg|thumb|right|A clothes dryer using a [[load control switch]] to reduce peak demand]]
In principle, any [[home appliance|appliance]] that operates to a [[duty cycle]] (such as industrial or domestic [[air conditioner]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[heat pump]]s and [[refrigeration]]) could be used to provide a constant and reliable grid balancing service by timing their duty cycles in response to system load.

Because it is possible to measure grid frequency from any [[power outlet]] on the grid, it is possible to design controllers for electrical appliances that detect any frequency imbalance in real time. Dynamic-demand enabled appliances would react to this same signal. When the frequency decreases they would be more likely to switch off, reducing the load on the grid and helping to restore the balance. When the frequency increases past the standard, they would be more likely to switch on, using up the excess power. Obviously, the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] must also ensure that at no point does the appliance stray out of its acceptable operating range. As [[Utility frequency|line frequency]] is directly related to the speed of rotation of [[Electrical generator|generator]]s on the system, millions of such devices acting together would act like a huge, fast-reacting [[peaking power plant]].

==Ancillary services==
The dynamic controller could also provide other [[Ancillary services (electric power)|ancillary services]], such as aiding [[Black start|blackstart recovery]]&amp;mdash;the ability of a power grid to be brought back to service after a [[power outage]] &amp;ndash; if programmed with that function. Generally blackstarts are made more difficult because of the large number of [[Power factor|reactive loads]] attempting to draw power simultaneously at start up when [[voltage]]s are low. This causes huge [[overcurrent|overload]]s that trip local [[Circuit breaker|breaker]]s delaying full system recovery. The dynamic controller could have these loads "wait their turn", as it were, until full power had been restored.

Another vital balancing service is ‘fast reserve’ which is the use of standby plant to replace possible lost generation (e.g. due to a failed power generator or lost [[electric power transmission|power line]]). By shedding load quickly while the running generators spin up, then switching back in to bring the frequency back to standard, dynamic controllers could spare the high cost of [[Peaking power plant|fast reserve generators]]. Also the fast response speed of this method would avoid possible [[power outage|brownouts]] occurring.

The technology could also help facilitate greater use of generation from variable sources, like [[wind power]]. Demand-side techniques could be an efficient and cost-effective way to help integrate this resource onto the grid. In particular it would allow these sources to work in conjunction with virtual power reserves like municipal [[water tower]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-17167.pdf DJ Hammerstrom et al., "Pacific Northwest GridWise™ Testbed Demonstration Projects: Part I. Olympic Peninsula Project," PNNL-17167, October 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a reasonably predictable [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] capacity.

==Implementation issues==
Dynamic demand devices have the potential to save considerable amounts of [[energy]] by the services they provide. But before dynamic demand control can be widely incorporated regulation must be put in place to mandate installation on at least new appliances or an effective market mechanism must be created to reward installation of the technology fairly. One method contemplated is to enable the [[electricity meter]] that measures the electricity consumption also measure the grid frequency, and switch to a higher [[tariff]] if the frequency drops below a certain level. The monthly electricity bill will then say that so many hours (and so many [[kilowatt hour]]s) were on the Regular tariff and a few hours on the Short Supply tariff. Those consumers without smart demand management have to pay the extra cost, but those who install smart technologies that adapt to the short supply periods will save money.

On 1 March 2011, RLtec launched its Dynamic Demand frequency response service in hot water and HVAC load devices distributed across one of the UK’s largest supermarket chains, [[Sainsbury's]]. This megawatt scale virtual power plant service provides commercial frequency regulating response to National Grid in the UK. The company is now called Open Energi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openenergi.com/our-customers/sainsburys/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency service and reserve service==
{{main|National Grid Reserve Service}}
The national grid in the UK already is a massive user of this technology at an industrial scale - up to 2 GW of load can be lost instantaneously by frequency sensitive relays switching off steelworks etc., which is matched over a 20-minute cycle by up to 2 GW of quite small emergency diesel generators. For a complete description of this complex system see for example "Emergency Diesel Standby Generator’s Potential Contribution to Dealing With Renewable Energy Sources Intermittency And Variability" - a talk by David Andrews of Wessex Water who works closely with the UK National Grid to provide this service, given at the Open University Seminar "Coping with Variability - Integrating Renewables into the Electricity System" 24 January 2006.
[http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?s=1&amp;whichevent=720]

Up to 5 GW of such diesel generation is used in France for similar purposes, but these technologies seem to be relatively unknown [http://www.claverton-energy.com/conference/programme]{{better source|date=February 2014}}. There is no reason they should not be massively increased in scope [https://web.archive.org/web/20100217164416/http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/131/]{{better source|date=February 2014}} to cope with even the intermittence introduced by wind power.

==UK government investigation==
In August 2007, the UK government published a report outlining what potential it sees for dynamic demand technology.[http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file41011.pdf] The report stops short of recommending the government encourage its introduction. It lists a number of technical and economic barriers to its introduction and recommends these be investigated before the government encourage the use of dynamic demand.  Dynamic demand is one element of a wider government investigation into technologies that can cut greenhouse gas emissions.

However, in 2009 it was announced that domestic refrigerators are now being sold into the UK incorporating a dynamic load control system [http://www.claverton-energy.com/bbc-talks-about-dynamic-demand-smart-fridges-and-smart-metering.html]{{better source|date=February 2014}}

'''Ecoinformatics''', or ecological informatics, is the science of information ([[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]) in [[Ecology]] and [[Environmental science]]. It integrates environmental and information sciences to define entities and natural processes with language common to both humans and computers. However, this is a rapidly developing area in ecology and there are alternative perspectives on what constitutes ecoinformatics. 

A few definitions have been circulating, mostly centered on the creation of tools to access and analyze natural system data. However, the scope and aims of ecoinformatics are certainly broader than the development of metadata standards to be used in documenting datasets. Ecoinformatics aims to facilitate environmental research and management by developing ways to access, integrate [[database]]s of environmental information, and develop new algorithms enabling different environmental datasets to be combined to test ecological hypotheses.  

Ecoinformatics characterize the [[semantics]] of natural system knowledge. For this reason, much of today's ecoinformatics research relates to the branch of [[computer science]] known as [[Knowledge representation]], and active ecoinformatics projects are developing links to activities such as the [[Semantic Web]]. 

Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of fields like Ecoinformatics to develop the foundations for effectively managing ecological information. Examples of these initiatives are  [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy.

The electricity sector in [[Colombia]] is dominated by large [[hydropower]] generation (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in [[New renewable energy|new renewable energy technologies]] (mainly [[Wind power|wind]], [[Solar power|solar]] and [[biomass]]), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as [[Feed-in Tariff|feed-in tariffs]], and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with [[Panama]], which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.

An interesting characteristic of the Colombian electricity sector (as well as of its [[Water supply and sanitation in Colombia|water sector]]) is a system of cross-subsidies from users living in areas considered as being relatively affluent, and from users consuming higher amounts of electricity, to those living in areas considered as being poor and to those who use less electricity.

The electricity sector has been unbundled into [[Electricity generation|generation]], [[Electricity transmission|transmission]], [[Electricity distribution|distribution]] and commercialization since sector reforms carried out in 1994. About half the generation capacity is privately owned. Private participation in electricity distribution is much lower

== Electricity supply and demand ==

=== Supply ===

==== Installed capacity ====

Electricity supply in Colombia relies on the National Interconnected System (SIN) and several isolated local systems in the Non-Interconnected Zones (ZNI). SIN encompasses one third of the territory, giving coverage to 96 percent of the population. The ZNI, which covers the remaining two thirds of the national territory, only serves 4 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/11/12/000012009_20041112100631/Rendered/PDF/303790CO.pdf |work=Colombia: Recent Economic Developments in Infrastructure (REDI). Balancing Social and Productive Needs for Infrastructure |date=1 November 2004 |publisher=World Bank |format=PDF |title=Volume II: Main Report |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-two large hydroelectric plants and thirty thermal power stations feed electricity into the SIN.&lt;ref name="MME"&gt;Ministry of Mines and Energy &amp; UPME 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ZNI is mostly served by small diesel generators, many of which are not in good working conditions.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt; At June 2015, installed net effective capacity was 15.5 [[Gigawatt]] (GW), with the following share by source:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energias-renovables.com/articulo/colombia-quiere-desatar-la-revolucion-eolica-20160211 Colombia quiere emprender la revolución eólica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of thermal participation in generation has increased since the mid-1990s. This has happened in response to the 1992/1993 crisis caused by [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] associated droughts and the high reliance of power generation on hydroelectric installations that lacked multi-year storage capacity. As a result of the new policies adopted by the country, the dominance of hydropower in the generation portfolio has been reduced from 80 percent in the early 1990s to less than 65 percent today. The expansion path involved adding 1,500 MW of new capacity, equally distributed between hydro and thermal sources, by 2011. This will entail investments of US$258 million per year.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

==== Production ====

Total electricity production in 2005 was 50.4 [[Watt-hour|Terawatt-hour]] (TWh).&lt;ref name="MME"/&gt; Hydroelectric plants generated 81.2 percent, thermal plants 18.6 percent and the Jepírachi wind plant 0.1 percent of the total.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand ===

In 2005, total electricity consumption was 48.8 TWh, which corresponds to an average energy consumption per capita of 828&amp;nbsp;kW·h per year.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption per sector is divided as follows:&lt;ref name="MME"/&gt;

* Residential: 42.2%
* Industrial: 31.8%
* Commercial: 18%
* Official: 3.8%
* Other uses: 4.3%

Demand is growing by approximately 4 percent annually.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imports and exports ===

Colombia is a net power exporter. In 2005 the country exported 1.76 TWh of electricity to Ecuador (3.5% of total production). It imported only very small volumes of electricity from Venezuela and Ecuador (0.02 TWh each). According to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, exports are estimated to increase at 5 percent annually.&lt;ref name="MME"/&gt;  

The [[Puebla Panama Plan]] includes a project of electric interconnection between Colombia and Panama that will allow the integration of Colombia with Central America. This project, carried out by [[Interconexión Eléctrica]] S.A. (ISA) in Colombia and [[Empresa de Transmisión Eléctrica S.A.]] (ETESA) in Panama, entails the construction of a transmission line with 300 MW capacity (3% of installed capacity) from Colombia to Panama and 200 MW capacity in the reverse way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planpuebla-panama.org/proyectos.php?iniciativa=5&amp;componente=0&amp;pagina=4&amp;estado=nada&amp;proyecto=42 Plan Puebla Panama]&lt;/ref&gt; The line is expected to become operational in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argenpress.info/notaold.asp?num=033977 Argenpress]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to electricity ==

In 2005, the interconnected electricity system served 87 percent of the population, a percentage that is below the 95 percent average for Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm Benchmarking data of the electricity distribution sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region 1995-2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In Colombia, electricity coverage is 93 percent in urban areas and 55 percent in rural areas. About 2.3 million people do not have access to electricity yet.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other countries, the zones outside the interconnected system pose especially challenging conditions for electrification, as well major inadequacies in service provision. This system, whose installed capacity is almost exclusively diesel-based, suffers from major [[diseconomy of scale|diseconomies of scale]] as 80 percent of capacity is in plants below the 100&amp;nbsp;kW threshold.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

== Service quality ==

=== Interruption frequency and duration ===

Service quality in Colombia, as measured by service interruptions, is much lower than the average for Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2005, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 185.7, far above the regional average of 13 interruptions. The duration of interruptions per subscriber was 66 hours, also far above the regional average of 14 hours.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;

=== Distribution and transmission losses ===
Losses in transmission and leaks are still a concern, even if the total amount has decreased in the last years. Distribution losses in 2005 were 16 percent, compared to 13.6% average in [[Latin America and the Caribbean]] (LAC).&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;

== Responsibilities ==

=== Policy and regulation ===

Colombia has had a liberalized [[energy market]] since 1995. The sector is characterized by an unbundled generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization framework.

The structure of the Colombian energy market is based on Laws 142 (Public Services Law) and 143 (Electricity Law) of 1994. The Ministry of Mines and Energy is the leading institution in Colombia’s energy sector. Within the Ministry, the Unit for Mining and Energy Planning (UPME) is responsible for the study of future energy requirements and supply situations, as well as for drawing up the National Energy Plan and Expansion Plan.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Regulatory Commission for Gas and Energy (CREG) is in charge of regulating the market for the efficient supply of energy. It defines tariff structures for consumers and guarantees free network access, transmission charges, and standards for the wholesale market, guaranteeing the quality and reliability of the service and economic efficiency. Among others, CREG is responsible for providing regulations that ensure the rights of consumers, the inclusion of environmental and socially sustainable principles, improved coverage, and financial sustainability for participating entities.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

The provision of public services (water, electricity, and telecommunications) to final users is supervised by the independent Superintendency for Residential Public Services, or SSPD.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generation ===

Colombia has 66 registered electricity producers.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Private companies own 60 percent of the installed generation capacity and account for 43 percent (measured in number of consumers) to 49 percent (measured in kWh sales) of energy supplied to the interconnected grid.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Just three companies - the public companies [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]] (EPM) and ISAGEN, as well as the private EMGESA - control altogether 52 percent of total generation capacity.&lt;ref name="MME"/&gt;

=== Transmission ===
 
Transmission in the National Interconnected System is carried out by seven different public companies, four of which work exclusively in transmission (ISA, EEB, TRANSELCA and DISTASA). The remaining three (EEPPM, ESSA and EPSA) are integrated companies that carry out all the activities in the electricity chain (i.e. generation, transmission and distribution).&lt;ref name="MME"/&gt; The largest company is Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. (ISA), which belongs to the government.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution and commercialization  ===

Currently, there are 28 pure commercializing companies; 22 distribution and commercialization ones; 8 ones that integrate generation, distribution and commercialization; and 3 fully integrated ones.&lt;ref name="MME"/&gt; The three largest players in commercialization are [[Unión Fenosa]] (with Electrocosta and Electrocaribe), Endesa (in [[Bogotá]]) and Empresas Públicas de [[Medellín]] (EPM).&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

== Renewable energy resources ==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Colombia}}
Colombia has 28.1 MW installed capacity of renewable energy (excluding large hydro), consisting mainly of wind power. The country has significant small hydro, wind, and solar resources that remain largely unexploited. According to a study by the World Bank’s [[Energy Sector Management Assistance Program]] (ESMAP), exploitation of the country’s significant wind potential alone could cover more than the country’s current total energy needs.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

=== Early history ===

The first historical landmark in the establishment of electric supply dates back from 1928, when Law 113 declared the exploitation of hydroelectric power of public interest. The system worked in a centralized manner, in which vertically integrated state companies maintained a monopoly in their corresponding regions. A public company, ISA, exchanged electricity among the different regional systems.

During the 1980s, the sector suffered a crisis, similar to most countries in Latin America. The crisis was the result of subsidized tariffs, political influence in the state companies, and the delays and cost overruns of large generation projects.&lt;ref name="ISA"&gt;[http://www.isa.com.co/pragma/documenta/ISA/secciones/ISA/HOME/IG/IDI/SEC/doc_868_HTML.html?idDocumento=868 ISA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994 reforms ===

At the beginning of the 1990s the government took steps to modernize the electricity sector, opening it to private participation. The restructuring was carried out through Laws 142 (Law of Public Services) and 143 (Electricity Law) of 1994, which defined the regulatory framework for the development of a competitive market. The new scheme, designed by the CREG, was implemented from July 1995 onwards.&lt;ref name="ISA"/&gt;

=== Law 697 of 2001 ===

Colombia has an ambitious reform agenda in the power sector. The country seeks to encourage foreign investment, with an emphasis on hydrocarbons and power capacity expansion; simplify modalities for small-scale energy projects; and renew interest in non-conventional renewable energy technologies with a regulatory framework to facilitate a gradual change in the [[energy mix]].&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Law 697, which promotes the efficient and rational use of energy and alternative energies, was promulgated. This law was regulated by Decree 3683, issued in 2003. The law and the decree contemplate important aspects such as the stimulus to education and research in renewable energy sources (RES). Nevertheless, the program created under this law lacks fundamental aspects to impulse the development of RES significantly, such as a regulatory support system to encourage investment, the definition of policies to promote renewable energy, or quantitative targets for the share of renewable energy.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2W-4H4V74N-1&amp;_user=1916569&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000055300&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1916569&amp;md5=527b0b19566ed0cab97fdbf01cee0c83 Ruiz &amp; Rodríguez-Padilla 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Limitations such as the ones above present an important legal vacuum for renewable energy in Colombia.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While there have been a few initiatives concerning efficient and rational use of energy (design of the Colombian program of normalization, accreditation, certification and labeling of final use of energy equipment, and promotion of carburant mixture for vehicle use and massive use of natural gas), there have been no recent initiatives related to [[new renewable energy]] technologies.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"/&gt;

== Tariffs and subsidies ==

=== Tariffs ===

The electricity market in Colombia has regulated and non-regulated segments. The regulated market, which is directly contracted and supplied by distribution companies, applies to industrial, commercial, and residential users with power demands under 0.5MW. In this market, the tariff structure is established by the regulatory agency CREG. In the non-regulated market, consumers with power demands of 0.5 MW and above can negotiate freely and contract their supply in the wholesale market (i.e., spot and contracts markets) directly or through commercial entities, distributors, or producers.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the average residential tariff was US$0.0979 per kWh, slightly below the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] [[weighted mean|weighted average]] of US$0.115. The average industrial tariff was US$0.0975 per kWh, slightly below the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] [[weighted mean|weighted average]] of US$0.107.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;

=== Subsidies and cross-subsidies ===

By law all urban areas in Colombia are classified in one of six socio-economic strata, which are used to determine the level of tariffs for electricity, water and other services. According to that system, consumers living in areas considered as poor - and consumers using low amounts of electricity - receive electricity and natural gas at subsidized tariffs. These cross-subsidies are almost entirely (approximately 98 percent) financed by consumers living in areas considered as being relatively affluent and who use more electricity. The cross-subsidies cover about 25 percent of the electricity and gas bill of low-income consumers.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A special fund that covers the remaining amount not covered by consumers provided US$21.8 million in 2005. On average, 7.5 million people a month benefited from this fund. In addition, the fund provided subsidies of COP$ 17,159 million (US$7.4 million) to 1,808,061 natural gas users.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidies are also given to provide diesel for power production in non-grid-connected zones. While diesel in the interior of the country can cost in the order of US$0.8/gal, in remote areas it can cost in the order of US$4.5/gal because of high transport costs.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsidy stratification system in Colombia has proven fairly ineffective at channeling subsidies towards the poor. Although the scheme is broad in its coverage and excludes no more than 2 percent of the poor for services with broad coverage such as electricity, water and sanitation, there are also high leakage rates. Some 50-60 percent of subsidy beneficiaries are from the top half of the income distribution and, moreover, only 30-35 percent of subsidy resources are captured by the poor. Nevertheless, the performance of this subsidy scheme varies depending on the service considered, being water the sector with the poorest performance and telephony the one with the best behavior.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

== Investment and financing ==

=== Investment ===

A 2004 report by the World Bank estimated the following power sector investment needs for Colombia up to 2010:&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; Power Purchase Agreement

In summary, the overall investment needs in the electricity generation, transmission and distribution sector total US$767 million per year. About 60 percent of that relates to maintenance obligations and payment of [[Power Purchase Agreement]] (PPA) guarantees, and the remaining 40 percent to new investment in generation and transmission. These investment needs are completely related to the SIN and do not take into account the needs associated with the ZNI.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

=== Financing of rural electrification ===

There are three different funds and programs that support [[rural electrification]] in Colombia, each established at a different time with different purposes, and all administered by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. At the end of 2006, the Ministry of Mines and Energy had approved a total of US$23.3 million rural electrification funds from these three funds and programs directed to benefit 14,965 families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.certificamos-sa.com/noticias2.php?idr=953 ''Compañía Colombiana de Certificación'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for the Electrification of Non-interconnected Zones (FANZI), was established in 2000 to assist isolated regions in the zones outside the interconnected system. It contemplated both the expansion of existing networks and the establishment of stand-alone solutions.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a special fund known as Rural Electrification Fund (FAER), of similar characteristics to the FAZNI, was established to subsidize investment in rural areas of the interconnected system. The fund was designed to collect a surcharge of US$0.40 per MWh of electricity sold to the wholesale market, which would yield approximately US$18 million per year. Projects are presented to the FAER by the local government authorities. In order to be eligible, they must form part of the local development plan and the investment plan of the corresponding distribution utility and must also pass through the national project screening and evaluation system.
 
Electrification projects also receive support from the Program for Network Normalization (PRONE) that draws its resources from the National Development Plan funds.&lt;ref name="InfrWB"/&gt;

The Institute for the Investigation and Application of Energy Solutions (IPSE) supports the Ministry of Mines and Energy in its efforts to promote rural electrification.

== Summary of private sector participation ==

Colombia has had a liberalized energy market since 1995. The sector is characterized by an unbundled generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization framework.

With 66 registered electricity producers, private companies own 60 percent of the installed generation capacity and account for 43 percent (measured in number of consumers) to 49 percent (measured in kWh sales) of energy supplied to the interconnected grid. Transmission is carried out by seven different public companies, while distribution and commercialization are in the hands of over 60 companies, both public and private.

== Electricity and the environment ==

=== Responsibility for the environment ===

The Ministry of the Environment, Housing and Territorial Development holds the environmental responsibilities in Colombia and leads the country’s commitment towards sustainable development. Within the Ministry, the Climate Change Mitigation Group addresses all the issues related with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minambiente.gov.co/ministerio/funciones.htm Ministry of the Environment, Housing and Territorial Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===

Because of Colombia’s abundant hydroelectric potential, greenhouse gas emissions are very low per capita (1.3 t{{CO2}}e) and per unit of GDP (0.2 t{{CO2}}e).&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) estimated that {{CO2}} emissions from electricity production in 2003 were 6.5 million tons of {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olade.org/informe.html OLADE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074348/http://www.olade.org/informe.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently 30 percent of {{CO2}} emissions in Colombia come from the power sector, but these could increase if thermal generation gains a larger part of the energy mix.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clean Development Mechanism projects in electricity ===

As of August 2007, there are three registered [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) projects in the electricity sector in Colombia, with overall estimated emission reductions of 107,465 t{{CO2}}e per year.

The Jepírachi project, in the [[Uribia]] region, is Colombia’s first and only wind farm. This 19.5 MW project is expected to displace an estimated 430,000 t{{CO2}} until 2019.&lt;ref name="urlCDM: Jepirachi Wind Power Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/SGS-UKL1135244574.04/view.html |title=CDM: Jepirachi Wind Power Project |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jepírachi project is now in its fourth year of operation. It generated about 144 GWh and displaced about 48,500 t{{CO2}}e from February 2004 to August 2006.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;ESMAP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The other two registered projects are the Santa Ana Hydroelectric Plant, in the Bogotá’s suburb [[Usaquén]], with estimated emission reductions of 20,642 t{{CO2}}e per year;&lt;ref name="urlCDM: Santa Ana Hydroelectric Plant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/TUEV-SUED1140544492.1/view.html |title=CDM: Santa Ana Hydroelectric Plant |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the La Vuelta and La Herradura Hydroelectric Project, in the [[Antioquia Department]], with estimated emission reductions of 69,795 t{{CO2}}e per year.&lt;ref name="urlCDM: La Vuelta and La Herradura Hydroelectric Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/DNV-CUK1161865279.03/view.html |title=CDM: La Vuelta and La Herradura Hydroelectric Project |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== External assistance ==

=== Inter-American Development Bank ===

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] has currently one energy project under implementation in Colombia, the Porce III Hydroelectric Power Plant, owned by Empresas Públicas de Medellín and approved in October 2005. This is a US$900 million project, of which the IDB is contributing US$200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=CO-L1005&amp;Language=English |title=Project: Porce III Hydroelectric Power Plant - Inter-American Development Bank |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the IDB is supporting the Colombia-Panama electric interconnection project through US$1.5 million financing for the feasibility studies phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=RS-T1241&amp;Language=English+ |title=Project: Colombia - Panama Electric Interconnection - Inter-American Development Bank |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in [[Burundi]]''' is a growing [[industry]] with tremendous potential.

==Electricity==
[[Bujumbura]] and [[Gitega]] are the only two cities in [[Burundi]] that have municipal electricity service. Burundi's total installed capacity was 49&amp;nbsp;MW in 2001. Two dams completed since 1984 have increased the amount of power production from hydroelectric installations. In 2001, estimated production of electricity totaled 155&amp;nbsp;GWh, of which 154&amp;nbsp;GWh was from hydroelectric sources, with geothermal and thermal sources accounting for the rest. Consumption in 2001 was estimated at 170&amp;nbsp;GWh.

==Petroleum==
Burundi imports all of its petroleum products from [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], and has no known reserves of petroleum or natural gas. Consumption of oil in 2001 is estimated at 3,000&amp;nbsp;barrels per day. Burundi is estimated to have no known consumption of natural gas in 2001. A subsidiary of [[BP]] has an oil exploratory concession in and around [[Lake Tanganyika]].

==Wood and peat==
[[Wood]] and [[peat]] account for 94% of energy consumption in Burundi. Peat offers an alternative to increasingly scarce firewood and charcoal as a domestic energy source. The government is promoting peat production and is fostering the development of renewable energy resources, such as [[solar electricity]] and [[biogas]].

'''Fabian Gottlieb Thaddeus von&lt;ref&gt;{{German title von}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellingshausen''' ({{lang-ru|Фадде́й Фадде́евич Беллинсга́узен}}, [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]] {{transl|ru|Faddey Faddeevich Bellinsgauzen}}; {{OldStyleDate|20 September|1778|9 September}} – {{OldStyleDate|25 January|1852|13 January}}), a [[Baltic German]] naval officer in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], cartographer and explorer, ultimately rose to the rank of [[Russian Admiral|admiral]]. He participated in the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] of the globe and subsequently became a [[leader]] of another [[circumnavigation]] expedition that discovered the continent of [[Antarctica]].

Bellingshausen started his service in the [[Baltic Fleet]], and after distinguishing himself joined the [[First Russian circumnavigation]] of the Earth in 1803-1806, serving on the merchant ship [[Nadezhda (1802 Russian ship)|''Nadezhda'']] under the captaincy of [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]]. After the journey he published a collection of maps of the newly explored areas and islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Subsequently, he commanded several ships of the Baltic and [[Black Sea Fleet]]s.

As a prominent cartographer, Bellingshausen was appointed to command the Russian circumnavigation of the globe in 1819-1821, intended to explore the [[Southern Ocean]] and to find land in the proximity of the [[South Pole]]. [[Mikhail Lazarev]] prepared the expedition and was made Bellingshausen's second-in-command and the captain of the sloop ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'', while Bellingshausen himself commanded the sloop ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]''. During this expedition Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see the land of [[Antarctica]] on 27 January 1820 ([[New Style]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date= September 1971 | url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5654852 | title= Bellingshausen and the discovery of Antarctica| journal= Polar Record | publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] | volume= 15 | issue= 99 | pages= 887–889 | doi= 10.1017/S0032247400062112 | accessdate= 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They circumnavigated the continent twice and never lost each other from view. Thus they disproved [[Captain Cook]]'s assertion that it was impossible to find land in the southern ice-fields. The expedition discovered and named [[Peter I Island]], [[Zavodovski Island|Zavodovski]], [[Leskov Island|Leskov]] and [[Visokoi Island]]s, the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and [[Alexander Island]] (Alexander Coast), and made other discoveries in the tropical waters of the [[Pacific]].

Made [[counter admiral]] on his return, Bellingshausen participated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]]. Promoted to [[vice-admiral]], he again served in the [[Baltic Fleet]] in 1830s, and from 1839 he was the military governor of [[Kronstadt]], where he died. In 1831 he published the book on his Antarctic travels, called ''Double Investigation of the Southern Polar Ocean and the Voyage Around the World'' (''Двукратные изыскания в южнополярном океане и плавание вокруг света''). Russians remember him as one of their greatest [[List of Russian admirals|admirals]] and [[List of Russian explorers|explorers]]. Multiple geographical features and locations in the [[Antarctic]], named in honor of Bellingshausen, commemorate his role in the exploration of the southern polar region.

==Early life and career==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Усадьба Беллинсгаузена.JPG|thumb|Bellingshausen farm on sacremento
[[Saaremaa|Saaremaa island]] (Ösel)]]
Bellingshausen was born to a noble [[Baltic German]] family in the [[Lahetaguse|Lahhentagge]] manor, [[Saaremaa]], [[Governorate of Livonia]], now in [[Salme Parish]], [[Saare County]], [[Estonia]] — then part of the Russian Empire. He enlisted as a cadet in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] at the age of ten. After graduating from the [[Kronstadt]] naval academy at age eighteen, Bellingshausen rapidly rose to the rank of captain.

==First Russian circumnavigation==

A great admirer of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s voyages, Bellingshausen served from 1803 in the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] of the Earth. He was one of the officers of the vessel ''[[Nadezhda (1802 Russian ship)|Nadezhda]]'' ("Hope"), commanded by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]].

The mission was completed in 1806. After the journey Bellingshausen published a collection of maps of the newly explored areas  and islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==Service as captain==

Bellingshausen's career continued with the command of various ships in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s. From 1812 to 1816 he commanded the  frigate ''[[:ru:Минерва (фрегат, 1811)|Minerva]]'' and from 1817 to 1819 the frigate ''[[:ru:Флора (фрегат, 1818)|Flora]]'', both in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. During 1812 he met on [[Macquarie island]] [[Richard Siddins]], the Australian captain of the ship ''Campbell Macquarie''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Richard|title=The Empty Ocean|date=2013|publisher=Island Press|isbn=1597265993|page=172|edition=Herzien|url=https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Empty_Ocean.html?id=9fWQed5be58C&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Russian Antarctic expedition==

[[File:Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Captain Faddey Bellingshausen with the Cross of the [[Order of St. Vladimir]]]]
When [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] authorized an expedition to the south polar region in 1819, the authorities selected Bellingshausen to lead it as an experienced captain and explorer, and a prominent cartographer. The expedition was intended to explore the [[Southern Ocean]] and to find land in the proximity of the [[South Pole]]. The preparation work on the two ships, the 985-ton [[sloop-of-war]] ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' ("East") and the 530-ton support vessel ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' ("Peaceful") was carried out by [[Mikhail Lazarev]], who had captained his own [[circumnavigation]] of the globe before. Bellingshausen became the captain of ''Vostok'', and Lazarev captained ''Mirny''. The journey started from [[Kronstadt]] on 4 June 1819.

Leaving [[Portsmouth]] on 5 September 1819 the expedition crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] (the first to do so since [[James Cook|Cook]]) on 26 January 1820 ([[New Style]]). On 27 January the expedition discovered the [[Antarctic|Antarctic mainland]] approaching the Antarctic coast at a point with coordinates 69º21'28"S 2º14'50"W and seeing ice-fields there. The point in question lies within twenty miles of the Antarctic mainland. Bellingshausen's diary, his report to the [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]n Naval Minister on 21 July 1821 and other documents, available in the [http://www.polarmuseum.ru/ Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, were carefully compared with the log-books of other claimants by the British polar historian A. G. E. Jones in his 1982 study ''Antarctica Observed''. Jones concluded that Bellingshausen, rather than the Royal Navy's [[Edward Bransfield]] on 30 January 1820 or the American [[Nathaniel Palmer]] on 17 November 1820, was indeed the discoverer of the sought-after [[Terra Australis]].

During the voyage Bellingshausen also visited [[Ship Cove, New Zealand|Ship Cove]] in New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=1966 |title =Ship Cove |encyclopedia=An Encyclopedia of New Zealand |editor=A.H. McLintock| publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage/Te Manatū Taonga, Government of New Zealand |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/ship-cove |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[South Shetland Islands]], and discovered and named [[Peter I Island|Peter I]], [[Zavodovski Island|Zavodovski]], [[Leskov Island|Leskov]] and [[Visokoi Island|Visokoi]] Islands, and a peninsula of the Antarctic mainland that he named the Alexander Coast but that has more recently borne the designation of [[Alexander Island]].

[[File:Lazarevpetrovich.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikhail Lazarev]], captain of ''Mirny'' and second-in-command to Bellingshausen during the Antarctic expedition.]]
Bellingshausen and Lazarev managed to twice circumnavigate the continent and never lost each other from view. Thus they disproved [[Captain Cook]]'s assertion that it was impossible to find land in the southern ice fields. The expedition also made discoveries and observations in the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Admiral==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Returning to [[Kronstadt]] on 4 August 1821, Bellingshausen was made [[counter admiral]]. He fought in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828–1829 and attained the rank of [[vice admiral]] in 1830. In 1831 he published the book on his Antarctic travel, called ''Double Investigation of the Southern Polar Ocean and the Voyage Around the World'' (''Двукратные изыскания в южнополярном океане и плавание вокруг света'').

==Military governor of Kronstadt==
He became the military governor of [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]], the port of [[St Petersburg]], from 1839, and died there in 1852.

==Legacy==
Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen is remembered in Russia as one of its greatest [[List of Russian admirals|admirals]] and [[List of Russian explorers|explorers]]. In the [[Antarctic]], multiple geographical features and locations, named in honor of Bellingshausen, remind of his role in exploration of the southern polar region.

'''Filipstadite''' is a very rare mineral&lt;ref name=M&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-1548.html |title=Filipstadite: Filipstadite mineral information and data |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[spinel]] group, with the formula (Mn,Mg)(Sb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=D&gt;Dunn, P.J., Peacor, D.R., Criddle, A.J., and Stanley, C.J., 1988.

==Occurrence and association==
In the [[metamorphic]] Fe-Mn ore bodies of the Långban-type filipstadite associates with native [[antimony]], [[calcite]], native [[copper]], [[forsterite]], [[hausmannite]], [[hedyphane]], [[ingersonite]], [[jacobsite]], [[phlogopite]], and [[svabite]].&lt;ref name=H /&gt;

==Notes on crystal structure==
Cations and anions in filipstadite occupy {{frac|1|8}} of the octahedral and {{frac|1|2}} of the tetrahedral holes of the [[spinel]]-type oxygen lattice, that has cubic close-packing. Tetrahedral sites are split into 5, and octahedral into 6 substitutes, due to cation ordering, which also causes the unit cell edge to be tripled. [[Antimony]], most of [[magnesium]] and trace [[aluminium]] are located on the octahedral (M) sites, trace magnesium, [[zinc]] and [[silicon]] are on the tetrahedral (T) sites. [[Manganese]] and [[iron]] are on both M and T sites.&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4260">{{short description|A database of temperature, precipitation and pressure records}}
The '''Global Historical Climatology Network''' (GHCN) is a database of [[temperature]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[pressure]] records managed by the [[National Climatic Data Center]], [[Arizona State University]] and the [[Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center]].&lt;ref name=Peterson_Vose_1997Overview&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peterson, Thomas C. and Russell S. Vose|year=1997|title=An overview of the Global Historical Climatology Network temperature data base|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=78|pages=2837–2849|doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078&lt;2837:AOOTGH&gt;2.0.CO;2|citeseerx = 10.1.1.170.6141|accessdate=&lt;!-- May 9, 2014 --&gt;|issn=1520-0477|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aggregate data are collected from many continuously reporting fixed stations at the [[Earth]]'s surface and represent the input of approximately 6000 temperature stations, 7500 precipitation stations and 2000 pressure stations.

This work has often been used as a foundation for reconstructing past [[instrumental temperature record|global temperatures]], and was used in previous versions of two of the best-known reconstructions, that prepared by the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC), and that prepared by [[NASA]] as its [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS) temperature set.&lt;ref name=NASA_GISS&gt;{{citation|url=http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/|title=GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)|date=nd|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average temperature record is 60 years long with ~1650 records greater than 100 years and ~220 greater than 150 years (based on GHCN v2 in 2006).  The earliest data included in the database were collected in 1697.

==Map and description==
[[Image:GHCN Temperature Stations.png|thumb|400px|Map of temperature station locations with record lengths indicated by coloring.]]

The GHCN is one of the primary reference compilations of temperature data used for [[climatology]], and is the foundation of the [http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ GISTEMP Temperature Record]. This map shows the 7,280 fixed temperature stations in the GHCN catalog color-coded by the length of the available record. Sites that are actively updated in the database (2,277) are marked as "active" and shown in large symbols, other sites are marked as "historical" and shown in small symbols. In some cases, the "historical" sites are still collecting data but due to reporting and data processing delays (of more than a decade in some cases) they do not contribute to current temperature estimates.

As is evident from this plot, the most densely instrumented portion of the globe is in the [[:en:United States|United States]], while [[:en:Antarctica|Antarctica]] is the most sparsely instrumented land area. Parts of the [[Pacific]] and other [[oceans]] are more isolated from fixed temperature stations, but this is supplemented by volunteer observing ships that record temperature information during their normal travels. This image shows 3,832 records longer than 50 years, 1,656 records longer than 100 years, and 226 records longer than 150 years. The longest record in the collection began in [[Berlin]] in 1701 and is still collected in the present day.

The '''history of geomagnetism''' is concerned with the history of the study of [[Earth's magnetic field]]. It encompasses the history of navigation using [[compass]]es, studies of the prehistoric magnetic field (archeomagnetism and [[paleomagnetism]]), and applications to [[plate tectonics]].

Magnetism has been known since prehistory, but knowledge of the Earth's field developed slowly. The horizontal direction of the Earth's field was first measured in the fourth century BC but the vertical direction was not measured until 1544 AD and the intensity was first measured in 1791. At first, compasses were thought to point towards locations in the heavens, then towards magnetic mountains. A modern experimental approach to understanding the Earth's field began with ''[[de Magnete]]'', a book published by [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] in 1600. His experiments with a magnetic model of the Earth convinced him that the Earth itself is a large magnet.

==Early ideas on magnetism==

Knowledge of the existence of magnetism probably dates back to the prehistoric development of iron [[smelting]]. Iron can be obtained on the Earth's surface from [[meteorite]]s; the mineral [[lodestone]] is rich in the magnetic mineral [[magnetite]] and can be magnetized by a lightning strike.  In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] recounts a legend about a [[Magnes the shepherd]] on the island of [[Crete]] whose iron-studded boots kept sticking to the path.  The earliest ideas on the nature of magnetism are attributed to [[Thales]] ({{circa|624}} BC &amp;ndash; {{circa|546}} BC).&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2&gt;{{harvnb|Jonkers|2003|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical antiquity]], little was known about the nature of magnetism. No sources mention the two poles of a magnet or its tendency to point northward. There were two main theories about the origins of magnetism. One, proposed by [[Empedocles]] of Acragas and taken up by [[Plato]] and [[Plutarch]], invoked an invisible ''effluvium'' seeping through the pores of materials; [[Democritus]] of Abdera replaced this effluvium by atoms, but the mechanism was essentially the same. The other theory evoked the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle of ''sympathy'' between similar objects. This was mediated by a purposeful life force that strove toward perfection. This theory can be found in the writings of Pliny the Elder and [[Aristotle]], who claimed that [[Thales]] attributed a soul to the magnet.&lt;ref name="Jonkers2003ch2"/&gt; In China, a similar life force, or ''[[qi]]'', was believed to animate magnets, so the Chinese used early compasses for [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name=Temple2006&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|2006|pp=162&amp;ndash;166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little changed in the view of magnetism during the [[Middle Ages]], and some classical ideas lingered until well after the first scientific experiments on magnetism. One belief, dating back to Pliny, was that fumes from eating garlic and onions could destroy the magnetism in a compass, rendering it useless. Even after [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] disproved this in 1600, there were reports of helmsmen on British ships being flogged for eating garlic.&lt;ref name=Stern2003sec2/&gt; However, this belief was far from universal. In 1558 [[Giambattista della Porta]] reported "When I enquired of mariners whether it were so that they were forbid to eat onyones and garlick for that reason, they said they were old wives fables and things ridiculous, and that sea-men would sooner lose their lives then abstain from eating onyons and garlick."&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch6&gt;{{harvnb|Jonkers|2003|loc=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement of the field ==
{{See also|Earth's magnetic field#Description}}
[[File:GeomagCoords.png|thumb|right|Illustration of the coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field. The coordinates X,Y,Z correspond to North, East and down; D is the declination and I is the inclination.]]
At a given location, a full representation of the Earth's magnetic field requires a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] with three coordinates (see figure). These can be [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] (North, East and Down) or [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] ([[Magnetic declination|declination]], [[Magnetic dip|inclination]] and intensity). In the latter system, the declination (the deviation from [[true north]], a horizontal angle) must be measured first to establish the direction of magnetic North; then the dip (a vertical angle) can be measured relative to magnetic North.&lt;ref name=MMMch2&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the horizontal direction was measured as early as the fourth century BC, and the existence of declination first recognized in 1088. In Europe, this was not widely accepted until the middle of the fifteenth century AD. Inclination (also known as ''magnetic dip'') was first measured in 1544 AD. The intensity was not measured until 1791, after advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]].

===Declination===
{{Main|Compass#History}}
[[Image:Boussole marine.png|thumb|right|An [[azimuth compass]] has visors of unequal height, allowing the sighting of objects above the horizon.]]
The magnetic [[compass]] existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for [[feng shui]] as for [[navigation]] on land. It was not until good [[steel]] needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their [[magnetism]] for long. The existence of magnetic declination, the difference between magnetic north and true north, was first recognized by [[Shen Kuo]] in 1088.&lt;ref name=Temple2006/&gt;

The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD by [[Alexander Neckam]]. He described it as a common navigational aid for sailors, so the compass must have been introduced to Europe some time earlier. Whether the knowledge came from China to Europe, or was invented separately, is not clear. If the knowledge was transmitted, the most likely intermediary was Arab merchants, but Arabic literature does not mention the compass until after Neckam. There is also a difference in convention: Chinese compasses point south while European compasses point north.&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch1/&gt;

In 1269, Pierre de Maricourt (commonly referred to as ''[[Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt|Petrus Peregrinus]]'') wrote a letter to a friend in which he described two kinds of compass, one in which an oval lodestone floated in a bowl of water, and the first dry compass with the needle mounted on a pivot. He also was the first to write about experiments with magnetism and describe the laws of attraction. An example is the experiment where a magnet is broken into two pieces and the two pieces can attract and repel each other (in modern terms, they both have north and south poles).&lt;ref name=Courtillot2007&gt;{{harvnb|Courtillot|Le Mouël|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter, generally referred to as ''Epistola de Magnete'', was a landmark in the history of science.&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;

Petrus Peregrinus assumed that compasses point towards true north. While his contemporary [[Roger Bacon]] is reputed to observe that compasses deviated from true north, the idea of magnetic declination was only gradually accepted. At first it was thought that the declination must be the result of systematic error. However, by the middle of the fifteenth century, sundials in Germany were oriented using corrections for declination.&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch2/&gt;

===Inclination===
A compass must be balanced to counter the tendency of the needle to dip in the direction of the Earth's field. Otherwise, it will not spin freely. Often, compasses that are balanced for one latitude do not work as well at a different latitude. This problem was first reported by [[Georg Hartmann]], a vicar in Nuremberg, in 1544. [[Robert Norman]] was the first to recognize that this occurs because the Earth's field itself is tilted from the vertical. In his book ''The Newe Attractive'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Robert|title=The newe attractive|year=1974|publisher=Theatrum Orbis Terrarum|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-221-0616-7|origyear = First published in 1581 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j9A4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=The+Newe+Attractive#PPP7,M2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman called inclination "a newe discouered secret and subtil propertie concernyng the Declinyng of the Needle." He created a compass in which the needle was floated in a goblet of water, attached to a cork to make it neutrally buoyant. The needle could orient itself in any direction, so it dipped to align itself with the Earth's field. Norman also created a [[dip circle]], a compass needle pivoted about a horizontal axis, to measure the effect.&lt;ref name=Stern2003sec2&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|2003|loc=Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch2/&gt;

==Early ideas about the source==
[[Image:Rupes Nigra.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a map by Mercator showing the "very high black rock" at the North Pole |alt=Old hand-drawn and colored map.]]
In early attempts to understand the Earth's magnetic field, measuring it was only part of the challenge. Understanding the measurements was also difficult because the mathematical and physical concepts had not yet been developed &amp;ndash; in particular, the concept of a [[vector field]] that associates a vector with each point in space. The Earth's field is generally represented by [[field line]]s that run from pole to pole; the field at any point is parallel to a field line but does not have to point at either pole.  As late as the eighteenth century, however, a [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] would believe that a magnet had to be pointing directly at something. Thus, the Earth's magnetic field had to be explained by localized sources, and as more was learned about the Earth's field, these sources became increasingly complex.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;

At first, in both China and Europe, the source was assumed to be in the heavens &amp;ndash; either the [[celestial pole]]s or the [[Pole star]]. These theories required that magnets point at (or very close to) [[true north]], so they ran into difficulty when the existence of [[declination]] was accepted. Then natural philosophers began to propose earthly sources such as a rock or mountain.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;

Legends about magnetic mountains go back to the classical era. [[Ptolemy]] recounted a legend about magnetic islands (now thought to be near [[Borneo]]) that exerted such a strong attraction on ships with nails that the ships were held in place and could not move. Even more dramatic was the Arab legend (recounted in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'') that a magnetic mountain could pull all the nails out of a ship, causing the ship to fall apart and founder. The story passed to Europe and became part of several epic tales.&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;

Europeans started to place magnetic mountains on their maps in the sixteenth century. A notable example is [[Gerardus Mercator]], whose famous maps included a magnetic mountain or two near the North Pole. At first, he just placed a mountain in an arbitrary location; but later he attempted to measure its location based on declinations from different locations in Europe. When subsequent measurements resulted in two contradictory estimates for the mountain, he simply placed two mountains on the map.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch2/&gt;

== Beginnings of modern science ==

===William Gilbert===
{{Quote|Magnus magnes ipse est globus terrestris. (The Earth itself is a great magnet.)|William Gilbert|''De Magnete''}}
1600 was a notable year for [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]. He became president of the [[Royal College of Physicians of London]], was appointed personal physician for [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], and wrote ''[[De Magnete]]'', one of the books that mark the beginning of modern science. ''De Magnete'' is most famous for introducing (or at least popularizing) an experimental approach to science and deducing that the Earth is a great magnet.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's book is divided into six chapters. The first is an introduction in which he discusses the importance of experiment and various facts about the Earth, including the insignificance of surface topography compared to the [[Earth radius|radius of the Earth]]. He also announces his deduction that the Earth is a great magnet. In book 2, Gilbert deals with "coition", or the laws of attraction. Gilbert distinguishes between magnetism and [[electrostatics|static electricity]] (the latter being induced by rubbing [[amber]]) and reports many experiments with both (some dating back to Peregrinus). One involves breaking a magnet in two and showing that both parts have a north and south pole.&lt;ref name=Courtillot2007/&gt; He also dismisses the idea of [[perpetual motion]]. The third book has a general description of magnetic directions along with details on how to magnetize a needle. He also introduces his ''terella'', or "little Earth". This is a magnetized sphere that he uses to model the magnetic properties of the Earth. In chapters 4 and 5 he goes into more detail about the two components of the direction, declination and inclination.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch3&gt;{{harvnb|Jonkers|2003|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch3&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2010|loc=Chapter3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1590s [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]], a professor of geometry at [[Gresham College]] in London, had published a table of magnetic inclination with latitude for the earth. It agreed well with the inclinations that Gilbert measured around the circumference of his terella. Gilbert deduced that the Earth's magnetic field is equivalent to that of a uniformly magnetized sphere, magnetized parallel to the [[Earth's rotation|axis of rotation]] (in modern terms, a ''geocentric axial dipole''). However, he was aware that declinations were not consistent with this model. Based on the declinations that were known at the time, he proposed that the continents, because of their raised [[topography]], formed centers of attraction that made compass needles deviate. He even demonstrated this effect by gouging out some topography on his terella and measuring the effect on declinations. A [[Jesuit]] monk, [[Niccolò Cabeo]], later took a leaf from Gilbert's book and showed that, if the topography was on the correct scale for the Earth, the differences between the highs and lows would only be about one tenth of a millimeter. Therefore, the continents could not noticeably affect the declination.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch3/&gt;

The sixth book of ''de Magnete'' was devoted to [[cosmology]]. He dismissed the prevailing [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic Model|Ptolemaic model]] of the universe, in which the planets and stars are organized in a series of concentric shells rotating about the Earth, on the grounds that the speeds involved would be absurdly large ("there cannot be [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] motion of infinity").&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch3/&gt; Instead, the Earth was rotating about its own axis. In place of the concentric shells, he proposed that the heavenly bodies interacted with each other and Earth through magnetic forces. Magnetism maintained the Earths position and made it rotate, while the magnetic attraction of the [[Moon]] drove the [[tides]]. Some obscure reasoning led to the peculiar conclusion that a terella, if freely suspended, would orient itself in the same direction as the Earth and rotate daily.  Both [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] would adopt Gilbert's idea of magnetic attraction between heavenly bodies, but [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] would render it obsolete.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch3/&gt;

===Guillaume le Nautonier===
In about 1603, the Frenchman Guillaume le Nautonier (William the Navigator),&lt;ref&gt;Some reputable sources (including {{harvnb|Turner|2010|loc=Chapter 3}} and {{harvnb|Jonkers|2003|loc=Chapter 2}}) refer to him as Guillaume de Nautonier, which would translate as "William of Navigator". Others, including {{harvnb|Courtillot|Le Mouël|2007}}, refer to him as "le Nautonier" ("the navigator").&lt;/ref&gt; Sieur de [[Castelfranc]], published a rival theory of the Earth's field in his book ''Mecometrie de l'eymant (Measurement of longitude with a magnet)''. Le Nautonier was a mathematician, astronomer and Royal Geographer in the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]. He disagreed with Gilbert's assumption that the Earth had to be magnetized parallel to the rotational axis, and instead produced a model in which the magnetic moment was tilted by {{formatnum:22.5}}° &amp;ndash; in effect, the first tilted dipole model. The last 196 pages of his book were taken up with tables of latitudes and longitudes with declination and inclination for use by mariners. If his model had been accurate, it could have been used to determine both latitude and longitude using a combination of magnetic declination and astronomical observations.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Courtillot2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch3/&gt;

Le Nautonier tried to sell his model to Henry IV, and his son to the English leader [[Oliver Cromwell]], both without success. It was widely criticized, with Didier Dounot concluding that the work was based on "unfounded assumptions, errors in calculation and data manipulation". However, the geophysicist Jean-Paul Poirier examined the works of both le Nautonier and Dounot, and found that the error was in Dounot's reasoning.&lt;ref name=Courtillot2007/&gt;

===Temporal variation===
[[File:Halleold.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Edmond Halley holding an image of his concentric spheres theory.]]
One of Gilbert's conclusions was that the Earth's field could not vary in time. This was soon to be proved false by a series of measurements in London. In 1580, [[William Borough]] measured the declination and found it to be 11{{1/4}}° NE. In 1622, [[Edmund Gunter]] found it to be 5° 56' NE. He noted the difference from Borough's result but concluded that Borough must have made a measurement error. In 1633, [[Henry Gellibrand]] measured the declination in the same location and found it to be 4° 05' NE. Because of the care with which Gunther had made his measurements, Gellibrand was confident that the changes were real. In 1635 he published ''A Discourse Mathematical on the Variation of the Magneticall Needle'' stating that the declination had changed by more than 7° in 54 years. The reality of [[geomagnetic secular variation]] was rapidly accepted in England, where Gellibrand had a high reputation, but in other countries it was met with skepticism until it was confirmed by further measurements.&lt;ref name=Jonkers2003ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch4&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2010|loc=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observations of Gellibrand inspired extensive efforts to determine the nature of variation - global or local, predictable or erratic. It also inspired new models for the origin of the field. Henry Bond Senior gained notoriety by successfully predicting in 1639 that the declination would be zero in London in 1657. His model, which involved a precessing dipole, was strongly criticized by a royal commission, but it continued to be published in navigational instruction manuals for decades. Dynamic models involving multiple poles were also proposed by Peter Perkins (1680) and [[Edmond Halley]] (1683, 1692), among others. In Halley's model, the Earth consisted of concentric spheres. Two magnetic poles were on a fixed outer sphere and two more were on an inner sphere that rotated westwards, giving rise to a "westward drift". Halley was so proud of this theory that a portrait of him at the age of eighty included a diagram of it.&lt;ref name=OMEch1&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|2010|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic navigation==
[[Image:Guillaume Brouscon. World chart, which includes America and a large Terra Java (Australia). HM 46. PORTOLAN ATLAS and NAUTICAL ALMANAC. France, 1543.C.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a world map published by Guillaume Brouscon in 1543, showing rhumb lines for navigation |alt=Hand drawn and colored map]]
Early mariners used [[portolan chart]]s for navigation. These charts showed coastline with [[rhumb line]]s connecting ports. A mariner could navigate by aligning the chart with a compass and following the compass heading. Early charts had distorted coastlines because the cartographers did not know about declination, but the charts still worked because mariners were sailing in straight lines.&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch2&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2010|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While boats mainly plied seas the size of the Mediterranean, rhumb lines were sufficient for navigation. However, when they ventured into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, it was no longer sufficient to plot a straight-line course from one destination to another.&lt;ref&gt;An exception is [[Christopher Columbus]], who used [[dead reckoning]] and a fixed compass direction {{harv|Pickering|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mariners needed to determine their latitude and longitude.

In the [[Age of Sail]], dating from the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century, international trade was dominated by sailing ships. More than one European government offered a generous prize to the first person who could accurately determine longitude. The British prize, the [[Longitude rewards|longitude prize]], led to the development of the [[marine chronometer]] by [[John Harrison]], a clockmaker from [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=Turner2010ch2/&gt;

The''' International Union for Vacuum Science, Technique, and Applications''' (IUVSTA) is a union of 33 science and technology national member societies whose role is to stimulate international collaboration in the fields of vacuum science, technique and applications, and related multi-disciplinary topics.

IUVSTA is a Member Scientific Associate of the '''[[International Council for Science]]''' (ICSU).

Founded in 1958, IUVSTA is an interdisciplinary union which represents several thousands of [[physicists]], [[chemist]]s, [[Materials science|materials scientists]], [[engineer]]s and [[technologist (disambiguation)|technologist]]s who are active in basic and applied [[research]], development, [[manufacturing]], [[sales]] and [[education]]. IUVSTA finances advanced scientific workshops, international schools and technical courses, worldwide.

IUVSTA comprises member societies from the following countries:
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,  [[The British Vacuum Council|United Kingdom]], and [[American Vacuum Society|USA]].

The main purposes of the IUVSTA are to organize and sponsor international conferences and educational activities, as well as to facilitate research and technological developments in the field of vacuum science and its applications.

The history and structure of the Union are described in two articles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= 1984 IUVSTA history article by J. M.

'''''Kubrick the Dog''''' is a 2011 non-fiction photography book by British director [[Sean Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vogue Photog Sean Ellis' Book About His Best Friend: Kubrick the Dog|url=http://racked.com/archives/2010/10/18/vogue-photog-sean-ellis-book-about-his-best-friend-kubrick-the-dog.php|publisher=Racked|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on February 28, 2011 through [[G. Schirmer|Schirmer Books]] and focuses on the life of Ellis's dog Kubrick. ''Kubrick the Dog'' features several photos of Kubrick, a [[Hungarian Vizsla]] that Ellis adopted as a puppy in 1998, in several poses and with different people such as [[Stella McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spicer|first=Kate|title=Dog days|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/living/Emotions/article414621.ece|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis began working on the book in 2010 after Kubrick's death by [[canine lymphoma]] as a way of working through his grief over the dog's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modefotograf Sean Ellis Der Hund, dem die Models zu Füßen lagen|url=http://www.fr-online.de/panorama/der-hund--dem-die-models-zu-fuessen-lagen,1472782,4816188.html|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=Frankfurter Rundschau|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception for the book was mostly positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Im eigenen Pelz|url=http://www.taz.de/!64499/|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=die Tageszeitung|date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bildband "Kubrick The Dog" : Der Hund und die Topmodels|url=http://www.rp-online.de/kultur/kunst/der-hund-und-die-topmodels-1.2002834|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=Rheinische Post|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basler Zeitung]] gave an overall positive review, stating that although some of the photographs felt a little deliberate, the book was also stirring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Showtime für den Hund|url=http://bazonline.ch/kultur/buecher/Showtime-fuer-den-Hund-/story/14796332|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=Basler Zeitung|date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogeny]] published in 2014 revealed that the genus ''Eulophia'' was [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] unless a clade containing ''[[Orthochilus]]'' was recognized, 34 species and one subspecies were transferred to the resurrected genus ''Orthochilus'', which included many ''Eulophia'' and all ''Pteroglossaspis'' taxa. This reduced the number of ''Eulophia'' species from 201 to 165. The authors also suggested recognizing ''[[Oeceoclades pulchra]]'' instead of ''Eulophia pulchra''. The taxa formerly recognized in ''Eulophia'' include:&lt;ref name="Martos et al. 2014"&gt;Martos, F., S.D. Johnson, C.I. Peter, and B. Bytebier. 2014.

This is a '''list of sovereign states and territories by [[carbon dioxide]] emissions''' due to certain forms of human activity, based on the EDGAR database created by [[European Commission]] and [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] released in 2015. The following table lists the 2015 annual {{CO2}} emissions estimates (in thousands of {{CO2}} tonnes) along with a list of emissions per capita (in tonnes of {{CO2}} per year) from same source. The data only considers carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and [[cement industry|cement manufacture]], but not emissions from [[land use, land-use change and forestry]]. Emissions from international shipping or [[bunker fuel]]s are also not included in national figures,&lt;ref name="Schrooten2"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Schrooten  | first = L  | title = Inventory and forecasting of maritime emissions in the Belgian sea territory, an activity based emission model  | journal = Atmospheric Environment  | volume = 42  | pages = 667–676  | year = 2008  | url =   | doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.09.071  | pmid =  | month =   | last2 = De Vlieger  | first2 = Ina  | last3 = Int Panis  | first3 = Luc  | last4 = Styns, R.

Old growth is defined as those forests that have not been logged (and have not been significantly disturbed by human beings) in the last 150 years. "Virgin forests" are those old-growth forests that show no sign of having ever been logged. 

A total of {{convert|2742|acre|ha}} of old-growth forest has been identified in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = "OldGrowthEastUS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/survey.html |title=Old Growth in the East: A Survey |author=Mary Byrd Davis |date= 23 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217114843/http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/survey.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts' old growth occurs almost entirely within the [[Northeastern Highlands (ecoregion)|Northeastern Highlands]] ecoregion.  The following list identifies some of the sites and their locations:&lt;ref name = "DamatoMassachesetts"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90945">This is a list of the power supply systems that are, or have been, used for tramway and [[railway electrification system]]s.

Note that the voltages are nominal and vary depending on load and distance from the substation.

Many modern trams and trains use on-board solid-state electronics to convert these supplies to run [[three-phase]] AC induction motors.

==Key to the tables below==
* Volts: [[voltage]] or [[volt]]
* Current:
** DC = [[direct current]]
** xx Hz = [[frequency]] in [[hertz]] ([[alternating current]] (AC))
*** AC supplies are [[single-phase electric power|single-phase]], except where marked [[three-phase electric power|three-phase]]
* Conductors:
**[[overhead line]] or
**conductor rail, usually a [[third rail]] to one side of the running rails
*** Conductor rail can be:
**** top contact: oldest, least safe, affected by ice, snow and leaves
**** side contact: newer, safer, less affected by ice, snow and leaves
**** bottom contact: newer, safer, least affected by ice, snow and leaves

==Systems using standard voltages==
{{see also|Railway electrification system#Voltage}}
Voltages are defined by two standards: BS&amp;nbsp;EN&amp;nbsp;50163{{sfnp|BS EN 50163|2007}} and IEC&amp;nbsp;60850.{{sfnp|IEC 60850|2007}}

===Overhead systems===

====600 V DC====

This voltage is mostly used by older tram systems worldwide but by a few new ones as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9700">This is a '''list of rivers of Finland'''. Listing begins with rivers flowing into the Baltic sea, from the north, that is from the Swedish border. Tributaries are listed down the page in an upstream direction.

Water flows from Finland directly to the [[Baltic Sea]], which is divided here into the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] and [[Gulf of Finland]], and the [[Archipelago Sea]] between them. Some rivers flow to [[Russia]], ending either to Gulf of Finland or to the [[White Sea]], and a few to the [[Arctic Ocean]] through Russia or [[Norway]].

There are a lot of lakes in Finland and so this listing includes also several lakes through which the rivers flow or begin from. Due to the great number of lakes especially in the [[Finnish Lakeland]], where watercources tend to consist of chains of lakes rather than long rivers, some rivers with a large catchment area can also be quite short or there may only be a short [[rapid]] between large lakes, like for example [[Tammerkoski]] in Tampere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="581">The traditional star name '''Muscida''' has been applied to:
* [[Omicron Ursae Majoris|ο Ursae Majoris]] (1 Ursae Majoris)
* [[Pi Ursae Majoris|π Ursae Majoris]], an optical double star consisting of:
** [[Pi1 Ursae Majoris|π¹ Ursae Majoris]] (3 Ursae Majoris)
** [[Pi2 Ursae Majoris|π² Ursae Majoris]] (4 Ursae Majoris)

The name derives from the post classical [[Latin language|Latin]] ''musus'', meaning "snout, or muzzle [of the bear]".

{{Geological era}}
The '''Neoproterozoic Era''' is the unit of [[geologic time scale|geologic time]] from {{Ma|Neoproterozoic|Cambrian}}.&lt;ref name=Ogg2008&gt;{{cite book

  | first = James G.

It is the last era of the [[Precambrian]] Supereon and the [[Proterozoic]] Eon; it is subdivided into the [[Tonian]], [[Cryogenian]], and [[Ediacaran]] Periods. It is preceded by the [[Mesoproterozoic]] era and succeeded by the [[Paleozoic]] era.

The most severe [[glaciation]] known in the geologic record occurred during the Cryogenian, when [[ice sheet]]s reached the [[equator]] and formed a possible "[[Snowball Earth]]".

The earliest fossils of [[metazoa|multicellular life]] are found in the Ediacaran, including the [[Ediacarans]], which were the earliest [[animal]]s.

According to Rino and co-workers, the sum of the [[continental crust]] formed in the [[Pan-African orogeny]] and the [[Grenville orogeny]] makes the Neoproterozoic the period of Earth's history that has produced most continental crust.&lt;ref name=Rinoetal2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rino |first=S. |last2=Kon |first2=Y. |last3=Sato |first3=W. |last4=Maruyama |first4=S. |last5=Santosh |first5=M. |last6=Zhao |first6=D. |date=2008 |title=The Grenvillian and Pan-African orogens: World's largest orogenies through geologic time, and their implications on the origin of superplume |url= |journal=[[Gondwana Research]] |publisher= |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=51–72 |doi=10.1016/j.gr.2008.01.001 |bibcode=2008GondR..14...51R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
At the onset of the Neoproterozoic the supercontinent [[Rodinia]], which had assembled during the late Mesoproterozoic, straddled the equator. During the Tonian, rifting commenced which broke Rodinia into a number of individual land masses.

Possibly as a consequence of the low-latitude position of most continents, several large-scale glacial events occurred during the Neoproterozoic Era including the [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]] glaciations of the Cryogenian Period.

These glaciations are believed to have been so severe that there were ice sheets at the equator—a state known as the "[[Snowball Earth]]".

==Subdivisions==
Russian geologists divide the Neoproterozoic of [[Siberia]] into the {{anchor|Baikalian}}'''Baikalian''' from 850 to 650 Ma (loosely equivalent to the Cryogenian), which follows the {{anchor|Mayanian}}'''Mayanian''', from 1000 to 850 Ma, then the {{anchor|Aimchanian}}'''Aimchanian'''.&lt;ref name='Khomentovsky2008'&gt;{{cite journal

==Paleobiology==
{{main|Ediacara biota}}

The idea of the Neoproterozoic Era was introduced in the 1960s. Nineteenth-century paleontologists set the start of [[metazoan|multicelled]] life at the first appearance of hard-shelled animals called [[trilobite]]s and [[Archaeocyatha|archeocyathid sponges]]. This set the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] Period. In the early 20th century, paleontologists started finding fossils of multicellular animals that predated the start of the Cambrian. A complex fauna was found in South West [[Africa]] in the 1920s but was inaccurately dated. Another fauna was found in South Australia in the 1940s but was not thoroughly examined until the late 1950s. Other possible early fossils were found in Russia, England, Canada, and elsewhere (see [[Ediacaran biota]]). Some were determined to be [[pseudofossil]]s, but others were revealed to be members of rather complex biotas that are still poorly understood. At least 25 regions worldwide yielded [[metazoan]] fossils older than the classical Cambrian boundary at {{Ma|541}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A few of the early animals appear possibly to be ancestors of modern animals. Most fall into ambiguous groups of frond-like organisms; discoids that might be holdfasts for stalked organisms ("medusoids"); mattress-like forms; small calcareous tubes; and armored animals of unknown provenance.

These were most commonly known as [[Vendian biota]] until the formal naming of the Period, and are currently known as Ediacaran Period biota. Most were soft bodied. The relationships, if any, to modern forms are obscure. Some paleontologists relate many or most of these forms to modern animals. Others acknowledge a few possible or even likely relationships but feel that most of the Ediacaran forms are representatives of unknown animal types.

In addition to Ediacaran biota, two other types of biota were discovered in China (the [[Doushantuo Formation]] and [[Hainan Formation]]).

==Terminal period==
{{main|Ediacaran}}

The nomenclature for the terminal Period of the Neoproterozoic Era has been unstable. Russian and Nordic geologists referred to the last period of the Neoproterozoic as the [[Vendian]], while Chinese geologists referred to it as the [[Sinian]], and most Australians and North Americans used the name Ediacaran.

However, in 2004, the International Union of Geological Sciences ratified the Ediacaran Period to be a geological age of the Neoproterozoic, ranging from {{Period start|Ediacaran}} to {{Period end|Ediacaran}} million years ago.&lt;ref name=Ogg2008 /&gt; The Ediacaran Period boundaries are the only Precambrian boundaries defined by biologic [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]]s, rather than the absolute [[Global Standard Stratigraphic Age]]s.

'''Oil Pollution Act of 1961''', 33 U.S.C. Chapter 20 §§ 1001-1011, established judicial definitions and coastal prohibitions for the United States maritime industry. The Act invoked the accords of the International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954. The international agreement provided provisions to control the discharge of [[fossil fuel]] [[Pollutants#Pollutants|pollutants]] from [[Chemical tanker|nautical vessels]] on the [[International waters|high seas]].

The S. 2187 [[legislation]] was passed by the United States 87th Congressional session and enacted by the [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|35th President of the United States]] John F. Kennedy on August 30, 1961.

==History==
The [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil]] (OILPOL) was an [[Public international law|international convention]] organized by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1954. The convention was held in [[London|London, England]] from April 26, 1954 to May 12, 1954. The international meeting was convened to acknowledge the disposal of harmful waste which posed endangerment to the [[Marine ecosystem|marine ecosystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpol1954.html |title=International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 |date=May 12, 1954 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 original text was penned in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The 1954 international agreement was amended in 1962, 1969, and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpolamend1962.html |title=Amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil of 12 May 1954 |date=April 11, 1962 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpolamend1969.html |title=Amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil of 12 May 1954 |date=October 21, 1969 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act emulated the subsequent formalities of the International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.

The '''Pacific–North American teleconnection pattern''' ('''PNA''') is a [[climate|climatological]] term for a large-scale weather pattern with two modes, denoted positive and negative, and which relates the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] circulation pattern over the North [[Pacific Ocean]] with the one over the [[North America]]n continent.

The positive phase of the PNA pattern features above-average [[barometric pressure]] heights in the vicinity of [[Hawaii]] and over the inter-mountain region of [[North America]], and below-average heights located south of the [[Aleutian Islands]] and over the southeastern United States. The PNA pattern is associated with strong fluctuations in the strength and location of the East Asian [[jet stream]]. The positive phase is associated with an enhanced East Asian jet stream and with an eastward shift in the jet exit region toward the western United States. The negative phase is associated with a westward retraction of that jet stream toward eastern Asia, blocking activity over the high latitudes of the North Pacific, and a strong split-flow configuration over the central North Pacific.

The positive phase of the PNA pattern is associated with above-average temperatures over western [[Canada]] and the extreme western United States, and below-average temperatures across the south-central and southeastern US. The PNA tends to have little impact on surface temperature variability over North America during summer. The associated precipitation anomalies include above-average totals in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] extending into the Pacific Northwestern United States, and below-average totals over the upper Midwestern United States.

The negative PNA phase is associated with the opposite.

Although the PNA pattern is a natural internal mode of climate variability, it is also strongly influenced by the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) phenomenon. The positive phase of the PNA pattern tends to be associated with Pacific warm episodes (El Niño), and the negative phase tends to be associated with Pacific cold episodes (La Niña).

The '''[[petroleum industry]] in Kenya''' is relatively new in term of mining and exploration. Oil was first discovered in 2012 by a [[United Kingdom|British]] firm [[Tullow]] oil. As to whether they are commercially viable is still being analysed. Currently, the oil industry is controlled by importation and refining.

==History==
[[File:Oil Exploration Blocks in Kenya.jpg|thumb|Oil Exploration Blocks in Kenya]]
The history of oil marketing in Kenya began in 1903 during colonial times. Initially, [[kerosene]] was the main import in tins but later gasoline was imported in tins and drums. [[Royal Dutch Shell]] established the first depot on the [[Mombasa island]] at Shimanzi.

In 2006, [[Uganda]] confirmed the discovery of significant quantities of oil reserves in the Albertine Graben region. By the end of 2013, oil deposits were estimated to be 3.5 billion barrels. In 2014 Uganda has revised oil reserves to 6.5 billion barrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/katine/2009/dec/02/oil-benefits-rural-uganda|title=Great expectations in Uganda over oil discovery|last=Kavuma|first=Richard M.|date=2009-12-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/uganda-announces-oil-discovery-296822|title=Uganda announces oil discovery {{!}} IOL|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Deloitte in 2013, Kenya has four prospective sedimentary basins: Anza, Lamu, Mandera and the Tertiary Rift.The Lamu basin extends offshore.&lt;ref&gt;http://docplayer.net/20731674-The-deloitte-guide-to-oil-and-gas-in-east-africa-uniquely-structured.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil is regulated by the Energy Regulation Commission and the [[Ministry of Mining (Kenya)|Ministry of Mining]]. Current traders include the [[National Oil Corporation of Kenya]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], [[Tullow Oil]], [[KenolKobil]], [[MOGAS Group|MOGAS]], Hass, Hashi Energy, [[Gulf Energy SAOC|Gulf Energy]], Olympic, Dalbit Petroleum.

{{GeoGroup|article=Soviet Project K nuclear tests}}

The '''Soviet Union's K project nuclear test series'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a group of 5 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1961-1962. These tests followed the ''[[1961 Soviet nuclear tests]]'' series and preceded the ''[[1962 Soviet nuclear tests]]'' series.

The K project nuclear testing series were all high altitude tests fired by missiles from the [[Kapustin Yar]] launch site in Russia across central Kazakhstan toward the Sary Shagan test range (see map below).

Two of the tests were 1.2 kiloton warheads tested in 1961.  The remaining three tests were of 300 kiloton warheads in 1962.

== Electromagnetic pulse ==

The worst effects of a Soviet high altitude test were from the [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] of the nuclear test on 22 October 1962 (during the [[Cuban missile crisis]]).  In that Operation K high altitude test, a 300 [[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] missile-warhead detonated west of [[Jezkazgan]] (also called Dzhezkazgan or Zhezqazghan) at an altitude of {{convert|290|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The Soviet scientists instrumented a {{convert|570|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} section of telephone line in the area that they expected to be affected by the nuclear detonation in order to measure the electromagnetic pulse effects.&lt;ref name="greetsai"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greetsai|first=Vasily N.|author2=Kozlovsky, A.H. |author3=Kuvshinnikov, V.M. |author4=Loborev, V.M. |author5=Parfenov, Y.V. |author6=Tarasov, O.A. |author7= Zdoukhov, L.N. |title=Response of Long Lines to Nuclear High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP)|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility |date=November 1998 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=348–354|doi=10.1109/15.736221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) fused all of the 570-kilometer monitored overhead telephone line with measured currents of 1500 to 3400 [[ampere]]s during the 22 October 1962 test.&lt;ref name="loborev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Loborev.txt| title=US-Russian meeting – HEMP effects on national power grid &amp; telecommunications|date=17 February 1995|first=Howard |last=Seguine|format=TXT|work=memorandum for record}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The monitored telephone line was divided into sub-lines of {{convert|40|to|80|km}} in length, separated by [[repeater]]s.   Each sub-line was protected by [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and by [[Gas-filled tube|gas-filled]] [[overvoltage]] protectors. The EMP from the 22 October (K-3) nuclear test caused all of the fuses to blow and all of the overvoltage protectors to fire in all of the sub-lines of the {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} telephone line.&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt; The EMP from the same test caused the destruction of the [[Karaganda]] power plant, and shut down {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of shallow-buried [[electric power transmission|power cables]] between [[Astana]] (then called Aqmola) and [[Almaty]].&lt;ref name="loborev"/&gt;

The [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] was passed the following year, ending atmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear tests.

[[File:ProjectK.png|right|560px|border|thumb|This map of Kazakhstan shows the missile flight path (in blue) for the K Project warhead-carrying missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Committee on Environmental Policy|title= Environmental Performance Reviews: Kazakhstan. (First Review.)|year=2000| page=78|url=http://www.unece.org/env/epr/epr_studies/kazakhstan.pdf|isbn=92-1-116770-1|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuclear missiles were launched from the [[Kapustin Yar]] site east of Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) in the upper left part of the map. The red burst in the flight path west of Zhezqazghan is the detonation location of the K-3 nuclear test (Test 184).  The detonation locations for the other tests have not been publicized, but from the published detonation altitudes and basic physics, it is known that the other K Project nuclear detonation locations were along the designated flight path between the K-3 detonation site and Saryshagan (at the eastern end of the designated flight path). The instrumented telephone line damaged in the K-3 test went from Zhezqazghan through Qaraghandy (Karaganda), northward to Aqmola (now called Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan) and ended at an unknown location just north of Aqmola.&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt;]]

==Aftereffects==

Although the weapons used in the K Project were much smaller (up to 300 kilotons) than the United States [[Starfish Prime]] test of 1962, the damage caused by the resulting EMP was much greater because the K Project tests were done over a large populated land mass, and at a location where the [[Earth's magnetic field]] was greater. After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the level of this damage was communicated informally to scientists in the United States.&lt;ref name="loborev"/&gt;

After the 1991 Soviet Union collapse, there was a period of a few years of cooperation between United States and Russian scientists on the high-altitude nuclear EMP phenomenon.  In addition, funding was secured to enable Russian scientists to formally report on some of the Soviet EMP results in international scientific journals.&lt;ref name="combatwmd"&gt;Pfeffer, Robert and Shaeffer, D. Lynn. Combating WMD Journal, (2009) Issue 3. pp. 33-38. [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a495245.pdf "A Russian Assessment of Several USSR and US HEMP Tests"]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; As a result, formal scientific documentation of some of the EMP damage in Kazakhstan exists&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="euroem"&gt;Loborev, Vladimir M.

The 1998 IEEE article,&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt; however, does contain a number of details about the measurements of EMP effects on the instrumented {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} telephone line, including details about the fuses that were used and also about the gas-filled overvoltage protectors that were used on that communications line.  According to that paper, the gas-filled overvoltage protectors fired as a result of the voltages induced by the fast E1 component of the EMP, and the fuses were blown as the result of the slow E3 component of the EMP, which caused [[geomagnetically induced currents]] in all of the sub-lines.

The Aqmola (Astana) to Almaty buried power cable was also shut down by the slow E3 component of the EMP.&lt;ref name="loborev"/&gt;

Published reports, including the 1998 IEEE article,&lt;ref name="greetsai"/&gt; have stated that there were significant problems with ceramic insulators on overhead electrical power lines during the tests of the K Project. In 2010, a technical report written for a United States government laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, stated, "Power line insulators were damaged, resulting in a short circuit on the line and some lines detaching from the poles and falling to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=Report Meta-R-320|title=The Early-Time (E1) High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Its Impact on the U.S. Power Grid."

'''Statkraft osmotic power prototype''' is the world's first [[osmotic power]] plant, based on the energy of [[osmosis]]. The power plant is run by [[Statkraft]]. The power plant is located at [[Tofte, Norway|Tofte]] in [[Hurum]], [[Norway]], with rooms at the factory area at [[Södra Cell Tofte]] cellulose factory. The power plant uses the osmotic gradient that occurs when fresh water and salt water meet, separated by a permeable membrane. The salt water pulls fresh water through the membrane and the pressure increases on the salt water side; this pressure increase can be used to produce [[electrical power]] with the use of a normal hydroelectric turbine/generator setup. 

The plant is a prototype developed together with [[Sintef]] and began test power production on 24 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10404158-54.html November 24, 2009, cnet.com: Norway opens world's first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2009/11/30/RTV2324909/ 30 November 2009, itnsource.com: NORWAY: World's first osmotic power plant opens in Tofte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/anb-nyheter/article4722834.ece 24.11.2009, Åpnet verdens første saltkraftanlegg. Oslo (ANB-NTB)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015805/http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/anb-nyheter/article4722834.ece |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway]] officially opened the plant. This plant had been planned since the summer of 2008, with a water usage of 10 litres of fresh water and 20 litres of salt water per second. It is expected to give a power output of between 2-4 [[kW]]. With better membranes it is assumed that the power for a similar plant can be increased to about 10&amp;nbsp;kW. A commercial plant is expected to be built between 2012 and 2015.

In 2013, Statkraft announced that is discontinuing its work to develop osmotic power technology. The larger planned pilot facility, and the future commercial plant, will not be built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/news/statkraft-halts-osmotic-power-investments.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213005850/http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/news/statkraft-halts-osmotic-power-investments.aspx |date=2014-02-13 }} Statkraft halts osmotic power investments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
This type of power generation is very reliable, consisting of only slightly more moving parts than a conventional hydroelectric power plant; in this case the addition of a pair of small pumps to move the fresh and salt water to the membrane surfaces. It is very quiet when operating and requires minimal supervision. In addition, it is expected the plant could respond very quickly as an emergency power source, using the membranes to 'store' power ready in the form of high pressure water; this water could be very quickly fed to the hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity. The expected lifetime of this plant is large; with almost no moving parts (those that do move are very simple and reliable), there will be little wear occurring. The availability of spare parts and upgrade components is also good, meaning that an installed osmotic power plant could be run for many years cost-effectively.

==Disadvantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Whilst highly reliable, simple and cheap to run/maintain, this plant is very expensive to install. The permeable membrane is currently an expensive resource, and to have any meaningful output, a very large membrane area is required. The plant described in this article could reach a power output of 4&amp;nbsp;kW in ideal conditions. By comparison, an open cycle gas turbine a fraction of the size (such as the Rolls-Royce or GE aero-derivative gas turbines) could easily produce greater than 15MW for a fraction of the installation costs, although fuel and maintenance costs would be greater. This is an increase in power output 3750 times greater, with a land usage that is much smaller. Comparing the ideal power output of this plant to the rough average household consumption of a modern home detailed in the article [[domestic energy consumption]], it can be seen that this is a very limited technology - working back the figures, it equates that the average home requires 2&amp;nbsp;kW of power. Bear in mind however that advances in materials technology will likely greatly increase the power output per plant volume over time and thus make this a more useful form of power generation, particularly in remote locations where reliability is key and spare parts are difficult to come by (e.g. difficult-to-access coastal locations with a small stream or river nearby that can provide the fresh water required).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">'''Søllerød Naturpark''' is a protected area of rolling  fields, meadows and small woods in [[Rudersdal Municipality]], some 20 kilometres north of central [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It reaches from '''Søllerød Kirkeskov''' in the south to '''Høje Sandbjerg''' in the north. The area is state-owned and managed by the Danish Nature Agency.

==Description==
Rygård Overdrev ("Rygård Meadows") takes its name after the farm Rygård which is situated in the middle of the park. The oldest of its buildings date from the 1790s.

The '''Triassic''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|t|r|aɪ|ˈ|æ|s|ɪ|k}}) is a [[geologic period]] and [[system (stratigraphy)|system]] which spans 50.6 million years from the end of the [[Permian]] Period 251.9 million years ago ([[annum|Mya]]), to the beginning of the [[Jurassic]] Period {{Period start|Jurassic}} Mya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale|title=ICS - Chart/Time Scale|first=Super|last=User|date=|website=www.stratigraphy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Triassic is the first period of the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]]. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major [[extinction event]]s.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 |format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898 | pages=759–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Triassic began in the wake of the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], which left the Earth's biosphere impoverished; it would take well into the middle of this period for life to recover its former diversity. [[Therapsid]]s and [[archosaur]]s were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time. A specialized subgroup of archosaurs, called [[dinosaur]]s, first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic Period.&lt;ref name = "Brusatte"&gt;{{cite journal

The first true [[mammal]]s, themselves a specialized subgroup of [[therapsid]]s, also evolved during this period, as well as the first flying vertebrates, the [[pterosaur]]s, who, like the [[dinosaur]]s, were a specialized subgroup of [[archosaur]]s. The vast [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] existed until the mid-Triassic, after which it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses, [[Laurasia]] to the north and [[Gondwana]] to the south.

The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121018-triassic-extinctions-hot-global-warming-science-environment/|title="Lethally Hot" Earth Was Devoid of Life—Could It Happen Again?|author=|date=19 October 2012|website=nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with deserts spanning much of Pangaea's interior. However, the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart. The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction, the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], that wiped out many groups and allowed dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic.

The Triassic was named in 1834 by [[Friedrich August von Alberti|Friedrich von Alberti]], after the three distinct rock layers (''tri'' meaning "three") that are found throughout [[Germany]] and northwestern [[Europe]]—[[red bed]]s, capped by marine [[limestone]], followed by a series of terrestrial [[mudstone|mud-]] and [[sandstone]]s—called the "Trias".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Alberti, ''Beitrag zu einer Monographie des bunten Sandsteins, Muschelkalks und Keupers, und die Verbindung dieser Gebilde zu einer Formation'' [Contribution to a monograph on the colored sandstone, shell limestone and mudstone, and the joining of these structures into one formation] (Stuttgart and Tübingen, (Germany):  J. G. Cotta, 1834).  Alberti coined the term "Trias" on  [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ClSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 324] :&lt;br&gt;"… bunter Sandstein, Muschelkalk und Keuper das Resultat einer Periode, ihre Versteinerungen, um mich der Worte E. de Beaumont’s zu bedeinen, die Thermometer einer geologischen Epoche seyen, … also die bis jezt beobachtete Trennung dieser Gebilde in 3 Formationen nicht angemessen, und es mehr dem Begriffe Formation entsprechend sey, sie zu einer Formation, welche ich vorläufig ''Trias'' nennen will, zu verbinden."&lt;br&gt;( … colored sandstone, shell limestone, and mudstone are the result of a period ; their fossils are, to avail myself of the words of E. de Beaumont, the thermometer of a geologic epoch ; … thus the separation of these structures into 3 formations, which has been maintained until now, isn't appropriate, and it is more consistent with the concept of "formation" to join them into one formation, which for now I will name "trias".)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and subdivisions==
The Triassic is usually separated into [[Early Triassic|Early]], [[Middle Triassic|Middle]], and [[Late Triassic]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]]s, and the corresponding rocks are referred to as Lower, Middle, or Upper Triassic. The [[faunal stages]] from the youngest to oldest are:

[[File:(1)Saunders Quarry-1.jpg|thumb|[[Sydney]], [[Australia]] lies on Triassic [[shales]] and sandstones. Almost all of the exposed rocks around Sydney belong to the Triassic [[Sydney sandstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herbert|first1=Chris|last2=Helby|first2=Robin|title=A Guide to the Sydney basin|year=1980|publisher=Geological Survey of NSW|pages=582 |location=Maitland, NSW |isbn=978-0-7240-1250-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the Triassic, almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator and spanning from pole to pole, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land"). From the east, along the equator, the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys sea]] penetrated Pangaea, causing the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] to be closed.

Later in the mid-Triassic a similar sea penetrated along the equator from the west. The remaining shores were surrounded by the world-ocean known as [[Panthalassa]] ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean.

The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in that period—but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangaea, which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]], are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Supergroup|Newark Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/10.html|title=Lecture 10 - Triassic: Newark, Chinle|author=|date=|website=rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a super-continental mass has less shoreline compared to one broken up, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare, despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic [[stratigraphy]] is mostly based on organisms that lived in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as Estheria crustaceans.

===Africa===
At the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, Africa was joined with Earth's other continents in Pangaea.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african" /&gt; Africa shared the supercontinent's relatively uniform fauna which was dominated by [[theropods]], [[prosauropods]] and primitive [[ornithischians]] by the close of the Triassic period.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african" /&gt; Late Triassic fossils are found throughout Africa, but are more common in the south than north.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african" /&gt; The time boundary separating the Permian and Triassic marks the advent of an extinction event with global impact, although African strata from this time period have not been thoroughly studied.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african"&gt;Jacobs, Louis, L. (1997). "African Dinosaurs." ''Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs''. Edited by Phillip J. Currie and Kevin Padian. Academic Press. p. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
At Paleorrota geopark, located in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], the [[Santa Maria Formation]] and [[Caturrita Formation]]s are exposed. In these formations, one of the earliest dinosaurs, ''[[Staurikosaurus]]'', as well as the mammal ancestors ''[[Brasilitherium]]'' and ''[[Brasilodon]]'' have been discovered.

==Climate==
The Triassic continental interior climate was generally hot and dry, so that typical deposits are [[red beds|red bed]] [[sandstone]]s and [[evaporite]]s. There is no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]] at or near either pole; in fact, the polar regions were apparently moist and [[temperate]], providing a climate suitable for forests and vertebrates, including reptiles. Pangaea's large size limited the moderating effect of the global ocean; its [[continental climate]] was highly seasonal, with very hot summers and cold winters.&lt;ref name="Stanley, 452-3"&gt;Stanley, 452-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The strong contrast between the Pangea supercontinent and the global ocean triggered intense cross-equatorial [[monsoons]].&lt;ref name="Stanley, 452-3"/&gt;

The Triassic may have mostly been a dry period, but evidence exists that it was punctuated by several episodes of increased rainfall in tropical and subtropical latitudes of the Tethys Sea and its surrounding land.&lt;ref name=Pretoetal2010&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sediments and fossils suggestive of a more humid climate are known from the Anisian to Ladinian of the Tethysian domain, and from the Carnian and Rhaetian of a larger area that includes also the Boreal domain (e.g., [[Svalbard]] Islands), the [[North America]]n continent, the South [[China]] block and [[Argentina]].

The best studied of such episodes of humid climate, and probably the most intense and widespread, was the [[Carnian Pluvial Event]].

==Life==
[[File:Meyers b15 s0826b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Triassic flora as depicted in [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]] (1885–90)]]
Three categories of organisms can be distinguished in the Triassic record: survivors from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], new groups which flourished briefly, and other new groups which went on to dominate the [[Mesozoic]] Era.

===Flora===
On land, the surviving vascular plants included the [[lycophyte]]s, the dominant [[cycad]]ophytes, [[ginkgophyta]] (represented in modern times by ''[[Ginkgo|Ginkgo biloba]]''), [[ferns]], [[horsetails]] and [[Glossopteridales|glossopterid]]s. The [[spermatophyte]]s, or seed plants, came to dominate the terrestrial flora: in the northern hemisphere, [[conifer]]s, ferns and [[bennettitales]] flourished. ''[[Glossopteris]]'' (a [[seed fern]]) was the dominant southern hemisphere tree during the Early Triassic period.

===Marine fauna===
[[File:Triassic marine vertebrate apex predators.png|thumb|Marine vertebrate apex predators of the Early Triassic]]
[[File:Triassic Utah.JPG|thumb|Middle Triassic marginal marine sequence, southwestern [[Utah]]]]
In [[Ocean|marine environments]], new modern types of [[coral]]s appeared in the Early Triassic, forming small patches of [[reefs]] of modest extent compared to the great reef systems of [[Devonian]] or modern times. [[Serpulidae|Serpulids]] appeared in the Middle Triassic.&lt;ref name=VinnMutvei2009&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microconchids]] were abundant. The shelled [[cephalopod]]s called [[ammonite]]s recovered, diversifying from a single line that survived the Permian extinction.

The fish fauna was remarkably uniform, suggesting that very few families survived the Permian extinction. There were also many types of marine reptiles. These included the [[Sauropterygia]], which featured [[pachypleurosaurus]] and [[nothosaur]]s (both common during the Middle Triassic, especially in the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] region), [[placodont]]s, and the first [[plesiosaur]]s. The first of the lizardlike [[Thalattosauria]] ([[Askeptosaurus|askeptosaurs]]) and the highly successful [[ichthyosaur]]s, which appeared in Early Triassic seas soon diversified, and some eventually developed to huge size during the Late Triassic. Subequatorial [[Saurichthys|saurichthyids]] have also been described in Early Triassic strata.&lt;ref name=Romano17&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Romano |first1=Carlo |last2= Jenks |first2=James F. |last3= Jattiot |first3= Romain |last4= Scheyer |first4= Torsten M. | year = 2017 | title = Marine Early Triassic Actinopterygii from Elko County (Nevada, USA): implications for the Smithian equatorial vertebrate eclipse | journal = Journal of Paleontology |volume=91 |issue=5 | pages = 1–22

Groups of terrestrial fauna, which appeared in the Triassic period or achieved a new level of evolutionary success during it include:&lt;ref name="PREHISTORIC LIFE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual History of Life On Earth|year=2009|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=9780756655730|pages=206, 207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EVOLUTION&gt;{{cite book|authors=Douglas Palmer &amp; Peter Barrett|title=Evolution: The Story of Life|year=2009|publisher=The Natural History Museum|location=London, Britain|isbn=9781845333393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Temnospondyls]]: one of the largest groups of early amphibians, temnospondyls originated during the [[Carboniferous]] and were still significant. Once abundant in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, the terrestrial species had mostly been replaced by reptiles. The Triassic survivors were aquatic or semi-aquatic, and were represented by ''[[Tupilakosaurus]]'', ''[[Thabanchuia]]'', [[Branchiosauridae]] and ''[[Micropholis (amphibian)|Micropholis]]'', all of which died out in Early Triassic, and the successful [[Stereospondyli]], with survivors into the Cretaceous era. The largest of these, such as the ''[[Mastodonsaurus]]'' were up to 13&amp;nbsp;feet in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDKEKy5JJbIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=By+the+Triassic+Period+(245+million+years+ago),+the+temnospondyls#v=onepage&amp;q=By+the+Triassic+Period+(245+million+years+ago),+the+temnospondyls&amp;f=false|title=The Ecology and Behavior of Amphibians|first=Kentwood D.|last=Wells|date=15 February 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780226893334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VThUUUtM8A4C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=At+the+end+of+the+Permian,+the+temnospondyls+largely+died+out#v=onepage&amp;q=At+the+end+of+the+Permian,+the+temnospondyls+largely+died+out&amp;f=false|title=Vertebrate Palaeontology|first=Michael|last=Benton|date=5 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books|isbn=9781405144490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rhynchosaur]]s, barrel-gutted herbivores which thrived for only a short period of time, becoming extinct about 220 million years ago. They were exceptionally abundant in Triassic, the primary large herbivores in many ecosystems. They sheared plants with their beaks and several rows of teeth on the roof of the mouth.
*[[Phytosaurs]]: [[archosaurs]] that prospered during the Late Triassic. These long-snouted and semiaquatic predators resemble living crocodiles and probably had a similar lifestyle, hunting for fish and small reptiles around the water's edge. However this resemblance is only superficial and is a prime-case of convergent evolution.
*[[Aetosaurs]]: heavily armored archosaurs that were common during the last 30 million years of the Late Triassic but died out at the Triassic-Jurassic extinction. Most aetosaurs were herbivorous, and fed on low-growing plants but some may have eaten meat.
*[[Rauisuchians]], another group of archosaurs, which were the keystone predators of most Triassic terrestrial ecosystems. Over 25 species have been found, and include giant quadrupedal hunters, sleek bipedal omnivores, and lumbering beasts with deep sails on their backs. They probably occupied the large-predator niche later filled by theropods.
*[[Theropods]]: dinosaurs that first evolved in the Triassic period but did not evolve into large sizes until the Jurassic. Most Triassic theropods, such as the ''[[Coelophysis]]'', were only around 1–2 meters long and hunted small prey in the shadow of the giant Rauisuchians.
*[[Cynodonts]], a large group that includes true mammals. The first cynodonts evolved in the Permian, but many groups prospered during the Triassic. Their characteristic mammalian features included hair, a large brain, and upright posture. Many were small but several forms were enormous and filled a large herbivore niche before the evolution of sauropodomorph dinosaurs, as well as large-sized carnivorous niches.

The Permian–Triassic extinction devastated terrestrial life. Biodiversity rebounded as the [[pioneer organisms|surviving species]] repopulated empty terrain, but these were short-lived. Diverse communities with complex [[food-web]] structures took 30 million years to reestablish.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;

[[Temnospondyli|Temnospondyl]] [[amphibian]]s were among those groups that survived the Permian–Triassic extinction; some lineages (e.g. [[trematosaur]]s) flourished briefly in the Early Triassic, while others (e.g. [[capitosaur]]s) remained successful throughout the whole period, or only came to prominence in the Late Triassic (e.g. plagiosaurs, [[metoposaur]]s). As for other amphibians, the first [[Lissamphibia]], progenitors of first [[frog]]s, are known from the Early Triassic, but the group as a whole did not become common until the [[Jurassic]], when the temnospondyls had become very rare. Other survivors the [[Chroniosuchia]] and [[Embolomeri]] were more closely related to amniotes than temnospondyls. Those became extinct after some million years.

Most of the [[Reptiliomorpha]], stem-amniotes that gave rise to the amniotes, disappeared in Triassic, but two water-dwelling groups survived; [[Embolomeri]] that only survived into the early part of the period, and the [[Chroniosuchia]], which survived until the end of Triassic.

[[Archosauromorpha|Archosauromorph]] reptiles, especially [[archosaur]]s, progressively replaced the [[synapsid]]s that had dominated the previous Permian period. The ''[[Cynognathus]]'' was the characteristic top predator in earlier Triassic ([[Olenekian]] and [[Anisian]]) on [[Gondwana]]. Both [[Kannemeyeriidae|kannemeyeriid]] [[dicynodont]]s and gomphodont [[cynodont]]s remained important [[herbivore]]s during much of the period, and [[ecteniniids]] played a role as large-sized, cursorial predators in the Late Triassic. During the [[Carnian]] (early part of the Late Triassic), some advanced cynodonts gave rise to the [[Evolution of mammals#From cynodonts to crown mammals|first mammals]]. At the same time the [[Ornithodira]], which until then had been small and insignificant, evolved into [[pterosaur]]s and a variety of [[dinosaur]]s. The [[Crurotarsi]] were the other important archosaur [[clade]], and during the Late Triassic these also reached the height of their diversity, with various groups including the [[phytosaur]]s, [[aetosaur]]s, several distinct lineages of [[Rauisuchia]], and the first [[crocodylia]]ns (the [[Sphenosuchia]]). Meanwhile, the stocky herbivorous [[rhynchosaur]]s and the small to medium-sized insectivorous or piscivorous [[Prolacertiformes]] were important [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] archosauromorph groups throughout most of the Triassic.

Among other reptiles, the earliest [[turtle]]s, like ''[[Proganochelys]]'' and ''[[Proterochersis]]'', appeared during the [[Norian]] Age (Stage) of the Late Triassic Period. The [[Lepidosauromorpha]], specifically the [[Sphenodontia]], are first found in the fossil record of the earlier Carnian Age. The [[Procolophonidae]] were an important group of small lizard-like herbivores.

During the Triassic, archosaurs displaced therapsids as the dominant amniotes. This "Triassic Takeover" may have contributed to the [[evolution of mammals]] by forcing the surviving therapsids and their [[Mammaliaformes|mammaliaform]] successors to live as small, mainly nocturnal [[insectivore]]s. Nocturnal life may have forced the mammaliaforms to develop fur and a higher [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name="RubenJones2000FurAndFeathers"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Ruben, J.A. |author2=Jones, T.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Selective Factors Associated with the Origin of Fur and Feathers | journal=American Zoologist | year=2000 | volume=40 | issue=4 | pages=585–596 |doi=10.1093/icb/40.4.585 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/4/585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Conifers]] became common in [[Eurasia]] and Australia which contained a few species with a [[lycopod]] herbaceous under story. These groups of conifers arose from endemic species because of the ocean barriers that prevented seed from crossing for over one hundred million years. For instance, Podocarpis was located south and pines, junipers, and sequoias were located north. The dividing line ran through the Amazon Valley, across the Sahara, and north of Arabia, India, Thailand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Florin | first1 = R | year = 1963 | title = The distribution of Conifer and Taxad genera in time and space | url = | journal = Acta Horti Bergiani | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 121–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Melville | first1 = R | year = 1966 | title = Continental drift, Mesozoic continents, and the migrations of the angiosperms | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 211 | issue = 5045| page = 116 |doi=10.1038/211116a0|bibcode = 1966Natur.211..116M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that there was a climate barrier for the conifers.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington PJ, (1965) Biogeography of the southern end of the world. Harvard University Press, Cambridge Mass., on p 168.&lt;/ref&gt; although water barriers are more plausible. If so, something that could cross at least minor water barriers must have been involved in producing the coal hiatus.

* An event excluding a catastrophe must have been involved to cause the coal hiatus because fungi would have removed all dead vegetation and coal-forming detritus in a few decades in most tropical places. In addition, fungal spores rose gradually and declined similarly along with a prevalence of woody debris. Each phenomenon would hint at widespread vegetative death. Whatever the cause of the coal hiatus, it must have started in North America approximately 25 million years sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1996)108&lt;0195:GCGBPT&gt;2.3.CO;2 | last1 = Retallack | first1 = GJ | last2 = Veevers | year = 1996 | first2 = John J. | last3 = Morante | first3 = Ric | title = Global coal gap between Permian-Triassic extinctions and middle Triassic recovery of peat forming plants (review) | url = | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 195–207 |bibcode = 1996GSAB..108..195R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lagerstätten==
[[File:Stadtroda Sandstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Triassic sandstone near [[Stadtroda]], Germany]]
The [[Monte San Giorgio]] [[lagerstätte]], now in the [[Lake Lugano]] region of northern [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], was in Triassic times a [[lagoon]] behind reefs with an anoxic bottom layer, so there were no scavengers and little turbulence to disturb fossilization, a situation that can be compared to the better-known Jurassic [[Solnhofen Limestone]] lagerstätte.

The remains of fish and various marine reptiles (including the common [[pachypleurosaur]] Neusticosaurus, and the bizarre long-necked [[archosauromorph]] ''[[Tanystropheus]]''), along with some terrestrial forms like ''[[Ticinosuchus]]'' and ''[[Macrocnemus]]'', have been recovered from this locality. All these fossils date from the [[Anisian]]/[[Ladinian]] transition (about 237 million years ago).

==Triassic–Jurassic extinction event==
{{Main|Triassic–Jurassic extinction event}}
[[File:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|The mass extinction event is marked by 'End Tr']]
The Triassic period ended with a mass extinction, which was particularly severe in the oceans; the [[conodont]]s disappeared, as did all the marine reptiles except [[ichthyosaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s. Invertebrates like [[brachiopod]]s, [[gastropod]]s, and [[mollusc]]s were severely affected. In the oceans, 22% of marine families and possibly about half of marine genera went missing.

Though the end-Triassic extinction event was not equally devastating in all terrestrial ecosystems, several important clades of [[Crurotarsi|crurotarsans]] (large archosaurian reptiles previously grouped together as the [[Thecodontia|thecodont]]s) disappeared, as did most of the large labyrinthodont amphibians, groups of small reptiles, and some synapsids (except for the proto-mammals). Some of the early, primitive dinosaurs also became extinct, but more adaptive ones survived to evolve into the Jurassic. Surviving plants that went on to dominate the Mesozoic world included modern conifers and cycadeoids.

The cause of the Late Triassic extinction is uncertain. It was accompanied by huge [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions that occurred as the supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart about 202 to 191 million years ago (40Ar/39Ar dates),&lt;ref&gt;Nomade et al.,2007 Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 244, 326-344.&lt;/ref&gt; forming the [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province]] (CAMP),&lt;ref&gt;Marzoli et al., 1999, Science 284. Extensive 200-million-year-old continental flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, pp. 618-620.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest known inland volcanic events since the planet had first cooled and stabilized. Other possible but less likely causes for the extinction events include global cooling or even a [[bolide]] impact, for which an impact crater containing [[Manicouagan Reservoir]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], has been singled out. However, the Manicouagan impact melt has been dated to 214±1 Mya. The date of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary has also been more accurately fixed recently, at {{Period start|Jurassic}} Mya. Both dates are gaining accuracy by using more accurate forms of radiometric dating, in particular the decay of uranium to lead in zircons formed at time of the impact. So, the evidence suggests the Manicouagan impact preceded the end of the Triassic by approximately 10±2 Ma. It could, therefore, not be the immediate cause of the observed mass extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Hodych &amp; Dunning, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Late Triassic extinctions is disputed. Some studies suggest that there are at least two periods of extinction towards the end of the Triassic, separated by 12 to 17 million years. But arguing against this is a recent study of North American faunas. In the [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]] of northeast Arizona there is a unique sequence of late Carnian-early Norian terrestrial sediments. An [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002AM/finalprogram/abstract_42936.htm analysis in 2002] found no significant change in the paleoenvironment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002AM/finalprogram/abstract_42936.htm|title=NO SIGNIFICANT NONMARINE CARNIAN-NORIAN (LATE TRIASSIC) EXTINCTION EVENT: EVIDENCE FROM PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK|author=|date=|website=gsa.confex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phytosaur]]s, the most common fossils there, experienced a change-over only at the genus level, and the number of species remained the same. Some [[aetosaur]]s, the next most common tetrapods, and early dinosaurs, passed through unchanged. However, both phytosaurs and aetosaurs were among the groups of archosaur reptiles completely wiped out by the end-Triassic extinction event.

It seems likely then that there was some sort of end-Carnian extinction, when several herbivorous archosauromorph groups died out, while the large herbivorous [[therapsid]]s—the [[Kannemeyeriidae|kannemeyeriid]] dicynodonts and the [[Traversodontidae|traversodont]] cynodonts—were much reduced in the northern half of Pangaea ([[Laurasia]]).

These extinctions within the Triassic and at its end allowed the dinosaurs to expand into many niches that had become unoccupied. Dinosaurs became increasingly dominant, abundant and diverse, and remained that way for the next 150 million years. The true "Age of Dinosaurs" is during the following Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, rather than the Triassic.

Thus, in a state of [[free fall]], the weight would be zero. In this sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless: ignoring [[Drag (physics)|air resistance]], the famous apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near [[Isaac Newton]], would be weightless.

The [[unit of measurement]] for weight is that of [[force]], which in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[newton (unit)|newton]]. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the [[Moon]]. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;The National Standard of Canada, CAN/CSA-Z234.1-89 Canadian Metric Practice Guide, January 1989:
*'''5.7.3''' Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term "weight". In commercial and everyday use, the term "weight" nearly always means mass. In science and technology "weight" has primarily meant a force due to gravity. In scientific and technical work, the term "weight" should be replaced by the term "mass" or "force", depending on the application.
*'''5.7.4''' The use of the verb "to weigh" meaning "to determine the mass of", e.g., "I weighed this object and determined its mass to be 5&amp;nbsp;kg," is correct.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do with the [[theory of relativity]] according to which gravity is modelled as a consequence of the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]]. In the teaching community, a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students. The current situation is that a multiple set of concepts co-exist and find use in their various contexts.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

Discussion of the concepts of heaviness (weight) and lightness (levity) date back to the [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects. [[Plato]] described weight as the natural tendency of objects to seek their kin. To [[Aristotle]], weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic elements: air, earth, fire and water. He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire. [[Archimedes]] saw weight as a quality opposed to [[buoyancy]], with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats. The first operational definition of weight was given by [[Euclid]], who defined weight as: "weight is the heaviness or lightness of one thing, compared to another, as measured by a balance."&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt; Operational balances (rather than definitions) had, however, been around much longer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/museum accessed 29 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, weight was the direct cause of the falling motion of an object, the speed of the falling object was supposed to be directly proportionate to the weight of the object. As medieval scholars discovered that in practice the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this cause effect relationship. Weight was split into a "still weight" or ''pondus'', which remained constant, and the actual gravity or ''gravitas'', which changed as the object fell. The concept of ''gravitas'' was eventually replaced by [[Jean Buridan]]'s [[theory of impetus|impetus]], a precursor to [[momentum]].&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

The rise of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican view of the world]] led to the resurgence of the Platonic idea that like objects attract but in the context of heavenly bodies. In the 17th century, [[Galileo]] made significant advances in the concept of weight. He proposed a way to measure the difference between the weight of a moving object and an object at rest. Ultimately, he concluded weight was proportionate to the amount of matter of an object, and not the speed of motion as supposed by the Aristotelean view of physics.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

===Newton===
The introduction of [[Newton's laws of motion]] and the development of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] led to considerable further development of the concept of weight. Weight became fundamentally separate from [[mass]]. Mass was identified as a fundamental property of objects connected to their [[inertia]], while weight became identified with the force of gravity on an object and therefore dependent on the context of the object. In particular, Newton considered weight to be relative to another object causing the gravitational pull, e.g. the weight of the Earth towards the Sun.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

Newton considered time and space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider concepts as true position and true velocity.{{Clarify| reason = broken sentence; not sure if it should say "*such* concepts as", or if there is something else missing|date=June 2011}} Newton also recognized that weight as measured by the action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy. He considered this a false weight induced by imperfect measurement conditions, for which he introduced the term ''apparent weight'' as compared to the ''true weight'' defined by gravity.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

Although Newtonian physics made a clear distinction between weight and mass, the term weight continued to be commonly used when people meant mass. This led the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) of 1901 to officially declare "The word ''weight'' denotes a quantity of the same nature as a ''force'': the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity", thus distinguishing it from mass for official usage.

===Relativity===
In the 20th century, the Newtonian concepts of absolute time and space were challenged by relativity. Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant by the force of gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt;

==Definitions==

===Gravitational definition===
The most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galili-Lehavi"/&gt; This is often expressed in the formula {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}, where ''W'' is the weight, ''m'' the mass of the object, and ''g'' [[gravitational acceleration]].

In 1901, the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) established this as their official definition of ''weight'':
{{quotation|"The word ''weight'' denotes a quantity of the same nature{{#tag:ref
 |The phrase "quantity of the same nature" is a literal translation of the [[French (language)|French]] phrase ''grandeur de la même nature''.

This resolution defines weight as a vector, since force is a vector quantity. However, some textbooks also take weight to be a scalar by defining:
{{quotation|"The weight ''W'' of a body is equal to the magnitude ''F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the gravitational force on the body."&lt;ref name="Halliday 2007 95"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Physics |volume=1 |first=David |last=Halliday |first2=Robert |last2=Resnick |first3=Jearl |last3=Walker |publisher= Wiley |date=2007 |edition=8th |page=95 |isbn= 978-0-470-04473-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The gravitational acceleration varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to have a [[standard gravity|standard value]] of {{nowrap|9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which gives the [[standard weight]].&lt;ref name="3rdCGPM"&gt;{{cite web

It has the secondary effect of comparing masses because weight is proportional to mass. --&gt; by comparing an object to references. On the Moon, an object would give the same reading, because the object and references would ''both'' become lighter.}}

===Operational definition===
In the operational definition, the weight of an object is the [[force]] measured by the operation of weighing it, which is '''the force it exerts on its support'''.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; 
Since, W=downward force on the body by the centre of earth, and there is no acceleration in the body. So, there exists opposite and equal force by the support on the body. Also it is equal to the force exerted by the body on its support because action and reaction have same numerical value and opposite direction.
This can make a considerable difference, depending on the details; for example, an object in [[free fall]] exerts little if any force on its support, a situation that is commonly referred to as [[weightlessness]]. However, being in free fall does not affect the weight according to the gravitational definition. Therefore, the operational definition is sometimes refined by requiring that the object be at rest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, this raises the issue of defining "at rest" (usually being at rest with respect to the Earth is implied by using [[standard gravity]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}). In the operational definition, the weight of an object at rest on the surface of the Earth is lessened by the effect of the centrifugal force from the Earth's rotation.

The operational definition, as usually given, does not explicitly exclude the effects of [[buoyancy]], which reduces the measured weight of an object when it is immersed in a fluid such as air or water. As a result, a floating [[balloon]] or an object floating in water might be said to have zero weight.

===ISO definition===
In the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] International standard ISO 80000-4(2006),&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-4:2006, Quantities and units - Part 4: Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt; describing the basic physical quantities and units in mechanics as a part of the International standard [[ISO/IEC 80000]], the definition of ''weight'' is given as:
{{quotation|
'''Definition'''
:&lt;math&gt;F_g = m g \, &lt;/math&gt;,
:where ''m'' is mass and ''g'' is local acceleration of free fall.

'''Remarks'''
*When the reference frame is Earth, this quantity comprises not only the local gravitational force, but also the local centrifugal force due to the rotation of the Earth, a force which varies with latitude.
*The effect of atmospheric buoyancy is excluded in the weight.
*In common parlance, the name "weight" continues to be used where "mass" is meant, but this practice is deprecated.
|ISO 80000-4 (2006)}}

The definition is dependent on the chosen [[frame of reference]]. When the chosen frame is co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; If the specified frame is the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.

=== Apparent weight ===
{{Main|Apparent weight}}
In many real world situations the act of weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually referred to as the apparent weight of the object. A common example of this is the effect of [[buoyancy]], when an object is immersed in a [[fluid]] the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Mass==
[[File:WeightNormal.svg|thumb|250px|An object with mass ''m'' resting on a surface and the corresponding [[free body diagram]] of just the object showing the [[force]]s acting on it. Notice that the amount of force that the table is pushing upward on the object (the N vector) is equal to the downward force of the object's weight (shown here as ''mg'', as weight is equal to the object's mass multiplied with the acceleration due to gravity): because these forces are equal, the object is in a state of [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] (all the forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on it sum to zero).]]
{{Main|Mass versus weight}}
In modern scientific usage, weight and [[mass]] are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] property of [[matter]], whereas weight is a ''force'' that results from the action of [[gravity]] on matter: it measures how strongly the force of gravity pulls on that matter. However, in most practical everyday situations the word "weight" is used when, strictly, "mass" is meant.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST811wt"&gt;{{cite web |author=A. Thompson |author2=B. N. Taylor |last-author-amp=yes |title=The NIST Guide for the use of the International System of Units, Section 8: Comments on Some Quantities and Their Units |work=Special Publication 811 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec08.html#8.3 |publisher=[[NIST]] |origyear=July 2, 2009 |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most people would say that an object "weighs one kilogram", even though the kilogram is a unit of mass.

The distinction between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because the strength of gravity does not vary too much on the surface of the Earth. In a uniform gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|directly proportional]] to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object's mass can be measured indirectly by its weight, and so, for everyday purposes, [[weighing]] (using a [[weighing scale]]) is an entirely acceptable way of measuring mass. Similarly, a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]] measures mass indirectly by comparing the weight of the measured item to that of an object(s) of known mass. Since the measured item and the comparison mass are in virtually the same location, so experiencing the same [[gravity|gravitational field]], the effect of varying gravity does not affect the comparison or the resulting measurement.

The Earth's [[gravity|gravitational field]] is not uniform but can vary by as much as 0.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; at different locations on Earth (see [[Earth's gravity]]). These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and must be taken into account in high precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. [[Spring scale]]s, which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010|reason=Doesn't this depend on the jurisdiction?}}

The historic use of "weight" for "mass" also persists in some scientific terminology – for example, the [[chemistry|chemical]] terms "atomic weight", "molecular weight", and "formula weight", can still be found rather than the preferred "[[atomic mass]]" etc.

In a different gravitational field, for example, on the surface of the [[Moon]], an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity on the surface of the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as on the surface of the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an intrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] weighs only about 30 [[pound-force|pounds-force]] when visiting the Moon.

===SI units===
In most modern scientific work, physical quantities are measured in [[International System of Units|SI]] units. The SI unit of weight is the same as that of force: the [[newton (unit)|newton]] (N) – a derived unit which can also be expressed in [[SI base unit]]s as kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (kilograms times meters per second squared).&lt;ref name=NIST811wt/&gt;

In commercial and everyday use, the term "weight" is usually used to mean mass, and the verb "to weigh" means "to determine the mass of" or "to have a mass of". Used in this sense, the proper SI unit is the [[kilogram]] (kg).&lt;ref name=NIST811wt/&gt;

===Pound and other non-SI units===
In [[United States customary units]], the pound can be either a unit of force or a unit of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/common-conversion-b.cfm
| title = Common Conversion Factors, Approximate Conversions from U.S. Customary Measures to Metric
| publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]
| accessdate = 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related units used in some distinct, separate subsystems of units include the [[poundal]] and the [[slug (unit)|slug]]. The poundal is defined as the force necessary to accelerate an object of one-pound ''mass'' at 1&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is equivalent to about 1/32.2 of a pound-''force''. The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass).

The [[kilogram-force]] is a non-SI unit of force, defined as the force exerted by a one kilogram mass in standard Earth gravity (equal to 9.80665 newtons exactly).  The [[dyne]] is the [[centimetre-gram-second|cgs]] unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI.

==Sensation==
{{See also|Apparent weight}}
The sensation of weight is caused by the force exerted by fluids in the [[vestibular system]], a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner [[ear]].{{Dubious|Sensation of Weight|date=June 2010}} It is actually the sensation of [[g-force]], regardless of whether this is due to being stationary in the presence of gravity, or, if the person is in motion, the result of any other forces acting on the body such as in the case of acceleration or deceleration of a lift, or centrifugal forces when turning sharply.

==Measuring==
{{Main|Weighing scale}}
{{redirect|Weigh|other uses|Weigh (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Peso-Valdivia-dsc02545.jpg|thumb|A [[weighbridge]], used for weighing trucks]]

Weight is commonly measured using one of two methods. A [[Weighing scale#Spring scales|spring scale]] or [[Weighing scale#Hydraulic or pneumatic scale|hydraulic or pneumatic scale]] measures local weight, the local [[force]] of [[gravity]] on the object (strictly [[apparent weight|''apparent'' weight force]]). Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal [[standard gravity]] of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (approx. 32.174&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). However, this calibration is done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, the force of gravity will be different, causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate, and legal for commerce, [[spring scale]]s must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.

A ''[[Weighing scale#balance|balance]]'' on the other hand, compares the weight of an unknown object in one scale pan to the weight of standard masses in the other, using a [[lever]] mechanism – a lever-balance. The standard masses are often referred to, non-technically, as ''"weights"''. Since any variations in gravity will act equally on the unknown and the known weights, a lever-balance will indicate the same value at any location on Earth. Therefore, balance ''"weights"'' are usually calibrated and marked in [[mass]] units, so the lever-balance measures mass by comparing the Earth's attraction on the unknown object and standard masses in the scale pans. In the absence of a gravitational field, away from planetary bodies (e.g. space), a lever-balance would not work, but on the Moon, for example, it would give the same reading as on Earth. Some balances can be marked in weight units, but since the weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object.

If the actual force of gravity on the object is needed, this can be calculated by multiplying the mass measured by the balance by the acceleration due to gravity – either standard gravity (for everyday work) or the precise local gravity (for precision work). Tables of the gravitational acceleration at different locations can be found on the web.

'''Gross weight''' is a term that is generally found in commerce or trade applications, and refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging. Conversely, '''net weight''' refers to the weight of the product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging; and '''[[tare weight]]''' is the weight of the packaging alone.

==Relative weights on the Earth and other celestial bodies==
{{Main|Earth's gravity|Surface gravity}}
The table below shows comparative [[Surface gravity|gravitational accelerations at the surface]] of the Sun, the Earth's moon, each of the planets in the solar system. The “surface” is taken to mean the cloud tops of the [[gas giants]] (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken to mean the [[photosphere]]. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the gas giants) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.

T., et al. (Eds.) (2001) Projections of future climate change, Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 881 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridgham, S. D., Cadillo-Quiroz, H., Keller, J. K. and Zhuang, Q. (2013), Methane emissions from wetlands: biogeochemical, microbial, and modeling perspectives from local to global scales. Glob Change Biol, 19: 1325–1346. doi:10.1111/gcb.12131&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands are characterized by water-logged soils and distinctive communities of plant and animal species that have evolved and adapted to the constant presence of water. This high level of water saturation as well as warm weather is the cause of the high levels of methane production.

Most [[methanogenesis]], or methane production, occurs in oxygen-poor environments. Because the microbes that live in warm, moist environments consume oxygen more rapidly than it can diffuse in from the atmosphere, wetlands are the ideal anaerobic environments for [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] as well as [[methanogen]] activity. However, levels of methanogenesis can fluctuate as it is dependent on the availability of oxygen, temperature of the soil, and the composition of the soil; a warmer, more anaerobic environment with rich soil would allow for more efficient methanogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T. R., A. Ekberg, L. Strom, M. Mastepanov, N. Panikov, M. Oquist, B. H. Svenson, H. Nykanen, P. J. Martikainen, and H. Oskarsson (2003), Factors controlling large scale variations in methane emissions from wetlands, Geophys. Res. Lett., 30, 1414, doi:10.1029/2002GL016848.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermentation is a process used by certain kinds of [[microorganisms]] to break down essential nutrients. In a process called acetoclastic [[methanogenesis]], microorganisms from the classification [[Domain (biology)|domain]] [[archaea]] produce methane by fermenting acetate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into methane and carbon dioxide.

H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C-COOH → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Depending on the wetland and type of archaea, hydrogenotrophicc methanogenesis, another process that yields methane, can also occur. This process occurs as a result of archaea oxidizing hydrogen with carbon dioxide to yield methane and water.

4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Natural progressions of wetlands==

Many different kinds of [[wetlands]] exist, all characterized by unique compositions of plant life and water conditions. To list a few, [[marshes]], [[swamps]], [[bogs]], [[fens]], [[peatlands]], [[muskegs]], prairie [[pothole (landform)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715303429 | doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.148 | volume=533 | title=Effects of land use on greenhouse gas fluxes and soil properties of wetland catchments in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America | year=2015 | journal=Science of the Total Environment | pages=391–409 | author=Tangen Brian A., Finocchiaro Raymond G., Gleason Robert A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pocosins are all examples of different kinds of wetlands. Because each type of wetland is unique, the same characteristics used to classify each wetland can also be used to characterize the amount of methane emitted from that particular wetland. Any waterlogged environment with moderate levels of decomposition create the anaerobic conditions needed for methanogenesis, but the amount of water and decomposition will affect the magnitude of methane emissions in a specific environment. For example, lower water tables result in lower levels of methane emission because methanotrophic bacteria require oxic conditions to oxidize methane into carbon dioxide and water. Higher water tables, however, result in higher levels of methane emission because there is less habitable area for methanotrophic bacteria to live, and thus the methane can more easily diffuse into the atmosphere without being broken down.

Often, the natural ecological progression of wetlands involves the development of one kind of wetland into one or several other kinds of wetlands. So over time, a wetland will naturally change the amount of methane emitted from its soil.

For example, Peatlands are wetlands that contain a large amount of [[peat]], or partially decayed plant life. When peatlands are first developing, they often start out as fens, wetlands characterized by mineral rich soil. These flooded wetlands, with higher water tables, would naturally have higher emissions of methane. Eventually, the fens develop into bogs, acidic wetlands with accumulations of peat and lower water tables. With the lower water tables, methane emissions are more easily consumed by methanotrophic, or methane consuming, bacteria and never make it to the atmosphere. Over time, the peatlands develop and end up with accumulated pools of water, which once again increases emissions of methane.

==Pathways of methane emission in wetlands==

[[Primary productivity]] fuels methane emissions both directly and indirectly. Plants not only provide much of the carbon needed for methane producing processes in wetlands, but in addition, methane can utilize three different pathways provided by primary productivity to reach the atmosphere: [[diffusion]] through the profile, plant [[aerenchyma]], and [[ebullition]].

===Diffusion===

[[Diffusion]] through the profile refers to the movement of methane up through soil and bodies of water to reach the atmosphere. The importance of diffusion as a pathway varies per wetland based on the type of soil and vegetation.&lt;ref name="Tang"&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2008AGUFM.B33B0424T | title=Assessing the role of different wetland methane emission pathways with a biogeochemistry model | journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts | page=0424 | year=2008| authors = Tang J., Zhuang Q., White, J.R., Shannon, R.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in peatlands, the mass amount of dead, but not decaying, organic matter results in relatively slow diffusion of methane through the soil.&lt;ref name="Couwenberg"&gt;Couwenberg, John. Greifswald University. "Methane emissions from peat soils." http://www.imcg.net/docum/09/couwenberg_2009b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because methane can travel more quickly through soil than water, diffusion plays a much bigger role in wetlands with drier, more loosely compacted soil.

===Aerenchyma===

Plant [[aerenchyma]] refers to the vessel-like transport tubes within the tissues of certain kinds of plants. Plants with arenchyma possess porous tissue that allows for direct travel of gases to and from the plant roots. Methane can travel directly up from the soil into the atmosphere using this transport system.&lt;ref name="Couwenberg"/&gt; The direct “shunt” created by the aerenchyma allows for methane to bypass oxidation by oxygen that is also transported by the plants to their roots.

===Ebullition===

Ebullition refers to the sudden release of bubbles of methane into the air. These bubbles occur as a result of methane building up over time in the soil, forming pockets of methane gas. As these pockets of trapped methane grow in size, the level of the soil will slowly rise up as well. This phenomenon continues until so much pressure builds up that the bubble “pops,” transporting the methane up through the soil so quickly that it does not have time to be consumed by the methanotrophic organisms in the soil. With this release of gas, the level of soil then falls once more.

Ebullition in wetlands can be recorded by delicate sensors, called [[piezometers]], that can detect the presence of pressure pockets within the soil. Hydraulic heads are also used to detect the subtle rising and falling of the soil as a result of pressure build up and release. Using piezometers and hydraulic heads, a study was done in northern United States peatlands to determine the significance of ebullition as a source of methane. Not only was it determined that ebullition is in fact a significant source of methane emissions in northern United States peatlands, but it was also observed that there was an increase in pressure after significant rainfall, suggesting that rainfall is directly related to methane emissions in wetlands.&lt;ref name="Glaser"&gt;Glaser, P.H., J.P. Chanton, P. Morin, D.O. Rosenberry, D.I. Siegel, O. Ruud, L.I. Chasar, A.S. Reeve. 2004. "Surface deformations as indicators of deep ebullition fluxes in a large northern peatland."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controlling factors on methane emission from wetlands==

The magnitude of [[methane]] emission from a [[wetland]] are usually measured using [[eddy covariance]], gradient or chamber [[flux]] techniques, and depends upon several factors, including [[water table]], comparative ratios of [[methanogenic]] bacteria to [[methanotrophic]] bacteria, transport mechanisms, temperature, [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] type, plant life, and climate. These factors work together to effect and control methane [[flux]] in wetlands.

Overall the main determinant of net flux of methane into the atmosphere is the ratio of methane produced by methanogenic bacteria that makes it to the surface relative to the amount of methane that is either consumed by methanotrophic bacteria or oxidized and lost before reaching the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Bubier"&gt;Bubier, Jill L. and Moore, Tim R. "An ecological perspective on methane emissions from northern wetlands."&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio is in turn affected by the other controlling factors of methane in the environment. Additionally, [[#Pathways of methane emission in wetlands|pathways of methane emission]] affect how the methane travels into the atmosphere and thus have an equal effect on methane flux in wetlands.

===Water table===

The first controlling factor to consider is the level of the water table. Not only does pool and water table location determine the areas where methane production or oxidation may take place, but it also determines how quickly methane can diffuse into the air. When traveling through water, the methane molecules run into the quickly moving water molecules and thus take a longer time to reach the surface. Travel through soil, however, is much easier and results in easier diffusion into the atmosphere. This theory of movement is supported by observations made in wetlands where significant fluxes of methane occurred after a drop in the water table due to drought.&lt;ref name="Bubier"/&gt; If the water table is at or above the surface, then methane transport begins to take place primarily through ebullition and vascular or pressurized plant mediated transport, with high levels of emission occurring during the day from plants that use pressurized ventilation.&lt;ref name="Bubier"/&gt;

===Temperature===

Temperature is also an important factor to consider as the environmental temperature—and temperature of the soil in particular—affects the metabolic rate of production or consumption by bacteria. Additionally, because methane fluxes occur annually with the seasons, evidence is provided that suggests that the temperature changing coupled with water table level work together to cause and control the seasonal cycles.

===Substrate composition===

The composition of soil and substrate availability change the nutrients available for methanogenic and methanotrophic bacteria, and thus directly affects the rate of methane production and consumption. For example, wetlands soils with high levels of acetate or hydrogen and carbon dioxide are conducive to methane production. Additionally, the type of plant life and amount of plant decomposition affects the nutrients available to the bacteria as well as the acidity. A constant availability of cellulose and a soil pH of about 6.0 have been determined to provide optimum conditions for methane production and consumption; however, substrate quality can be overridden by other factors.&lt;ref name="Bubier"/&gt; Soil [[pH]] and composition must still be compared to the effects of water table and temperature.

===Net ecosystem production===

Net ecosystem production (NEP) and climate changes are the all encompassing factors that have been shown to have a direct relationship with methane emissions from wetlands. In wetlands with high water tables, NEP has been shown to increase and decrease with methane emissions, most likely due to the fact that both NEP and methane emissions flux with substrate availability and soil composition. In wetlands with lower water tables, the movement of oxygen in and out of the soil can increase the oxidation of methane and the inhibition of methanogenesis, nulling the relationship between methane emission and NEP because methane production becomes dependent upon factors deep within the soil.

A changing climate affects many factors within the ecosystem, including water table, temperature, and plant composition within the wetland—all factors that affect methane emissions. However, climate change can also affect the amount of carbon dioxide in the surrounding atmosphere, which would in turn decrease the addition of methane into the atmosphere, as shown by an 80% decrease in methane flux in areas of doubled carbon dioxide levels.&lt;ref name="Bubier"/&gt;

==Human development of wetlands==

Humans often drain wetlands in the name of development, housing, and agriculture. By draining wetlands, the water table is thus lowered, increasing consumption of methane by the methanotrophic bacteria in the soil.&lt;ref name="Bubier"/&gt; However, as a result of draining, water saturated ditches develop, which due to the warm, moist environment, end up emitting a large amount of methane.&lt;ref name="Bubier"/&gt; Therefore the actual effect on methane emission strongly ends up depending on several factors. If the drains are not spaced far enough apart, then saturated ditches will form, creating mini wetland environments. Additionally, if the water table is lowered significantly enough, then the wetland can actually be transformed from a source of methane into a sink that consumes methane. Finally, the actual composition of the original wetland changes how the surrounding environment is affected by the draining and human development.
