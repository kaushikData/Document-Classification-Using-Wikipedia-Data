'''AMBO pipeline''' was a planned oil pipeline from the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Black Sea]] port of [[Burgas]] via the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the [[Albania]]n [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] port of [[Vlorë]].

==History==
The pipeline was proposed already in 1993. On 27 December 2004, prime-ministers of Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria signed the latest political declaration, followed by the memorandum of understanding between representatives of Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria and Ted Ferguson, the president and CEO of AMBO.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;

|title=Go-ahead for Balkan oil pipeline
|publisher= [[BBC News]]
|date=2004-12-28
|accessdate=2008-04-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  On 30 October 2006, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia signed a protocol to determinate the entrance points of the pipeline. The entrance point will be Stebleve village in Albania and Lakaica village in the Republic of Macedonia. A similar protocol between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia was signed later in 2006. 

On 31 January 2007, the Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania signed a trilateral convention on the construction of the AMBO pipeline.  This document was ratified by the Parliaments of all three countries and governed the construction, operation, and maintenance of the pipelines.&lt;ref name=set&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The aim of the {{convert|912|km|adj=on}} long pipeline was to bypass the [[Turkish Straits]] in transportation of [[Russia]]n and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil.  The pipeline was expected to cost about US$1.5&amp;nbsp;billion and it would have a capacity of {{convert|750000|oilbbl/d}}.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There would be four pump stations, two in Bulgaria and one each in the Republic of Macedonia and Albania, constructed along the route. A pre-front-end engineering and design study (FEED) was to be prepared by [[KBR (company)|KBR]]. The pipeline was expected to be operational by 2011.&lt;ref name=downstream1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project company==
The pipeline was to be built and operated by the US-registered Albanian Macedonian Bulgarian Oil Corporation (AMBO). The project was backed by the US government, who financed a feasibility study of pipeline.&lt;ref name=ba2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative projects==
Other pipeline projects were the [[Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline]] from Burgas to the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] port [[Alexandroupoli]], and the [[Pan-European Pipeline]] from [[Constanţa]] in [[Romania]] to [[Trieste]] in [[Italy]]. Compared with Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline, the AMBO pipeline would be longer and more expensive, but Vlorë (which is a sheltered, deep-water, all-weather port) could accommodate larger tankers and is more accessible than Alexandroupoli. Also, an oil spill in the Aegean would have a negative influence on Greece's tourism industry.&lt;ref name=ba1&gt;

'''Bismuth titanate''' or '''bismuth titanium oxide''' is a solid inorganic compound of [[bismuth]], [[titanium]] and [[oxygen]] with the [[chemical formula]] of Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;,
Bi &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; or Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;

==Synthesis==
Bismuth titanate ceramics can be produced by heating a mixture of bismuth and titanium oxides. Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; forms at 730–850&amp;nbsp;°C, and melts when the temperature is raised above 875&amp;nbsp;°C, decomposing in the melt to Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Millimeter-sized single crystals of Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; can be grown by the [[Czochralski process]], from the molten phase at 880–900&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

==Properties and applications==
Bismuth titanates exhibit [[electrooptical effect]] and [[photorefractive effect]], that is, a reversible change in the [[refractive index]] under applied electric field or illumination, respectively. Consequently, they have potential applications in reversible recording media for real-time [[holography]] or image processing applications.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

'''Coastal Hazards''' are physical phenomena that expose a coastal area to risk of property damage, loss of life and environmental degradation. Rapid-onset hazards last over periods of minutes to several days and examples include major cyclones accompanied by high winds, waves and surges or tsunamis created by [[submarine earthquake]]s and landslides. Slow-onset hazards develop incrementally over longer time periods and examples include erosion and gradual inundation.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2005) Encyclopaedia of Coastal Science, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since early civilisation, coastal areas have been attractive settling grounds for human population as they provided abundant marine resources, fertile agricultural land and possibilities for trade and transport. This has led to high population densities and high levels of development in many coastal areas and this trend is continuing into the 21st century. At present, about 1,2 billion people live in coastal areas globally, and this number is  predicted to increase to 1,8–5,2 billion by the 2080s due to a combination of population growth and coastal migration.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this increase follows major investments in infrastructure and the build environment.

The characteristics of coastal environments, however, pose some great challenges to human habitation. Coastlines are highly dynamic natural systems that interact with terrestrial, marine and atmospheric processes and undergo continuous change in response to these processes. Over the years, human society has often failed to recognize the hazards related to these dynamics &lt;ref&gt;Masselink &amp; Hughes, Coastal processes &amp; geomorphology, Arnold, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and this has led to major disasters and societal disruption to various degrees. Even today, coastal development is often taking place with little regard to the hazards present in these environments, although climate change is likely to increase the general hazard levels.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2014: http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/&lt;/ref&gt; Societal activities in coastal areas can also pose a hazard to the natural balance of coastal systems, thereby disrupting e.g. sensitive ecosystems and subsequently human livelihood.

Coastal hazard management has become an increasingly important aspect of coastal planning in order to improve the resilience of society to coastal hazards. Possible management options include hard engineering structures, soft protection measures, various accommodation approaches as well as a managed retreat from the coastline. For addressing coastal hazards, it is also important to have early warning systems and emergency management plans in place to be able to address sudden and potential disastrous hazards i.e. major flooding events. Events as the Hurricane Katrina affecting the southern USA in 2005 and the cyclone Nargis affecting Myanmar in 2008 provides clear examples of the importance of timely coastal hazard management.

== Coastal environments of the USA ==
There are many different types of environments along the coasts of the United States with very diverse features that affect, influence, and mold the near-shore processes that are involved.  Understanding these ecosystems and environments can further advance the mitigating techniques and policy-making efforts against natural and man-made coastal hazards in these vulnerable areas.  The five most common types of [[coastal zone]]s range from the northern ice-pushing, mountainous coastline of Alaska and Maine, the barrier island coasts facing the Atlantic, the steep, cliff-back [[Headlands and bays|headlands]] along the pacific coast, the marginal-sea type coastline of the Gulf region, and the coral reef coasts bordering Southern Florida and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, Douglas L. "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE IN THE COASTAL ZONE." Environmental Science in the Coastal Zone: Issues for Further Research. The National Academic Press. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice-pushing/mountainous coastline'''

These coastal regions along the northernmost part of the nation were affected predominantly by, along with the rest of the Pacific Coast, continuous tectonic activity, forming a very long, irregular, ridged, steep and mostly mountainous coastline.  These environments are heavily occupied with permafrost and glaciers, which are the two major conditions affecting Alaska's Coastal Development.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrier island coastline'''

[[Barrier island]]s are a land form system that consists of fairly narrow strips of sand running parallel to the mainland and play a significant role in mitigating storm surges and oceans swells as natural storm events occur. The morphology of the various types and sizes of barrier islands depend on the wave energy, tidal range, basement controls, and sea level trends.  The islands create multiple unique environments of wetland systems including marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;"BarrierIslnd." Smithsonian Marine Station (SMS) at Fort Pierce. Web. 30 April 2012. &lt;http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/BarrierIslnd.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steep, cliff-backing abrasion coastline'''

The coastline along the western part of the nation consists of very steep, cliffed rock formations generally with vegetative slopes descending down and a fringing beach below.  The various sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rock formations assembled along a tectonically disturbed environment, all with altering resistances running perpendicular, cause the ridged, extensive stretch of uplifted cliffs that form the peninsulas, lagoons, and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, B., and N. Sitar. "Processes of Coastal Bluff Erosion in Weakly Lithified Sands, Pacifica, California, USA." Geomorphology 97.3–4 (2008): 483–501. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal-sea type coastline'''

The southern banks of the United States border the Gulf of Mexico, intersecting numerous rivers, forming many inlets bays, and lagoons along its coast, consisting of vast areas of marsh and wetlands.  This region of landform is prone to natural disasters yet highly and continuously developed, with man-made structures attaining to water flow and control.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coral reef coastline'''

[[Coral reef]]s are located off the shores of the southern Florida and Hawaii consisting of rough and complex natural structures along the bottom of the ocean floor with extremely diverse ecosystems, absorbing up to ninety percent of the energy dissipated from wind-generated waves.  This process is a significant buffer for the inner-lying coastlines, naturally protecting and minimizing the impact of storm surge and direct wave damage.  Because of the highly diverse ecosystems, these coral reefs not only provide for the shoreline protection, but also deliver an abundant amount of services to fisheries and  tourism, increasing its economic value.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, John. "Coral Reefs". Nature 40.1030 (1889): 294. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Coastal Hazards ==

[[File:Hurricane Flooding.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Surge]]

'''Natural VS Human disasters'''

The population that lives along or near our coastlines are an extremely vulnerable population.  There are numerous issues facing our coastlines and there are two main categories that these hazards can be placed under, [[Natural disasters]] and Human disasters.  Both of these issues cause great damage to our coastlines and discussion is still ongoing regarding what standards or responses need to be met to help both the individuals who want to continue living along the coastline, while keeping them safe and not eroding more coastline away.  Natural disasters are disasters that are out of human control and are usually caused by the weather.  Disasters that include but are not limited to; [[storms]], [[tsunamis]], [[typhoons]], [[flooding]], [[tides]], [[waterspouts]], [[nor'easters]], and [[storm surge]].  Human disasters occur when humans are the main culprit behind why the disaster happened.  Some human disasters are but are not limited to; [[pollution]], [[trawling]], and human development. Natural and human disasters continue to harm the coastlines severely and they need to be researched in order to prepare/stop the hazards if possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Coastal hazards- natural," 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations that live near or along the coast experience many hazards and it affects millions of people.  Around ten million people globally feel the effects of coastal problems yearly and most are due to certain natural hazards like coastal flooding with storm surges and typhoons.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A major problem related to coastal regions deals with how the entire global environment is changing and in response, the coastal regions are easily affected.

[[File:Hurricane Diana.jpg|thumb|left|Hurricane Diana]]

'''Storms, Flooding and Erosion'''

Storms are one of the major hazards that are associated to coastal regions.  Storms, flooding, and erosion are closely associated and can happen simultaneously.  Tropical storms or Hurricanes especially can devastate coastal regions.  For example, Florida during [[Hurricane Andrew]] occurred in 1992 that caused extreme damage.  It was a category five hurricane that caused $26.5 billion in damages and even 23 individuals lost their lives from the storm.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurricane Katrina also caused havoc along the coast to show the extreme force a hurricane can do in a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;Burby, R. (n.d.). Hurricane katrina . Sage journals, Retrieved from http://ann.sagepub.com/content/604/1/171.short&lt;/ref&gt; The Chennai Floods of 2015, which affected many people, is an example of flooding due to cyclones. People across the whole state of Tamil Nadu felt its impact and even parts of Andhra Pradesh got affected. There was a loss of Rs.900 crore and 280 people died. Many cyclones like this happen across Asia but the media reports only minor hurricanes which hit the United States.

  In almost all cases, storms are the major culprit that causes flooding and erosion.  Flash flooding is caused by storms that occurs when a massive amount of rainfall comes down into an area over a short period of time.  Where as a storm surge, which is closely related to tropical storms, is when the wind collects and pushes water towards low pressure or inland and can rise rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;(2009).  Coastal hazards- natural disasters. Ocean science and stewardship, Retrieved from http://dels-old.nas.edu/oceans/coastal_hazards_part_2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an offshore rise of water and overall creates a higher sea level that rises and is pushed inland.  The amount of rise or fall of storm surge depends greatly on the amount and duration of wind and water in a specific location.  Also if it occurs during a high tide it can have an even greater effect on the coast.

Almost all storms with high wind and water cause erosion along the coast.  Erosion occurs when but not limited to; along shore currents, tides, sea level rise and fall, and high winds.  Larger amounts of erosion cause the coastline to erode away at a faster rate and can leave people homeless and leave less land to develop or keep for environmental reasons.  Coastal erosion has been increasing over the past few years and it is still on the rise which makes it a major coastline hazard.  In the United States, 45 percent of its coast line is along the Atlantic or Gulf coast and the erosion rate per year along the Gulf coast is at six feet a year.  The average rate of erosion along the Atlantic is around two to three feet a year.  Even with these findings, erosion rates in specific locations vary because of various environmental factors such as major storms that can cause major erosion upwards to 100 feet or more in only one day.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA or Federal Emergency Management Agency. (2000). Significant losses from coastal erosion anticipated along u.s. coastlines. Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov /news/newsrelease.fema?id=7708&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollution, Trawling and Human Development'''
[[File:Loss of Property due to storms.jpg|thumb|right|North Carolina Homes being taken by the Atlantic Ocean 08-23-2011]]
Pollution, trawling, and human development are major human disasters that affect coastal regions.  There are two main categories related to pollution, [[point source pollution]], and [[nonpoint source pollution]].  Point source pollution is when there is an exact location such as a pipeline or a body of water that leads into the rivers and oceans.  Known dumping into the ocean is also another point source of pollution.  Nonpoint source pollution would pertain more to fertilizer runoff, and industrial waste.  Examples of pollution that affect the coastal regions are but are not limited to; fertilizer runoff, oil spills, and dumping of hazardous materials into the oceans.  More human acts that hurt the coastline are as follows; waste discharge, fishing, dredging, mining, and drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, D. (n.d.). Types of coastal zones: similarities and differences. Retrieved from http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&amp;page=67&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil spills are one of the most hazardous dangers towards coastal communities.  They are hard to contain, difficult to clean up, and devastate everything.  The fish, animals such as birds, the water, and especially the coastline near the spill.  The most recent oil spill that had everybody concerned with oil spill was the [[BP oil spill]].

Trawling hurts the normal ecosystems in the water around the coastline.  It depletes all ecosystems on the ocean floor such as, flounder, shellfish, marsh etc.. It is simply a giant net that is drug across the ocean floor and destroys and catches anything in its path.  Human development is one of the major problems when facing coastal hazards.  The overall construction of buildings and houses on the coast line takes away the natural occurrences to handle the fluctuation in water and sea level rise.  Building houses in pre-flood areas or high risk areas that are extremely vulnerable to flooding are major concerns towards human development in coastal regions.  Having houses and buildings in areas that are known to have powerful storms that will create people to be in risk by living there.  Also pertaining to barrier islands, where land is at risk for erosion but they still continue to build there anyway.  More and more houses today are being taken by the ocean; look at picture above.

'''Coastal hazards &amp; climate change'''

The predicted climate change is adding an extra risk factor to human settlement in coastal areas. Whereas the natural dynamics that shape our coastlines have been relatively stable and predictable over the last centuries, much more rapid change is now expected in processes as sea level rise, ocean temperature and acidity, tropical storm intensity and precipitation/runoff patterns.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. 
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The world's coastlines will respond to these changes in different ways and at different pace depending on their bio-geophysical characteristics, but generally society will have to recognize that past coastal trends cannot be directly projected into the future. Instead, it is necessary to consider how different coastal environments will respond to the predicted climate change and take the expected future hazards into account in the coastal planning processes.

== Policies ==

'''National Flood Insurance Program'''

The National Flood Insurance Program or [[NFIP]] was instituted in 1968 and offers home owners in qualifying communities an opportunity to rebuild and recover after flooding events following the decision by insurance companies to discontinue providing flood insurance. This decision was made on behalf of the private insurers after continually high and widespread flood losses. The goals of this program are to not only better protect individuals from flood, but to reduce property losses, and reduce the total amount disbursed for flood loses by the government. Only communities which have adopted and implemented mitigation policies that are compliant with or exceed federal regulations. The regulatory policies reduce risk to life and property located within floodplains. The NFIP also comprehensively mapped domestic floodplains increasing public awareness of risk.  The majority of structures were constructed after the mapping was completed and risk could be assessed. To reduce the cost to these owners, which constitute roughly 25% of the total policies the rates for insurance are subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration. National Flood Insurance Program: Program Description. U.S. Government Press, August 1, 2002 Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1480&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal States Organization'''

The [[Coastal States Organization]] or COS was established in 1970 to represent 35 U.S. sub-federal governments on issues of coastal policies. CSO lobbies Congress on issues pertaining to Coastal Policy allowing states input on federal policy decisions. Funding, support, water quality, coastal hazards, and coastal zone management are the primary issues COS promotes. The strategic goals of COS are to provide information and assistance to members,evaluate and manage coastal needs, and secure long term funding for member states initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;About COS. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.coastalstates.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Zone Management Act'''

In 1972 the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] or CZMA works to streamline the policies which states create to a minimum federal standard for environmental protection. CZMA establishes the national policy for the development and implementation of regulatory programs for coastal land usage, which is supposed to be reflected in state legislation such as CAMA. CZMA also provides minimum building requirements to make the insurance provided through the NFIP less expensive for the government to operate by mitigating losses. Congress found that it was necessary to establish the minimum which programs should provide for. Each coastal state is required to have a program with 7 distinct parts: Identifying land uses,Identifying critical coastal areas, Management measures,Technical assistance, Public participation, Administrative coordination, State coastal zone boundary modification.&lt;ref&gt;(1972). 16 usc chapter 33 – coastal zone management.

'''The Coastal Area Management Act'''

The Coastal Area Management Act or CAMA is policy that was implemented by the state of North Carolina in 1974 to work in-tandem with the CZMA. It creates a cooperative program between the state and local governments. The State government operates in an advisory capacity and reviews decisions made by local government planners. The goal of this legislation was to create a management system capable of preserving the coastal environment, insure the preservation of land and water resources, balance the use of coastal resources and establish guidelines and standards for conservations, economic development, tourism, transportation, and the protection of common law.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, Division of Coastal Management.

== Management and planning ==

Due to the increasing urbanization along the coastlines, planning and management are essential to protecting the ecosystems and environment from depleting. [[Coastal management]] is becoming implemented more because of the movement of people to the shore and the hazards that come with the territory. Some of the hazards include movement of [[barrier island]]s, [[sea level rise]], [[hurricane]]s, [[nor'easter]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[flooding]], [[erosion]], [[pollution]] and human development along the coast. The [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA)  was created in 1972 because of the continued growth along the coast, this act introduced better management practices such as [[integrated coastal zone management]], [[adaptive management]] and the use [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] strategies when planning. According to the Coastal Zone Management Act, the objectives are to remain balanced to "preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the resources of the nation's coastal zone".&lt;ref&gt;National oceanic and atmospheric administration. (2011). Retrieved from http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/czm/czm_act.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of the land can strongly affect the sea,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. Coastal zone management handbook. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZHvKDJSg1PEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=management of coastal hazards&amp;ots=bwKAk06AoG&amp;sig=b9_iBP7OykljD0qtF9BkJutiEUw&lt;/ref&gt; for example the engineering of structures versus non-structures and the effects of erosion along the shore.

'''Integrated coastal zone management'''

Integrated coastal zone management means the integration of all aspects of the coastal zone; this includes environmentally, socially, culturally politically and economically to meet a sustainable balance all around. Sustainability is the goal to allow development yet protect the environment in which we develop. Coastal zones are fragile and do not do well with change so it is important to acquire sustainable development. The integration from all views will entitle a holistic view for the best implementation and management of that country, region and local scales. The five types of integration&lt;ref&gt;CICIN-SAIN, B. 1993. Sustainable Development and Integrated Coastal Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 11–43.&lt;/ref&gt; include integration among sectors, integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone, integration amount levels of government, integration between nations and integration among disciplines are all essential to meet the needs for implementation.
Management practices include
#maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems,without disrupting the environment
#reducing resource-use conflicts, by making sure resources are used adequately and sustainably,
#maintaining the health of the environment, which means to protect the ecosystems and natural cycle,
#facilitating the progress of multisectoral development, which means allowing developers to develop within standards.&lt;ref&gt;THIA-ENG, C. 1993. Essential Elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 81–108.&lt;/ref&gt;
These four management practices should be based on a bottom-up approach, meaning the approach starts from a local level which is more intimate to the specific environment of that area. After assessment from the local level, the state and federal input can be implemented. The bottom-up approach is key for protecting the local environments because there is a diversity of environments that have specific needs all over the world.

'''Adaptive management'''
[[File:Managing Coastal Hazards.gif|thumb|left| Managing Coastal Hazards Chart]]
Adaptive management is another practice of development adaptation with the environment. Resources are the major factor when managing  adaptively to a certain environment to accommodate all the needs of development and ecosystems. Strategies used must be flexible by either passive or active adaptive management include these key features:&lt;ref&gt;Elzinga, C.L., D. W. Salzer, J. W. Willoughby (1998). Measuring and Monitoring Plant Populations. Denver, CO: Bureau of Land Management. BLM Technical Reference 1730-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*AIterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning process)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference (experimentation)
*Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding (trial and error)
To achieve adaptive management is testing the assumptions to achieve a desired outcome, such as trial and error, find the best known strategy then monitoring it to adapt to the environment, and learning the outcomes of success and failures of a project.

'''Mitigation'''
[[File:Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Relocation due to high energy wave activity.jpg|thumb|right|Relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, NC, Failure of groin to protect the coast]]
The purpose of [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] is not only to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resources&lt;ref&gt;Race, Margret. , &amp; Christie, Donna, (n.d.). Coastal zone development: Mitigation and decision-making. 6(4), 317–328. Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/r078478127573341/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline.  Structural management deals with the use of the following: groins which are man-made solution to [[longshore drift|longshore current]] movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.
The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline. Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.

[[File:Small stationary Bauer HP compressor installation DSC09403.JPG|thumb|A small stationary high pressure breathing air compressor for filling scuba cylinders]]

A '''compressor''' is a mechanical device that increases the [[pressure]] of a [[gas]] by reducing its [[volume]]. An [[air compressor]] is a specific type of gas compressor.

Compressors are similar to [[pump]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.

==Types of compressors==
The main and important types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:
[[File:Gas-compressors-types-yed.png|frame|center]]

===Positive displacement===
A positive displacement compressor is a system which compresses the air by the displacement of a mechanical linkage reducing the volume (since the reduction in volume due to a piston in thermodynamics is considered as positive displacement of the piston).{{vague|date=May 2018}}

====Reciprocating compressors====

{{main article|Reciprocating compressor}}
[[File:ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg|right|thumb|A motor-driven six-cylinder reciprocating compressor that can operate with two, four or six cylinders.]]
'''Reciprocating compressors''' use [[piston]]s driven by a crankshaft. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Larger reciprocating compressors well over {{convert|1000|hp|abbr=on}} are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications. [[discharge pressure|Discharge pressures]] can range from low pressure to very high pressure (&gt;18000 psi or 180 MPa). In certain applications, such as air compression, multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available, and are typically larger, and more costly than comparable rotary units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/machinery-tools-supplies/Industrial-Compressed-Air-Systems Introduction to Industrial Compressed Air Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428012223/http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/machinery-tools-supplies/industrial-compressed-air-systems |date=2010-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another type of reciprocating compressor, usually employed in automotive cabin [[air conditioning]] systems,{{cn|date=August 2017}} is the swash plate compressor, which uses pistons moved by a swash plate mounted on a shaft (see ''[[axial piston pump]]'').

Household, home workshop, and smaller job site compressors are typically reciprocating compressors 1½&amp;nbsp;hp or less with an attached receiver tank.

====Ionic liquid piston compressor====

Their application can be from {{convert|3|hp|kW}} to over {{convert|1200|hp|kW}} and from low pressure to moderately high pressure (&gt;{{convert|1200|psi|MPa|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The classifications of rotary screw compressors vary based on stages, cooling methods, and drive types among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.industrialcompressorsolutions.com/articles/how-does-a-rotary-screw-air-compressor-work|title=How Does a Rotary Screw Air Compressor Work?|last=ICS|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817001135/http://www.industrialcompressorsolutions.com/articles/how-does-a-rotary-screw-air-compressor-work|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotary screw compressors are commercially produced in Oil Flooded, Water Flooded and Dry type.

====Rotary vane compressors====

[[Image:Rotary vane pump.svg|thumb|300px|Eccentric rotary-vane pump]]
{{See also|Rotary vane pump}}
'''Rotary vane compressors''' consist of a rotor with a number of blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.

With suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., {{convert|2|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about {{convert|13|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on}} in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.

Rotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063 Mattei Compressors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509233715/http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063 |date=2010-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rolling piston====

[[File:Rollkolbenverdichter.png|thumb|Rolling piston compressor]]
The Rolling piston in a rolling piston style compressor plays the part of a partition between the vane and the rotor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=icec|title=Motion of Rolling Piston in Rotary Compressor|last=|first=|date=|website=Purdue University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816232859/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=icec|archive-date=2017-08-16|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.

====Scroll compressors====

[[File:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|thumb|right|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]
{{main article|Scroll compressor}}
A '''scroll compressor''', also known as '''scroll pump''' and '''scroll vacuum pump''', uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to [[pump]] or compress [[fluid]]s such as [[liquids]] and [[gas]]es. The vane geometry may be [[involute]], [[archimedean spiral]], or hybrid curves.&lt;ref&gt;Tischer, J., Utter, R: “Scroll Machine Using Discharge Pressure For Axial Sealing,” U.S. Patent 4522575, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caillat, J., Weatherston, R., Bush, J: “Scroll-Type Machine With Axially Compliant Mounting,” U.S. Patent 4767293, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Jr., Hubert: “Scroll Compressor With Orbiting Scroll Member Biased By Oil Pressure,” U.S. Patent 4875838, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range.

Often, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.

Due to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors have a very high [[volumetric efficiency]].

This type of compressor was used as the [[G-Lader|supercharger]] on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.

====Diaphragm compressors====

{{main article|Diaphragm compressor}}
A '''diaphragm compressor''' (also known as a '''membrane compressor''') is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

The degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.

Diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas ([[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) as well as in a number of other applications.

[[File:DiaphragmCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A three-stage diaphragm compressor]]
The photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to {{convert|6000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} for use in a prototype [[compressed hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling station built in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by the [[Arizona Public Service]] company (an electric utilities company). [[Reciprocating compressor]]s were used to compress the [[natural gas]]. The reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by [[Sertco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eric Slack | title=Sertco | date=Winter 2016 | url=http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | publisher=Phoenix Media Corporation | work=Energy and Mining International | accessdate=February 27, 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304170914/http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | archivedate=March 4, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype [[alternative fuel]]ing station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety, environmental and building codes in Phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas.

===Dynamic===
Dynamic compressors depend upon the [[inertia]] and [[momentum]] of a fluid.

====Air bubble compressor====
Also known as a [[trompe]]. A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=Page 633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326071901/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Centrifugal compressors====
[[File:CentrifugalCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor]]
{{main article|Centrifugal compressor}}
'''Centrifugal compressors''' use a rotating disk or [[impeller]] in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller, increasing the velocity of the gas. A diffuser (divergent duct) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy. They are primarily used for continuous, stationary service in industries such as [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[chemical plant|chemical]] and [[petrochemical]] plants and [[natural gas processing]] plants.&lt;ref name=Perry &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their application can be from {{convert|100|hp|kW}} to thousands of horsepower. With multiple staging, they can achieve high output pressures greater than {{convert|10000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}.

Many large [[snowmaking]] operations (like [[ski resorts]]) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as [[supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s. Centrifugal compressors are used in small [[gas turbine]] [[engine]]s or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.

====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====
'''Diagonal''' or '''[[mixed-flow compressor]]s''' are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQcEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT251&amp;lpg=PT251&amp;dq=diffuser+turns+diagonal+flow+to+axial+flow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rkZptfuirh&amp;sig=RgvJpyW13dPTS677R4UWIOCaQtU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbvIKZ9NnVAhXD6YMKHWfvCuwQ6AEINzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=diffuser%20turns%20diagonal%20flo&amp;f=false|title=Pollution Control Handbook for Oil and Gas Engineering|last=Cheremisinoff|first=Nicholas P.|date=2016-04-20|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119117889|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224222642/https://books.google.com/books?id=WQcEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT251&amp;lpg=PT251&amp;dq=diffuser+turns+diagonal+flow+to+axial+flow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rkZptfuirh&amp;sig=RgvJpyW13dPTS677R4UWIOCaQtU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbvIKZ9NnVAhXD6YMKHWfvCuwQ6AEINzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=diffuser%20turns%20diagonal%20flo&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative to the conventional centrifugal compressor (of the same stage pressure ratio), the value of the speed of the mixed flow compressor is 1.5 times larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://turbolab.tamu.edu/proc/turboproc/T13/T13139-147.pdf|title=Development of High Specific Speed Mixed Flow Compressors|last=Kano|first=Fumikata|date=|website=Texas A&amp;M University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811093700/http://turbolab.tamu.edu/proc/turboproc/T13/T13139%2D147.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Axial-flow compressors====
[[File:Axial compressor.gif|thumb|right|An animation of an axial compressor.]]
{{main article|Axial-flow compressor}}
'''Axial-flow compressors''' are dynamic rotating compressors that use arrays of fan-like [[airfoil]]s to progressively compress a fluid. They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.

The arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or ''rotors'', accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as ''stators'' or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial [[Mach number]]. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).

Axial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% [[polytropic]] at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large [[gas turbine]] engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.

===Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===
[[File:Lednička Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, kompresor s odpařovací miskou (002).JPG|thumb|A small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]] typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut, which seals operating gases inside the system. There is no route for gases to leak, such as around motor shaft seals. On this model, the plastic top section is part of an auto-defrost system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water.]]

Compressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and [[Electric motor|motor]] drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is '''hermetically sealed compressor''', while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a '''semi-hermetic compressor'''.

In hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.

The difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components.

The primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. Open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure, and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties.

An open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.

The disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced. Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device.

An advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources, such as an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[turbine]]. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally ''maintenance-free'' throughout the life of the system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.

==Thermodynamics of Gas Compression==

===Isentropic Compressor===
A compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and [[adiabatic]], thus an [[isentropic]] steady state device, meaning the change in [[entropy]] is 0.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A. 2012"&gt;Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A. Boles. Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach. 7th Edition ed. New York: Mcgraw-Hill, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; By defining the compression cycle as [[isentropic]], an ideal efficiency for the process can be attained, and the ideal compressor performance can be compared to the actual performance of the machine. Isotropic Compression as used in [[ASME]] PTC 10 Code refers to a reversible, adiabatic compression process &lt;ref name="PTC 10 - Compressors and Exhauters"&gt;[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-10-1997-performance-test-code-compressors PTC 10 Compressors and Exhausters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619013643/https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-10-1997-performance-test-code-compressors |date=2015-06-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isentropic efficiency of Compressors:
: &lt;math&gt; \eta _C = \frac{\rm Isentropic \;Compressor\;Work}{\rm Actual\;Compressor\; Work}=\frac{W_s}{W_a} \cong \frac{h_{2s}-h_1}{h_{2a}-h_1}  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; h_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[enthalpy]] at the initial state
: &lt;math&gt; h_{2a}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[enthalpy]] at the final state for the actual process
: &lt;math&gt; h_{2s}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[enthalpy]] at the final state for the isentropic process

===Minimizing work required by a Compressor===

====Comparing Reversible to Irreversible Compressors====

Comparison of the differential form of the energy balance for each device
&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; be heat, &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt; be work, &lt;math&gt; ke &lt;/math&gt; be kinetic energy and &lt;math&gt; pe &lt;/math&gt; be potential energy.
&lt;br /&gt; 
Actual Compressor:
&lt;br/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;  \delta q_{act} - \delta w_{act} = dh + dke + dpe &lt;/math&gt;
Reversible Compressor:
&lt;br/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;  \delta q_{rev} - \delta w_{rev} = dh + dke + dpe &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The right hand side of each compressor type is equivalent, thus:
&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;   \delta q_{act} - \delta w_{act} = \delta q_{rev} - \delta w_{rev} &lt;/math&gt;
re-arranging:
&lt;br/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;   \delta w_{rev} - \delta w_{act} = \delta q_{rev} - \delta q_{act} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
By substituting the know equation &lt;math&gt;   \delta q_{rev} =T ds &lt;/math&gt; into the last equation and dividing both terms by T:
&lt;br/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;   \frac{\delta w_{rev} - \delta w_{act}}{T} =ds - \frac{\delta q_{act}}{T} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Furthermore, &lt;math&gt; ds \geq \frac{\delta q_{act}}{T} &lt;/math&gt; and T is [absolute temperature] (&lt;math&gt; T \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;) which produces:
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;   \delta w_{rev} \geq \delta w_{act} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
or
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;   w_{rev} \geq w_{act} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, work-consuming devices such as pumps and compressors (work is negative) require less work when they operate reversibly.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A. 2012"/&gt;

====Effect of Cooling During the Compression Process====
[[File:Insetropic,polytropic,isothermal.jpg|thumb|P-v (Specific volume vs. Pressure) diagram comparing isentropic, polytropic, and isothermal processes between the same pressure limits.]]

[[isentropic]] process: involves no cooling,
&lt;br /&gt;
[[polytropic]] process: involves some cooling
&lt;br /&gt;
[[isothermal]] process: involves maximum cooling

By making the following assumptions the required work for the compressor to compress a gas from &lt;math&gt;P_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; P_2&lt;/math&gt; is the following for each process:
&lt;br /&gt;
Assumptions:
&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;P_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_2&lt;/math&gt;

: All processes are internally reversible
: The gas behaves like an [[ideal gas]] with constant [[specific heats]]

Isentropic (&lt;math&gt; Pv^k = constant &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k = C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt;):
&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; W_{comp,in}= \frac{kR(T_2-T_1)}{k-1}=\frac{kRT_1}{k-1} \left [  \left ( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right ) ^{(k-1)/k} -1 \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

Polytropic (&lt;math&gt; Pv^n = constant &lt;/math&gt;):
&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; W_{comp,in}= \frac{nR(T_2-T_1)}{n-1}=\frac{nRT_1}{n-1} \left [  \left ( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right ) ^{(n-1)/n} -1 \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

Isothermal (&lt;math&gt;T = constant&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Pv = constant&lt;/math&gt;):
&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; W_{comp,in}= RT ln \left (  \frac{P_2}{P_1}\right ) &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing the three internally reversible processes compressing an ideal gas from &lt;math&gt;P_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; P_2&lt;/math&gt;, the results show that isentropic compression (&lt;math&gt; Pv^k = constant &lt;/math&gt;) requires the most work in and the isothermal compression(&lt;math&gt;T = constant&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Pv = constant&lt;/math&gt;) requires the least amount of work in. For the polytropic process (&lt;math&gt; Pv^n = constant &lt;/math&gt;) work in decreases as the exponent, n, decreases, by increasing the heat rejection during the compression process. One common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A. 2012"/&gt;

===Compressors in Ideal Thermodynamic Cycles===
Ideal [[Rankine Cycle]] 1-&gt;2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a [[pump]]
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal [[Carnot Cycle]] 4-&gt;1 [[Isentropic]] compression
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal [[Otto Cycle]] 1-&gt;2 [[Isentropic]] compression
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal [[Diesel Cycle]] 1-&gt;2 [[Isentropic]] compression
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal [[Brayton Cycle]] 1-&gt;2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a compressor
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal [[Vapor-compression refrigeration | Vapor-compression refrigeration Cycle]] 1-&gt;2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a compressor
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: The isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes.

==Temperature==
{{main article|Gas laws}}
Compression of a gas increases its [[temperature]].
: &lt;math&gt;W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} p dV = p_1 V_1^n \int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-n} dV&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;\frac { p_2 }{ p_1 }\ = \left( \frac{ V_1 } { V_2 }\ \right) ^ n&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n = p V^n&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;p = \frac {p_1 V_1^n}{V^n} &lt;/math&gt;

so
: &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {{p_1} {V_1^n}} {1-n}\ ( {V_2^{1-n}} - {V_1^{1-n}} ) &lt;/math&gt;

in which ''p'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''n'' takes different values for different compression processes (see below), and 1 &amp; 2 refer to initial and final states.

{{anchor|Adiabatic}}
* [[Adiabatic process|Adiabatic]] - This model assumes that no energy (heat) is transferred to or from the gas during the compression, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is:&lt;ref&gt;''Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook'' 8th edition
Perry, Green, page 10-45 section 10-76&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; T_2 = T_1 \left(\frac {p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(k-1)/k} &lt;/math&gt;
with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] or [[kelvin]]s, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; being absolute pressures and ''k'' = [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]]s (approximately 1.4 for air).  The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.
The relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of n for an adiabatic process is k (the ratio of specific heats).

{{anchor|Isothermal}}
* [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] - This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.

For an isothermal process, n is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:
: &lt;math&gt;W = - {p_1} {V_1} \ln \left( \frac {p_2} {p_1}\ \right)&lt;/math&gt;

When evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.

{{anchor|Polytropic}}
* [[Polytropic process|Polytropic]] - This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of n will be between 1 and k.

==Staged compression==
In the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in [[vapor-liquid separator]]s.

In the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the [[intercooler]] of a two or more stage compressor.

Because rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 × 7 × 7 = 343 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s). ({{convert|343|atm|MPa ksi|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out|disp=or}})

==Drive motors==
There are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:
* Gas [[turbine]]s power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of [[jet engine]]s.
* [[Steam turbine]]s or [[water turbine]]s are possible for large compressors.
* [[Electric motor]]s are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[alternating current]]. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] alternating current supply is available.
* [[Diesel engine]]s or [[petrol engine]]s are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. 
* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a [[supercharger]]), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a [[turbocharger]]).

==Applications==
Gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:
* In [[pipeline transport]] of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.
* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.
* [[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioner]] equipment use compressors to move [[heat]] in [[refrigerant]] cycles (see ''[[vapor-compression refrigeration]]'').
* Gas turbine systems compress the intake [[combustion]] air.
* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for [[medical]], [[welding]], and other uses.
* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require [[compressed air]] to power [[pneumatic tools]].
* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.
* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain [[cabin pressurization]] at altitude.
* Some types of [[jet engine]]s—such as [[turbojet]]s and [[turbofan]]s—compress the air required for fuel combustion. The jet engine's [[turbine]]s power the combustion air compressor.
* In [[SCUBA diving]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], and other life support devices, compressors put [[breathing gas]] into small volume containers, such as [[diving cylinder]]s.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air – the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145–51 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |pmid=22692708 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxyhackers &gt;{{cite book |author=Harlow, V |title=Oxygen Hacker's Companion |publisher=Airspeed Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-9678873-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[surface supplied diving]], an air compressor frequently supplies low pressure air (10 to 20 bar) for breathing.
* [[Submarine]]s use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust depth.
* [[Turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s are compressors that increase [[internal combustion engine]] performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder, so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power.
* [[Rail transport|Rail]] and heavy [[road transport]] vehicles use [[compressed air]] to operate [[Air brake (rail)|rail vehicle]] or [[Air brake (road vehicle)|road vehicle]] brakes—and various other systems ([[door]]s, [[windscreen wiper]]s, [[engine]], [[gearbox]] control, etc.).
* Service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic [[tire]]s and power pneumatic tools.
* [[Fire piston]]s and [[heat pump]]s exist to heat air or other gasses, and compressing the gas is only a means to that end.
* Rotary lobe compressors are often used to provide air in pneumatic conveying lines for powder or solids. Pressure reached can range from 0.5 to 2 bar g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Blowers.html|title=Blowers (Roots)|last=Staff|work=Engineering resources for powder processing industries|publisher=www.powderprocess.net|accessdate=15 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814175023/http://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Blowers.html|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12100">'''Cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylases''', also termed '''cytochrome P450 ω-hydroxylases''', '''CYP450 omega hydroxylases''', '''CYP450 ω-hydroxylases''', '''CYP omega hydroxylase''', '''CYP ω-hydroxylases''', '''fatty acid omega hydroxylases''', '''cytochrome P450 monooxygenases''', and '''fatty acid monooxygenases''', are a set of [[cytochrome P450]]-containing enzymes that catalyze the addition of a [[hydroxyl]] residue to a [[fatty acid]] [[Substrate (chemistry)]].  The CYP omega hydroxylases are often referred to as monoxygenases; however, the [[monooxygenase]]s are CYP450 enzymes that add a hydroxyl group to a wide range of [[xenobiotic]] (e.g. drugs, industrial toxins) and naturally occurring endobiotic (e.g. cholesterol) substrates, most of which are not fatty acids. The CYP450 omega hydroxylases are accordingly better viewed as a subset of monooxygenases that have the ability to hydroxylate fatty acids. While once regarded as functioning mainly in the [[catabolism]] of dietary fatty acids, the omega oxygenases are now considered critical in the production or break-down of fatty acid-derived mediators which are made by cells and act within their cells of origin as [[autocrine signaling]] agents or on nearby cells as [[paracrine signaling]] agents to regulate various functions such as blood pressure control and inflammation.

==Action==
The omega oxygenases metabolize fatty acids (RH) by adding a hydroxyl (OH) to their terminal (i.e. furthest from the fatty acids' carboxy residue) carbons; in the reaction, the two atoms of molecular oxygen(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ are reduced to one hydroxyl group and one water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule) by the concomitant oxidation of [[NAD(P)H]] (see [[monooxygenase]]).&lt;ref name="PUB00000123"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harayama S, Kok M, Neidle EL |title=Functional and evolutionary relationships among diverse oxygenases |journal=Annu.

==Functions==
CYP450 enzymes belong to a superfamily which in humans is composed of at least 57 CYPs; within this superfamily, members of six CYP4A subfamilies, (which are CYP4A, CYP4B, CYP4F, CYP4V, CYP4X, and CYP4z) possess ω-hydroxylase activity viz., CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4F&lt;ref name="Panigrahy_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panigrahy D, Kaipainen A, Greene ER, Huang S | title = Cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids: the neglected pathway in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 723–35 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 20941528 | pmc = 2962793 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9264-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15822183 | year = 2005 | author1 = Kroetz | first1 = D.

'''Economic dispatch''' is the short-term determination of the optimal output of a number of [[electricity generation]] facilities, to meet the system load, at the lowest possible cost, subject to transmission and operational constraints. The Economic Dispatch Problem is solved by specialized computer software which should satisfy the operational and system constraints of the available resources and corresponding transmission capabilities. In the US [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the term is defined as "the operation of generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost to reliably serve consumers, recognising any operational limits of generation and transmission facilities".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110429035824/http://www.doi.gov/pam/EnergyPolicyAct2005.pdf Energy Policy Act 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea is that, in order to satisfy the load at a minimum total cost, the set of generators with the lowest marginal costs must be used first, with the marginal cost of the final generator needed to meet load setting the system marginal cost. This is the cost of delivering one additional MWh of energy onto the system. The historic methodology for economic dispatch was developed to manage fossil fuel burning power plants, relying on calculations involving the input/output characteristics of power stations.

==Basic mathematical formulation ==

The following is based on Kirschen (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirschen|first=Daniel|title=Fundamentals of Power System Economics|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-470-84572-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic dispatch problem can be thought of as maximising the economic welfare {{math|''W''}} of a power network whilst meeting system constraints. For a network with {{math|''n''}} buses (nodes), where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the net power injection at bus {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the cost function of producing power at bus {{math|''k''}}, the unconstrained problem is formulated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\min_{I_k}\; (-W)=\min_{I_k}\;\left \{ \sum_{k=1}^n C_k(I_k)\right \}&lt;/math&gt;

Constraints imposed on the model are the need to maintain a power balance, and that the flow on any line must not exceed its capacity. For the power balance, the sum of the net injections at all buses must be equal to the power losses in the branches of the network:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n I_k = L(I_1,I_2,\dots,I_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;

The power losses {{math|''L''}} depend on the flows in the branches and thus on the net injections as shown in the above equation. However it cannot depend on the injections on all the buses as this would give an over-determined system. Thus one bus is chosen as the [[Slack bus]] and is omitted from the variables of the function {{math|''L''}}. The choice of Slack bus is entirely arbitrary, here bus {{math|''n''}} is chosen.

The second constraint involves capacity constraints on the flow on network lines. For a system with {{math|''m''}} lines this constraint is modeled as:

:&lt;math&gt; F_l(I_1,I_2,\dots,I_{n-1}) \leq F_{l}^{max} \qquad l=1,\dots,m&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the flow on branch {{math|''l''}}, and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''max''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the maximum value that this flow is allowed to take. Note that the net injection at the slack bus is not included in this equation for the same reasons as above.

These equations can now be combined to build the [[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrangian]] of the optimization problem:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}= \sum_{k=1}^n C_k(I_k) + \pi \left [ L(I_1,I_2,\dots,I_{n-1})-\sum_{k=1}^n I_k \right ] + \sum_{l=1}^m \mu_l \left [ F_{l}^{max}-F_l(I_1,I_2,\dots,I_{n-1}) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where π and μ are the Lagrangian multipliers of the constraints. The conditions for optimality are then:

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \mathcal{L}\over\partial I_k} = 0 \qquad k=1,\dots,n &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \mathcal{L}\over\partial \pi} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \mathcal{L}\over\partial \mu_l} = 0 \qquad l=1,\dots,m &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_l \cdot \left [ F_{l}^{max}-F_l(I_1,I_2,\dots,I_{n-1}) \right ]  = 0 \quad \mu_l \geq 0 \quad k=1,\dots,n &lt;/math&gt;

where the last condition is needed to handle the inequality constraint on line capacity.

Solving these equations is computationally difficult as they are nonlinear and implicitly involve the solution of the [[Power flow study|power flow]] equations. The analysis can be simplified using a linearised model called a DC power flow.

== Environmental dispatch ==

In environmental dispatch, additional considerations concerning reduction of pollution further complicate the power dispatch problem. The basic constraints of the economic dispatch problem remain in place but the model is optimized to minimize pollutant emission in addition to minimizing fuel costs and total power loss.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morsali|first1=Roozbeh|last2=Mohammadi|first2=Mohsen|last3=Maleksaeedi|first3=Iman|last4=Ghadimi|first4=Noradin|title=A new multiobjective procedure for solving nonconvex environmental/economic power dispatch|journal=Complexity|volume=20|issue=2|pages=47–62|doi=10.1002/cplx.21505|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.21505/full|bibcode=2014Cmplx..20b..47M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the added complexity, a number of algorithms have been employed to optimize this environmental/economic dispatch problem. Notably, a modified [[bees algorithm]] implementing chaotic modeling principles was successfully applied not only ''in silico'', but also on a physical model system of generators.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;. Other methods used to address the economic emission dispatch problem include [[Particle Swarm Optimization]] (PSO) &lt;ref name="MASON2017188"/&gt; and [[neural networks]] &lt;ref name="Mason:2017:EMN:3067695.3082480"/&gt;

Another notable algorithm combination is used in a real-time emissions tool called Locational Emissions Estimation Methodology (LEEM) that links electric power consumption and the resulting pollutant emissions.&lt;ref name="Carter, TH et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=TH|last2=Wang|first2=C|last3=Miller|first3=SS|last4=McEllmurry|first4=SP|last5=Miller|first5=CJ|last6=Hutt|first6=IA|title=Modeling of power generation pollutant emissions based on locational marginal prices for sustainable water delivery|journal=Energytech, 2011 IEEE|pages=1, 6, 25–26|doi=10.1109/EnergyTech.2011.5948499
|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5948499&amp;isnumber=5948497}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LEEM estimates changes in emissions associated with incremental changes in power demand derived from the locational marginal price (LMP) information from the independent system operators (ISOs) and emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref name="Carter, TH et al. 2011" /&gt; LEEM was developed at Wayne State University as part of a project aimed at optimizing water transmission systems in Detroit, MI starting in 2010 and has since found a wider application as a load profile management tool that can help reduce generation costs and emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=C|last2=McEllmurry|first2=SP|last3=Miller|first3=CJ|last4=Zhou|first4=J|title=An integrated economic/emission/ load profile management dispatch algorithm|journal=IEEE PES General Meeting 2012|publisher=IEEE|pages=25–26|doi=10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electric vehicle''', also called an '''EV''', uses one or more [[electric motor]]s or [[traction motor]]s for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a [[Electric vehicle battery|battery]], [[solar panel]]s or an [[electric generator]] to convert fuel to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Asif Faiz|author2=Christopher S. Weaver|author3=Michael P. Walsh|title=Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles: Standards and Technologies for Controlling Emissions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hqsyv_KD0lgC&amp;pg=PA227+|year=1996|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-3444-7|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, [[electric aircraft]] and [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric spacecraft]].

EVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Modern [[internal combustion engine]]s have been the dominant propulsion method for [[automobile|motor vehicle]]s for almost 100 years, but electric power has remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types.

In the 21st century, EVs saw a resurgence due to technological developments, and an increased focus on [[renewable energy]]. A great deal of demand for electric vehicles developed and a small core of [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) engineers began sharing technical details for doing [[electric vehicle conversion]]s. [[Government incentive]]s to increase adoptions were introduced, including in the United States and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energy.gov/articles/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-federal-and-private-sector-actions-accelerate|title=Obama Administration Announces Federal and Private Sector Actions to Accelerate Electric Vehicle Adoption in the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-transportation-electric-cars-idUSKBN0L71I720150203|title=EU policy-makers seek to make electric transport a priority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric motive power started in 1827, when Hungarian priest [[Ányos Jedlik]] built the first crude but viable electric motor, provided with stator, rotor and commutator, and the year after he used it to power a tiny car.&lt;ref name=Guarnieri&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2012|title=Looking back to electric cars|journal=Proc. HISTELCON 2012 – 3rd Region-8 IEEE HISTory of Electro - Technology CONference: The Origins of Electrotechnologies|pages=#6487583|doi= 10.1109/HISTELCON.2012.6487583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in 1835, professor [[Sibrandus Stratingh]] of University of Groningen, the Netherlands, built a small scale electric car and a Robert Anderson of Scotland is reported to have made a crude electric carriage sometime between the years of 1832 and 1839. Around the same period, early experimental electrical cars were moving on rails, too. American blacksmith and inventor [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]] built a toy electric locomotive, powered by a primitive electric motor, in 1835. In 1838, a Scotsman named [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour (6&amp;nbsp;km/h). In England a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to [[Lilley and Colten]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r066.html |title=History of Railway Electric Traction |publisher=Mikes.railhistory.railfan.net |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain), [[Robert Anderson (inventor)|Robert Anderson]] of [[Scotland]] invented the first crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable [[primary cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mary bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aacarselectrica.htm |title=Inventors - Electric Cars (1890 - 1930) |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mass-produced electric vehicles appeared in America in the early 1900s. In 1902, "Studebaker Automobile Company" entered the automotive business with electric vehicles, though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904. However, with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by Ford, electric cars fell to the wayside&lt;ref name=hendrym&gt;{{cite book|title=Studebaker: One can do a lot of remembering in South Bend|last=Hendry|first=Maurice M|publisher= Automobile Quarterly|location=New Albany, Indiana|pages=228–275|id=Vol X, 3rd Q, 1972}} p231&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the limitations of [[storage batteries]] at that time, electric cars did not gain much popularity, however electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and fast speeds achievable. By the 20th century, electric rail transport became commonplace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles, as [[Electric platform truck|platform trucks]], [[forklift truck]]s, [[ambulance]]s,&lt;ref&gt;pp.8-9 Batten, Chris ''Ambulances'' Osprey Publishing, 04/03/2008&lt;/ref&gt; tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British [[milk float]]; for most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's largest user of electric road vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~racowan/escape.html |title=Escaping Lock-in: the Case of the Electric Vehicle |publisher=Cgl.uwaterloo.ca |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrified trains were used for [[coal]] transport, as the motors did not use precious [[oxygen]] in the mines. Switzerland's lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of [[Rail transport in Switzerland|their rail network]]. One of the earliest [[rechargeable batteries]] - the [[nickel-iron battery]] - was favored by [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] for use in [[electric cars]].

EVs were among the earliest automobiles, and before the preeminence of light, powerful [[internal combustion engines]], electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s. They were produced by [[Baker Electric]], [[Columbia Automobile Company|Columbia Electric]], [[Detroit Electric]], and others, and at one point in history out-sold gasoline-powered vehicles. In fact, in 1900, 28 percent of the cars on the road in the USA were electric. EVs were so popular that even President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and his secret service agents toured Washington, DC, in their Milburn Electrics, which covered {{convert|60|–|70|mi|-1|abbr=on}} per charge.&lt;ref&gt;AAA World Magazine. Jan-Feb 2011, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of developments contributed to decline of electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;See Loeb, A.P., "Steam versus Electric versus Internal Combustion: Choosing the Vehicle Technology at the Start of the Automotive Age," Transportation Research Record, Journal of the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, No. 1885, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auto trail|Improved road infrastructure]] required a greater range than that offered by electric cars, and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in Texas, Oklahoma, and California led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline/petrol, making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also internal combustion powered cars became ever easier to operate thanks to the invention of the [[electric starter]] by [[Charles Kettering]] in 1912,&lt;ref Name=R1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voltec System - Energy Storage and Electric Propulsion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262004450_The_Voltec_System_Energy_Storage_and_Electric_Propulsion|last1=Matthe|first1=Roland|last2=Eberle|first2=Ulrich|date=2014-01-01|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the [[muffler]], which [[Hiram Percy Maxim]] had invented in 1897. As roads were improved outside urban areas electric vehicle range could not compete with the ICE. Finally, [[Assembly line|the initiation of mass production]] of gasoline-powered vehicles by [[Henry Ford]] in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars.&lt;ref name=aboutcom&gt;{{citation

In the 1930s, [[National City Lines]], which was a partnership of [[General Motors]], [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], and [[Standard Oil of California]] purchased many electric [[tram]] networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with GM buses. The partnership was convicted of [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|conspiring]] to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies, but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services.

=== Experimentation ===

In January 1990, General Motors' President introduced its EV concept two-seater, the "Impact", at the Los Angeles Auto Show. That September, the California Air Resources Board mandated major-automaker sales of EVs, in phases starting in 1998. From 1996 to 1998 GM produced 1117 [[General Motors EV1|EV1s]], 800 of which were made available through three-year leases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Driving the Future"|last=Quiroga|first=Tony|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.|year=August 2009|isbn=|location=|pages=52|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, and Toyota also produced limited numbers of EVs for California drivers. In 2003, upon the expiration of GM's EV1 leases, GM discontinued them. The discontinuation has variously been attributed to:
* the auto industry's successful [[United States federal courts|federal court]] challenge to California's [[zero-emissions vehicle]] mandate, 
* a federal regulation requiring GM to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousands EV1s and 
* the success of the oil and auto industries' media campaign to reduce public acceptance of EVs.

[[File:EV1A014 (1) cropped.jpg|left|thumb|[[General Motors EV1]] electric car (1996-1998), story told in movie [[Who Killed the Electric Car?]] ]]
A movie made on the subject in 2005-2006 was titled ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' and released theatrically by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in 2006. The film explores the roles of [[automobile manufacturer]]s, [[oil industry]], the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], batteries, [[hydrogen (car)|hydrogen vehicles]], and [[consumer]]s, and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology.

[[Ford]] released a number of their [[Ford Ecostar]] delivery vans into the market. Honda, Nissan and Toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their EVs, which, like the GM EV1s, had been available only by closed-end lease. After public protests, Toyota sold 200 of its [[Toyota RAV4 EV|RAV EVs]] to eager buyers; they later sold at over their original forty-thousand-dollar price. This lesson did not go unlearned; [[BMW]] of Canada sold off a number of Mini EVs when their Canadian testing ended.

The production of the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]] stopped in September 2005.

Vehicles making use of engines working on the principle of combustion can usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources, usually non-renewable fossil fuels. A key advantage of hybrid or plug-in electric vehicles is [[regenerative braking]], which recovers kinetic energy, typically lost during friction braking as heat, as electricity restored to the on-board battery.

== Electricity sources ==

There are many ways to generate electricity, of varying costs, efficiency and ecological desirability.

=== Connection to generator plants ===
* direct connection to generation plants as is common among [[electric locomotive|electric trains]], trolley buses, and [[trolleytruck|trolley trucks]] (See also : [[overhead lines]], [[third rail]] and [[conduit current collection]])
* [[Online Electric Vehicle]] collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through [[electromagnetic induction]]

=== Onboard generators and hybrid EVs ===

(See articles on [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] and gasoline-electric [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] locomotion for information on EVs using also [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]]s).
* generated on-board using a diesel engine: [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] locomotive
* generated on-board using a [[fuel cell]]: [[fuel cell vehicle]]
* generated on-board using [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]: nuclear [[submarine]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s
* renewable sources such as [[solar power]]: [[solar vehicle]]

It is also possible to have hybrid EVs that derive electricity from multiple sources. Such as:
* on-board [[rechargeable electricity storage system]] (RESS) and a direct continuous connection to land-based generation plants for purposes of on-highway recharging with unrestricted highway range {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* on-board rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source (internal combustion engine): plug-in hybrid

Another form of chemical to electrical conversion is [[fuel cell]]s, projected for future use.

For especially large EVs, such as [[submarine]]s, the chemical energy of the diesel-electric can be replaced by a [[nuclear reactor]]. The nuclear reactor usually provides heat, which drives a [[steam turbine]], which drives a generator, which is then fed to the propulsion. ''See [[Nuclear Power]]''

A few experimental vehicles, such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity.

=== Onboard storage ===
{{electric vehicle}}
These systems are powered from an external generator plant (nearly always when stationary), and then disconnected before motion occurs, and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed.
* on-board [[rechargeable electricity storage system]] (RESS), called Full Electric Vehicles (FEV).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Power storage methods include:
** [[chemical energy]] stored on the vehicle in on-board batteries: [[Battery electric vehicle]] (BEV)
** kinetic energy storage: [[Gyrobus|flywheels]]
** static [[energy]] stored on the vehicle in on-board [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s

Batteries, [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s and [[flywheel energy storage]] are forms of rechargeable on-board [[rechargeable electricity storage system|electrical storage]]. By avoiding an intermediate mechanical step, the [[energy conversion efficiency]] can be improved over the hybrids already discussed, by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions. Furthermore, electro-chemical batteries conversions are easy to reverse, allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form.{{Citation needed|reason=capacitor efficiency allowing|date=November 2017}}

Most electric vehicles use [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] (Li-Ions or LIBs). Lithium ion batteries have higher [[energy density]], longer [[Rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability|life span]] and higher [[power density]] than most other practical batteries. Complicating factors include safety, durability, thermal breakdown and [[Rechargeable battery#Price history|cost]]. Li-ion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges in order to operate safely and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.060| title = A review on the key issues for lithium-ion battery management in electric vehicles| journal = Journal of Power Sources| volume = 226| pages = 272–288| year = 2013| last1 = Lu | first1 = L. | last2 = Han | first2 = X. | last3 = Li | first3 = J. | last4 = Hua | first4 = J. | last5 = Ouyang | first5 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the battery's lifespan decreases effective costs. One technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adany|first=Ron|title=Switching algorithms for extending battery life in Electric Vehicles|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775312019295|accessdate=28 October 2013|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.12.075|volume=231|journal=Journal of Power Sources|pages=50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electric motor ==
{{Main|Traction motor|Energy conversion efficiency}}

The power of a vehicle's electric motor, as in other vehicles, is measured in [[kilowatt]]s (kW). 100&amp;nbsp;kW is roughly equal to 134 [[horsepower]], but electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide RPM range. This means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100&amp;nbsp;kW electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100&amp;nbsp;kW internal combustion engine, which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed.

Energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy. Approximately 90% of the energy from the battery is converted to mechanical energy, the losses being in the motor and drivetrain.&lt;ref&gt;https://matter2energy.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/wells-to-wheels-electric-car-efficiency/&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, [[direct current]] (DC) electricity is fed into a DC/AC inverter where it is converted to [[alternating current]] (AC) electricity and this AC electricity is connected to a 3-phase AC motor.

For electric trains, [[forklift truck]]s, and some electric cars, DC motors are often used. In some cases, [[universal motor]]s are used, and then AC or DC may be employed. In recent production vehicles, various motor types have been implemented, for instance: [[Induction motor]]s within Tesla Motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214993715000032|title = Electric vehicle traction motors without rare earth magnets|last = Widmar|first = Martin|date = 2015|journal = Sustainable Materials and Technologies|doi = 10.1016/j.susmat.2015.02.001|pmid = |access-date =|volume=3|pages=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EVs are on the road in many functions, including electric cars, electric trolleybuses, [[electric bus]]es, [[battery electric bus]]es, [[electric truck]]s, [[electric bicycle]]s, [[electric motorcycles and scooters]], [[personal transporter]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, [[golf cart]]s, [[milk float]]s, and [[forklift truck|forklifts]]. [[Off-road vehicle]]s include electrified [[all-terrain vehicle]]s and [[Elec-Trak|tractor]]s.

==== Railborne EVs ====
{{Main|Railway electrification system}}
[[File:2001-03-31.H-TW2000-Vahrenwalder-Platz.jpg|thumb|A [[streetcar]] (or [[Tram]]) drawing current from a single overhead wire through a [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]].]]

The fixed nature of a rail line makes it relatively easy to power EVs through permanent [[overhead lines]] or electrified [[third rail]]s, eliminating the need for heavy onboard batteries. [[Electric locomotive]]s, electric trams/streetcars/trolleys, electric [[light rail system]]s, and electric [[rapid transit]] are all in common use today, especially in Europe and Asia.

Since electric trains do not need to carry a heavy internal combustion engine or large batteries, they can have very good [[power-to-weight ratio]]s. This allows [[high speed train]]s such as France's double-deck [[TGV]]s to operate at speeds of 320&amp;nbsp;km/h (200&amp;nbsp;mph) or higher, and [[electric locomotive]]s to have a much higher power output than [[diesel locomotive]]s. In addition, they have higher short-term [[overcurrent|surge power]] for fast acceleration, and using [[regenerative brake]]s can put braking power back into the [[electrical grid]] rather than wasting it.

[[Maglev (transport)|Maglev]] trains are also nearly always EVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://namti.org/?page_id=9 |work=North American Maglev Transport Institute |title=-Maglev Technology Explained |date=1 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727110924/http://namti.org/?page_id=9 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy and motors ==
[[File:Trådbuss Landskrona.JPG|thumb|A [[trolleybus]] uses two overhead wires to provide electric current supply and return to the power source]]

Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires. Electric traction allows the use of [[regenerative braking]], in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of, usually, a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending. This regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to utilise the power generated by descending vehicles.

In the systems above, motion is provided by a [[Rotary motor|rotary]] electric motor. However, it is possible to "unroll" the motor to drive directly against a special matched track. These [[linear motor]]s are used in [[maglev train]]s which float above the rails supported by [[magnetic levitation]]. This allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track. In addition to the high-performance control systems needed, [[Railroad switch|switching]] and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors, which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point to point services.

== Properties ==

=== Components ===

The type of [[Electric vehicle battery|battery]], the type of [[traction motor]] and the [[motor controller]] design vary according to the size, power and proposed application, which can be as small as a [[motorized shopping cart]] or [[wheelchair]], through [[pedelec]]s, electric motorcycles and scooters, neighborhood electric vehicles, industrial [[fork-lift truck]]s and including many hybrid vehicles.

=== Energy sources ===

Although EVs have few direct emissions, all rely on energy created through [[electricity generation]], and will usually emit pollution and generate waste, unless it is generated by [[renewable source]] power plants. Since EVs use whatever electricity is delivered by their electrical utility/grid operator, EVs can be made more or less efficient, polluting and expensive to run, by modifying the electrical generating stations. This would be done by an electrical utility under a government energy policy, in a timescale negotiated between utilities and government.

[[Fossil fuel]] vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a nation's fleet of vehicles. New efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles, often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their end-of-life. Only a few nations set a retirement age for old vehicles, such as Japan or [[Driving in Singapore|Singapore]], forcing periodic upgrading of all vehicles already on the road.

EVs will take advantage of whatever environmental gains happen when a renewable energy generation station comes online, a [[fossil-fuel power station]] is decommissioned or upgraded. Conversely, if government policy or economic conditions shifts generators back to use more polluting fossil fuels and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), or more inefficient sources, the reverse can happen. Even in such a situation, electrical vehicles are still more efficient than a comparable amount of fossil fuel vehicles. In areas with a deregulated electrical energy market, an electrical vehicle owner can choose whether to run his electrical vehicle off conventional electrical energy sources, or strictly from renewable electrical energy sources (presumably at an additional cost), pushing other consumers onto conventional sources, and switch at any time between the two.

=== Issues with batteries ===

=== Efficiency ===

Because of the different methods of charging possible, the emissions produced have been quantified in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varga|first=Bogdan Ovidiu|title=Energy management of electric and hybrid vehicles dependent on powertrain configuration|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=20 February 2012|volume=2|issue=2|pages=253–263|doi=10.2478/s13531-011-0066-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plug-in all-electric and hybrid vehicles also have different consumption characteristics.&lt;ref name=knipping&gt;Knipping, E. and Duvall, M.

=== Electromagnetic radiation ===

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] from high performance electrical motors has been claimed to be associated with some human ailments, but such claims are largely unsubstantiated except for extremely high exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/power-lines/index.htm |title=GreenFacts summary of the IARC Evaluation of Static and Extremely Low-Frequency (ELFs) Electric and Magnetic Fields |publisher=Greenfacts.org |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric motors can be shielded within a metallic [[Faraday cage]], but this reduces efficiency by adding weight to the vehicle, while it is not conclusive that all electromagnetic radiation can be contained.

=== Charging ===

==== Grid capacity ====

If a large proportion of private vehicles were to convert to grid electricity it would increase the demand for generation and transmission, and consequent emissions.&lt;ref name="Liasi"&gt;Liasi, Sahand Ghaseminejad, and Masoud Aliakbar Golkar. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7985237/citations "Electric vehicles connection to microgrid effects on peak demand with and without demand response."] In Electrical Engineering (ICEE), 2017 Iranian Conference on, pp. 1272-1277. IEEE, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish because of the higher efficiency of EVs over the entire cycle. In the USA it has been estimated there is already nearly sufficient existing power plant and transmission infrastructure, assuming that most charging would occur overnight, using the most efficient off-peak [[base load]] sources.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.asp?id=204 |title=PNNL: Newsroom - Mileage from megawatts: Study finds enough electric capacity to "fill up" plug-in vehicles across much of the nation |publisher=Pnl.gov |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK however, things are different. While National Grid's high-voltage electricity transmission system can currently manage the demand of 1 million electric cars, Steve Holliday (CEO National Grid PLC) said, “penetration up and above that becomes a real issue. Local distribution networks in cities like London may struggle to balance their grids if drivers choose to all plug in their cars at the same time."

==== Charging stations ====
[[File:2014 BYD E6.jpg|thumb|[[BYD e6]]. Recharging in 15 Minutes to 80 Percent]]

{{Main|Charging station}}

EVs typically charge from conventional power outlets or dedicated charging stations, a process that typically takes hours, but can be done overnight and often gives a charge that is sufficient for normal everyday usage.

However, with the widespread implementation of [[electric vehicle network]]s within large cities in the UK and Europe, EV users can plug in their cars whilst at work and leave them to charge throughout the day, extending the possible range of commutes and eliminating [[range anxiety]].

A recharging system that avoids the need for a cable is Curb Connect, patented in 2012&lt;ref&gt;Dower, Gordon (2012). [https://web.archive.org/web/20151017220708/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8%2C138%2C718&amp;OS=8%2C138%2C718&amp;RS=8%2C138%2C718 "US Patent: Docking bay for conditionally supplying battery recharging energy to a vehicle utilizing non plug-in electrical contact between a pair of docking bay contacts and a pair of vehicle contacts"]&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr Gordon Dower. In this system, electrical contacts are fitted into curbs, such as angle parking spaces on city streets. When a suitably authorized vehicle is parked so that its front end overhangs the curb, the curb contacts become energized and charging occurs.

Another proposed solution for daily recharging is a standardized [[inductive charging]] system such as Evatran's [[Plugless Power]]. Benefits are the convenience of parking over the charge station and minimized cabling and connection infrastructure.&lt;ref name=cleantech100120&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantech.com/news/5537/electric-vehicle-car-disaster-market |title='Disaster' scenarios for electric cars |author=Dallas Kachan |publisher=Cleantech Group |date=January 20, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123183747/http://cleantech.com/news/5537/electric-vehicle-car-disaster-market |archivedate=2010-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swvatoday090918&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swvatoday.com/comments/electric_car_company/news/6018/ |title = Electric (Car) Company |publisher = Wytheville News |author = Hubbard, Nate |date = September 18, 2009 |accessdate = 2009-09-19 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130111091735/http://www.swvatoday.com/comments/electric_car_company/news/6018/ |archivedate = January 11, 2013 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnet100226&gt;{{cite web |url = http://industry.bnet.com/auto/10003830/hands-free-ev-charging-is-on-the-horizon-from-plugless-power/ |title = Evatran Hoping To Cash In On Plug-Free Electric Cars |publisher = CBS Interactive Inc.

Yet another proposed solution for the typically less frequent, long distance travel is "rapid charging", such as the [[Aerovironment]] PosiCharge line (up to 250&amp;nbsp;kW) and the [[Norvik]] MinitCharge line (up to 300&amp;nbsp;kW). [[Ecotality]] is a manufacturer of Charging Stations and has partnered with Nissan on several installations. Battery replacement is also proposed as an alternative, although no OEMs including Nissan/Renault have any production vehicle plans. Swapping requires standardization across platforms, models and manufacturers. Swapping also requires many times more battery packs to be in the system.

According to [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] research conducted at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], 84% of existing vehicles could be switched over to plug-in hybrids without requiring any new grid infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Kintner/&gt;{{rp|1}} In terms of transportation, the net result would be a 27% total reduction in emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]]es [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrous oxide]], a 31% total reduction in [[nitrogen oxide]]s, a slight reduction in nitrous oxide emissions, an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] emissions, the same [[sulfur dioxide]] emissions, and the near elimination of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[volatile organic compound]] emissions (a 98% decrease in carbon monoxide and a 93% decrease in volatile organic compounds).&lt;ref name=Kintner/&gt;{{rp|13 }} The emissions would be displaced away from street level, where they have "high human-health implications."&lt;ref name=Kintner/&gt;{{rp|4 }}

==== Battery swapping ====

Instead of recharging EVs from electric socket, batteries could be mechanically replaced at special stations in a couple of minutes ([[battery swapping]]).

Batteries with greatest [[energy density]] such as metal-air fuel cells usually cannot be recharged in purely electric way. Instead, some kind of metallurgical process is needed, such as aluminum smelting and similar.

Silicon-air, aluminum-air and other metal-air fuel cells look promising candidates for swap batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=16 mei 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfdYU7gk8fs |title=The Future of Gas Stations, Electric Battery Swap Station |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=7 maart 2007 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0SB5psrVCM&amp;feature=related |title=Unlimited Range Electric Car |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any source of energy, renewable or non-renewable, could be used to remake used metal-air fuel cells with
relatively high efficiency. Investment in infrastructure will be needed. The cost of such batteries could be
an issue, although they could be made with replaceable anodes and electrolyte.

==== Chassis swapping ====

Instead of replacing batteries, it is possible to replace the entire chassis (including the batteries, electric motor and wheels) of an electric [[Modular vehicle]].

Such a system was patented in 2000 by Dr Gordon Dower and three road-licensed prototypes have been built by the [http://ridek.com Ridek Corporation] in Point Roberts, Washington.{{Third-party inline|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Dower, Gordon (2000). [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=%22Modular+vehicle+construction+transportation+system%22&amp;OS= "US Patent: Modular vehicle construction and transportation system"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dower proposed that an individual might own only the body (or perhaps a few different style bodies) for their vehicle, and would lease the chassis from a pool, thereby reducing the depreciation costs associated with vehicle ownership.

Conventional [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s are being worked to achieve the energy density of lithium ion batteries, offering almost unlimited lifespans and no environmental issues.

=== Safety ===

The [[United Nations]] in [[Geneva]] ([[UNECE]]) has adopted the first international regulation (Regulation 100) on safety of both fully electric and hybrid electric cars, with the intent of ensuring that cars with a [[high voltage]] electric power train, such as hybrid and fully EVs, are as safe as combustion-powered cars. The EU and Japan have already indicated that they intend to incorporate the new UNECE Regulation in their respective rules on technical standards for vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/260&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA - Press Releases - Car safety: European Commission welcomes international agreement on electric and hybrid cars |publisher=Europa.eu |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing concern about the safety of EVs, given the demonstrated tendency of the Lithium-ion battery, most promising for EV use because of its high energy density, to overheat, possibly leading to fire or explosion, especially when damaged in a crash. The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] opened a defect investigation of the [[Chevy Volt]] on November 25, 2011 amid concerns over the risk of battery fires in a crash. At that time, automotive consulting firm [[CNW Marketing Research]] reported a decline in consumer interest in the Volt, citing the fires as having made an impact on consumer perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/business/general-motors-to-re-examine-volts-welded-parts.html|title=G.M.

The agency also announced it has developed interim guidance to increase awareness and identify appropriate safety measures regarding electric vehicles for the emergency response community, law enforcement officers, tow truck operators, storage facilities and consumers.&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/business/us-finds-no-defect-in-volt.html?_r=1&amp;ref=automobiles |title=In Fire Investigation, Regulators Say They Found No Defect in Volt |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |last2=Vlasic |first2=Bill |work=The New York Times|date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/nhtsa-concludes-safety-defect-investigation-into-post-crash-fire-risk-of-the-volt.html |title=NHTSA concludes safety defect investigation into post-crash fire risk of the Volt |work=Green Car Congress |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages and disadvantages of EVs ===
{{Sustainable energy}}

==== Environmental ====

EVs release no tail pipe air pollutants at the place where they are operated. They also typically generate less [[noise pollution]] than an internal combustion engine vehicle, whether at rest or in motion.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; The energy that electric and hybrid cars consume is usually [[electricity generation|generated]] by means that have environmental impacts. Nevertheless, adaptation of EVs would have a significant net environmental benefit, except in a few countries that continue to rely on older coal fired power plants for the bulk of their electricity generation throughout the life of the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electroauto.com/info/pollmyth.shtml|title= Debunking the Myth of EVs and Smokestacks|author= Chip Gribben| publisher= |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buekers"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Buekers | first = J | title = Health and environmental benefits related to electric vehicle introduction in EU countries | journal = Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 26–38 | year = 2014 | url =https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266450977_Health_and_environmental_benefits_related_to_electric_vehicle_introduction_in_EU_countries | last2 =Van Holderbeke

There are special kind of electric vehicles named SAFA TEMPO in Nepal that help lower the pollution created by vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.paranjaya.com.np/2012/08/safa-tempos-electric-vehicles-to-save.html|title = SAFA Tempos: Electric Vehicles to Save Pollution(Electric Vehicle in Nepal)|date = August 4, 2012|accessdate = December 13, 2014|website = |publisher = Paranjaya Paudel}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vehicles are powered by electricity - usually charged batteries - rather than oil or gas and currently heavily promoted by the government to facilitate environmental and vehicle management issues. Electric motors don't require oxygen, unlike internal combustion engines; this is useful for [[submarine]]s and for [[Rover (space exploration)|space rover]]s.

A study by Cambridge Econometrics shows the potential air pollution benefits of EVs. According to one of the scenarios in the study, Europe would be on track to reduce CO2 emissions from cars by 88% by 2050. The associated technology improvements would cut toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from cars from around 1.3 million tonnes per year to around 70,000 tonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportenvironment.org/press/electromobility-could-create-over-200000-net-additional-jobs-2030-europe-%E2%80%93-study|title=Electromobility could create over 200,000 net additional jobs by 2030 in Europe – study  {{!}} Transport &amp; Environment|website=www.transportenvironment.org|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mechanical ====
[[File:Tesla Motors Model S base.JPG|thumb|[[Tesla Model S]] chassis with drive motor]]
[[File:Tesla Model S motor cutout.jpg|thumb|Cutaway view of a [[Tesla Model S]] drive motor]]

Electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90% [[energy conversion efficiency]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectbetterplace.com/images/resources/factsheet_projectbetterplace.pdf Better Place]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled. They can also be combined with [[regenerative braking]] systems that have the ability to convert movement energy back into stored electricity. This can be used to reduce the wear on brake systems (and consequent brake pad dust) and reduce the total energy requirement of a trip. Regenerative braking is especially effective for start-and-stop city use.

They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from rest, unlike internal combustion engines, and do not need multiple gears to match power curves. This removes the need for [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]]es and [[torque converter]]s.

EVs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and [[vibration]] than internal combustion engines.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/road/electric_en.htm |title=Transport: Electric vehicles - European commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2009-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033116/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/road/electric_en.htm |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is a desirable attribute, it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind, elderly and very young pedestrians. To mitigate this situation, automakers and individual companies are developing systems that produce [[Electric vehicle warning sounds|warning sounds]] when EVs are moving slowly, up to a speed when normal motion and rotation (road, suspension, electric motor, etc.) noises become audible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aIqaK2fByA.8 |title=Nissan Adds 'Beautiful' Noise to Make Silent Electric Cars Safe |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Energy resilience ====

Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources, therefore it gives the greatest degree of [[energy resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future |title=Our Electric Future — The American, A Magazine of Ideas |publisher=American.com |accessdate=2010-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/ |archive-date=2014-08-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Energy efficiency ====

EV '[[tank-to-wheel]]s' efficiency is about a factor of 3 higher than internal combustion engine vehicles.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; Energy is not consumed while the vehicle is stationary, unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel while idling. However, looking at the [[well-to-wheel]] efficiency of EVs, their total emissions, while still lower, are closer to an efficient gasoline or diesel in most countries where electricity generation relies on fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/C0EE00031K |author1=Aaron R.

Well-to-wheel efficiency of an EV has less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity production. A particular EV would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuel to a wind or tidal primary source of energy. Thus, when "well-to-wheels" is cited, one should keep in mind that the discussion is no longer about the vehicle, but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructure - in the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration, mining, refining, and distribution.

The lifecycle analysis of EVs shows that even when powered by the most carbon intensive electricity in Europe, they emit less greenhouse gases than a conventional diesel vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/2017_10_EV_LCA_briefing_final.pdf|title=Electric vehicle life cycle analysis and raw material availability|last=Lepetit|first=Yoann|date=October 2017|website=Transport &amp; Environment|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cost of recharge ====

The cost of operating an EV varies wildly depending on location. In some parts of the world, an EV costs less to drive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, as long as the higher initial purchase price is not factored in. In the US, in states which have a tiered electricity rate schedule, "fuel" for EVs today costs owners significantly more than fuel for a comparable gas-powered vehicle. A 2011 study done by Purdue University found that in California most users already reach the third pricing tier for electricity each month, and adding an EV could push them into the fourth or fifth (highest, most expensive) tier, meaning that they will be paying in excess of $0.45 per kWh for electricity to recharge their vehicle. At this price, which is higher than the average electricity price in the US, it is dramatically more expensive to drive a pure-EV than it is to drive a traditional pure-gas powered vehicle. "The objective of a tiered pricing system is to discourage consumption. It's meant to get you to think about turning off your lights and conserving electricity. In California, the unintended consequence is that plug-in hybrid cars won't be economical under this system," said Tyner (the author), whose findings were published in the online version of the journal Energy Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyner|first=Wally|url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/110113TynerHybrids.html|title=Electricity pricing policies may make or break plug-in hybrid buys|publisher=Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since EVs can be plugged into the [[electric grid]] when not in use, there is a potential for battery-powered vehicles to even cut the demand for electricity by feeding electricity ''into'' the grid from their batteries during peak use periods (such as midafternoon air conditioning use) while doing most of their charging at night, when there is unused generating capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantech.com/news/990/first-vehicle-to-grid-demonstration |title=First vehicle-to-grid demonstration |accessdate=2009-03-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523233412/http://cleantech.com/news/990/first-vehicle-to-grid-demonstration |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liasi"/&gt; This [[vehicle-to-grid]] (V2G) connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants, as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their batteries, by being drained by the power company during peak demand. It is also proved that an electric vehicle parking lot was able to well play the role of an agent that provides [[demand response]].&lt;ref&gt;Shafie-khah, Miadreza, et al. "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7328756&amp;isnumber=7593445 Optimal behavior of electric vehicle parking lots as demand response aggregation agents]." IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid 7.6 (2016): 2654-2665. doi: 10.1109/TSG.2015.2496796&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, our current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variable-output power sources such as wind and solar PV. This variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV batteries are charged, or possibly even discharged.

Some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations, much like gas/petrol stations today. Clearly these will require enormous storage and charging potentials, which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging, and to output power during shortage periods, much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-library/downloads/enginesgasturbines |title=Engines and Gas Turbines &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/131/ National Grid's use of Emergency.

==== Range ====

Electric vehicles may have shorter range compared to Internal Combustion Engines, however, the price per mile of electric vehicles is falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/explaining-electric-plug-hybrid-electric-vehicles|title=Explaining Electric &amp; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR,OTAQ,TCD|first=US|website=US EPA|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/the-average-price-of-electric-cars-rose-in-2016-but-its-not-a-backwards-trend/|title=Electric vehicle price is rising, but cost-per-mile is falling|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most owners opt to charge their vehicles primarily at their houses while not in use due to their typically slower charging times, and added convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1117053_twitter-poll-results-more-electric-cars-get-charged-at-work-than-at-public-chargers|title=Twitter poll results: More electric cars get charged at work than at public chargers|work=Green Car Reports|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heating of EVs ====

In cold climates, considerable energy is needed to heat the interior of a vehicle and to defrost the windows. With internal combustion engines, this heat already exists as waste combustion heat diverted from the engine cooling circuit. This process offsets the [[greenhouse gas]]es' external costs. If this is done with battery EVs, the interior heating requires extra energy from the vehicles' batteries. Although some heat could be harvested from the motor or motors and battery, their greater efficiency means there is not as much waste heat available as from a combustion engine.

However, for vehicles which are connected to the grid, battery EVs can be preheated, or cooled, with little or no need for battery energy, especially for short trips.

Newer designs are focused on using super-[[thermal insulation|insulated]] cabins which can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the passengers. This is not enough, however, in colder climates as a driver delivers only about 100 W of heating power. A [[heat pump]] system, capable of cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter, seems to be the most practical and promising way of solving the thermal management of the EV. Ricardo Arboix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://r744.com/assets/paper/file/pdf_421.pdf |title=Introduction and background |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107222027/http://r744.com/assets/paper/file/pdf_421.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced (2008) a new concept based on the principle of combining the thermal-management of the EV-battery with the thermal-management of the cabin using a heat pump system. This is done by adding a third heat-exchanger, thermally connected with the battery-core, to the traditional heat pump/air conditioning system used in previous EV-models like the GM EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV. The concept has proven to bring several benefits, such as prolonging the life-span of the battery as well as improving the performance and overall energy-efficiency of the EV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.r744.com/articles/2009-09-18-iaa-ixetic-displays-r744-lithium-ion-battery-cooling-for-evs.php |title=R744.COM/ Ixetic |access-date=2016-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222175229/http://www.r744.com/articles/2009-09-18-iaa-ixetic-displays-r744-lithium-ion-battery-cooling-for-evs.php |archive-date=2012-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valeo.com/fileadmin/dotcom/uploads/Publications/Mondial_auto_2008/PRESS%20KIT%20eng.pdf |title=Valeo Press Kit |publisher=R744.com |accessdate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717184553/http://www.valeo.com/fileadmin/dotcom/uploads/Publications/Mondial_auto_2008/PRESS%20KIT%20eng.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dana.mediaroom.com/index.php/press_releases/2203 |title=Dana |publisher=Dana.mediaroom.com |accessdate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064756/http://dana.mediaroom.com/index.php/press_releases/2203 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://behr.de/Internet/behrcms_eng.nsf/$all/662CCCAA03FEEAEAC125762E004A623E?open&amp;qm=leftmenu2,5,5,0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013190739/http://www.behr.de/Internet/behrcms_eng.nsf/$all/662CCCAA03FEEAEAC125762E004A623E?open&amp;qm=leftmenu2,5,5,0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-13 |title=Behr |publisher=Behr.de |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2010-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electric public transit efficiency ==

Shifts from private to [[public transport]] (train, [[trolleybus]], [[personal rapid transit]] or tram) have the potential for large gains in efficiency in terms of an individual's distance traveled per kWH.

Research shows people do prefer trams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/trams-energy-saving-private-cars-trolley-buses-diesel-buses.html |title=Trams, energy saving, private cars, trolley buses, diesel buses &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having higher status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/sustainable-light-rail-2.html |title=SUSTAINABLE LIGHT RAIL &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel consumption in cities through the use of electric trams. Trams may be the most energy-efficient form of public transportation, with rubber wheeled vehicles using 2/3 more energy than the equivalent tram, and run on electricity rather than fossil fuels.

In terms of [[net present value]], they are also the cheapest—[[Blackpool tram]]s are still running after 100-years,{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} but combustion buses only last about 15-years.

== Incentives and promotion ==
{{Main|Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles}}
{{See also|Electric car use by country}}

In May 2017, India was the first to announce plans to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsclick.in/india-plans-sell-only-electric-cars-2030|title=India Plans to Sell Only Electric Cars by 2030 {{!}} NewsClick|website=NewsClick|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/04/21/india-considers-100-electric-vehicles-2030/|title=India Considers 100% Electric Vehicles By 2030 {{!}} CleanTechnica|website=cleantechnica.com|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]]'s government kickstarted the ambitious plan by floating a tender to purchase 10,000 electric vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=171263|title=EESL to procure 10,000 Electric Vehicles from TATA Motors|website=pib.nic.in|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; hailed as "the world’s single-largest EV procurement initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1095005/tata-motors-and-mahindra-are-in-the-drivers-seat-as-india-revs-up-its-grand-electric-vehicles-plan/|title=As India revs up its grand electric vehicles plan, Tata and Mahindra are in the driver’s seat|last=Balachandran|first=Manu|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with fulfilling the urgent need to keep air pollution in check, the Indian government aims at reducing the petroleum import bill and running cost of vehicles. With nearly a third of all cars sold in 2017 of all new cars either fully electric or a hybrid, Norway is the world leader in the adoption of electric cars and pushes to sell only electric or hybrid cars by 2030. The other nations followed the lead, with France and UK announcing the plan to ban the sale of gas and diesel cars by 2040. Austria, China, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Korea and Spain have also set official targets for electric car sales.

Many governments offer incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles, with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil consumption. Some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant. Other incentives include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes, and investment in charging infrastructure.

In some states, car companies have partnered with local private utilities in order to provide large incentives on select electric vehicles. For example, in the state of Florida, Nissan and NextEra Energy, a local energy company, are working together to offer $10,000 incentives on the all-electric 2017 Nissan Leaf. In addition, the government offers electric vehicle incentives up to $7,500 to people who meet the qualifications outlined by the Federal Electric Vehicles Tax Credit. A standard 2017 Nissan Leaf costs around $30,000. As a result, Florida residents could purchase a new Leaf for less than half of the market value price.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2017/04/14/nissan-leaf-discounting/|title=Nissan is heavily discounting the LEAF with special deals for just ~$13,000 ahead of next-generation|author=Frederic Lambert|work=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Diego's local private utility, San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&amp;E), offers its customers an electric vehicle incentive of $10,000 for a 2017 BMW i3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sdge.com/clean-energy/electric-vehicles/10000-means-affordable-electric-cars-sdge-customers|title=$10,000 off 2017 BMW i3|author=SDG&amp;E|work=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonoma Clean Power, the public utility that serves both Sonoma and Mendocino, offers its customers EV incentives up to $2,000 on a Volkswagen e-Golf. In addition, Volkswagen offers an incentive of $7,000 towards the purchase of an e-Golf. On top of these local incentives, and the federal tax credit, California residents can receive state incentives up to $2,500 in the form of state rebates. Therefore, Sonoma Clean Power customers can potentially save up to $19,000 on an e-Wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/7294986-181/new-electric-car-for-less?artslide=0|title=New electric car for less than $10,000? Sonoma County makes it happen|author=Guy Kovner|work=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, NPR reported that demand for electricity in the U.S. had begun to decline. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] projected a 13 percent drop in demand among the seven states it serves, which is "the first persistent decline in the federally owned agency's 85-year history." To combat this, companies in the utility sector launched programs to get more involved in the electric car market. For example, utility companies began to invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and to team up with automobile manufacturers to offer rebates to people who purchase electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/29/598032288/u-s-utilities-look-to-electric-cars-as-their-savior-amid-decline-in-demand|title=U.S. Utilities Look To Electric Cars As Their Savior Amid Decline In Demand|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved batteries ===

First, advances in [[lithium ion battery|lithium ion batteries]], in large part driven by the consumer electronics industry, allow full-sized, highway-capable EVs to be propelled as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline. Lithium batteries have been made safe, can be recharged in minutes instead of hours (see [[Rechargeable battery#Recharging time|recharging time]]), and now last longer than the typical vehicle (see [[Rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability|lifespan]]). The production cost of these lighter, higher-capacity lithium batteries is gradually decreasing as the technology matures and production volumes increase (see [[Rechargeable battery#Price history|price history]]).

[[Toyota]] Motors Corporation is trying to replace the current lithium ion battery with [[solid-state battery]] technology by 2020. The solid-state battery replaces the liquid electrolyte with a solid electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20130311/OEM06/303119959/toyota-targets-solid-state-batteries-in-20#axzz2iyZa2oux|title=Toyota targets solid-state batteries in '20|author=Hans Greimel|work=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506881/how-improved-batteries-will-make-electric-vehicles-competitive/|title=Advances in Lithium-Ion Batteries Will Make Electric Vehicles Competitive, But It Will Take a Decade - MIT Technology Review|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rechargeable [[Lithium–air battery|lithium-air batteries]] potentially offer increased range over other types and are a current topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2009/Pages/airfuelledbattery.aspx |title=STAIR electrochemical battery |publisher=Epsrc.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709184949/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2009/Pages/airfuelledbattery.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battery management and intermediate storage ===

Another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery through electronic control, employing [[supercapacitor]]s to buffer large but short power demands and [[regenerative braking]] energy. The development of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak points mentioned above. The cell management involves not only monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration (one more cell than needed). With sophisticated switched wiring it is possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty.

[[File:Chandra X-ray View of Orion.jpg|thumb|300px|X-ray view of Orion showing the Trapezium embedded cluster.]]

'''Embedded stellar clusters''', or simply '''embedded clusters''' (EC), are [[open cluster]]s that are still surrounded by their progenitor [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name="LL03" /&gt;
They are often areas of active [[star formation]], giving rise to stellar objects that have similar ages and compositions.&lt;ref name="cle2004" /&gt;
Because of the dense material that surrounds the stars, they appear obscured in [[visible light]] but can be observed using other sections of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as the [[near-infrared]] and [[X-ray]]s that can see through the cloud material.&lt;ref name=Feigelson13 /&gt; In our Galaxy, embedded clusters can mostly be found within the Galactic disk or near the Galactic center where most of the star-formation activity is happening. &lt;ref name="cle2004" /&gt;

The sizes of stellar objects born in embedded clusters are distributed according to [[initial mass function]], with many low-mass stars formed for every high-mass star. Nevertheless, the high-mass stars of temperature class [[OB stars|O and B]], which are significantly hotter and more luminous than the low-mass stars, have a disproportionate effect on their interstellar environment by ionizing the gas surrounding them creating [[H II region]]s. Many [[ultra-compact H II region]]s, the precursors to massive protostars, are associated with embedded clusters.&lt;ref name="cle2004" /&gt;

Over time, radiation pressure from the stellar objects will disperse the molecular cloud and give rise to the better known [[open cluster]].

Several famous embedded clusters include the [[Trapezium cluster]] in the [[Orion Nebula]], L1688 in the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]], [[NGC 2244]] in the [[Rosette Nebula]], the cluster in the [[Trifid Nebula]], NGC 6611 in the [[Eagle Nebula]], and [[Trumpler 14]], [[Trumpler 15|15]], and [[Trumpler 16|16]] in the [[Carina Nebula]]

'''''Fallout Protection: What To Know And Do About Nuclear Attack''''' was an official [[United States federal government]] booklet released in December 1961 by the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[United States civil defense|Office of Civil Defense]].
The first page of the book is a note from then-[[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] explaining that the booklet is the result of the first task he was given when he assumed responsibility for the Federal Civil Defense Program in August 1961. The task, assigned by President [[John F. Kennedy]], was to "give the American people the facts they need to know about the dangers of a [[nuclear warfare|thermonuclear attack]] and what they can do to protect themselves."

== Subject matter ==
Much more straightforward about the dangers of atomic weapons than ''[[Survival Under Atomic Attack]]'', and published in the era of the [[hydrogen bomb]] and the [[ICBM]], the book first explains general information and hazards of [[nuclear weapons]], [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] and [[radiation]]. Second, it covers community [[fallout shelters]], improvised fallout shelters and supplies that one ought to have ready in case of a [[nuclear attack]]. There is a brief section outlining "emergency housekeeping" which covers water and food conservation and first aid for the time spent in the shelter. Last, the booklet mentions recovery and how to clean up the fallout.

A '''flapper valve''' is a type of valve used in flush [[toilet]]s. It creates the watertight seal in the toilet tank that holds the water until flushing. When one pushes the handle, the flapper raises, allowing the water to flush out the excreted items, the flapper then goes back down and recreates the watertight seal.

The '''Ford F-Series''' is a series of [[Truck classification#Light duty|light-duty trucks]] and medium-duty trucks (Class 2-7) that have been marketed and manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company]] since 1948. While most variants of the F-Series trucks are [[Pickup truck#North American full-size pickups|full-size pickup trucks]], the F-Series also includes [[chassis cab]] trucks and [[commercial vehicle]]s. The Ford F-Series has been the [[List of best-selling automobiles|best-selling vehicle in the United States]] since 1986 and the best-selling pickup since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 25, 2007|title=Ford's Best Selling Pickups Add More Features For 2008|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2007/163_news070524_2008_ford_trucks_features|journal=Truck Trend|publisher=Ford Motor Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/auto-sales-reach-six-year-high-demand-peaked-article-1.1567645|title=Auto sales reach six-year high of 15.6 million vehicles sold, Ford F-Series takes the lead|date=January 6, 2014|work=Daily News|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the best selling vehicle in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/top-10-best-selling-vehicles/article1512191/|title=Top 10 best-selling vehicles – The Globe and Mail|last=Cato|first=Jeremy|date=March 25, 2010|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2018 model year, the F-Series generates ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|41|2018|r=1}}}} billion in annual revenue for Ford, making the F-Series brand more valuable than [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/news/future-ford-filled-mustangs-trucks-off-road-suvs/ FUTURE OF FORD IS FILLED WITH MORE MUSTANGS, TRUCKS, OFF-ROAD SUVS] ''[[Motor Trend]] (03/15/2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, to bridge the gap between the pickup line and the medium-duty trucks, the F-250 and F-350 became the [[Ford Super Duty]] vehicles; considered an expansion of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks are built on a distinct chassis with heavier-duty components. As of the 2017 model year, the F-Series includes the F-150, the Super Duty (F-250 through F-550), and [[Ford F-650|F-650 and F-750 Super Duty]] medium-duty commercial trucks. The most popular version of the F-Series is the F-150, now in its thirteenth generation.

Through the use of [[rebadging]], Ford has marketed the F-Series through all three Ford divisions in North America. From 1946 to 1968, Mercury sold the [[Mercury M-Series]] in Canada; during the 2000s, Lincoln sold the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], replaced by the [[Lincoln Mark LT]].

== First generation (1948–1952) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (first generation)}}
[[File:1950 Ford F3.jpg|thumb|1950 F-3]]

The first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in 1948 as a replacement for the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, cab-over engine (COE), conventional truck, and school bus chassis body styles.

== Second generation (1953–1956) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (second generation)}}
[[File:1954 Ford F-100 Red.jpg|thumb|1953 F-100]]

For the 1953 model year, Ford introduced a second generation of the F-Series trucks.  Increased dimensions, improved engines, and an updated chassis were features of the second generation.  In another change, the model nomenclature of the F-Series was expanded to three numbers; this remains in use in the present day.  The half-ton F-1 became the F-100 (partially influenced by the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}; the F-2 and F-3 were combined into the ¾-ton F-250 while the F-4 became the one-ton F-350.  Conventional F-Series trucks were F-500 to F-900; COE chassis were renamed C-Series trucks.

While large body parts are the same from 1953-1956 F-100 &amp; F-250s (namely the hood, fenders, and all bed components), in 1956 the cab underwent a major revision.  Centered around a wraparound windshield, the cab was given new doors, a redesigned dashboard, and an (optional) panoramic rear window).  In line with Ford cars, the 1956 F-Series offered seat belts as an option.

== Third generation (1957–1960) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (third generation)}}
[[File:1960 Ford F-500 stake truck black fr.jpg|thumb|1960 F-500]]

Introduced in 1957, the third generation F-series was a significant modernization and redesign. Front fenders became integrated into the body, and the new Styleside bed continued the smooth lines to the rear of the pickup.

The cab-over F-Series was discontinued, having been replaced by the tilt-cab [[Ford C-Series|C-Series]].

In 1959, Ford began in-house production of four-wheel-drive pickups.

== Fourth generation (1961–1966) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (fourth generation)}}
[[File:1965 Ford F100 Pick Up.jpg|thumb|1965 F-100]]

Ford introduced a dramatically new style of pickup in 1961 with the fourth generation F-Series. Longer and lower than its predecessors, these trucks had increased dimensions and new engine and gearbox choices. Additionally, the 1961–1963 models were constructed as a unibody design with the cab and bed integrated. This proved unpopular and Ford reverted to the traditional separate cab/bed design in 1964.

In 1965, the F-Series was given a significant mid-cycle redesign. A completely new platform, including the "[[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]" front suspension, was introduced that would be used until 1996 on the F-150 and until 2016 on the F-250/350 4x2. Additionally that year, the Ranger name made its first appearance on a Ford pickup; previously a base model of the Edsel, it was now used to denote a high-level styling package for F-Series pickups.&lt;ref&gt;This F-series Ranger is distinct from compact [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] series of pickup trucks introduced in 1983 for North America, although the latter used technology from the full-size trucks, such as the Twin I-Beam front suspension on two-wheel-drive models and Twin Traction Beam suspension on four-wheel-drive.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fifth generation (1967–1972) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (fifth generation)}}
[[File:1972 Ford F-250 Camper Special pickup.jpg|thumb|1972 F-250 Camper Special]]

Introduced in 1967, the fifth generation F-series pickup was built on the same platform as the 1965 revision of the fourth generation. Dimensions and greenhouse glass were increased, engine options expanded, and plusher trim levels became available during the fifth generation's production run.

Suspension components from all 1969 F-Series models are completely interchangeable.

Perhaps the most rare of this series is the Heavy Duty Special, often confused with the Camper Special. However, the Heavy Duty Special is a 1/2 T with upgraded heavy duty parts such as Firestone overload rear leaf mounts, larger brake drums and axles. 

A variant of the fifth generation F-series was produced until 1992 in Brazil for the South American market. 

{{clear}}

== Sixth generation (1973–1979) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (sixth generation)}}
[[File:Ford F-250 Ranger.jpg|thumb|1979 F-250 Ranger]]

The sixth generation F-series was introduced in 1973. This version of the F-series continued to be built on the 1965 fourth generation's revised platform, but with significant modernization and refinements. Front disc brakes, increased cabin dimensions, gas tank relocated outside the cab and under the bed, significantly improved heating and air conditioning, full double wall bed construction, increased use of galvanized steel, Super-cab was introduced in the sixth generation pickup.

The FE engine series was discontinued in 1976 after a nearly 20-year run, replaced by the more modern 351 series (Modified) and 400 series engines.

In 1975, the F-150 was introduced in between the F-100 and the F-250 in order to avoid certain emission control restrictions. For 1978, square headlights replaced the previous models' round ones on higher trim package models, such as Lariat and Ranger, and in 1979 became standard equipment. Also for 1978, the Ford Bronco was redesigned into a variant of the F-series pickup. 1979 was the last year that the 460 big block engine was available in a half ton truck.

== Seventh generation (1980–1986) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (seventh generation)}}
[[File:7th-Ford-F150.jpg|thumb|F-150 XL]]

The 1980 F-Series was redesigned with an all-new chassis and larger body; this was the first ground-up redesign since 1965. The exterior styling of the truck was redone to improve aerodynamics and fuel economy. Medium-duty F-Series (F600-F900) were also redesigned; although they shared the cabin of the smaller pickup trucks, the largest version of F-Series now wore a bonnet with separate front wings (like the [[Ford L-Series Trucks|L-Series]]). Medium duty Ford F-Series would carry the 1980–1986 interior design until 2000 (though pickups were restyled again in 1987 and 1992), with very subtle changes such as window glass and electronics.

In a move towards fuel efficiency, Ford dropped the M-Series engines (the 5.8 Liter ''351M'' and 6.6 Liter 400&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8s) in 1981, replacing them with the 4.2 Liter 255 C.I. and 5.8 Liter 351 C.I. [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor V8]] engines from the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]]. The 255 V8 was simply a 5.0L, 302 V8 with a smaller bore, built specifically for better fuel economy, but was dropped for the 1982 model year due to being underpowered and having limited demand. For 1982 and 1983, the 3.8L, 232 C.I. Essex V6 was the base engine but was quickly dropped for the 1984 model year. In 1983, Ford added Diesel power to the F-Series through a partnership with [[International Harvester]] (later [[Navistar]]). The 6.9L, 420 C.I. IDI V8 produced similar power output as the gasoline 351 Windsor V8, with the fuel economy of the 4.9L, 300 I6. From this point on (1983-present), the heavier duty f-series trucks (F-350 and above) were usually equipped with the Diesel engines as standard horsepower. 1985 was the first year of electronic fuel injection on the 5.0L V8, all other engines following suit in 1988. There was a new "high output" version of the 5.8L Windsor beginning in 1984.

A noticeable change was made to the F-Series in 1982 as the Ford "Blue Oval" was added to the center of the grill, also the Ranger and Custom trims were no longer available. The Ranger name had been shifted onto the all-new compact pickup developed as a replacement for the Courier. The new trim levels were a no-badge base model (essentially the new Custom), XL, a very rare XLS, and XLT Lariat.

1983 marked the final year of the F-100, making the F-150 the lightest pickup available on the market. F-100s and F-150s were virtually identical with the exception of smaller brakes. F-100s over a certain GVWR and/or without power brakes did use the F-150 axles. Also, the 1980–1983 F-100 was never offered with four-wheel-drive.

1986 marked the final year that the F-150 was available with a 3-speed manual gearbox that shifted via a steering column lever (3-on-the-tree). Incidentally, this was the second-last vehicle in the United States that offered this set up. 1986 was also the last year the Explorer package was available.

This is the first generation of trucks to incorporate amenities such as power mirrors, power windows, and power door locks.

== Eighth generation (1987–1991) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (eighth generation)}}
[[File:Ford F-150 -- 09-07-2009.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 (light-duty type)]]

The 1987 F-Series carried over the same body style from the seventh generation, yet sported a new rounded front clip that improved aerodynamics, as well as the softening of body lines around the rear of the bed and fender arches around the wheel wells. The interior was also completely redesigned in 1987. The transmissions available on SuperCab models were a four-speed or five-speed manual; regular cab models were also available with automatic transmission. The Custom trim made a comeback for the eighth generation. In 1988, the 4.9 Liter inline-six, 5.8 Liter V8, and 7.5 Liter V8 engines gained electronic fuel injection. International Navistar also increased the displacement of their 6.9 Liter V8 in the same year, resulting in the new 7.3 Liter unit. This was also the first year of a five-speed manual overdrive transmission, which included the Mazda ''M5OD'' in the F-150s and the heavy-duty ZF5 in the F-250s and F-350s. Four-speed manuals were discontinued as standard equipment after 1987, but were available as a customer-ordered option until 1989. In 1989, the C6 three-speed automatic was replaced as the base automatic transmission with the ''E4OD'', a four-speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive unit, though the C6 was still available as an option, mostly in F-250s and F-350s, until 1997. Heavy-Duty models included F-250s and F-350s (along with F-Super Dutys) that were classified as incomplete vehicles only that were produced with no bed, but appeared as [[tow truck]]s, box trucks (notably [[U-Haul]]), flatbed trucks, [[dump truck]]s and other models. Although the F-250s, F-250 HDs (heavy duty), and F-350s were built as a [[Chassis cab]] models only from 1987 to 1997, owners can convert the models to pickup trucks. However [[General Pacheco, Argentina]] and [[São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil]] assemblies were the only places F-250, F-250 HD, and F-350 were built and sold as pickup trucks models. Despite being produced only in General Pacheco, Argentina and São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil assemblies (located in [[South America]]) F-250s, F-250 HDs, and F-350s were shipped from South America to the United States as imports from 1987 to 1997.

== Ninth generation (1992–1997) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (ninth generation)}}
[[File:1993 F-150 with dual gas tanks.jpg|thumb|1993 Ford F-150, with dual fuel tanks]]

For the 1992 model year, the body-shell of the 1980 F-Series was given another major upgrade. To further improve its aerodynamics, the forward bodywork was given a slightly lower hoodline, rounding the front fenders and grille; in addition, the changes matched the F-Series with the design of the newly introduced Explorer and redesigned E-Series and Ranger. Along with the exterior updates, the interior received a complete redesign.

Dormant since 1987, the FlareSide bed made its return as an option for 1992. To increase its appeal for younger buyers, the bed bodywork was redesigned, borrowing the sides of the F-350 dual-rear wheel bed (fitted to the narrower F-150 single-wheel chassis). To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first Ford factory-produced truck (the 1917 [[Ford Model TT]]), Ford offered a 75th anniversary package on its 1992 F-series, consisting of a stripe package, an argent colored step bumper, and special 75th anniversary logos. In 1993, the 240&amp;nbsp;hp SVT Lightning was introduced as a specially-tuned performance truck; over 11,000 were built from 1993 to 1995.

In a trim shift, the XLT Lariat was dropped and combined with the XLT; the XL took over for the Custom trim after 1993 (marking the last usage of the Custom nameplate by Ford). In 1995, the Eddie Bauer trim made its return.

In 1995, the medium-duty Ford F-Series (F-600 through F-800 and all Ford B-Series) were given their first update since 1980. All versions (except severe-service) received a hood redesign which enlarged the grille and moved the turn signal indicators to the outside of the front headlights.

During the second half of 1997, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350. The body style stayed the same until the end of 1997. The only change of the F-250 HD and F-350 was that they no longer has classic style tailgates, with the stainless steel cap on them which read FORD. Instead the tailgate had the '''F-250 Heavy Duty'''/'''F-350''' nameplate labeled on its left side, while Ford's blue oval was labeled on The right side (similarly styled like the 1997 Ford F-150 around this same time). The F-250 HD also had some minor changes in trim location, and options available. The 1997 F-250 HD with the 7.3 Powerstroke Diesel is also the rarest and most desirable of ninth generation Fords.

Following the introduction of the tenth-generation F-150, the F-250 and F-350 continued into production into the 1998 model year, becoming part of the [[Ford Super Duty|Ford F-Series Super Duty]] line as they were replaced in 1999.

== Tenth generation (1997–2004) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (tenth generation)}}
[[File:'97-'98 Ford F-250 XL Regular Cab.JPG|thumb|1999-2000 F-250 XL]]

For 1997, Ford Motor Company made a major change to its F-Series family of trucks as the F-Series pickup line was essentially split in two. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, buyers of pickup trucks had increasingly purchased the vehicles for the purposes of personal use over work use. To further increase its growing market share, Ford sought to develop vehicles for both types of buyers. In its ultimate decision, the company decided to make the F-150 as a contemporary vehicle for personal use, while the F-250 and F-350 would be designed more conservatively for work-based customers.

Introduced in early 1996 as a 1997 model, the F-150 was a completely new vehicle in comparison from its predecessor. Similar to the original Ford Taurus of 1986, the 1997 F-150 was developed with a radically streamlined body. Dispensing with the traditional Twin I-Beam for a fully independent front suspension, the all-new chassis only shared the transmissions with the previous generation. In a major change, the long-running 4.9L inline-6 was replaced by a 4.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#4.2|Essex]] V6 engine as standard. The 4.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#4.6|Modular]] V8 shared with the Panther Car was optional (with a bigger 5.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4|Triton]] V8 version added in mid-1997). Originally developed for use in the F-Series, the Modular/Triton V8 was the first overhead-camshaft engine ever to be installed in a full-size pickup truck.

To improve rear-seat access for SuperCab models, a rear-hinged (curb-side) door was added to all versions. Following its popularity, the SuperCab gained a fourth door for 1999. In 2001, the F-150 became the first pickup truck in its size segment to become available with four full-size doors. Sharing the length of a standard-bed SuperCab, the F-150 SuperCrew was produced with a slightly shortened bed.

During the second half of the 1997 model year, Ford introduced a heavier GVWR version (8800 GVW), bearing the F-250 name. It was distinguished by an uncommon and unique seven-lug bolt pattern for the wheels. At the same time, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350 (same square body style as the last generation F-150; it was still built in [[South America]] only). Due the Super Duty trucks never reaching Ford dealerships as for sale until the beginning of 1999, Ford produced a lighter duty F-250, using the same body the F-150 had at the time as a temporarily model (1997 to 1999). By February 1999, the f-150-based F-250 was discontinued and the Super Duty trucks finally marketed for sale.

In 1999, the SVT Lightning made its return, with output expanded to 360&amp;nbsp;hp; over 28,000 were produced from 1999 to 2003. For 2002, Lincoln-Mercury gained its first full-size pickup truck since 1968 with the introduction of the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first Lincoln pickup. Sharing the front bodywork of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV and the same cab body work as the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150]], the Blackwood was designed with a model-exclusive bed and was sold only in black. Due to very poor sales, the Blackwood was discontinued after 2002.

In 1999, the F-250 and F-350 pickups were introduced as the 1999 [[Ford Super Duty|Ford F-Series Super Duty]] model line. While remaining part of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks use a different platform architecture, powertrain, and design language, primarily as they are intended for heavy-duty work use. Designed in a joint venture with [[Navistar International]], the medium-duty [[Ford F-650|F-650/F-750 Super Duty]] were introduced in 2000.

== Eleventh generation (2004–2008) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)}}
[[File:Ford F150 FX4 2004.jpg|thumb|2004 F-150 FX4]]

For the 2004 model year, the F-150 was redesigned on [[Ford P platform#P2|an all-new platform]]. Externally, the eleventh-generation model was different from its predecessor, with sharper-edged styling; a major change was the adoption of the stepped driver's window from the Super Duty trucks. Regardless of cab type, all F-150s were given four doors, with the rear doors on the regular cab providing access to behind-the-seat storage. Ford also introduced the Triton engines in the variants of the F-150. Due to declining sales, the Flareside beds were dropped; this marked the first time in 56 years of F-Series production that Flareside beds were not available.

From 2005 to 2008, Lincoln-Mercury dealers sold this version of the F-150 as the [[Lincoln Mark LT]], replacing the Blackwood.

In late 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Super Duty trucks were given an [[Ford P platform#P3|all-new platform]]. While using the same bed and cabin as before, these are distinguished from their predecessors by an all-new interior and a much larger grille and [[head lamp]]s. Previously available only as a chassis-cab model, the F-450 now was available as a pickup directly from Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ford F-150 – Boosting The EcoBoost |work=Truckin Magazine |first=Barry |last=Cluczyk |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}
From 2004 to 2006 offered a different bed style as well.

== Twelfth generation (2009–2014) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (twelfth generation)}}
[[File:2009 Ford F-150 XLT SuperCrew.jpg|thumb|2009 F-150 XLT SuperCrew]]

The twelfth generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year as an update of the [[Ford P platform#P415|Ford full-size truck platform]]. Similar to its predecessor, these trucks are distinguished by their Super Duty-style grilles and head lamps; standard cab models again have two-doors instead of four. The FlareSide bed was continued until 2010, dropped along with the manual gearbox; outside of Mexico, the Lincoln Mark LT was replaced by the F-150 Platinum. A new model for 2010 included the SVT Raptor, a dedicated off-road pickup.

As part of a major focus on fuel economy, the entire engine lineup for the F-150 was updated for the 2011 model year. Along with two new V8 engines, the F-150 gained a new 3.7 Liter base V6 engine, and a powerful twin-turbocharged 3.5 Liter V6, dubbed [[Ford EcoBoost engine#EcoBoost V6|EcoBoost]] by Ford. An automatic transmission is the only option. Other modifications include the addition of a [[Nexteer Automotive]] [[Power steering|Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system on most models.

A recent study conducted by [[iSeeCars.com]] and published on the Ford Motor Company website listed Ford F-250 Super Duty as the top longest-lasting vehicle and Expedition, Explorer and F-150 in the top 20 longest-lasting vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://social.ford.com/our-articles/suvs/expedition/five-ford-vehicles-made-the-200000-mile-list/ |title=Five Ford Vehicles Made the 200,000-Mile List |publisher=Ford.com |access-date=May 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530023147/http://social.ford.com/our-articles/suvs/expedition/five-ford-vehicles-made-the-200000-mile-list/ |archivedate=May 30, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thirteenth generation (2015–present) ==
{{Main|Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)}}
[[File:2018 Ford F-150 XLT front (2) 5.19.18.jpg|thumb|2018 F-150 XLT SuperCab]]

The thirteenth-generation Ford F-Series was introduced for the 2015 model year.  Largely previewed by the [[Ford Atlas]] concept vehicle at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the new design marked several extensive changes to the F-Series design.  In the interest of fuel economy, Ford designers reduced curb weight of the F-150 by nearly 750 pounds, without physically altering its exterior footprint.  To allow for such a massive weight reduction, nearly every body panel was switched from steel to aluminum (with the exception of the firewall); the frame itself remains high-strength steel.&lt;ref name="2015 F150 Autoblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/13/2015-ford-f-150-detroit-2014/|title=2015 Ford F-150 brings big aluminum to the Rust Belt [w/video]|author=Korzeniewski, Jeremy|date=January 13, 2014|access-date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="motortrend.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1401_2015_ford_f_150_first_look/|title=2015 Ford F-150 First Look - Motor Trend|date=January 12, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To prove the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, during the development of the thirteenth-generation F-Series, Ford entered camouflaged prototypes into the Baja 1000 endurance race (where the vehicles finished).  The 2015 F-150 was the first pickup truck with [[Autonomous cruise control system#Vehicles models supporting adaptive cruise control|adaptive cruise control]], which uses radar sensors on the front of the vehicle to maintain a set following distance between it and the vehicle ahead of it, decreasing speed if necessary.

The 3.7L V6 was dropped, replaced by a 3.5L V6 as the standard engine, with a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 added alongside the 3.5L EcoBoost V6.  While the 6.2L V8 was withdrawn, the 5.0L V8 continued as an option, with a 6-speed automatic as the sole transmission. 

For the 2018 model year, the Ford F-150 underwent a mid-cycle redesign, being revealed at the 2017 [[New York International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betweentheaxles.net/galleries/2017/ford-f-150-2018-facelift-13th-generation-photos-13567?gid=2117&amp;pid=50932|title=Ford F-150 (2018 facelift, 13th generation) photos|last=Thompson|first=Joshua|date=January 10, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoworldnews.com/articles/26127/20170110/big-ones-in-detroit-ford-f-150-gmc-terrain-volkswagen-atlas-and-chevrolet-traverse-to-be-presented.htm|title=Big Ones In Detroit: Ford F-150, GMC Terrain, Volkswagen Atlas And Chevrolet Traverse To Be Presented|last=News|first=Auto World|date=January 10, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pickuptrucks2017.com/2018-ford-f-150/|title=2018 Ford F-150 Specs, Engine - 2017 / 2018 Pickup Trucks|date=April 1, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the introduction of the 2017 Super Duty model line, the F-Series (F-150 through F-550 and Ford Raptor) are again manufactured using a common cab (for the first time since 1996).  For 2018, the F-150 shifted from the long-running 3-bar design used on Ford trucks to the "center bar" designs that debuted on the 2017 Super Duty model line.  The powertrain underwent several revisions, as the 3.5L V6 was replaced by a 3.3L V6 mated to a 6 speed transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/2018-ford-f-150-debuts-new-engines-30l-power-stroke-v6-diesel-33l-ti-vct-v6-114420.html|title=2018 Ford F-150 Debuts New Engines: 3.0L Power Stroke V6 Diesel, 3.3L Ti-VCT V6|last=Panait|first=Mircea|date=2017-01-08|newspaper=autoevolution|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EcoBoost V6 engines and 5.0L V8 engines were fitted with a 10-speed automatic (from the Raptor) and stop-start capability (previously only from the 2.7L EcoBoost).&lt;ref name="f2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.ca/trucks/f150/2018/?searchid=71700000018508789&amp;gclid=CM-ZwLSMuNECFQ61wAodYSACow|title=2018 Ford F-150 Pickup {{!}} Tougher, Smarter, More Capable Than Ever {{!}} Ford.ca|website=www.ford.ca|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, a PowerStroke diesel engine was fitted to the F-150 for the first time, as Ford introduced a 250 hp 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6 (from the "Lion" lineup of engines shared by PSA Peugeot Citroën and Jaguar Land Rover).&lt;ref name="f2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/2017/01/2018-ford-f-150-revealed-bears-new-looks-diesel-engine/|title=2018 Ford F-150 Photos, Diesel Engine, Specs, Revealed|date=2017-01-08|website=Ford Authority|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fordauthority.com/2016/12/we-wonder-will-the-ford-f-150-diesel-adopt-the-power-stroke-moniker/|title=Will The F-150 Diesel Be Named 'Power Stroke'?{{!}}Ford Authority|date=2016-12-22|newspaper=Ford Authority|access-date=2017-01-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special models ==
Throughout its production, variants of the Ford F-Series has been produced to attract buyers. While these variants primarily consist of trim packages, others are high-performance versions while other variants were designed with various means of improving functionality.

=== Unibody F-Series (1961-1963) ===
For 1961 into part of the 1963 model year, the Ford F-Series was offered with a third body configuration, integrating the Styleside bed with the cab.  With the pickup bed stampings welded directly to the cab before both assemblies were mounted to the frame, the design simplified the assembly and paint process (the configuration was similar to that of the [[Ford Ranchero]]).  Following a poor market reception, the unibody pickup bed design was withdrawn during the 1963 model year.

=== Specials (1961-1979) ===
From 1961 to 1979, Ford offered several ''Special'' option packages for the F-Series, typically designed for owners with specific uses for their vehicles.  For 1961, the ''Camper Special'' option package was introduced; designed for owners of [[Truck camper|slide-in truck campers]], the option package featured pre-wiring for the camper, heavy-duty transmission and engine cooling, and a larger alternator.  For 1968, Ford introduced the ''Contractor's Special'', and ''Farm and Ranch Special'', which featured toolboxes and heavier-duty suspension.  The ''Explorer Special'' was introduced as a lower-priced variant of the Ranger trim. The "Trailer Special" was offered as well with trailer brake, heavy-duty radiator, transmission cooler, and tow hitch.

In 1980, the Special option packages were withdrawn as part of the F-Series redesign, while a number of features continued as stand-alone options; the Explorer continued as a variant of the Ranger trim through the 1986 model year.

=== F-150 Nite (1991-1992) ===
Sold from 1991 to 1992 on the Ford F-150 XLT Lariat, the Nite special edition was an monochromatic option package, featuring black paint and trim with a multicolor accent stripe. For 1991, it was exclusive to the regular-cab F-150; for 1992, it was available on all bodystyles of the F-150 and introduced on the Ford Bronco.

The Nite edition was available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive with either the 5.0L or 5.8L V8; it also included a sport suspension and alloy wheels on 235/75R15 white-letter tires.

=== Eddie Bauer (1994-1996) ===
For 1994, Ford introduced the Eddie Bauer trim level for the F-150. In a fashion similar to the same trim packages on the Aerostar, Bronco, and Explorer/Bronco II, it consisted of outdoors-themed interior trim with two-tone exterior paint.

=== SVT Lightning (1993-1995; 1999-2004) ===
{{Main|Ford_F-Series_tenth_generation#SVT_Lightning|l1=Ford SVT Lightning}}
[[File:1993FordLightning.jpg|thumb|1993 Ford SVT Lightning]]
[[File:Ford-F150-Lightning.jpg|thumb|Second-generation Ford SVT Lightning]]

Introduced as a 1993 model, the [[Ford SVT Lightning]] is a [[Performance car|high-performance version]] of the F-150 that was produced by the Ford Special Vehicle Team ([[Ford SVT|SVT]]).  Intended as a competitor for the [[Chevrolet 454 SS|Chevrolet 454SS]], the SVT Lightning was derived from the F-150; to improve its handling, extensive modifications were made to the front and rear suspension and frame.  Powered by a 240&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 5.8L V8, the Lightning used a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic transmission from the F-350 (normally paired with the 7.5L V8 or 7.3L diesel V8).  While slower in acceleration than the [[GMC Syclone]], the Lightning retained nearly all of the towing and payload capacity of a standard Ford F-150.  Produced from 1993 to 1995, the first-generation SVT Lightning was withdrawn as Ford readied the 1997 Ford F-150 for sale.  

After a three-year hiatus, Ford released a second generation of the SVT Lightning for the 1999 model year.  In line with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the second-generation Lightning was based on the F-150 with a number of suspension modifications; in a design change, all examples were produced with a FlareSide bed.  In place of a model-specific engine, the second-generation was powered by a supercharged version of the 5.4L V8 from the F-150, producing 360 hp (increased to 380 hp in 2001).  As before, the higher-output engine was paired with a heavier-duty transmission from the F-350 pickup.  

For the 2004 redesign of the Ford F-150, the SVT Lightning was not included, leaving 2004 as the final year for the model line.  While of an entirely different design focus from the SVT Lightning, the SVT/Ford Raptor is the succeeding generation of high-performance Ford F-Series pickup trucks.

=== Harley-Davidson Edition (2000-2011) ===
From 2000 to 2011, the [[Harley-Davidson]] Edition was an option package available on the F-150.  Primarily an appearance package featuring monochromatic black trim, from 2002 to 2003, the edition included a slightly detuned version of the supercharged 5.4L V8 engine from the SVT Lightning. In 2003, a 100th Anniversary Edition was produced for F-150 SuperCrew trucks.  For 2004, the Harley-Davidson option package became available for F-250/F-350 Super Duty trucks.  After 2008, the option package adopted many of the options featured from the Platinum trim level, featuring leather seating produced from materials reserved for Harley-Davidson biker jackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29845 |title=New 2010 Ford Harley-Davidson F-150: tough truck with cool attitude; new details, inside and out |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=February 10, 2009 |access-date=April 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416055311/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29845 |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For 2012, the Harley-Davidson Edition was replaced by the Limited trim level, retaining a monochromatic exterior appearance (shifting past motorcycle-themed trim).  

=== SVT/Ford Raptor (2010-2014; 2017-present) ===
[[File:Ford F-150 Raptor SVT - blue front.jpg|thumb|F-150 SVT Raptor]]For 2010, Ford introduced its second high-performance truck, the [[Ford F-Series twelfth generation#Ford SVT Raptor|SVT Raptor]]. In contrast to the enhanced on-road performance of the SVT Lightning, the SVT Raptor is a focused towards off-road use, in line with that of a [[Baja 1000]] racing truck. While a road-legal vehicle, many design modifications of the Raptor were made to improve its off-road capability, with the vehicle featuring a model-exclusive suspension with long-travel springs and shocks. The Raptor shares only its cab with a standard F-150; to accommodate its larger tires, the Raptor is fitted with wider front fenders, hood, and pickup bed. Initially produced as a SuperCab, a Raptor SuperCrew was introduced late in the 2010 model year. For the first time on a Ford vehicle in North America since 1983, the word "Ford" was spelled across the grille of the SVT Raptor in place of the Ford Blue Oval badge.

For 2010, the SVT Raptor was powered by a 310 hp 5.4L V8; a 411 hp 6.2L V8 (from the F-150 Platinum and Super Duty trucks) became optional, replacing the 5.4L V8 for 2011. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission paired with both engines.  

After a two-year hiatus, the second-generation Ford Raptor (the SVT prefix was removed) was introduced for the 2017 model year. Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|thirteenth-generation F-Series]], the Ford Raptor shifted to an aluminum body. Again produced as a high-performance off-road vehicle, the Raptor is produced in SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations, with long-travel suspension specific to the vehicle. As a design theme, the second-generation Raptor does not carry a Ford Blue Oval grille badge, instead spelling out "Ford" across the grille.  

To improve fuel economy and reduce weight, the 6.2L V8 was replaced by a 450 hp 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lingeman|first1=Jake|date=February 6, 2017|title=Molehills out of Mountains|journal=[[Autoweek]]|pages=20-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== F-150 Platinum (2009-present) ===
[[File:Platinum 2009.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 Platinum]]

Introduced for 2009, Platinum is a luxury-oriented trim of the Ford F-150. Effectively replacing the [[Lincoln Mark LT]] in the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122468|title=RIP: Lincoln Mark LT|authorlink=Inside Line|date=September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033620/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D122468|archivedate=September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes|access-date=September 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though its production continued through 2014 in Mexico), the Platinum adopted many of the luxury features and content from the Mark LT with more subdued exterior styling (the Platinum was fitted with an eggcrate grille similar to early models of the Ford Expedition).  

In 2013, Ford began use of the Platinum trim  for Super Duty trucks, from the F-250 to the F-450 pickup trucks. Until 2016, the Platinum trim was an add-on package to a Super Duty that was ordered as a Lariat. 2017 saw the Platinum become a separate trim level.   

=== F-150 Tremor (2014) ===
For the 2014 model year, Ford introduced the Tremor model of the F-150. The Tremor was released as a high-performance sport truck for street truck enthusiasts. The regular-cab Tremor is based on the style of the FX Appearance Package with the 3.5 Liter EcoBoost engine and a 4.10 rear axle. The interior uses a console-mounted shifter, custom bucket seats and a flow-through center console not found in any other F-150. The Tremor is available in both 4x2 and 4x4. Both options feature an electronic locking rear differential and customized suspension. There were 2,230 Tremors built.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The truck won the [[San Felipe 250]] eight times between 1999 and 2007.

[[Greg Biffle]] won the [[2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]].

Drivers such as [[Roger Norman (racing driver)|Roger Norman]] and [[Larry Roeseler]] won the [[Primm 300]] in 2003, 2007 and 2008.

In 2008, Ford announced its entrance into the [[Baja 1000]] class-eight race for moderately modified, full-size pickups. The driver of record was Steve Oligos, supported by co-drivers Randy Merritt, Greg Foutz, and Bud Brutsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fordnewsblog.wordpress.com/2008/11/06/ford-svt-f-150-raptor-r-to-enter-baja-1000/ |title=Ford SVT F-150 Raptor R to enter Baja 1000 |publisher=Fordnewsblog.wordpress.com |date=November 26, 2008 |access-date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was built with collaboration between the Ford Special Vehicle Team (SVT), Ford Racing, and Foutz Motorsports, Inc.

In the Best in the Desert race series, an F-150 SVT Raptor R completed the "Terrible's 250" race, placing second overall in the class 8000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/news/idx/0/417/article/2010_FORD_F150_SVT_RAPTOR_R_CAPTURES_PODIUM_FINISH%3B_PRICING_ANNOUNCED.html |title=2010 Ford F150 SVT Raptor R Captures Podium Finish; Pricing Announced |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |access-date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, a single Raptor SVT (No. 439), driven by Chilean driver Javier Campillay, competed in the Argentina-Chile Dakar Rally. However, the pickup was unable to finish due to a catch-up crash with another car in the middle of the road during stage seven. In January 2011, two Raptors started in the Argentina-Chile Dakar Rally in [[Buenos Aires]], with Campillay driving the more reliable Raptor (No. 375), and American female driver Sue Mead driving a T2 Raptor (No. 374). Mead crossed the finish line in Buenos Aires and won the "super production" class, the first North American class win in Dakar history. Campillay was unable to finish the 12th stage after losing time due to mechanical failure during the 11th stage, which led to his disqualification for failing to reach the race camp by the designated deadline.

== Variants ==
=== Medium-duty trucks ===
[[File:Ford F-Series truck (5043837888).jpg|thumb|Early 1970s Ford F600/F700]]
For most of its production, the F-Series was sold in a medium-duty conventional truck configuration alongside the traditional pickup trucks.  Beginning in 1948 with the 1½ ton F-5 (later F-500), the medium-duty trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800).  Prior to the 1957 introduction of the [[Ford C-Series]] tilt-cab, the medium-duty range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.

Following the introduction of the fifth-generation F-Series in 1967, the medium-duty trucks were designed separately from the pickup truck range.  Although remaining part of the F-Series range, the medium-duty trucks shared only the cab and interior with the F-Series pickup trucks.  Since 1967, the cab design has changed only in 1980 and in 2000.  Redesigned on an all-new chassis, the 2017 F-Series medium-duty trucks retain an updated version of the 2000-2016 F-650/F750 cab.

The medium-duty F-Series served as the donor platform for the [[Ford B-Series|B-Series]] cowled bus chassis produced from 1948 to 1998. Produced primarily for school bus bodies, the B-Series was discontinued as part of the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner in 1996.

=== Heavy-duty trucks ===
Above its medium-duty truck ranges, the Ford F-Series was used as a heavy-truck chassis during its early production.  In 1951, Ford debuted its "Big Job" line, denoting the F-8 conventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-trucks2.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Trucks|date=2007-06-20|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, the "Super Duty" and "Extra Heavy Duty" replaced the Big Job trucks, marking the debut of the [[Ford Super Duty engine|Super Duty V8]] engine line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-trucks9.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Trucks|date=2007-06-20|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, the N-Series became the first short-hood conventional built by Ford, replacing the F-900 Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty.   Although based on an all-new chassis and separate bodywork, the cab was sourced from the F-Series.

In 1970, Ford introduced the [[Ford L-Series|L-Series "Louisville"]] line of conventional trucks, moving all heavy truck development away from the F-Series.  The L-Series/Aeromax would remain in production through 1998, as Ford exited the heavy-truck segment.

=== Vans ===
From 1948 until 1960, Ford manufactured the F-Series in a panel van configuration, largely replacing it with the Econoline in 1961. In contrast to General Motors, the panel van was never produced in a passenger "carryall" variant, such as the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban.

For much of its production life, the [[Ford E-Series]] vans shared a high degree of mechanical commonality with the F-Series; in the late 1970s, some body components were shared. Since the 1990s, this changed somewhat, as Ford updated the F-Series several times since 1992 while the E-Series continued on with very few changes; no powertrains were shared as of 2016.

=== Export ===
[[File:Ford V8 Freighter F-100.jpg|thumb|This 1955 Australian F-100 Freighter had special high side panels, perhaps unique to Australia; note the right-hand drive.]]

As of 2018, outside of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the Ford F-150 is officially sold in most [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Caribbean|Caribbean countries]] (except Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Cuba), Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), Iceland, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, the Dutch territories of Aruba, Curaçao, Saint Maarten and the [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] of the Cayman Islands. The [[Special Vehicle Team|SVT]] Raptor is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), China, Ecuador, Chile and Peru. Both are available in LHD only.

In Mexico, the F-150 (XLT and higher trim levels) is called the "Ford Lobo" while the F-150 SVT Raptor is called the "Ford Lobo Raptor". The F-150 XL is called F-150 XL.

There is a strong [[Parallel import|grey market]] presence of Ford F-Series trucks around the world, most notably in Europe, China, and Australia, and usually driven by wealthy car enthusiasts, as the higher end trim models are the most sought-after versions.

In Bolivia, Ford F-series truck are imported from the United States. F-150 single, super cab and crew cab are available with short and long bed. F-series Heavy Duty like F-250, F-350 are available in Super Cab and Crew cab with long bed, but the F-450 is available only in a chassis version. The F-150 Raptor is available, too.

In Australia, Ford F-series trucks are imported and converted to right-hand drive by several Australian importers, mostly by the Harrison Motoring Group, which as become the largest importer of F-Series vehicles in the Southern Hemisphere. Harrison F-Trucks have become Australia's number one converter and supplier of the famous Ford F-Series badges. 

In the United Kingdom, most imported Ford F-Series trucks are the F-150 model, and usually the higher-end four door versions.

Right-hand drive versions of the F-Series for the United Kingdom and Australia were manufactured in Brazil.

In Argentina and Brazil, the [[Gasoline|petrol]] engines are often converted to also run with alternative fuels, E-96h (Brazilian-spec ethanol) and compressed natural gas (CNG). Biodiesel also is used in Diesel engines.{{Citation needed|reason=As of the 2010s, so-called "FlexFuel" vehicles are commonly sold in the United States that can run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol, making them suitable for markets like Brazil.  This is no longer a distinguishing special feature, but standard with electronic fuel injection systems.|date=July 2017}}

The addition of the 3.0l V6 turbo diesel engine could potentially make the Ford F-150 go global and in both LHD and RHD from the factory.

[[File:LightningVolt Deep Blue Sea.jpg|thumb|right|Free surface of the sea, viewed from below]]

In [[physics]], a '''free surface''' is the surface of a fluid that is subject to zero parallel [[shear stress]],&lt;ref name="titleGlossary: Free Surface"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vishay.com/company/brands/measurements-group/guide/glossary/freesurf.htm |title=Glossary: Free Surface |accessdate=2007-12-02 | publisher = Vishay Measurements Group |work= Interactive Guide | quote = Surface of a body with no normal stress  perpendicular or shear stresses parallel to it…}}&lt;/ref&gt;
such as the boundary between two homogeneous [[fluid]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/free-surface  Free surface]. ''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms''. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 2003. [[Answers.com]]. Retrieved on 2007-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
for example liquid water and the air in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Unlike [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es cannot form a free surface on their own.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;
[[Fluidization|Fluidized]]/[[Liquefaction|liquified]] solids, including [[slurry|slurries]], [[granular]] materials, and [[wikt:powders|powders]] may form a free surface.

A liquid in a [[gravitational field]] will form a free surface if unconfined from above.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book |author=White, Frank |title=Fluid mechanics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |page= 4 |isbn=0-07-240217-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under [[mechanical equilibrium]] this free surface must be perpendicular to the forces acting on the liquid; if not there would be a force along the surface, and the liquid would flow in that direction.&lt;ref name = Rowland/&gt; Thus, on the surface of the Earth, all free surfaces of liquids are [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] unless disturbed (except near solids dipping into them, where [[surface tension]] distorts the surface in a region called the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]]).&lt;ref name = Rowland/&gt;

In a free liquid that is not affected by outside forces such as a gravitational field, internal attractive forces only play a role (e.g. [[Van der Waals forces]], [[hydrogen bonds]]). Its free surface will assume the shape with the least surface area for its volume: a perfect [[sphere]]. Such behaviour can be expressed in terms of [[surface tension]]. It can be demonstrated experimentally by observing a large globule of oil placed below the surface of a mixture of water and alcohol having the same [[density]] so the oil has neutral [[buoyancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22free+surface%22+liquid&amp;as_brr=1&amp;vq=free%20surface&amp;pg=PA114&amp;ci=56,675,889,771&amp;source=bookclip|title = A First Course in Physics| chapter = 161.

==Waves==
{{Further|Ocean surface wave|Airy wave theory}}
If the free surface of a liquid is disturbed, [[wave]]s are produced on the surface. These waves are not [[elastic waves]] due to any [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic force]]; they are [[gravity wave]]s caused by the force of gravity tending to bring the surface of the disturbed liquid back to its horizontal level. [[Momentum]] causes the wave to [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]], thus oscillating and spreading the disturbance to the neighboring portions of the surface.&lt;ref name = Rowland/&gt; The velocity of the surface waves varies as the square root of the [[wavelength]] if the liquid is deep; therefore [[swell (ocean)|long waves]] on the sea go faster than short ones.&lt;ref name = Rowland/&gt; Very minute waves or ripples are not due to gravity but to [[capillary action]], and have properties different from those of the longer [[ocean surface waves]],&lt;ref name = Rowland/&gt;
because the surface is increased in area by the ripples and the capillary forces are in this case large compared with the gravitational forces.&lt;ref name = International&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImlMAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22free+surface%22+liquid&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA731&amp;ci=499,532,396,57&amp;source=bookclip | title = The New International Encyclopædia |editor1=Gilman, Daniel Coit |editor2=Peck, Harry Thurston |editor3=Colby, Frank Moore |page = 739|chapter = Hydrostatics|year = 1903| publisher =

Capillary ripples are damped both by sub-surface [[viscosity]] and by [[surface rheology]].

== Rotation ==
[[Image:Rotating Vessel.png|thumb|right|Free surface of a liquid in a rotating vessel is a [[paraboloid]]]]
If a liquid is contained in a cylindrical vessel and is rotating around a vertical axis coinciding with the axis of the cylinder, the free surface will assume a parabolic [[surface of revolution]] known as a [[paraboloid]]. The free surface at each point is at a right angle to the force acting at it, which is the resultant of the force of gravity and the centrifugal force from the motion of each point in a circle.&lt;ref name = Rowland&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=m9oXAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22free+surface%22&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA70&amp;ci=101,317,865,1066&amp;source=bookclip | title = Elements of Physics| chapter = Free Surface of Liquids | first = Henry Augustus | last = Rowland | authorlink = Henry Augustus Rowland |author2=[[Joseph Sweetman Ames]] | pages = 70–71| year = 1900 | publisher = American Book Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the main mirror in a telescope must be parabolic, this principle is used to create [[liquid mirror telescopes]].

Consider a cylindrical container filled with liquid rotating in the z direction in cylindrical coordinates, the equations of motion are:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial P}{\partial r} = \rho r \omega^2, \; \; \; \frac{\partial P}{\partial \theta} = 0, \; \; \;  \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} = -\rho g &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid, &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the cylinder, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. Taking a surface of constant pressure &lt;math&gt; (dP = 0 ) &lt;/math&gt; the total differential becomes:

&lt;math&gt; dP = \rho r \omega^2 dr - \rho g dz \rightarrow \frac{ dz_{isobar}} {dr} = \frac{ r \omega^2}{g}  &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating, the equation for the free surface becomes:

&lt;math&gt; z_s = \frac{\omega^2}{2g} r^2 + h_c &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; h_c &lt;/math&gt; is the distance of the free surface from the bottom of the container along the axis of rotation. If one integrates the volume of the paraboloid formed by the free surface and then solves for the original height, one can find the height of the fluid along the centerline of the cylindrical container:

&lt;math&gt; h_c = h_0 - \frac{\omega^2 R^2}{4g} &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of the free surface at any distance &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; from the center becomes:

&lt;math&gt; z_s = h_0 - \frac{\omega^2}{4g} ( R^2 - 2 r^2) &lt;/math&gt;

If a free liquid is rotating about an axis, the free surface will take the shape of an [[oblate spheroid]]: the approximate shape of the Earth due to its [[equatorial bulge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkkOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22free+surface%22+liquid&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA123&amp;ci=64,1063,791,78&amp;source=bookclip|title = Appletons' Cyclopædia of Applied Mechanics| chapter = Hydrostatics| page = 123 | publisher = D. Appleton and company | year = 1880 | location = New York|quote=If a perfectly homogeneous mass of liquid be acted upon by a force which varies directly as the distance from the centre of the mass, the free surface will be of spherical form; if the mass rotates about an axis, the form assumed will be that of an oblate spheroid, which is the shape of the earth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gridded ion thruster''' is a common design for [[ion thruster]]s, a highly efficient low-thrust [[spacecraft propulsion]] running on electrical power. These designs use high-voltage grid [[electrode]]s to accelerate [[ion]]s with [[electrostatic]] forces.

==History==
The ion engine was first demonstrated by German-born [[NASA]]  scientist [[Ernst Stuhlinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Stuhlinger, ''Ion Propulsion for Space Flight'' (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; and developed in practical form by [[Harold R. Kaufman]] at [[NASA Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis]] (now Glenn) Research Center  from 1957 to the early 1960s. 

The use of ion propulsion systems were first demonstrated in space by the NASA Lewis "[[SERT-1|Space Electric Rocket Test" (SERT)]] I and II.&lt;ref name="Sovey"&gt;J. S. Sovey,  V. K. Rawlin, and M. J. Patterson, "Ion Propulsion Development Projects in U. S.: Space Electric Rocket Test 1 to Deep Space 1", ''Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 17'', No. 3, May–June 2001, pp. 517-526.&lt;/ref&gt;  These thrusters used mercury as the reaction mass.  The first was [[SERT-1]], launched July 20, 1964, which successfully proved that the technology operated as predicted in space.  The second test, SERT-II, launched on February 3, 1970,&lt;ref&gt;NASA Glenn, "[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ion/past/70s/sert2.htm SPACE ELECTRIC ROCKET TEST II (SERT II)] (Accessed July 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/sert.htm SERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025005136/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/sert.htm |date=2010-10-25 }} page at Astronautix (Accessed July 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; verified the operation of two mercury ion engines for thousands of running hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ion/past/70s/sert2.htm Space Electric Rocket Test]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the demonstration in the 1960s and 70s, though, they were rarely used before the late 1990s.

NASA Glenn continued to develop electrostatic gridded ion thrusters through the 1980s, developing the [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness]] (NSTAR) engine, that was used successfully on the [[Deep Space 1]] probe, the first mission to fly an interplanetary trajectory using electric propulsion as the primary propulsion.  It is currently flying the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]] asteroid mission. [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes Aircraft Company]] (now L-3 ETI) has developed the XIPS (Xenon Ion Propulsion System) for performing station keeping on its geosynchronous satellites (more than 100 engines flying). NASA is currently working on a 20-50 [[Kilowatt|kW]] electrostatic ion thruster called [[HiPEP]] which will have higher efficiency, [[specific impulse]], and a longer lifetime than NSTAR.  [[Aerojet]] has recently completed testing of a prototype [[NEXT (ion thruster)|NEXT]] ion thruster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerojet.com/program/news/nr_090903_aerojet_successfully_completes_next_milestones.htm?program_ID=45 Aerojet Successfully Completes Manufacturing and System Integration Milestones for NASA's NEXT Ion Engine Development Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530182031/http://www.aerojet.com/program/news/nr_090903_aerojet_successfully_completes_next_milestones.htm?program_ID=45 |date=May 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, radio-frequency ion thrusters were developed at Giessen University and [[ArianeGroup]]. RIT-10 engines are flying on the [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] and [[ARTEMIS]]. Qinetiq (UK) has developed the T5 and T6 engines (Kaufman type), used on the [[GOCE]] mission (T5) and possibly the [[BepiColombo]] mission (T6). From Japan, the µ10, using microwaves, flew on the [[Hayabusa]] mission.

== Method of operation ==
Propellant atoms are injected into the discharge chamber and are ionized by electron bombardment, forming a plasma. There are several ways of producing the energetic electrons for the discharge: electrons can be emitted from a [[Electron gun|hollow cathode]] and accelerated by potential difference with the anode; the electrons can be accelerated by an oscillating electric field induced by an alternating electromagnet, which results in a self-sustaining discharge and omits any cathode (radio frequency ion thruster); and microwave heating. The positively charged ions diffuse towards the chamber's extraction system (2 or 3 multi-aperture grids). After ions enter the plasma sheath at a grid hole, they are accelerated by the potential difference between the first and second grids (called the screen and accelerator grids, respectively). The ions are guided through the extraction holes by the powerful electric field. The final ion energy is determined by the potential of the plasma, which generally is slightly greater than the screen grids' voltage.

The negative voltage of the accelerator grid prevents electrons of the beam plasma outside the thruster from streaming back to the discharge plasma. This can fail due to insufficient negative potential in the grid, which is a common ending for ion thrusters' operational life. The expelled ions propel the spacecraft in the opposite direction, according to [[Newton's third law|Newton's 3rd law]].
Lower-energy electrons are emitted from a separate cathode, called the neutralizer, into the ion beam to ensure that equal amounts of positive and negative charge are ejected. Neutralizing is needed to prevent the spacecraft from gaining a net negative charge, which would attract ions back toward the spacecraft and cancel the thrust.

== Performance ==
The ion optics are constantly bombarded by a small amount of secondary ions and erode or wear away, thus reducing engine efficiency and life. Ion engines need to be able to run efficiently and continuously for years. Several techniques were used to reduce erosion; most notable was switching to a different propellant. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] or [[caesium]] atoms were used as propellants during tests in the 1960s and 1970s, but these propellants adhered to, and eroded the grids.  [[Xenon]] atoms, on the other hand, are far less corrosive, and became the propellant of choice for virtually all ion thruster types. NASA has demonstrated continuous operation of [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness|NSTAR]] engines for over 16,000 hours (1.8 years), and tests are still ongoing for double this lifetime. Electrostatic ion thrusters have also achieved a [[specific impulse]] of 30–100&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg, better than most other ion thruster types. Electrostatic ion thrusters have accelerated ions to speeds reaching 100 [[Kilometre per second|km/s]].

In January 2006, the [[European Space Agency]], together with the [[Australian National University]], announced successful testing of an improved electrostatic ion engine, the [[Dual-Stage 4-Grid]] (DS4G), that showed exhaust speeds of 210 [[Kilometre per second|km/s]], reportedly four times higher than previously achieved, allowing for a specific impulse which is four times higher. Conventional electrostatic ion thrusters possess only two grids, one high voltage and one low voltage, which perform both the ion extraction and acceleration functions. However, when the charge differential between these grids reaches around 5 kV, some of the particles extracted from the chamber collide with the low voltage grid, eroding it and compromising the engine's longevity. This limitation is successfully bypassed when two pairs of grids are used. The first pair operates at high voltage, possessing a voltage differential of around 3 kV between them; this grid pair is responsible for extracting the charged propellant particles from the gas chamber. The second pair, operating at low voltage, provides the electrical field that accelerates the particles outwards, creating thrust. Other advantages to the new engine include a more compact design, allowing it to be scaled up to higher thrusts, and a narrower, less divergent exhaust plume of 3 degrees, which is reportedly five times narrower than previously achieved. This reduces the propellant needed to correct the orientation of the spacecraft due to small uncertainties in the thrust vector direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMOSTG23IE_index_0.html ESA Portal - ESA and ANU make space propulsion breakthrough&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
The largest difference in the many electrostatic ion thrusters is the method of ionizing the propellant atoms - electron bombardment (NSTAR, NEXT, T5, T6), radiofrequency (rf) excitation (RIT 10, RIT 22, µN-RIT), microwave excitation (µ10, µ20). Related to this is the need of a cathode and required effort for the power supplies. Kaufman type engines require at least supplies to the cathode, anode and chamber, whereas the rf and microwave types require an additional rf generator, but no anode and cathode supplies. 

In the extraction grid systems minor differences occur in the grid geometry and the materials used, which may have implications for the grid system lifetime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1678">'''Harold C. Anderson''' was an [[United States|American]] accountant and [[wilderness]] activist.  A prominent member of the [[Potomac Appalachian Trail Club]] (PATC) in the [[Washington D.C.]] area from its inception, he was also a co-founder of [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]].

Because of his ties to the PATC, Anderson was well acquainted with [[Benton MacKaye]], a forester who was the first to propose the [[Appalachian Trail]].  Anderson was especially concerned with the proposed building of [[skyline]]s along the Appalachian crest,&lt;ref&gt;Sutter, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; something that he shared with MacKaye, who was at the time butting heads with PATC president [[Myron Avery]] on the subject.  In August 1934, Anderson wrote to MacKaye of his desire to originate the country's first society dedicated to the protection of wilderness: "You and [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] have been preaching that those who love the primitive should get together and give a united expression of their views.  That is what I would like to get started."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16082">In [[solid-state physics]], '''heavy fermion materials''' are a specific type of [[intermetallic compound]], containing elements with 4f or 5f electrons in unfilled electron bands.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=P.

The properties of the heavy fermion compounds often derive from the partly filled f-orbitals of [[rare-earth]] or [[actinide]] ions, which behave like localized [[magnetic moment]]s. The name "heavy fermion" comes from the fact that the fermion behaves as if it has an [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] greater than its rest mass. In the case of electrons, below a characteristic temperature (typically 10&amp;nbsp;K), the conduction electrons in these metallic compounds behave as if they had an effective mass up to 1000 times the free-electron mass.  This large effective mass is also reflected in a large contribution to the [[resistivity]] from electron-electron scattering via the [[Kadowaki–Woods ratio]]. Heavy fermion behavior has been found in a broad variety of states including metallic, [[superconducting]], insulating and magnetic states. Characteristic examples are CeCu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, CeAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CeCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, YbAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, UBe&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and UPt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Historical overview==
Heavy fermion behavior was discovered by Andres, Graebner and Ott in 1975, who observed enormous magnitudes of the linear specific heat capacity in CeAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K. Andres |author2=J.E. Graebner |author3=H.R. Ott |year=1975|title=4''f''-Virtual-Bound-State Formation in CeAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at Low Temperatures|journal=Phys. Rev.

While investigations on doped superconductors led to the conclusion that the existence of localized magnetic moments and superconductivity in one material was incompatible, the opposite was shown, when in 1979 [[Frank Steglich|Steglich]] ''et al.'' discovered [[heavy fermion superconductor|heavy fermion superconductivity]] in the material CeCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F.

The discovery of a [[quantum critical point]] and non fermi liquid behavior in the phase diagram of heavy fermion compounds by von Löhneysen ''et al.'' in 1994 led to a new rise of interest in the research of these compounds.&lt;ref name="Lohneysen1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author=H.v.

Heavy fermion materials play an important role in current scientific research, acting as prototypical materials for unconventional superconductivity, non fermi liquid behavior and quantum criticality. The actual interaction between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons in heavy fermion compounds is still not completely understood and a topic of ongoing investigation.

==Properties of heavy fermion materials==
Heavy fermion materials belong to the group of [[strongly correlated materials|strongly correlated electron systems]].

Several members of the group of heavy fermion materials become superconducting below a critical temperature. The superconductivity is [[Unconventional superconductor|unconventional]].

At high temperatures, heavy fermion compounds behave like normal metals and the electrons can be described as a [[Fermi gas]], in which the electrons are assumed to be non-interacting fermions. In this case, the interaction between the ''f''&amp;nbsp;electrons, which present a local magnetic moment and the conduction electrons, can be neglected.

The [[Fermi liquid|Fermi liquid theory]] by Landau provides a good model to describe the properties of most heavy fermion materials at low temperatures. In this theory, the electrons are described by quasiparticles, which have the same quantum numbers and charge, but the interaction of the electrons is taken into account by introducing an [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], which differs from the actual mass of a free electron.

===Optical properties===
[[File:Optical properties heavy fermion.png|thumb|Typical frequency-dependent optical conductivity of a heavy fermion compound. Blue line: T &gt; T&lt;sub&gt;coh&lt;/sub&gt;. Red line: T &lt; T&lt;sub&gt;coh&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
In order to obtain the optical properties of heavy fermion systems, these materials have been investigated by optical [[spectroscopy]] measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Degiorgi|year=1999|title=The electrodynamic response of heavy-electron compounds|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=71|issue=3|pages=687–734|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.71.687|bibcode = 1999RvMP...71..687D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments the sample is irradiated by [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] with tuneable [[wavelength]]. Measuring the reflected or transmitted light reveals the characteristic energies of the sample.

Above the characteristic coherence temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{coh}&lt;/math&gt;, heavy fermion materials behave like normal metals; i.e. their optical response is described by the [[Drude model]]. Compared to a good metal however, heavy fermion compounds at high temperatures have a high scattering rate because of the large density of local magnetic moments (at least one ''f''&amp;nbsp;electron per unit cell), which cause (incoherent) [[Kondo effect|Kondo]] scattering. Due to the high scattering rate, the conductivity for dc and at low frequencies is rather low. A conductivity roll-off (Drude roll-off) occurs at the frequency that corresponds to the relaxation rate.

Below &lt;math&gt;T_{coh}&lt;/math&gt;, the localized ''f''&amp;nbsp;electrons hybridize with the conduction electrons. This leads to the enhanced effective mass, and a hybridization gap develops. In contrast to [[Kondo insulator]]s, the chemical potential of heavy fermion compounds lies within the conduction band. These changes lead to two important features in the optical response of heavy fermions.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

The frequency-dependent conductivity of heavy-fermion materials can be expressed by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\omega)=\frac{ne^2}{m^*}\frac{\tau^*}{1+\omega^2\tau^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;, containing the effective mass &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; and the renormalized relaxation rate &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau^*}=\frac{m}{m^*}\frac{1}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Millis&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.J. Millis |author2=P.A. Lee |year=1987|title=Large-orbital-degeneracy expansion for the lattice Anderson model|journal=Phys. Rev. B |volume=35|number=7|pages=3394–3414|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.35.3394|bibcode = 1987PhRvB..35.3394M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large effective mass, the renormalized relaxation time is also enhanced, leading to a narrow Drude roll-off at very low frequencies compared to normal metals.&lt;ref name=Millis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Scheffler |author2=K. Schlegel |author3=C. Clauss |author4=D. Hafner |author5=C. Fella |author6=M. Dressel |author7=M. Jourdan |author8=J. Sichelschmidt |author9=C. Krellner |author10=C.

The lowest such Drude relaxation rate observed in heavy fermions so far, in the low [[microwave|GHz range]], was found in [[UPd2Al3|UPd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Scheffler |author2=M. Dressel |author3=M. Jourdan |author4=H. Adrian |year=2005 |title=Extremely slow Drude relaxation of correlated electrons|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=438 |pages=1135–1137 |doi=10.1038/nature04232 |issue=7071 |bibcode = 2005Natur.438.1135S |pmid=16372004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gap-like feature in the optical conductivity represents directly the hybridization gap, which opens due to the interaction of localized ''f''&amp;nbsp;electrons and conduction electrons. Since the conductivity does not vanish completely, the observed gap is actually a [[pseudogap]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Donovan |author2=A. Schwartz |author3=G. Grüner |year=1997|title=Observation of an Optical Pseudogap in UPt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=79|number=7|pages=1401–1404|bibcode = 1997PhRvL..79.1401D |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.1401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At even higher frequencies we can observe a local maximum in the optical conductivity due to normal interband excitations.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

==Heat capacity==

=== Specific heat for normal metals ===
At low temperature and for normal metals, the specific heat &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; consists of the specific heat of the electrons &lt;math&gt;C_{P, el}&lt;/math&gt; which depends linearly on temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and of the specific heat of the crystal lattice vibrations ([[phonon]]s) &lt;math&gt;C_{P, ph}&lt;/math&gt; which depends cubically on temperature
:&lt;math&gt;C_P = C_{P, el}+C_{P, ph} = \gamma T + \beta T^3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
with proportionality constants &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

In the temperature range mentioned above, the electronic contribution is the major part of the specific heat. For the [[Fermi gas|free-electron gas]] &amp;mdash; a simple model system that neglects electron interaction &amp;mdash; or metals that could be described by it, the electronic [[Electron_heat_capacity#Derivation_for_the_electron_heat_capacity_within_the_free_electron_model | specific heat]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;C_{P, el} = \gamma T = \frac{\pi^2}{2}\frac{k_B}{\epsilon_F}nk_BT&lt;/math&gt;
with Boltzmann's factor &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt;, the electron density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Fermi energy]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_F&lt;/math&gt; (the highest single particle energy of occupied electronic states). The proportionality constant &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called the Sommerfeld coefficient.

=== Relation between heat capacity and "thermal effective mass" ===
For electrons with a quadratic [[dispersion relation]] (as for the free-electron gas), the [[Fermi energy]] ε&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is inversely proportional to the particle's mass m:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_F = \frac{\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_F&lt;/math&gt; stands for the Fermi wave number that depends on the electron density and is the absolute value of the wave number of the highest occupied electron state. Thus, because the Sommerfeld parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is inversely proportional to &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the particle's mass and for high values of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the metal behaves as a free electron gas in which the conduction electrons have a high thermal effective mass.

=== Example: heat capacity for UBe&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; at low temperatures ===
Experimental results for the specific heat of the heavy fermion compound UBe&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; show a peak at a temperature around 0.75 K that goes down to zero with a high slope if the temperature approaches 0 K. Due to this peak, the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; factor is much higher than for the free-electron gas in this temperature range. In contrast, above 6 K, the specific heat for this heavy fermion compound approaches the value expected from free-electron theory.

== Quantum Criticality ==
The presence of local moment and delocalized conduction electrons leads to a competition of the [[Kondo effect|Kondo interaction]] (which favors a non-magnetic ground state) and the [[RKKY interaction]] (which generates magneticially ordered states, typically [[antiferromagnetic]] for heavy fermions). By suppressing the [[Néel temperature]] of a heavy-fermion antiferromagnet down to zero (e.g. by applying pressure or magnetic field or by changing the material composition), a [[quantum phase transition]] can be induced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hilbert v. Löhneysen |year=2007 |title=Fermi-liquid instabilities at magnetic quantum phase transitions |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=1015-1075 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.79.1015 |display-authors=etal |bibcode=2007RvMP...79.1015L|arxiv=cond-mat/0606317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several heavy-fermion materials it was shown that such a quantum phase transition can generate very pronounced [[non-Fermi liquid]] properties at finite temperatures. Such quantum-critical behavior is also studied in great detail in the context of [[unconventional superconductivity]].

Examples of heavy-fermion materials with well-studied quantum-critical properties are CeCu&lt;sub&gt;6−x&lt;/sub&gt;Au,&lt;ref name="Lohneysen1994" /&gt; CeIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name="Mathur1998" /&gt; CePd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name="Mathur1998" /&gt; [[YbRh2Si2|YbRh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[CeCoIn5|CeCoIn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.

Innovation, freedom of investment, development in Africa, and technology for reducing [[greenhouse gas|{{CO2}} emission]]s were the four main issues this process visited in 2008 and 2009. A progress report was presented at the 2008 G8 Summit in Japan; a final report on the results of the dialogue was put forward in Italy in 2009. [[German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] supported this process, stating, "[W]e cannot get by, or shape globalization in a humane way, without each other".

On August 28, 2007, [[French President]] Nicolas Sarkozy proposed that China, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and India should become members of G8: "The G8 can't meet for two days and the G13 for just two hours.... That doesn't seem fitting, given the power of these five emerging countries." Nevertheless, as of 2009 formal enlargement of the G8 is not a realistic political option, as G8 states have diverging positions thereon. The US and Japan have been against enlargement, with Great Britain and France actively in favour, and Italy, Germany, and Canada undecided.

A '''helium atom''' is an [[atom]] of the chemical element [[helium]]. Helium is composed of [[Two-electron atom|two electrons]] bound by the [[electromagnetic force]] to a nucleus containing two protons along with either one or two neutrons, depending on the [[Isotopes of helium|isotope]], held together by the [[strong force]]. Unlike for [[hydrogen]], a closed-form solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the helium atom has not been found. However, various approximations, such as the [[Hartree–Fock method]], can be used to estimate the [[ground state]] energy and [[wavefunction]] of the atom.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Helium-term-scheme.svg |thumb|400px|right| Schematic termscheme for Para- and Orthohelium with one electron in ground state 1s and one excited electron.]]
The quantum mechanical description of the helium atom is of special interest, because it is the simplest multi-electron system and can be used to understand the concept of [[quantum entanglement]]. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of helium, considered as a three-body system of two electrons and a nucleus and after separating out the centre-of-mass motion, can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; H(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) = \sum_{i=1,2}\Bigg(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \nabla^2_{r_i} -\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r_i}\Bigg) - \frac{\hbar^2}{M} \nabla_{r_1} \cdot \nabla_{r_2} + \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r_{12}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac{mM}{m+M}&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced mass of an electron with respect to the nucleus, &lt;math&gt; \vec{r}_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt; are the electron-nucleus distance vectors and &lt;math&gt; r_{12} = |\vec{r_1} - \vec{r_2}| &lt;/math&gt;. The nuclear charge, &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; is 2 for helium. In the approximation of an infinitely heavy nucleus, &lt;math&gt; M = \infty &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; \mu = m &lt;/math&gt; and the mass polarization term &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \frac{\hbar^2}{M} \nabla_{r_1} \cdot \nabla_{r_2} &lt;/math&gt; disappears. In [[atomic units]] the Hamiltonian simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt; H(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) = -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2_{r_1} - \frac{1}{2}\nabla^2_{r_2} - \frac{Z}{r_1} - \frac{Z}{r_2} + \frac{1}{r_{12}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note, that it operates not in normal space, but in a 6-dimensional ''configuration space &lt;math&gt;(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2)&lt;/math&gt;''. In this approximation ([[Pauli equation|Pauli approximation]]) the wave function is a second order [[spinor]] with 4 components &lt;math&gt; \psi_{ij}(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where the indices &lt;math&gt; i,j = \,\uparrow,\downarrow &lt;/math&gt; describe the spin projection of both electrons (''z''-direction up or down) in some coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;P. Rennert, H. Schmiedel, C. Weißmantel. "Kleine Enzyklopädie Physik", VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1988, 192-194.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to obey the usual normalization condition &lt;math&gt; \sum_{ij}\int d\vec{r}_1 d\vec{r}_2|\psi_{ij}|^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. This general spinor can be written as 2x2 matrix &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \psi = \begin{pmatrix}\psi_{\uparrow\uparrow} &amp; \psi_{\uparrow\downarrow} \\ \psi_{\downarrow\uparrow} &amp; \psi_{\downarrow\downarrow} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and consequently also as linear combination of any given basis of four orthogonal (in the vector-space of 2x2 matrices) constant matrices &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \sigma^i_k &lt;/math&gt; with scalar function coefficients
&lt;math&gt; \phi^k_i (\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \psi = \sum_{ik}\phi^k_i (\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) \boldsymbol \sigma^i_k &lt;/math&gt;. A convenient basis consists of one anti-symmetric matrix (with total spin &lt;math&gt; S = 0&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a '''singlet state''')&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \sigma^0_0 = \frac 1{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} =  \frac 1{\sqrt 2}(\uparrow\downarrow - \downarrow\uparrow) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;and three symmetric matrices (with total spin &lt;math&gt; S = 1&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a '''triplet state''') &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \sigma^1_0 = \frac 1{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} =   \frac 1{\sqrt 2}(\uparrow\downarrow + \downarrow\uparrow)\; ;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \sigma^1_1 = \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} = \;\uparrow\uparrow\; ;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \sigma^1_{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} = \;\downarrow\downarrow \; .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is easy to show, that the singlet state is invariant under all rotations (a scalar entity), while the triplet can be mapped to an ordinary space vector &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z) &lt;/math&gt;,
with the three components&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; \sigma_x = \frac 1{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_y = \frac i{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma_z = \frac 1{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Since all spin interaction terms between the four components of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \psi &lt;/math&gt; in the above (scalar) Hamiltonian are neglected (e.g. an external magnetic field, or [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], like [[angular momentum coupling]]), the four [[Schrödinger equation]]s can be solved independently.
&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Landau, E.M. Lifschitz. "Lehrbuch der Theoretischen Physik", Bd. III (Quantenmechanik), Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 1971, Kap. IX, pp. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

The spin here only comes into play through the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which for fermions (like electrons) requires antisymmetry under ''simultaneous exchange of spin and coordinates''

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \psi_{ij} (\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) = - \boldsymbol \psi_{ji} (\vec{r}_2,\, \vec{r}_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Parahelium''' is then the singlet state &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \psi = \phi_0 (\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) \boldsymbol \sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt; with a ''symmetric ''function &lt;math&gt;\phi_0 (\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) = \phi_0 (\vec{r}_2,\, \vec{r}_1)&lt;/math&gt; 
and '''orthohelium''' is the triplet state &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \psi_m = \phi_1 (\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2)\boldsymbol \sigma^1_m,\; m =-1,0,1 &lt;/math&gt; with an ''antisymmetric ''function &lt;math&gt;\phi_1(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) = -\phi_1 (\vec{r}_2,\, \vec{r}_1)&lt;/math&gt;. 
If the electron-electron interaction term is ignored, both spatial functions &lt;math&gt;\phi_x,\; x = 0,1 &lt;/math&gt; can be written as linear combination of two arbitrary (orthogonal and normalized) 
one-electron eigenfunctions &lt;math&gt; \varphi_a, \varphi_b&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\phi_x =  \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}(\varphi_a(\vec{r}_1) \varphi_b(\vec{r}_2) \pm \varphi_a(\vec{r}_2) \varphi_b(\vec{r}_1)) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;or for the special cases
of &lt;math&gt; \varphi_a = \varphi_b&lt;/math&gt; (both electrons have identical quantum numbers, parahelium only): &lt;math&gt;\phi_0 =  \varphi_a(\vec{r}_1) \varphi_a(\vec{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt;.
The total energy (as eigenvalue of &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt;) is then for all cases &lt;math&gt; E = E_a + E_b &lt;/math&gt; (independent of the symmetry).

This explains the absence of the &lt;math&gt;1^3 S_1&lt;/math&gt; state (with &lt;math&gt; \varphi_a = \varphi_b = \varphi_{1s} &lt;/math&gt;) for orthohelium, where 
consequently &lt;math&gt;2^3S_1&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt; \varphi_a =  \varphi_{1s}, \varphi_b = \varphi_{2s} &lt;/math&gt;) is the metastable ground state.
(A state with the quantum numbers: principal quantum number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, total spin &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, angular quantum number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and total angular momentum 
&lt;math&gt;J = |L-S| \dots L+S&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;n^{2S+1}L_J&lt;/math&gt;.)

If the electron-electron interaction term &lt;math&gt; \frac 1{r_{12}} &lt;/math&gt; is included, the Schrödinger equation is non separable. 
However, also if is neglected, all states described above (even with two identical quantum numbers, like &lt;math&gt; 1^1S_0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\psi= \varphi_{1s}(\vec{r}_1)\varphi_{1s}(\vec{r}_2) \boldsymbol \sigma^0_0 &lt;/math&gt;)
cannot be written as a product of one-electron wave functions:
&lt;math&gt; \psi_{ik}(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) \neq \chi_i (\vec{r}_1)\xi_k(\vec{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt; — the wave function is [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]].
One cannot say, particle 1 is in '''state 1''' and the other in '''state 2''', and measurements cannot be made on one particle without affecting the other.

Nevertheless, quite good theoretical descriptions of helium can be obtained within the Hartree–Fock and Thomas–Fermi approximations (see below).

==Hartree–Fock method==
The Hartree–Fock method is used for a variety of atomic systems. However it is just an approximation, and there are more accurate and efficient methods used today to solve atomic systems. The "[[many-body problem]]" for helium and other few electron systems can be solved quite accurately. For example, the [[ground state]] of helium is known to fifteen digits. In Hartree–Fock theory, the electrons are assumed to move in a potential created by the nucleus and the other electrons. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for helium with two electrons can be written as a sum of the Hamiltonians for each electron:

&lt;math&gt; H = \sum_{i=1}^2 h(i) = H_0 + H^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

where the zero-order unperturbed Hamiltonian is

&lt;math&gt; H_0 = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{r_1}^2 - \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{r_2}^2 - \frac{Z}{r_1} - \frac{Z}{r_2} &lt;/math&gt;

while the perturbation term:

&lt;math&gt; H' = \frac{1}{r_{12}} &lt;/math&gt;

is the electron-electron interaction. H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is just the sum of the two hydrogenic Hamiltonians:

&lt;math&gt; H_0 = \hat{h}_1 + \hat{h}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; \hat{h}_i = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{r_i}^2 - \frac{Z}{r_i}, i=1,2 &lt;/math&gt;

E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, the energy eigenvalues and &lt;math&gt;\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\vec{r}_i) &lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding eigenfunctions of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian will denote the normalized energy [[eigenvalue]]s and the normalized eigenfunctions. So:

&lt;math&gt; \hat{h}_i \psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\vec{r_i}) = E_{n_i} \psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\vec{r_i}) &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; E_{n_i} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2}{n_i^2}   \text{ in a.u.} &lt;/math&gt;

Neglecting the electron-electron repulsion term, the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the spatial part of the two-electron wave function will reduce to the 'zero-order' equation

&lt;math&gt; H_0\psi^{(0)}(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) = E^{(0)} \psi^{(0)}(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is separable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of single products of hydrogenic wave functions:

&lt;math&gt; \psi^{(0)}(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) = \psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\vec{r}_1) \psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\vec{r}_2)  &lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding energies are (in [[atomic units]], hereafter a.u.):

&lt;math&gt; E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} = E_{n_1} + E_{n_2} = - \frac{Z^2}{2} \Bigg[\frac{1}{n_1^2} + \frac{1}{n_2^2} \Bigg] &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the wave function

&lt;math&gt; \psi^{(0)}(\vec{r}_2, \vec{r}_1) = \psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\vec{r}_1) \psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\vec{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

An exchange of electron labels corresponds to the same energy &lt;math&gt; E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} &lt;/math&gt;. This particular case of [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]] with respect to exchange of electron labels is called [[exchange degeneracy]]. The exact spatial wave functions of two-electron atoms must either be symmetric or [[Even and odd functions|antisymmetric]] with respect to the interchange of the coordinates &lt;math&gt; \vec{r}_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt; of the two electrons. The proper wave function then must be composed of the symmetric (+) and antisymmetric(-) linear combinations:

&lt;math&gt; \psi^{(0)}_\pm(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\vec{r}_1) \psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\vec{r}_2) \pm \psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\vec{r}_1) \psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\vec{r}_2)] &lt;/math&gt;

This comes from [[Slater determinants]].

The factor &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &lt;/math&gt; normalizes &lt;math&gt; \psi^{(0)}_\pm &lt;/math&gt;. In order to get this wave function into a single product of one-particle wave functions, we use the fact that this is in the ground state. So &lt;math&gt; n_1=n_2=1,\, l_1=l_2=0,\, m_1=m_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;. So the &lt;math&gt; \psi^{(0)}_{-}&lt;/math&gt; will vanish, in agreement with the original formulation of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which two electrons cannot be in the same state. Therefore, the wave function for helium can be written as

&lt;math&gt; \psi^{(0)}_0(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) = \psi_1(\vec{r_1}) \psi_1(\vec{r_2}) = \frac{Z^3}{\pi} e^{-Z(r_1 + r_2)} &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \psi_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \psi_2 &lt;/math&gt; use the wave functions for the hydrogen Hamiltonian. {{efn|1=For n = 1, l = 0 and m = 0, the [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential|wavefunction in a spherically symmetric potential]] for a hydrogen electron is &lt;math&gt;\psi_(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \left(\frac{Z}{a_0}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\ e^{-{\textstyle \frac{Zr}{a_0}}}\; &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html|title=Hydrogen Wavefunctions|website = Hyperphysics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201162948/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html|archivedate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[atomic units]], the [[Bohr radius]] &lt;math&gt;{a_0}&lt;/math&gt; equals 1, and the wavefunction becomes &lt;math&gt;\psi_(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} Z^{\frac{3}{2}}\ e^{-{\textstyle Zr}}\; &lt;/math&gt;.}} For helium, Z = 2 from

&lt;math&gt; E^{(0)}_0 = E^{(0)}_{n_1=1,\, n_2=1} = -Z^2 \text{ a.u.} &lt;/math&gt;

where E&lt;math&gt;^{(0)}_0&lt;/math&gt; = &amp;minus;4 a.u. which is approximately &amp;minus;108.8 eV, which corresponds to an ionization potential V&lt;math&gt;_P^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; = 2 a.u. (&amp;cong;54.4 eV). The experimental values are E&lt;math&gt;_0&lt;/math&gt; = &amp;minus;2.90 a.u. (&amp;cong; &amp;minus;79.0 eV) and V&lt;math&gt;_p&lt;/math&gt; = 0.90 a.u. (&amp;cong; 24.6 eV).

The energy that we obtained is too low because the repulsion term between the electrons was ignored, whose effect is to raise the energy levels. As Z gets bigger, our approach should yield better results, since the electron-electron repulsion term will get smaller.

So far a very crude independent-particle approximation has been used, in which the electron-electron repulsion term is completely omitted. Splitting the Hamiltonian showed below will improve the results:

&lt;math&gt; H = \bar{H_0} + \bar{H'} &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; \bar{H_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_{r_1} + V(r_1) - \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_{r_2} + V(r_2) &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; \bar{H'} = \frac{1}{r_{12}} - \frac{Z}{r_1} -V(r_1) - \frac{Z}{r_2} - V(r_2) &lt;/math&gt;

V(r) is a central potential which is chosen so that the effect of the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \bar{H'} &lt;/math&gt; is small. The net effect of each electron on the motion of the other one is to screen somewhat the charge of the nucleus, so a simple guess for V(r) is

&lt;math&gt; V(r) = -\frac{Z-S}{r} = - \frac{Z_e}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

where S is a screening constant and the quantity Z&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective charge. The potential is a Coulomb interaction, so the corresponding individual electron energies are given (in a.u.) by

&lt;math&gt; E_0 = -(Z-S)^2 = - Z_e^2 &lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding wave function is given by

&lt;math&gt; \psi_0(r_1\,  r_2) = \frac{Z_e^3}{\pi} e^{-Z_e(r_1 + r_2)} &lt;/math&gt;

If Z&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; was 1.70, that would make the expression above for the ground state energy agree with the experimental value E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;2.903 a.u. of the ground state energy of helium. Since Z = 2 in this case, the screening constant is S = 0.30. For the ground state of helium, for the average shielding approximation, the screening effect of each electron on the other one is equivalent to about &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{3} &lt;/math&gt; of the electronic charge.&lt;ref&gt;B.H. Bransden and C.J. Joachain's ''Physics of Atoms and Molecules'' 2nd edition Pearson Education, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas–Fermi method==
{{expert needed|Physics|section|date=July 2009}}
Not long after Schrödinger developed the wave equation, the [[Thomas–Fermi model]] was developed. Density functional theory is used to describe the particle density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\vec{r}),\, r\, \epsilon\, \reals^3&lt;/math&gt;, and the ground state energy E(N), where N is the number of electrons in the atom. If there are a large number of electrons, the Schrödinger equation runs into problems, because it gets very difficult to solve, even in the atom's ground states. This is where density functional theory comes in. Thomas–Fermi theory gives very good intuition of what is happening in the ground states of atoms and molecules with N electrons.

The energy functional for an atom with N electrons is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\xi = \frac{3}{5}   \gamma \int_{\reals^3} \rho^{5/3}(\vec{r}) d^3\vec{r}\, + \int_{\reals^3} V(\vec{r}) \rho(\vec{r}) d^3\vec{r}\, + \frac{e^2}{2} \int_{\reals^3} \frac{\rho(\vec{r})\rho(\vec{r'})}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|}\, d^3\vec{r}d^3\vec{r'} &lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} &lt;/math&gt;

The electron density needs to be greater than or equal to 0, &lt;math&gt;\int_{\reals^3} \rho = N&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\rho \rightarrow \xi &lt;/math&gt; is convex.

In the energy functional, each term holds a certain meaning. The first term describes the minimum quantum-mechanical kinetic energy required to create the electron density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\vec{x})&lt;/math&gt; for an N number of electrons. The next term is the attractive interaction of the electrons with the nuclei through the Coulomb potential &lt;math&gt; V(\vec{r}) &lt;/math&gt;. The final term is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.nyu.edu/LarrySpruch/Lieb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

So the Hamiltonian for a system of many electrons can be written:

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{i=1}^N \Bigg[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla_i^2 + V(\vec{r_i})\Bigg] + \int \frac{e^2\rho(\vec{r'})}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} d^3r'&lt;/math&gt;

For helium, N = 2, so the Hamiltonian is given by:

&lt;math&gt; H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (\nabla_1^2 + \nabla_2^2) + V(\vec{r_1}, \, \vec{r_2}) + \int \frac{e^2 \rho(\vec{r'})} {|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} d^3r'  &lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{e^2 \rho(\vec{r'})} {|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{1}{|\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_2|},\, \text{ and }\,  V(\vec{r_1}, \, \vec{r_2}) = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \Bigg[\frac{2}{r_1} + \frac{2}{r_2} \Bigg] &lt;/math&gt;

yielding

&lt;math&gt; H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (\nabla_1^2 + \nabla_2^2) + \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \Bigg[\frac{2}{r_1} + \frac{2}{r_2} - \frac{1}{|\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_2|}\Bigg] &lt;/math&gt;

From the Hartree–Fock method, it is known that ignoring the electron-electron repulsion term, the energy is 8E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;109 eV.

==The variational method==
To obtain a more accurate energy the [[variational principle]] can be applied to the electron-electron potential V&lt;sub&gt;ee &lt;/sub&gt;using the wave function

&lt;math&gt; \psi_0(\vec{r}_1,\, \vec{r}_2) = \frac{8}{\pi a^3} e^{-2(r_1+r_2)/a} &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \langle H \rangle = 8E_1 + \langle V_{ee} \rangle = 8E_1 + \Bigg(\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\Bigg) \Bigg(\frac{8}{\pi a^3}\Bigg)^2 \int \frac{e^{-4(r_1 + r_2)/a}} {|\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_2|}\, d^3\vec{r}_1 \, d^3\vec{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

After integrating this, the result is:

&lt;math&gt; \langle H \rangle = 8E_1 + \frac{5}{4a} \Bigg(\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\Bigg) = 8E_1 - \frac{5}{2}E_1 = -109 + 34 = -75 \text{ eV} &lt;/math&gt;

This is closer to the experimental value, but if a better trial wave function is used, an even more accurate answer could be obtained. An ideal wave function would be one that doesn't ignore the influence of the other electron. In other words, each electron represents a cloud of negative charge which somewhat shields the nucleus so that the other electron actually sees an effective nuclear charge Z that is less than 2. A wave function of this type is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \psi(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) = \frac{Z^3}{\pi a^3} e^{-Z(r_1+r_2)/a} &lt;/math&gt;

Treating Z as a variational parameter to minimize H. The Hamiltonian using the wave function above is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \langle H \rangle = 2Z^2E_1 + 2(Z-2) \Bigg(\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\Bigg) \left\langle \frac{1}{r} \right\rangle + \left\langle V_{ee} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

After calculating the expectation value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{r} &lt;/math&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;ee&lt;/sub&gt; the expectation value of the Hamiltonian becomes:

&lt;math&gt; \langle H \rangle = \left[-2Z^2 + \frac{27}{4}Z\right]E_1 &lt;/math&gt;

The minimum value of Z needs to be calculated, so taking a derivative with respect to Z and setting the equation to 0 will give the minimum value of Z:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dZ} \left(\left[-2Z^2 + \frac{27}{4}Z\right] E_1\right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{27}{16} \sim 1.69 &lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the other electron somewhat shields the nucleus reducing the effective charge from 2 to 1.69. So we obtain the most accurate result yet:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \Bigg(\frac{3}{2}\Bigg)^6 E_1 = -77.5 \text{ eV} &lt;/math&gt;

Where again, '''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' represents the ionization energy of hydrogen.

[[Image:Wärmflasche1.jpg|right|thumb|Two modern hot-water bottles shown with their stoppers]]

A '''hot-water bottle''' is a [[bottle]] filled with hot water and sealed with a stopper, used to provide warmth, typically while in bed, but also for the application of heat to a specific part of the body.

==Early history==
Containers for warmth in bed were in use as early as the 16th century. The earliest versions contained hot [[coal]]s from the dying embers of the fire, and these [[bed warmer]]s were used to warm the bed before getting into it.

Containers using hot water were soon also used, with the advantage that they could remain in the bed with the sleeper.

Prior to the invention of [[rubber]] that could withstand sufficient heat, these early hot-water bottles were made of a variety of materials, such as [[zinc]], [[copper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Holden |first=M. |date=February 1922 |title=The Charm of Old Copper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHEFc90F-z0C&amp;pg=RA3-PA65#v=onepage&amp;f=false |work=[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=65 |access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[brass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Description of Articles Tested and Approved |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78s2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA723#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |department=Good Housekeeping Institute |date=May 1912 |volume=54 |page=723 |magazine=[[Good Housekeeping Magazine]] |access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[glass]],&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Interesting Hot-Water Bottles Facts |url=https://www.lovehotwaterbottles.com/Interesting-Hot-Water-Bottle-Facts/ |date=30 May 2007 |department=Love Hot-Water Bottles |publisher=Urban Industry Limited |access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[earthenware]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Cryer |first=Pat |title=Getting Warm in Bed with Stoneware Hot-Water Bottles |url=http://www.1900s.org.uk/1940s-hot-water-bottles.htm |publisher=Join Me in the 1900s |access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lipman |first=Denis |year=2010 |title=A Yank Back to England: The Prodigal Tourist Returns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LET9O0m3jcwC&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Boston |publisher=GemmaMedia |page=12 |isbn=9781934848241 |access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[wood]]. To prevent burning, the metal hot water flasks were wrapped in a soft cloth bag.

==Rubber bottles==
[[File:Electric hot-water bottle.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An electric hot-water bottle]]
"[[India rubber]]" hot-water bottles were in use in Britain at least by 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mr. Teale's Case Of Excessively High Temperature| volume=2|issue=758|page=57|date=10 July 1875 |journal=The British Medical Journal| first=John W.|last=Teale| doi=10.1136/bmj.2.758.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern conventional hot-water bottles were patented in 1903 and are manufactured in [[natural rubber]] or [[PVC]], to a design [[patent]]ed by the [[Croatia]]n inventor [[Slavoljub Eduard Penkala|Eduard Penkala]]. They are now commonly covered in fabric, sometimes with a novelty design.

[[File:Yutanpo-japan-nov2017.jpg|thumb|Japanese style plastic hot-water bottle, known locally as a ''yutanpo'', with its cloth protective bag on the right.]]
By the late 20th century, the use of hot-water bottles had markedly declined around most of the world. Not only were homes better heated, but newer items such as [[electric blanket]]s were competing with hot-water bottles as a source of night-time heat. However the hot-water bottle remains a popular alternative in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/households-stock-up-on-hot-water-bottles-to-keep-warm-and-save-on-power-bills-this-winter/story-fnagkbpv-1226451280090|title=Households stock up on hot-water bottles to keep warm and save on power bills this winter|date=16 August 2012|publisher=News Corp|archivedate=24 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724105115/http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/households-stock-up-on-hot-water-bottles-to-keep-warm-and-save-on-power-bills-this-winter/story-fnagkbpv-1226451280090|first=Karen|last=Collier}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]], [[developing countries]] and rural areas. For example, it is widely used in [[Chile]], where it is called a "guatero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diccionario de la lengua española |publisher=Real Academia Española |language=es |url=http://www.rae.es/guatero |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107062407/http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=guatero |archivedate=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a recent surge in popularity in Japan where it is seen as an ecologically friendly and thrifty way to keep warm.&lt;ref name=Lewis2008&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan's thrifty find the hot-water bottle to survive the chill |last=Lewis |first=Leo |date=November 29, 2008 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5254354.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newer products function like the older bottles, but use a [[polymer]] [[gel]] or [[wax]] in a [[heating pad|heat pad]]. The pads can be heated in a [[microwave oven]], and they are marketed as safer than liquid-filled bottles or electrically-heated devices. Some newer bottles now use a silicone-based material instead of rubber, which resists very hot water better, and does not deteriorate as much as rubber. Although the stopper size in Ireland and the UK has been largely standard for many decades, the newer bottles (notably those from German manufacturer Fashy) use a wider mouth which is easier to fill (and a larger stopper to fit it).

While generally used for keeping warm, conventional hot-water bottles can be used to some effect for the local application of heat as a medical treatment, for example for pain relief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heat 'relieves internal pain'|date=5 July 2006|first=Alok|last=Jha|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jul/05/health.society|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925001851/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jul/05/health.society|archivedate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but newer items such as purpose-designed [[heating pad]]s are often used now.

==Regulation==
{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}
Hot-water bottles are meant to contain very hot fluids and also supposed to be in contact with human skin. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure, mainly through standards and [[regulations]],  that the closing and [[welding]] is stable enough to prevent burns, but also to make sure that the bottle’s chemical components are not dangerous for human health. More generally, it is crucial to certify and assure that hot-water bottles, whether manufactured, sold or imported, are safe.

For instance, the [[United Kingdom]] defined British Standards for hot-water bottles to regulate their manufacture and sale as well as to ensure their compliance with all [[safety standards]]. The British Standards BS 1970 and BS 1970:2012 (updated version) define, for instance, the bottles’ filling characteristics, safety instructions, allowed materials and components as well as testing methods such as tensile tests for PVC bottles.

Most regulations applied to a country are generally harmonized in order to be applied and applicable in a larger area, such as a trade zone.

==Problems==
There have been problems with premature failure of rubber hot-water bottles due to faulty manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/hot-water-bottles-recalled-over-leak-danger-20090901-f7cj.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724104812/http://www.smh.com.au/national/hot-water-bottles-recalled-over-leak-danger-20090901-f7cj.html|archivedate=24 July 2015|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2 September 2009|publisher=Fairfax Media|title=Hot water bottles recalled over leak danger|agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rubber may fail strength or fitness tests, or become brittle if manufacturing is not controlled closely. Natural rubber filled with [[calcium carbonate]] is the most common material used, but is susceptible to [[oxidation]] and [[polymer degradation]] at the high temperatures used in shaping the product.

Boiling water is not recommended for use in hot-water bottles. This is due to risks of the rubber being degraded from high-temperature water, and the risk of injury in case of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hotwaterbottleshop.co.uk/pages/how-to-fill-a-hot-water-bottle-safely-video|date=17 January 2016|title=How to Fill a Hot Water Bottle Safely|publisher=Hot Water Bottle Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Alfred, the cantankerous hot-water bottle, is a character from ''[[Johnson and Friends]]'', a popular Australian children's television series from the 1990s. This character has gained a cult following in recent years, particularly among those who grew up with the series, due to the odd character choice. Alfred is believed to be the only anthropomorphised hot-water bottle in existence.{{Citation needed|reason=No reason to believe Alfred is alone?|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="654">'''Hydrocarbon economy''' is a term referencing the global hydrocarbon industry and its relationship to world markets. [[world energy resources and consumption|Energy used]] mostly comes from three [[hydrocarbon]]s: [[petroleum]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]].  Hydrocarbon economy is often used when talking about possible alternatives like the [[hydrogen economy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22hydrocarbon+economy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?tab=sw&amp;sa=N&amp;q=%22hydrocarbon+economy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Sir James Irvine Orme Masson''' [[Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; [[FRSE]] [[MBE]] LLD (3 September 1887 – 22 October 1962), generally known as '''Irvine Masson''', was an Australian-born [[chemist]] of Scots descent who was Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Sheffield]] from 1938 to 1953.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Masson, Sir David Orme (1858–1937)| journal = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/38283 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually referred to in documents as '''J. I. O. Masson'''.

==Life==

Irvine Masson was born in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], near [[Melbourne]], the son of Sir [[David Orme Masson]] a professor of chemistry at [[Melbourne University]], and his wife, Mary Struthers. He went to [[Melbourne Grammar School]] then Melbourne University, achieving a BSc with first class honours in [[chemistry]] in 1908. He began medical studies, but reverted to chemistry and in 1910 took up a scholarship in the subject at [[University College London]] joining the staff in 1913.

During the [[First World War]] he did explosives research at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], a practical experience very different from his previous academic work, but which had a major influence on his future research.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

After further time at University College, in 1924 he was made Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Durham]], also taking on the role of head of the Department of Pure Science. During this time he was lucky to survive one of his experiments which destroyed much of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; This administrative role led to his appointment as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield in 1938. However he combined this with running research on explosives during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

In 1939 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]]. He was knighted by King [[George VI]] in 1950. In 1953 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Arthur Holmes]], Sir [[Godfrey Thomson]], Sir [[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sydney A Smith]], and [[John Edwin MacKenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 he retired from Sheffield and moved to Edinburgh, where both he and his wife had other family connections.

He died in Edinburgh on 22 October 1962. He is buried in the [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]] in southern Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/110960089@N08/11304661733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He was the paternal grandson of [[David Masson]] and maternal grandson of [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]]. He was the nephew of [[Simon Somerville Laurie]]. 

In 1913 he married his first cousin, Flora Gulland (d.1960) sister of [[John Masson Gulland]]. Their children included [[David I. Masson|David Irvine Masson]]

The '''Keystone Pipeline System''' is an [[oil pipeline]] system in Canada and the United States, commissioned in 2010 and now owned solely by [[TransCanada Corporation]].&lt;ref name="system-doc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transcanada.com/liquids-pipelines-projects.html |title=Keystone Pipeline System |publisher=TransCanada |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs from the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]] in [[Alberta]] to refineries in [[Illinois]] and [[Texas]], and also to oil [[Oil terminal|tank farms]] and an oil pipeline distribution center in [[Cushing, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=USStateDepartmentSEISMarch2013 /&gt; The pipeline became well-known when a planned fourth phase, '''Keystone XL''', attracted opposition from environmentalists, becoming a symbol of the battle over [[Attribution of recent climate change|climate change and fossil fuels]].  In 2015 Keystone XL was temporarily delayed by then–[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. On January 24, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] took action intended to permit the pipeline's completion.

Three phases of the project are in operation:
* The Keystone Pipeline (Phase I) completed in June 2010 delivers oil from [[Hardisty]], [[Alberta]], over {{convert|3456|km}} to the junction at [[Steele City, Nebraska]], and on to [[Wood River Refinery]] in [[Roxana, Illinois]], and Patoka Oil Terminal Hub north of [[Patoka, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="TransCanada-PR20100630"/&gt;
* The Keystone-Cushing extension (Phase II) completed in February 2011 running {{convert|468|km}} from Steele City to a tank farm in [[Cushing, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=TransCanada2013Jan /&gt;&lt;ref name="TransCanada-PR20110208"/&gt;
* The Gulf Coast Extension (Phase III) completed in January 2014 runs {{convert|784|km}} from Cushing to refineries at [[Port Arthur, Texas]].&lt;ref name="TransCanada-PR20120727"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TransCanada-PR20140122"/&gt; A lateral pipeline to refineries at [[Houston, Texas]] and a terminal was completed mid-2016, going online the following year.&lt;ref name="TransCanada-HoustonStatus"/&gt;

The first two phases have the capacity to deliver up to {{convert|590000|oilbbl/d}} of oil into the Midwest refineries.&lt;ref name=TransCanada2013Jan&gt;{{cite web|title=Keystone Pipeline |url=http://www.transcanada.com/100.html |accessdate=2013-03-17 |publisher=[[TransCanada Corporation]] |location=Calgary, Alberta, Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116010600/http://transcanada.com/100.html |archivedate=January 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase III has capacity to deliver up to {{convert|700000|oilbbl/d}} to the Texas refineries.&lt;ref name=spacedaily220114/&gt; By comparison, production of [[petroleum in the United States]] averaged {{convert|9400000|oilbbl/d}} in first-half 2015, with gross exports of {{convert|500000|oilbbl/d}} through July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short-Term Energy and Winter Fuels Outlook|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/report/us_oil.cfm|accessdate=8 November 2015|publisher=[[Energy Information Administration|US Energy Information Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Keystone Pipeline system consists of the operational Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III, the Gulf Coast Pipeline Project. A fourth, proposed pipeline expansion segment Phase IV, Keystone XL, failed to receive necessary permits from the United States federal government in 2015. Construction of Phase III, from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Nederland, Texas, in the Gulf Coast area, began in August 2012 as an independent economic utility.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;It was presented to the United States State Department as an independent economic utility in February 2012, sidestepping the requirement for a Presidential Permit because it does not cross an international border (United States Department of State SEIS March 1, 2013 p. ES1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GulfCoast&gt;{{cite web |title=Gulf Coast Pipeline Project |url=http://www.transcanada.com/gulf-coast-pipeline-project.html |accessdate=March 17, 2013 |publisher=TransCanada Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121135703/http://transcanada.com/gulf-coast-pipeline-project.html |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase III was opened on 22 January 2014&lt;ref name=spacedaily220114&gt;, completing the pipeline path from Hardisty, Alberta to Nederland, Texas.{{cite news | url = http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_leg_of_controversial_Canadian_oil_pipeline_opens_999.html | title = US leg of controversial Canadian oil pipeline opens | work = Space Daily | date = 2014-01-22 | accessdate = 2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keystone XL Pipeline Project (Phase IV) revised proposal in 2012 consists of a new {{convert|36|in|adj=on}} pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Nebraska, to "transport of up to {{convert|830000|oilbbl/d}} of crude oil from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta, Canada, and from the Williston Basin (Bakken) region in Montana and North Dakota, primarily to refineries in the Gulf Coast area."&lt;ref name=USStateDepartmentSEISMarch2013 /&gt; The Keystone XL pipeline segments were intended to allow American crude oil to enter the XL pipelines at [[Baker, Montana]], on their way to the storage and distribution facilities at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. Cushing is a major crude oil marketing/refining and pipeline hub.&lt;ref name="NYTKeystoneXL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Keystone XL Pipeline |date=28 February 2012 |publisher=The New York Times |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/k/keystone_pipeline/index.html |first1=John M. |last1=Broder |first2=Clifford |last2=Krauss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating since 2010, the original Keystone Pipeline System is a {{convert|3461|km|adj=on}} pipeline delivering Canadian crude oil to U.S. Midwest markets and Cushing, Oklahoma. In Canada, the first phase of Keystone involved the conversion of approximately {{convert|864|km}} of existing {{convert|36|in|adj=on}} natural gas pipeline in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to crude oil pipeline service. It also included approximately {{convert|373|km}} of new {{convert|30|in|adj=on}} diameter pipeline, 16&amp;nbsp;pump stations and the Keystone Hardisty Terminal.&lt;ref name="barrelfull"/&gt;

The U.S. portion of the Keystone Pipeline included {{convert|1744|km}} of new, {{convert|30|in|adj=on}} diameter pipeline in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.&lt;ref name="barrelfull"/&gt; The pipeline has a minimum ground cover of {{convert|4|ft}}.&lt;ref name=downstream4/&gt; It also involved construction of 23&amp;nbsp;pump stations and delivery facilities at Wood River and Patoka, Illinois. In 2011, the second phase of Keystone included a {{convert|480|km|0|adj=on}} extension from Steele City, Nebraska, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and 11&amp;nbsp;new pump stations to increase the capacity of the pipeline from {{convert|435000|to|591000|oilbbl/d|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name="barrelfull"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/keystone-pipeline | title = Keystone Pipeline | newspaper = A Barrel Full | date = 2012-03-02 | accessdate = 2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional phases (III, completed in 2014, and IV, rejected in 2015) have been in construction or discussion since 2011. If completed, the Keystone XL would have added {{convert|510000|oilbbl/d}} increasing the total capacity up to {{convert|1.1|Moilbbl/d}}.&lt;ref name=downstream2/&gt;

The original Keystone Pipeline cost US$5.2&amp;nbsp;billion with the Keystone XL expansion slated to cost approximately US$7&amp;nbsp;billion. The Keystone XL had been expected to be completed by 2012–2013, however construction was ultimately overtaken by events.&lt;ref name=downstream2/&gt;

===Ownership===
While the project was originally developed as a partnership between [[TransCanada Corporation]] and [[ConocoPhillips]], TransCanada is now the sole owner of the Keystone Pipeline System, as TransCanada received regulatory approval on August 12, 2009 to purchase ConocoPhillips' interest.&lt;ref name="transcanada-keystone"&gt;{{cite web |title= Keystone Pipeline System |url= http://www.transcanada.com/keystone/ |publisher= TransCanada Corporation |accessdate= 8 September 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501081804/http://www.transcanada.com/keystone/ |archive-date= 2009-05-01 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed '''Keystone XL''' pipeline starts from the same area in [[Alberta]], Canada, as the Phase 1 pipeline.&lt;ref name=downstream4/&gt; The Canadian section would consist of {{convert|526|km}} of new pipeline.&lt;ref name=downstream110310/&gt; It would enter the United States at [[Morgan, Montana]], and travel through [[Baker, Montana]], where American-produced oil would be added to the pipeline; then it would travel through South Dakota and Nebraska, where it would join the existing Keystone pipelines at [[Steele City, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="system-doc" /&gt; This phase has generated the greatest controversy because of its routing over the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sandhills]] in Nebraska.&lt;ref name=gm241211&gt;
{{cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/the-politics-of-pipe-keystones-troubled-route/article2282805/singlepage/#articlecontent |title = The politics of pipe: Keystone's troubled route |first = Nathan | last = VanderKlippe |newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] |date = 2011-12-24 |accessdate = 2012-12-09 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USDS_Keystone2011_11_10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ecoregions/&gt;

On 6 November 2015, the project of Keystone XL was rejected by the [[Obama administration]] after more than six years of review and initial approval by the Obama State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/06/obama-reject-keystone-pipeline/75293270/|title=Obama administration rejects Keystone pipeline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to this, financial commitment towards completion of the pipeline was weakened by a number of technological factors as well. Recent innovations in fracking had increased domestic production of oil and, according to the EIA, reduced annual demand of oil from foreign countries to an all-time low since 1985. Shifts to Gasoline fuel for cargo vehicles, new technologies promoting fuel efficiency, and export restrictions that forced the price of oil to decrease also played a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_juice/2015/11/obama_didn_t_kill_the_keystone_xl_pipeline_innovation_did.html|title=Obama Didn't Kill Keystone XL|last=Gross|first=Daniel|date=2015-11-06|work=Slate|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Obama's decision, aides to then President Elect [[Donald Trump]] were reportedly looking for the easiest way(s) to countermand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-23/trump-aides-eye-reviving-keystone-by-rescinding-lbj-s-order|title=Trump Aides Eye Reviving Keystone by Rescinding LBJ's Order|date=23 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2018, TransCanada announced they had secured commitments to ship 500,000 barrels per day for 20 years. They believe construction could begin in 2019.&lt;ref name=wsj11818&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monga|first1=Vipal|title=Keystone XL Pipeline Obtains Enough Shipper Commitments to Proceed|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/keystone-xl-pipeline-obtains-enough-shipper-commitments-to-proceed-1516298281|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2018, a federal judge in Montana blocked construction of Keystone XL pipeline, due to it failing to comply with federal environmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcn.org/articles/oil-a-judge-just-dealt-a-potentially-fatal-blow-to-keystone-xl|title=A judge just dealt a potentially fatal blow to Keystone XL|date=15 November 2019|publisher=|via=www.hcn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Republicans in the House of Representatives defended the Northern Route Approval Act, which would allow for congressional approval of the pipeline, on the grounds that the pipeline created jobs and energy independence. If enacted the Northern Route Approval Act would waive the requirement for permits for a foreign company and bypass the need for President Obama's approval, and the debate in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate, concerned about serious environmental risks, that could result in the rejection of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=CP22may2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Republicans aim to take Keystone XL decision out of Obama's hands |first=Lee-Anne |last=Goodman |publisher=The Canadian Press |date=22 May 2013 |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/Republicans+take+Keystone+decision+Obama+hands/8420625/story.html#ixzz2U8R6yL8f }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Nebraska professor Dr. John Stansbury conducted an independent analysis that provides more detail on the potential risks for the Ogallala Aquifer.&lt;ref name="unl.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117101558/http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [https://web.archive.org/web/20150117101558/http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf analysis], Dr. Stansbury concludes that safety assessments provided by TransCanada are misleading. According to Dr. Stansbury, "We can expect no fewer than 2 major spills per state during the 50-year projected lifetime of the pipeline. These spills could release as much as 180 thousand barrels of oil each."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmogblog.com/expert-warns-transcanada-s-keystone-xl-pipeline-assessments-are-misleading|title=Expert Warns That TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline Assessments Are Misleading|work=DeSmogBlog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other items of note in Dr. Stansbury's analysis:

* "While TransCanada estimates that the Keystone XL will have 11 significant spills (more than 50 barrels of crude oil) over 50 years, a more realistic assessment is 91 significant spills over the pipeline's operational lifetime. TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)"
* "Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than {{convert|800,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline – a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on}} pipe compared to the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} Keystone XL – was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)"
* "Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than {{convert|180000|oilbbl|USgal L}} in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than {{convert|160000|oilbbl|USgal L}} of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than {{convert|140000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Platte River crossing and more than {{convert|120000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Missouri River crossing."
* "Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, NE; Omaha, NE; Nebraska City, NE; St. Joseph, MO; Kansas City, MO) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river."
* "The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface. This aquifer is the well-known Ogallala Aquifer that is one of the most productive and important aquifers in the world."&lt;ref name="unl.edu"/&gt;

Pipeline industry spokesmen have noted that thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, in southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico, western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Lakely, [http://heartland.org/policy-documents/map-pipelines-and-ogallala-aquifer-2012 Map of Pipelines and the Ogallala Aquifer, 2012], 20 Jan. 2012.

Portions of the pipeline will also cross an active [[seismic zone]] that had a 4.3 magnitude [[earthquake]] as recently as 2002.&lt;ref name="thetyee-20100707"/&gt; Opponents claim that TransCanada applied to the U.S. government to use thinner steel and pump at higher pressures than normal.&lt;ref name="thetyee-20100621"/&gt; In October 2011, ''The New York Times'' questioned the impartiality of the environmental analysis of the pipeline done by [[Cardno Entrix]], an environmental contractor based in Houston.

TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has described the Keystone Pipeline as "routine", noting that TransCanada has been building similar pipelines in North America for half a century and that there are {{convert|200,000|mi}} of similar oil pipelines in the United States today. He also stated that the Keystone Pipeline will include 57&amp;nbsp;improvements above standard requirements demanded by U.S. regulators so far, making it "the safest pipeline ever built".&lt;ref name='cattaneo'/&gt; Rep. [[Ed Whitfield]], a member of the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] concurred, saying "this is the most technologically advanced and safest pipeline ever proposed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120201052045/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/world/archives/2011/12/20111202-162023.html "Keystone XL the 'safest pipeline ever'"], ''[[Sun News Network]]'', 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while TransCanada had asserted that a set of 57&amp;nbsp;conditions will ensure Keystone XL's safe operation, Anthony Swift of the Natural Resources Defense Council asserted that all but a few of these conditions simply restate current minimum standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20110919/keystone-xl-pipeline-safety-regulations-phmsa-transcanada-oil-sands-bitumen |title=Keystone XL Pipeline Safety Standards Not as Rigorous as They Seem |first = Elizabeth |last = McGowan |newspaper= InsideClimate News |date=2011-09-19|accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TransCanada claims that they will take 100% responsibility for any potential environmental problems. According to their website, "It's our responsibility – as a good company and under law. If anything happens on the Keystone XL Pipeline, rapid response is key. That's why our Emergency Response plans are approved by state and federal agencies, and why we practice them regularly. We conduct regular emergency exercises, and aerial surveys every two weeks. We're ready to respond with a highly-trained response team standing by."

====Leaks and 2017 South Dakota spill====
In 2016, about 400 barrels were released from the original Keystone pipe network via leaks, which federal investigators said resulted from a "weld anomaly."&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt;

On November 17, 2017, the pipeline leaked what the company claimed was 210,000 gallons of oil&lt;ref name="WASHINGPOST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX"/&gt; onto farmland near [[Amherst, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name="TRIBUNE"/&gt; The oil leak is the largest seen from the Keystone pipeline in the state. The leak lasted for several minutes, with no initial reports of damage to water sources or wildlife. Although the spill did not happen on Sioux property, it was in close enough proximity to potentially contaminate the aquifer used for water.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/us/keystone-pipeline-leak/index.html|title=Keystone Pipeline leaks 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota|last=CNN|first=Mayra Cuevas and Steve Almasy,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WASHINGPOST"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mufson|first1=Steven|last2=Mooney|first2=Chris |date=2017-11-16|title=Keystone pipeline spills 210,000 gallons of oil on eve of permitting decision for TransCanada|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/11/16/keystone-pipeline-spills-210000-gallons-of-oil-on-eve-of-key-permitting-decision/|work=[[The Washington Post]] |location= |access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline was immediately shut down,&lt;ref name="DOUBLE"&gt;[https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1HE0T7?__twitter_impression=true "Keystone pipeline leak in South Dakota about double previous estimate: paper"], Reuters, April 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and TransCanada began using the pipe again 12 days after the leak.&lt;ref name="TRIBUNE"&gt;[https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/04/07/keystone-pipeline-spill-south-dakota-twice-big-first-thought/496679002/ "Keystone Pipeline spill in South Dakota twice as big as first thought"], Associated Press, April 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; For much of late 2017, the Keystone pipeline operated at reduced pressure during remediation efforts. The federal [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] said that the failure "may have been caused by mechanical damage to the pipeline and coating associated with a weight installed on the pipeline in 2008." Later, the NTSB found that a metal tracked vehicle had run over the area, damaging the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB1801.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;[https://www.upi.com/November-spill-from-Keystone-pipeline-larger-than-first-estimated/8971523274440/ "November spill from Keystone pipeline larger than first estimated"], Daniel J. Graeber, UPI, April 9, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, a federal investigation found that 408,000 gallons of crude had spilled at the site, almost twice what TransCanada had reported. That number made it the seventh-largest onshore oil spill since 2002.&lt;ref name="VICE"&gt;[https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evqqmk/egypts-jon-stewart-watched-the-egyptian-elections-from-la "The Keystone Pipeline oil spill was nearly twice as big as TransCanada said"], ''[[Vice News]]'', Sarah Sax, April 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_32334.html?nocache=5134#_Incidents_tab_3&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, ''[[Reuters]]'' reviewed documents that showed that Keystone had "leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010."&lt;ref name="DOUBLE"/&gt;

====Potential for increased carbon emissions====

Environmental organizations such as the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) also oppose the project due to its transportation of oil from oil sands.&lt;ref name=nyt210811/&gt; In its March 2010 report, the NRDC stated that "the Keystone XL Pipeline undermines the U.S. commitment to a [[clean energy]] economy", instead "delivering dirty fuel at high costs".&lt;ref name="nrdc-tsp4"&gt;{{cite news |title= Say No to Tar Sands Pipeline | url= http://www.nrdc.org/land/files/TarSandsPipeline4pgr.pdf | date= 2010-03-10 | publisher= NRDC | format = PDF | accessdate= 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 2010, 50&amp;nbsp;Democrats in Congress in their letter to Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] warned that "building this pipeline has the potential to undermine America's clean energy future and international leadership on climate change", referencing the higher input quantity of fossil fuels [[Oil sands#Input energy|necessary to take the tar and turn it into a usable fuel product]] in comparison to other [[Energy returned on energy invested|conventionally derived fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/sclefkowitz/house_members_say_proposed_tar_1.html | title = House members say tar sands pipeline will undermine clean energy future | publisher = NRDC | first = Susan | last = Casey-Lefkowitz | date = 2010-06-23 | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=downstream240610&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.downstreamtoday.com/news/article.aspx?a_id=23134 | title = Enviro Groups, 50 Congressmen Mobilize Against Keystone XL | newspaper = The Commercial Appeal | first = Bartholomew | last = Sullivan | publisher = Downstream Today | date = 2010-06-24 | accessdate = 2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] climate scientist [[James Hansen]] stated in 2013 that "moving to tar sands, one of the dirtiest, most [[EROEI|carbon-intensive fuels]] on the planet" is a step in exactly the wrong direction, "indicating either that governments don't understand the situation or that they just don't give a damn".&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2010, the No Tar Sands Oil campaign, sponsored by action groups including Corporate Ethics International, NRDC, [[Sierra Club]], [[350.org]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], and [[Rainforest Action Network]], was launched.&lt;ref name=calgaryherald081210&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/12/08-6 | title = Pressure in U.S. mounts against oilsands pipeline | first = Dina | last = O'Meara | newspaper = [[The Calgary Herald]] | date = 2010-12-08 | accessdate = 2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech to the Canadian Club in Toronto on September 23, 2011, [[Joe Oliver (politician)|Joe Oliver]], [[Minister of Natural Resources (Canada)|Canada's Minister of Natural Resources]], sharply criticized opponents of oil sands development and the pipeline, arguing that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NOTA Bene |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/NOTA+Bene/5452294/story.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110924221506/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/NOTA+Bene/5452294/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2011 |newspaper=National Post |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The total area that has been affected by surface mining represents only 0.1% of [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canada's boreal forest]].
* The oil sands account for about 0.1% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.
* Electricity plants powered by coal in the U.S. generate almost 40 times more greenhouse-gas emissions than Canada's oil sands (the coal-fired electricity plants in the State of Wisconsin alone produce the equivalent of the entire GHG emissions of the oil sands).
* California bitumen is more GHG-intensive than the oil sands.

The State Department's Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS) estimated that producing and transporting oil to the pipeline's capacity would increase greenhouse-gas emissions compared to alternative sources of oil. However, this estimate would only apply to the pipeline project as a whole if the denial of the pipeline project meant that the oil would stay in the ground. "However, ... such a change is not likely to occur. [A]pproval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed Project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands, or the continued demand for heavy crude oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, Keystone XL Project, 4.14: Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change|url=https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the oil would be extracted in any case, the relevant comparison would be to alternative means of transporting it; the Final SEIS considered three alternative scenarios and found that "total GHG emissions associated with construction and operation (direct and indirect) combined would be higher for each of the three scenarios than for the entire route encompassing the proposed Project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, Keystone XL Project, 5.3: Comparison of Alternatives|url=https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221198.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Final SEIS made no estimate of the net effect of the project on greenhouse-gas emissions, considering both the amount of oil that would likely replace other sources (increasing emissions) and the amount of oil for which the pipeline would merely replace alternate means of transportation (decreasing emissions).

In a February 2, 2015 letter response to the U.S. Department of State's [http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/finalseis/index.htm Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS)] for the Keystone XL Pipeline Project, [http://www.epa.gov/ U.S. the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] stated that the pipeline will significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions because it will lead to the expansion of Alberta's carbon intensive oilsands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/business/slams+Keystone+significant+emissions+climate+change+impact/10784258/story.html|title=EPA slams Keystone for 'significant' emissions and climate change impact|work=www.canada.com|access-date=2015-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209031742/http://www.canada.com/business/slams+Keystone+significant+emissions+climate+change+impact/10784258/story.html|archive-date=2015-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter goes on to add that over the proposed 50-year timeline of the pipeline, this could mean releasing as much as "1.37 billion more tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/03/epa-keystone-xl-pipeline-will-impact-global-warming|title=EPA: Keystone XL Pipeline Will Impact Global Warming - US News|author=Alan Neuhauser|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York Times, EPA concluded that due to the current relatively cheap cost of oil, companies might be less likely to set up their own developments in the oil sands. It would be too expensive for the companies to ship by rail. However, "the presence of the pipeline, which offers an inexpensive way to move the oil to market, could increase the likelihood that companies would extract from the oil sands even when prices are low".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/us/politics/house-passes-keystone-bill.html|title=House Passes Keystone Bill Despite Obama's Opposition|date=12 February 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its letter response, the EPA suggested that the State Department should "revisit" its prior conclusions in light of the drop in oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcanada-rebuts-epa-comments-on-keystone-xl-pipeline-1423659353?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f|title=TransCanada Rebuts EPA Comments on Keystone XL Pipeline|author=Amy Harder and Lee Roberts|date=11 February 2015|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TransCanada Corporation responded with a letter of its own, in which President and CEO Russel K.

The pipeline was a top-tier election issue for the November 4, 2014, United States elections for the [[United States Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2014|for U.S. House of Representatives]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|for governors in states and territories]], and for many state and local positions as well.

In January 2012, Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) requested a new report on the environmental review process.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/920768194&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] publicly expressed her opposition on Keystone XL, citing climate change concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/politics/hillary-clinton-opposes-keystone-xl-pipeline/index.html|title=Hillary Clinton opposes Keystone XL pipeline|first=Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Brianna Keilar|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic issues===
Commentator Bill Mann has linked the Keystone postponement to the Michigan Senate's rejection of Canadian funding for the proposed [[Gordie Howe International Bridge]] and to other recent instances of "U.S. government actions (and inactions) that show little concern about Canadian concerns". Mann drew attention to a ''[[Maclean's]]'' article sub-titled "we used to be friends"&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Bill, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-should-be-thankful-for-canada-2011-11-24 "Americans should be thankful for Canada"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', November 24, 2011.

Retrieved 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian [[Gary Doer|Ambassador Doer]] observes that Obama's "choice is to have it come down by a pipeline that he approves, or without his approval, it comes down on trains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/transcanada-says-keystone-xl-will-create-many-jobs-despite-obama-interview/article13471894/ | title='Trains or pipelines,' Doer warns U.S. over Keystone | newspaper=The Globe &amp; Mail | date = 2013-07-28 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 Pacific Northwest Economic Region Summit in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler, B.C.]], Canada's US Ambassador Gary Doer stated that there is no proof, be it environmental, economic, safety or scientific, that construction work on Keystone XL should not go ahead. Doer said that all the evidence supports a favourable decision by the US government for the controversial pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's US ambassador pushes for Keystone XL decision|url=http://www.energyglobal.com/news/pipelines/articles/Canadas-US-ambassador-pushes-for-Keystone-XL-decision-674.aspx#.U9if__ldV8E|date=July 24, 2014|publisher=energyglobal.com|access-date=2014-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045023/http://www.energyglobal.com/news/pipelines/articles/Canadas-US-ambassador-pushes-for-Keystone-XL-decision-674.aspx#.U9if__ldV8E|archive-date=2014-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the President of the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Sioux Nation]], Cyril Scott, has stated that the November 14, 2014, vote in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] is an "[[Casus belli|act of war]]", declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are outraged at the lack of intergovernmental cooperation. We are a [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereign nation]], and we are not being treated as such. We will close our reservation borders to Keystone XL. Authorizing Keystone XL is an act of war against our people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Geopolitical issues===
Proponents for the Keystone XL pipeline argue that it would allow the U.S. to increase its energy security and reduce its dependence on foreign oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/keystonexl.shtml |title=U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce: The Keystone XL Pipeline |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113045908/http://energycommerce.house.gov/keystonexl.shtml |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/story/2011-10-26/Keystone-oil-pipeline-build/50941230/1 |title=Say Yes To Building The Keystone Oil Pipeline |last= Editorial |agency =USA Today |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has argued that "the U.S. needs 10 million barrels a day of imported oil" and the debate over the proposed pipeline "is not a debate of oil versus alternative energy. This is a debate about whether you want to get your oil from Canada or [[Venezuela]] or [[Nigeria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.financialpost.com/news/Keystone+exaggerated+rhetoric+untrue+Canada/5449012/story.html|title=Keystone 'exaggerated rhetoric' untrue|first=Yadullah|last=Hussein|newspaper=Financial Post|date=2011-09-23|access-date=2012-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101175424/http://www.financialpost.com/news/Keystone+exaggerated+rhetoric+untrue+Canada/5449012/story.html|archive-date=2012-01-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute refers to some studies (e.g. a 2011 study by Danielle Droitsch of Pembina Institute) according to which "a good portion of the oil that will gush down the KXL will probably end up being finally consumed beyond the territorial United States". It also states that the project will increase the heavy crude oil price in the [[Midwestern United States]] by diverting oil sands oil from the Midwest refineries to the Gulf Coast and export markets.&lt;ref name="ILR Cornell Study"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/globallaborinstitute/research/upload/GLI_KeystoneXL_Reportpdf.pdf |title= Pipe dreams?

The US Gulf Coast has a large concentration of refineries designed to process very heavy crude oil. At present, the refineries are dependent on heavy crude from [[Venezuela]], including crude from Venezuela's own massive [[Orinoco oil sands]]. The United States is the number one buyer of crude oil exported from Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ve Venezuela], 20 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The large trade relationship between the US and Venezuela has persisted despite political tensions between the two countries. However, the volume of oil imported into the US from Venezuela dropped in half from 2007 to 2014, as overall Venezuelan exports have dropped, and also as Venezuela seeks to become less dependent on US purchases of its crude oil. The Keystone pipeline is seen as a way to replace imports of heavy oil-sand crude from Venezuela with more reliable Canadian heavy oil.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge R. Pinon, [http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/lacp/files/UT-LACP-August-2014-Energy-Issue-Brief.pdf The possible loss of Venezuelan heavy crude oil imports underscores the strategic importance of the Keystone XL pipeline], Energy Issue Brief, Jackson School of Geosciences, Univ. of Texas, Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

TransCanada's Girling has also argued that if Canadian oil doesn't reach the Gulf through an environmentally friendly buried pipeline, that the alternative is oil that will be brought in by tanker, a mode of transportation that produces higher greenhouse-gas emissions and that puts the environment at greater risk.&lt;ref name='cattaneo'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/09/08/transcanada-in-eye-of-the-storm/|title=TransCanada in eye of the storm|first=Claudia |last=Cattaneo |newspaper=Financial Post |date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diane Francis]] has argued that much of the opposition to the oil sands actually comes from foreign countries such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia, all of whom supply oil to the United States and who could be affected if the price of oil drops due to the new availability of oil from the pipeline. She cited as an example an effort by Saudi Arabia to stop pro-oil-sands television commercials.&lt;ref name=financialpost230911&gt;{{cite news | url = http://opinion.financialpost.com/2011/09/23/foreign-interests-attack-oil-sands/ | title = Foreign interests attack oil sands | newspaper = Financial Post | first = Diane | last = Francis | authorlink = Diane Francis | date = 2011-09-23 | accessdate = 2012-11-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130205004817/http://opinion.financialpost.com/2011/09/23/foreign-interests-attack-oil-sands/ | archive-date = 2013-02-05 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; TransCanada had said that development of oil sands will expand regardless of whether the crude oil is exported to the United States or alternatively to Asian markets through [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]] or [[Kinder Morgan]]'s Trans-Mountain line.&lt;ref name=downstream300610&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.downstreamtoday.com/news/article.aspx?a_id=23197 | title = TransCanada: Oil Sands Exports Will Go To Asia If Blocked In US | agency = [[Dow Jones Newswires]] | first = Edward | last = Welsch | publisher = Downstream Today | date = 2010-06-30 | accessdate = 2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2011, a number of leaders from Native American bands in the United States and First Nations bands from Canada were arrested for protesting the Keystone XL outside the White House. According to Debra White Plume, a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] activist, indigenous peoples "have thousands of ancient and historical cultural resources that would be destroyed across [their] treaty lands".&lt;ref name="Academic OneFile"/&gt; TransCanada's Pipeline Permit Application to the [[South Dakota Public Utilities Commission]] states project impacts that include potential physical disturbance, demolition or removal of "prehistoric or historic archaeological sites, districts, buildings, structures, objects, and locations with traditional cultural value to Native Americans and other groups".&lt;ref name="XL Keystone - 2009"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Application to the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission for a Permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline Under the Energy Conversion and Transmission Facility Act|url=http://puc.sd.gov/commission/dockets/hydrocarbonpipeline/2009/hp09-001/application.pdf|publisher=puc.sd.gov|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic issues===
[[Russ Girling]], president and CEO of [[TransCanada Corp.|TransCanada]], touted the positive impact of the project by "putting 20,000&amp;nbsp;US workers to work and spending $7&amp;nbsp;billion stimulating the US economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | date = 2011-08-31 | title = TransCanada CEO on Proposed Pipeline | url = http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/1136627843001/transcanada-ceo-on-proposed-pipeline/ | publisher = [[Fox News Channel]] | accessdate = 2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers come from a 2010 report written by The Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm based in Texas that was hired by TransCanada to evaluate Keystone XL.&lt;ref name="Perryman Report 2010"&gt;{{cite report | date = June 2010 | title = The Impact of Developing the Keystone XL Pipeline Project on Business Activity in the US: An Analysis Including State-by-State Construction Effects and an Assessment of the Potential Benefits of a More Stable Source of Domestic Supply | url = http://www.perrymangroup.com/reports/TransCanada.pdf | publisher = Perryman Group | accessdate = 2012-03-18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120125125858/http://www.perrymangroup.com/reports/TransCanada.pdf | archivedate = 2012-01-25 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keystone XL jobs"&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2012-01-12 | title = Keystone XL Jobs Bewilder Media.

On January 27, 2012, Greenpeace Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] appealed to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] to review TransCanada's claims that the Keystone Pipeline would create 20,000 jobs. Stating that the company had "consistently used public statements and information it knows are false in a concerted effort to secure permitting approval" of the pipeline, Radford argued that TransCanada had "misled investors, U.S. and Canadian officials, the media, and the public at large in order to bolster its balance sheets and share price".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Radford, Phil |title=Greenpeace Letter to Securities and Exchange Commission | url = https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/287168-gp-sec-transcanada-letter.html | accessdate = 2014-03-04|date=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2013, President Obama stated "The most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two, and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people." The estimate of 2,000 during construction came under heavy attack, while the long-term, permanent job estimates did not receive as much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/27/obama-keystone-xl-jobs_n_3664998.html |title=Obama Questions Keystone XL Pipeline Job Projections|date=2013-07-27 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press noted that it was unclear where the president's figure of 2,000 jobs came from. The U.S. State Department's Preliminary Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, issued in March 2013, estimated 3,900 direct jobs and 42,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/08/01/ap-obama-understates-keystone-xl-pipeline-jobs-by-thousands/ AP: Obama Understates Keystone XL Pipeline Jobs By Thousands], 1 Aug. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/finalseis/ Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS)], the Pipeline will only create 35 permanent jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/finalseis/|title=Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS)|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There might be unintended economic consequences to the construction of Keystone XL. As an example, the additional north-south crude oil transport capacity brought by Keystone XL will increase the price the oil sands producers receive for their oil. These higher revenues will have a positive impact on the development of the industry in Alberta. In return, due to the [[Petrodollar]] nature of the Canadian currency these same additional revenues will strengthen the [[Canadian dollar]] versus the [[United States dollar]]. Based on historical trends, this stronger Canadian dollar will result in a reduction of the competitiveness of Canada's manufacturing industry and could lead to the loss of 50,000 to 100,000&amp;nbsp;jobs in Canada's manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name = "On the economic impact of the Keystone pipeline"&gt;{{Cite web | title = On the economic impact of the Keystone pipeline | url = http://opendatadepot.org/blog/entry/7/on-the-economic-impact-of-the-keystone-pipeline/ | accessdate = 2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=anonymous blog|date=March 2013}} Many of these jobs, such as the ones in the auto industry, would likely find their way south and have a positive impact on manufacturing employment in the U.S.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail-4105411"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Cato | first = Jeremy | title = Canadian Auto Workers union: singing off-key as jobs go south | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = September 10, 2012 | url = http://m.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/driving-it-home/canadian-auto-workers-union-singing-off-key-as-jobs-go-south/article4105411/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130411231302/http://m.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/driving-it-home/canadian-auto-workers-union-singing-off-key-as-jobs-go-south/article4105411/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = April 11, 2013 | accessdate = 2013-03-19 | location = Toronto }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date = July 2013}}

Glen Perry, a petroleum engineer for Adira Energy, has warned that including the [[Alberta Clipper pipeline]] owned by TransCanada's competitor Enbridge, there is an extensive overcapacity of oil pipelines from Canada.&lt;ref name = "theglobeandmail-1543726"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vanderklippe | first = Nathan | title = Oil sands awash in excess pipeline capacity | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = April 23, 2010 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/oil-sands-awash-in-excess-pipeline-capacity/article1543726/ | accessdate = 2012-02-22 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completion of the Keystone XL line, oil pipelines to the U.S. may run nearly half-empty. The expected lack of volume combined with extensive construction cost overruns has prompted several petroleum refining companies to sue TransCanada. Suncor Energy hoped to recoup significant construction-related tolls, though the U.S. Energy Regulatory Commission did not rule in their favor. According to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;The refiners argue that construction overruns have raised the cost of shipping on the Canadian portion of Keystone by 145 per cent while the U.S. portion has run 92 per cent over budget. They accuse TransCanada of misleading them when they signed shipping contracts in the summer of 2007. TransCanada nearly doubled its construction estimates in October 2007, from $2.8-billion (U.S.) to $5.2-billion.&lt;ref name = "theglobeandmail-1548807"&gt;{{cite news | title= Pipeline fees revolt widens | url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/pipeline-fees-revolt-widens/article1548807/ | first= Nathan | last= Vanderklippe | date= 2010-04-29 | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | accessdate=2010-08-01 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public opinion===
Public opinion polls taken by independent national polling organizations toward the beginning of the dispute showed majority support for the proposed pipeline in the US. A September 2013 poll by the Pew Center found 65% favored the project and 30% opposed. The same poll found the pipeline favored by majorities of men (69%), women (61%), Democrats (51%), Republicans (82%), independents (64%), as well as by those in every division of age, education, economic status, and geographic region. The only group identified by the Pew poll with less than majority support for the pipeline was among those Democrats who identified themselves as liberal (41% in favor versus 54% opposed).&lt;ref name="people-press.org"&gt;Pew Center, [http://www.people-press.org/2013/09/26/continued-support-for-keystone-xl-pipeline/ Continued Support for Keystone XL Pipeline], 26 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the same polling organization published results of a February 2017 poll showing that support for the pipeline had fallen to only 42% by the beginning of 2017, with 48% of polled respondents opposing the pipeline. The Pew Center reported a 17 percentage point drop in support since 2014, with the majority of the shift due to a sharp decline in support among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents. At the time of the poll, only 17% of Democrats favored the pipeline. Support among Republicans had also fallen (to 76%) but by no means as steeply as among Democrats.&lt;ref name="Public Divided Over Keystone XL" &gt;Pew Center, [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/21/public-divided-over-keystone-xl-dakota-pipelines-democrats-turn-decisively-against-keystone/, February 21, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, it was learned that the government of Alberta was investigating, as an alternative to the pipeline south through the United States, a shorter all-Canadian pipeline north to the Arctic coast, from where the oil would be taken by tanker ships through the [[Arctic Ocean]] to markets in Asia and Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jill Burke, [http://alaskadispatch.com/article/20130425/alaska-watches-canadians-consider-shipping-tar-sands-oil-across-arctic-ocean Alaska watches Canadians consider shipping tar sands oil across Arctic Ocean], Alaska Dispatch, 30 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and in August, TransCanada announced a new proposal to create a longer all-Canada pipeline, called [[Energy East pipeline|Energy East]], that would extend as far east as the port city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], at the same time providing feedstock to refineries in Montreal, Quebec City and Saint John.&lt;ref&gt;TransCanada, [http://www.transcanada.com/news-releases-article.html?id=1746092 Energy East News Release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213235625/http://www.transcanada.com/news-releases-article.html?id=1746092 |date=2014-12-13 }}, August 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enbridge "Alberta Clipper" expansion of the existing cross-border Line 67 pipeline has been continuing since late 2013.

===Lawsuits===
In September 2009, independent refiner CVR sued TransCanada for Keystone Pipeline tolls seeking $250&amp;nbsp;million damage compensation or release from transportation agreements. CVR alleged that the final tolls for the Canadian segment of the pipeline were 146% higher than initially presented, while the tolls for the U.S. segment were 92% higher.&lt;ref name=oildaily&gt;{{cite news | title= Independent refiner CVR sues TransCanada's Keystone Pipeline | url= http://www.allbusiness.com/transportation/pipeline-transportation-oil-gas/13114806-1.html | date= 2009-09-18 | work = The Oil Daily | first = Barbara | last = Shook | publisher= AllBusiness.com, Inc | accessdate= 2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, three smaller refineries sued TransCanada to break Keystone transportation contracts, saying the new pipeline has been beset with cost overruns.&lt;ref name = "theglobeandmail-1548807"/&gt;

In October 2009, a suit was filed by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] that challenged the pipeline on the grounds that its permit was based on a deficient environmental impact statement. The suit was thrown out by a federal judge on procedural grounds, ruling that the NRDC lacked the authority to bring it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= NRDC's Suit to Block Canada-US Oil Pipeline Thrown Out | url= http://www.heatingoil.com/blog/nrdcs-suit-to-block-canada-us-oil-pipeline-thrown-out102/ | date= 2009-10-02 | agency= [[Associated Press]] | accessdate= 2010-07-22 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418200508/http://www.heatingoil.com/blog/nrdcs-suit-to-block-canada-us-oil-pipeline-thrown-out102/ | archivedate= 2010-04-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[Sierra Club]], Inc., Clean Energy Future Oklahoma, and the East Texas Sub Regional Planning Commission filed a joint complaint in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma]] seeking injunctive relief and petitioning for a review of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]' action in issuing Nationwide Permit 12 permits for the Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast portion of the pipeline. The suit alleges that, contrary to the federal [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], 5 U.S.C. § 701 et. seq., the Corps' issuance of the permits was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Enviros Sue to Stop Keystone Pipeline Project | url= http://www.cnsenvironmentallaw.com/2012/07/03/1014.htm | agency = Courthouse News Service |accessdate= 2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2016, TransCanada announced it would initiate an [[ISDS]] claim under [[NAFTA]] against the United States, seeking $15 billion in damages and calling the denial of a permit for Keystone XL "arbitrary and unjustified."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/transcanada-files-lawsuit-over-keystone-pipeline-rejection/article28038526/ TransCanada to launch NAFTA claim over Keystone rejection], The Globe and Mail, January 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lampas''' is a type of luxury [[textile|fabric]] with a background [[weft]] (a "ground weave") typically in [[taffeta]] with supplementary wefts (the "pattern wefts") laid on top and forming a design, sometimes also with a "[[brocade|brocading]] weft". Lampas is typically [[weaving|woven]] in silk, and often has gold and silver thread enrichment.

==History==
Lampas weaves were developed around 1000 CE. Beginning late in the 17th century western lampas production began centered in [[Lyon, France]], where an industry of providing for French and other European courts became centered.

'''Lithium triborate''' (LiB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) or '''LBO''' is a [[non-linear optics]] [[crystal]].  It has a wide [[transparency (optics)|transparency]] range, moderately high [[nonlinear coupling]], high damage threshold and desirable [[chemical]] and [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties. This crystal is often used for [[second harmonic generation]] (SHG, also known as ''frequency doubling''), for example of [[Nd:YAG laser]]s (1064&amp;nbsp;nm → 532&amp;nbsp;nm). LBO can be both critically and non-critically [[phase matching|phase-matched]]. In the latter case the crystal has to be heated or cooled depending on the [[wavelength]].

Lithium triborate was discovered and developed by [[Chen Chuangtian]] and others of the [[Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter]], [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].  It has been patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4,826,283}} (issued in 1989), 2023845 in Japan and CN88102084.2 in China.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==
*[[Point group]]: mm2
*[[Lattice parameter]]s: ''a''=8.4473 Å, ''b''=7.3788 Å, ''c''=5.1395 Å
*[[Mohs hardness]]: 6
*Transmission range: 0.16 – 2.6 μm
*Damage threshold: 25 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1064&amp;nbsp;nm, 10 ns pulses)
*[[Thermal expansion coefficient]]s: ''x'': 10.8×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;/K, ''y'': −8.8×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;/K, ''z'': 3.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;/K
*Specific heat: 1060 J/kg·K
*Melting point: 834&amp;nbsp;°C

==Applications of lithium triborate (LBO) crystal==
Lithium triborate (LBO) crystals are applicable in various nonlinear optical applications:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eksmaoptics.com/en/p/lithium-triborate-lbo-crystals-297 LBO crystal applications at www.eksmaoptics.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Second-harmonic generation|Frequency doubling (SHG)]] and frequency tripling of high peak power pulsed Nd doped, [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:Sapphire lasers]] and [[Dye laser]]s

==Medical uses==

Miltefosine is primarily used for the treatment of [[visceral leishmaniasis|visceral]] and [[cutaneous leishmaniasis|New World cutaneous leishmaniasis]], and is undergoing [[clinical trial]]s for this use in several countries.&lt;ref name=FAPEPI&gt;{{cite news|last=Cristina |first=Márcia |author2=Pedrosa, Robert |title=Hospital de Doenças Tropicais testa droga contra calazar |work=Sapiência |language=Portuguese |publisher=Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Piauí |date=September 2005 |url=http://www.fapepi.pi.gov.br/sapiencia6/pesquisa3.php |accessdate=2006-09-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822060527/http://www.fapepi.pi.gov.br/sapiencia6/pesquisa3.php |archivedate=2006-08-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soto&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soto J, Berman J |title=Treatment of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis with miltefosine |journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg |year=2006 |pmid=16930649 |doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2006.02.022 |volume=100 |pages=S34–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This drug is now listed as a core medication for the treatment of leishmaniasis under the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf|title=19th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|last=WHO|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513043105/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several medical agents have some efficacy against visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, however, a 2005 survey concluded that miltefosine is the only effective oral treatment for both forms of leishmaniasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berman | first1 = J. | title = Clinical status of agents being developed for leishmaniasis | doi = 10.1517/13543784.14.11.1337 | journal = Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 1337–1346 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16255674| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Miltefosine is listed as pregnancy category D by the FDA. This means there is evidence-based adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans of harm to the human fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy-categories.html|title=New FDA Pregnancy Categories Explained - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116163852/https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy-categories.html|archivedate=2016-11-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this evidence, the potential benefits of miltefosine may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.  A pregnancy test should be done prior to starting treatment. Effective [[birth control]] should be used while on miltefosine and 5 months after discontinuation of treatment. Its use during breast feeding is most likely unsafe.&lt;ref name="dorlo" /&gt;

==Contraindications==
Miltefosine is contraindicated in individuals who have a [[hypersensitivity]] to this medication, pregnant women, and people who have the [[Sjögren-Larsson syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights of Prescribing Information for Impavido|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/204684s000lbl.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118193055/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/204684s000lbl.pdf|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and [[teratogenic]] in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and [[contraception]] is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sindermann|first=H.|author2=Engel, J.|title=Development of miltefosine as an oral treatment for leishmaniasis|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2006|volume=100|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S17–S20|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2006.02.010|pmid=16730362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s from miltefosine treatment are [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], which occur in 60% of people. Other common side effects are dizziness, headache, and daytime sleepiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/sfx/miltefosine-side-effects.html|title=Miltefosine Side Effects in Detail - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117070506/https://www.drugs.com/sfx/miltefosine-side-effects.html|archivedate=2016-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Miltefosine primarily acts on ''Leishmania'' by affecting the species's promastigote and amastigote stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/1311/impavido-miltefosine|title=Impavido New FDA Drug Approval {{!}} CenterWatch|website=www.centerwatch.com|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104192249/http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/1311/impavido-miltefosine|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miltefosine exerts its activity by interacting with lipids, inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and causing apoptosis-like cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Anti-InfectiveDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM371074.pdf|title=Miltefosine (Impravido) for the Treatment of Visceral, Mucosal and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis|last=FDA|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 Nov 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024125444/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Anti-InfectiveDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM371074.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may affect membrane integrity and mitochondrial function of the parasite.

==History==
===Cancer===

===Leishmaniasis===
In the same year as the discovery of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] as having antileishmanial effect as well. The compound was effective against ''[[Leishmania donovani]]'' [[amastigote]]s in cultured mouse peritoneal [[macrophage]]s at a dose of 12.8&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day in a five-day course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Croft|first=S.L.|author2=Neal, R.A. |author3=Pendergast, W. |author4= Chan, J.H. |title=The activity of alkyl phosphorylcholines and related derivatives against Leishmania donovani|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|year=1987|volume=36|issue=16|pages=2633–2636|doi=10.1016/0006-2952(87)90543-0|pmid=3606662}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, priority was given to the development of the compound for cutaneous [[metastases]] of [[breast cancer]]. In 1992 a new research was reported in which the compound was highly effective in mouse against different [[life cycle (biology)|life cycle stages]] of different ''Leishmania'' species, and in fact, more potent than the conventional [[sodium stibogluconate]] therapy by a factor of more than 600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhlencord|first=A|author2=Maniera, T |author3=Eibl, H |author4= Unger, C |title=Hexadecylphosphocholine: oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in mice.|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|year=1992|volume=36|issue=8|pages=1630–1634|doi=10.1128/AAC.36.8.1630|pmid=1329624| pmc=192021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of the first clinical trial in humans were reported from Indian patients with chronic leishmaniasis with high degree of success and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sundar|first=Shyam|author2=Rosenkaimer, Frank |author3=Makharia, Manoj K |author4=Goyal, Ashish K |author5=Mandal, Ashim K |author6=Voss, Andreas |author7=Hilgard, Peter |author8= Murray, Henry W |title=Trial of oral miltefosine for visceral leishmaniasis|journal=The Lancet|year=1998|volume=352|issue=9143|pages=1821–1823|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)04367-0|pmid=9851383}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promising development promulgated a unique public–private partnership collaboration between [[Asta Medica|ASTA Medica]] (later Zentaris GmbH), the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the [[Government of India]]. Eventually, several successful Phase II and III trials led to the approval of miltefosine in 2002 as the first and only oral drug for leishmaniasis.&lt;ref name=dorlo/&gt;

===Naegleria fowleri and acanthamoeba===

In 2013, the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommended miltefosine for the treatment of free-living amebae infections such as [[granulomatous amoebic encephalitis]] and [[primary amoebic meningoencephalitis]], two fatal protozoal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cope|first1=Jennifer R|title=Investigational drug available directly from CDC for the treatment of infections with free-living amebae.|journal=MMWR.

==Further research==

===Antiprotozoal and antifungal activities===
Miltefosine is being investigated by researchers interested in finding treatments for infections which have become resistant to existing drugs.  Animal and ''[[in vitro]]'' studies suggest it may have broad anti-protozoal and anti-fungal properties:

===Anti-HIV activity===

Miltefosine targets HIV infected [[macrophages]], which play a role [[in vivo]] as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The HIV protein [[Structure and genome of HIV#Genome organization|Tat]] activates pro-survival [[PI3K]]/[[Akt]] pathway in primary human macrophages.  Miltefosine acts by inhibiting the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/Akt pathway]], thus removing the infected macrophages from circulation, without affecting healthy cells.&lt;ref name=pmid18237430&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chugh P, Bradel-Tretheway B, Monteiro-Filho CM, etal |title=Akt inhibitors as an HIV-1 infected macrophage-specific anti-viral therapy |journal=Retrovirology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=11 |year=2008 |pmid=18237430 |doi=10.1186/1742-4690-5-11 |pmc=2265748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleAIDSmeds.com - Top Stories : Parasitic Drug Shows HIV-Fighting Promise"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmeds.com/articles/hiv_miltefosine_macrophages_1667_13933.shtml |title=Parasitic Drug Shows HIV-Fighting Promise |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=2008-02-01 |publisher=AIDSmeds.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212122209/http://www.aidsmeds.com/articles/hiv_miltefosine_macrophages_1667_13933.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It significantly reduces replication of HIV-1 in cocultures of human [[dendritic cell]]s (DCs) and [[CD4(+) T cell|CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell]]s, which is due to a rapid secretion of soluble factors and is associated with induction of type-I [[interferon]] (IFN) in the human cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garg|first=Ravendra |author2=Tremblay, Michel J.|title=Miltefosine represses HIV-1 replication in human dendritic cell/T-cell cocultures partially by inducing secretion of type-I interferon|journal=Virology|year=2012|volume=432|issue=2|pages=271–276|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.032|pmid=22704066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20736">'''Nuclear propulsion''' includes a wide variety of propulsion methods that fulfill the promise of the [[Atomic Age]] by using some form of [[nuclear reaction]] as their primary power source. The idea of using nuclear material for propulsion dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 it was hypothesised that radioactive material, [[radium]], might be a suitable fuel for engines to propel cars, boats, and planes.&lt;ref&gt;Some practical uses of radium rays, The Republic, Sunday, September 13, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. G. Wells]] picked up this idea in his 1914 fiction work ''[[The World Set Free]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The new source of energy, The World Set Free, H G Wells, Collins, London and Glasgow, 1956 edition, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface ships, submarines, and torpedoes==

Nuclear-powered vessels are mainly military [[submarine]]s, and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Russia and America are the only countries that currently have nuclear-powered civilian surface ships, including [[icebreaker]]s and Aircraft carriers. America currently (as of July 2018) has 11 Aircraft carriers in service, and all are powered by nuclear reactors. They use [[nuclear reactor]]s as their power plants. For more detailed articles see:

===Torpedo===
{{Main|Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System}}
Russia's Channel One Television news broadcast a picture and details of a nuclear-powered torpedo called ''Status-6'' on about 12 November 2015. The torpedo was stated as having a range of up to 10,000&amp;nbsp;km, a cruising speed of 100 knots, and operational depth of up to 1000 metres below the surface. The torpedo carried a 100-megaton nuclear warhead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34797252 Russia reveals giant nuclear torpedo in state TV 'leak'], BBC news,
12 November 2015 - retrieved 27 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the suggestions emerging in the summer of 1958 from the first meeting of the scientific advisory group that became [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] was for ''"a nuclear-powered torpedo that could roam the seas almost indefinitely"''. &lt;ref&gt;Science Magazine, 29 November 1991, p.1284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft and missiles==
{{main|Nuclear-powered aircraft}}
[[File:HTRE-3.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of an [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] system, known as HTRE-3(Heat Transfer Reactor Experiment no. 3). The central [[EBR-1]] based reactor, took the place of chemical fuel [[combustion]] to heat the air. The reactor rapidly raised the temperature via an air [[heat exchanger]] and powered the dual [[General Electric J47|J47 engine]]s in a number of ground tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thornton|first=G|author2=Blumbeg, B.|title=Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Heat Transfer Reactor Experiments Fulfill Test Goals|journal=Nucleonics|date=January 1961|volume=19|issue=1|publisher=McGraw-Hill|issn=0096-6207}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Research into nuclear-powered aircraft was pursued during the [[Cold War]] by the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] as they would presumably allow a country to keep nuclear bombers in the air for extremely long periods of time, a useful tactic for [[nuclear deterrence]]. Neither country created any operational nuclear aircraft. One design problem, never adequately solved, was the need for heavy shielding to protect the crew from [[radiation sickness]]. Since the advent of [[ICBM]]s in the 1960s the tactical advantage of such aircraft was greatly diminished and respective projects were cancelled. Because the technology was inherently dangerous it was not considered in non-military contexts. Nuclear-powered missiles were also researched and discounted during the same period.

==Spacecraft==
{{main|Nuclear power in space}}
Many types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them (e.g. [[NERVA]]) tested for spacecraft applications.

*[[Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Rockets]] conduct nuclear fission reactions similar to those safely employed at nuclear power plants including submarines. The energy is used to heat the liquid hydrogen propellant. Advocates of nuclear-powered spacecraft point out that at the time of launch, there is almost no radiation released from the nuclear reactors. The nuclear-powered rockets are not used to lift off the Earth. Nuclear thermal rockets can provide great performance advantages compared to chemical propulsion systems. Nuclear power sources could also be used to provide the spacecraft with electrical power for operations and scientific instrumentation.&lt;ref name=Biomodal1&gt;{{cite web

===Russian Federal Space Agency development===
{{main|TEM (nuclear propulsion)}}
[[Anatolij Perminov]], head of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]], announced{{when|date=June 2014}} that it is going to develop a nuclear-powered spacecraft for deep space travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhabitat.com/russian-space-agency-announces-plans-to-build-nuclear-powered-deep-space-rocket/ Russian Space Agency Announces Plans to Build Nuclear-Powered Deep Space Rocket]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Russia_And_US_To_Discuss_Nuke_Powered_Spaceship_Project_999.html Russia And US To Discuss Nuke-Powered Spaceship Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary design was done by 2013, and 9 more years are planned for development (in space assembly). The price is set at 17 billion rubles (600 million dollars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1029/russians-to-ride-a-nuclear-powered-spacecraft-to-mars Russians to ride a nuclear-powered spacecraft to Mars] // 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The nuclear propulsion would have mega-watt class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/05/russia_nasa_nuclear_spacecraft/|title=Russia, NASA to hold talks on nuclear-powered spacecraft.

This system would consist of a space nuclear power and a matrix of ion engines. "...Hot inert gas temperature of 1500 °C from the reactor turns turbines. The turbine turns the generator and compressor, which circulates the working fluid in a closed circuit. The working fluid is cooled in the radiator. The generator produces electricity for the same ion (plasma) engine..." &lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.federalspace.ru/8996/ Academician Anatoly Koroteev: "Nuclear power can provide a qualitative leap in the development of space"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2014}}

According to him, the propulsion will be able to support [[human mission to Mars]], with cosmonauts staying on the Red planet for 30 days. This journey to Mars with nuclear propulsion and a steady acceleration would take six weeks, instead of eight months by using chemical propulsion – assuming thrust of 300 times higher than that of chemical propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalspace.ru/main.php?id=2&amp;nid=11297&amp;lang=en Space Propulsion for Martian Mission may be Developed in 6-9 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/nuclear-propulsion-in-space/ Russia Leads Nuclear Space Race After U.S. Drops Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles==

===Cars===
The idea of making cars that used radioactive material, [[radium]], for fuel dates back to at least 1903. Analysis of the concept in 1937 indicated that the driver of such a vehicle might need a 50-ton [[lead]] barrier to [[Radiation protection|shield]] them from [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Science Review, Issues 1-12, University of Melbourne Science Club, Melbourne University, 1937, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Dr R M Langer, a [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] physicist, espoused the idea of a car powered by [[uranium-235]] in the January edition of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. He was followed by [[William Bushnell Stout]], designer of the [[Stout Scarab]] and former [[Society of Engineers]] president, on 7 August 1945 in the ''[[New York Times]]''. The problem of shielding the reactor continued to render the idea impractical.&lt;ref&gt;Automobile Quarterly, Volume 31 Number 1, 1992, pages 14-29&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1945, a John Wilson of London, announced he had created an atomic car. This created considerable interest. The Minister of Fuel and Power along with a large press contingent turned out to view it. The car did not show and Wilson claimed that it had been sabotaged. A later court case found that he was a fraud and there was no nuclear-powered car.&lt;ref&gt;First Atomic Car "sabotaged", Townsville Daily Bulletin, Queensland, Australia, Monday 3 December 1945 page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic Car" hoax - Elderly inventor gets goal sentence, Cairns Post, Queensland Australia, Monday 22 July 1946, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the shielding problem, through the late 1940s and early 1950s debate continued around the possibility of nuclear-powered cars. The development of nuclear-powered submarines and ships, and experiments to develop a nuclear-powered aircraft at that time kept the idea alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benson Ford poses challenge on atomic powered automobiles|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52868920/?terms=%22atomic%2Bpowered%2Bcar%22|newspaper=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=October 2, 1951|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 4, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian papers in the mid-1950s reported the development of a nuclear-powered car by Professor V P Romadin, but again shielding proved to be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Eagle, Sunday, February 20, 1955, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that its laboratories had overcome the shielding problem with a new alloy that absorbed the rays.&lt;ref&gt;Atom-powered Automobile Claimed Russian, The victoria Advocate, Victoria, Texas, Sunday, January 30, 1955, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 at the height of the [[1950s American automobile culture]] there were at least four theoretical nuclear-powered [[concept car]]s proposed, the American [[Ford Nucleon]] and [[Packard#Astral|Studebaker Packard Astral]], as well as the French [[Simca#Fulgur|Simca Fulgur]] designed by [[Robert Opron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radioactive cars of the twentieth century|url=http://specialcarnews.com/?p=292|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Une anticipation Simca : la "fulgur"|url=http://a21.idata.over-blog.com/1/09/44/33/vehicules/fulgur/214b93a9d10c06e.jpg|accessdate=26 April 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Arbel (automobile)|Arbel {{Not a typo|Symetric}}]]. Apart from these concept models, none were built and no automotive nuclear power plants ever made. [[Chrysler]] engineer C R Lewis had discounted the idea in 1957 because of estimates that an {{convert|80000|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} engine would be required by a {{convert|3000|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} car. His view was that an efficient means of storing energy was required for nuclear power to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Atom powered car], Popular Mechanics, April 1957, page 141&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Chrysler's stylists in 1958 drew up some possible designs.

In 1959 it was reported that [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] had developed a new [[rubber]] compound that was light and absorbed radiation, obviating the need for heavy shielding. A reporter at the time considered it might make nuclear-powered cars and aircraft a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Advent of Atom Powered Plane Speeded, Ray Cromley, The Victoria Advocate, Victoria, Texas, Wednesday, June 24, 1959, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford made another potentially nuclear-powered model in 1962 for the [[Seattle World's Fair]], the [[Ford Seattle-ite XXI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanlon|first=Mike|title=Ford Seattle-ite: one of history's most significant concept cars|url=http://www.gizmag.com/ford-seattle-ite-one-of-historys-most-significant-concept-cars/2798/|work=Gizmag.com|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1962 Ford Seattle-ite XXI|url=http://forum.love-fords.org/content.php?165-1962-Ford-Seattle-ite-XXI|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also never went beyond the initial concept.

In 2009, for the hundredth anniversary of [[General Motors]]' acquisition of [[Cadillac]], Loren Kulesus created [[concept art]] depicting a car powered by [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalspeedinc.com/cadillac-world-thorium-fuel-concept-cadillac-wtf/ WTF?

Usually variation in potential reproductive rates creates bias in the OSR and this in turn will affect the strength of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balshine- Earn | first1 = Sigal | year = 1996 | title = Reproductive Rates, Operational Sex Ratios, and Mate choice in St. Peter's Fish | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 107–116 | doi=10.1007/s002650050272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSR is said to be biased toward a particular sex when sexually ready members of that sex are more abundant.  For example, a male-biased OSR means that there are more sexually competing males than sexually competing females.

==Some factors that affect OSR==
The operational sex ratio is affected by the length of time each sex spends in caring for young or in recovering from mating.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T. H. | last2 = Parker | first2 = G. A. | title = Potential Reproductive Rates and the Operation of Sexual Selection | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 437–456 | doi = 10.1086/417793 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if females cease mating activity to care for young, but males do not, then more males would be ready to mate, thus creating a male biased OSR. One aspect of gestation and recovery time would be clutch loss. Clutch loss is when offspring or a group of offspring is lost, due to an accident, predation, etc. This, in turn, effects how long reproductive cycles will be in both males and females. If the males were to invest more time in the care of their offspring, they would be spending less time mating. This pushes the population towards a female biased OSR and vice versa. Whether or not it is the males or females investing more care in their offspring, if they were to lose their offspring for whatever reason, this would then change the OSR to be less biased because the once occupied sex becomes available to mate again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prohl | first1 = Heike | year = 2005 | title = Clutch Loss affects the Operational Sex Ratio in the Strawberry Poison Frog Dendrobates pumilio | doi = 10.1007/s00265-005-0915-9 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 310–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As aforementioned, another major factor that influences OSR is potential rate of reproduction (PRR). Any sexual differences in the PRR will also change the OSR, so it is important to look at factors that change PRR as well.&lt;ref name= "Gwynne1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gwynne | first1 = D.T. | year = 1990 | title = Testing parental investment and the control of sexual selection: the operational sex ratio | url = | journal = Am.

For example, if males are required to provide a nutrient high gift before mating (most likely food) then when nutrients available is high, the OSR will be male biased because there is plenty of nutrients available to provide gifts. However, if nutrients is low, less males will be ready to reproduce, causing the population to have a female biased OSR.&lt;ref name="Gwynne1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gwynne | first1 = D.T. | last2 = Simmons | first2 = L.W. | year = 1990 | title = Experimental reversal of courtship roles in insects | doi = 10.1038/346172a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 364 | issue = 6280| pages = 172–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = L.W. | year = 1992 | title = Quantification of role reversal in relative parental investment in a brush cricket | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 358 | issue = 6381| pages = 61–63 | doi=10.1038/358061a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kvarnemo | first1 = C. | last2 = Simmons | first2 = L.W. | year = 1999 | title = Variance in female quality, operational sex ratio, and male mate choice in a brushcricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 45 | issue = 3–4| pages = 245–252 | doi=10.1007/s002650050559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example would be if, in a certain species, males provided care for offspring and a nest. If the availability of nesting sites decreased, we would see the population trend towards a more female biased OSR because only a small number of males actually have a nest while all the females, regardless of a nest or not, are still producing eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Almada | first1 = V.C. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1995 | title = Courting females: ecological constraints affect sex roles in a natural population of blennild fish Salaria pavo | url = | journal = Anim.

==Some factors that OSR predicts==
A major factor that OSR can predict is the opportunity for sexual selection. As the OSR becomes more biased, the sex that is in excess will tend to undergo more competition for mates and therefore undergo strong sexual selection.&lt;ref name= "Emlen1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "jstor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renolds | first1 = J.D. | year = 1996 | title = Animal breeding systems | url = | journal = Trends Ecol. Evol. | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 68–72 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)81045-7| pmid = 21237764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intensity of competition is also a factor that can be predicted by OSR.&lt;ref name="Kvarnemo1996"/&gt; According to sexual selection theory, whichever sex is more abundant is expected to compete more strongly and the sex that is less abundant is expected to be "choosier" in who they decide to mate with. It would be expected that when an OSR is more biased to one sex than the other, that one would observe more interaction and competition from the sex that is more available to mate. When the population is more female biased, more female-female competition is observed and the opposite is seen for a male population where a male biased would cause more male-male interaction and competitiveness. Though both sexes may be competing for mates, it is important to remember that the biased OSR predicts which sex is the predominant competitor (the sex that exhibits the most competition).&lt;ref name="Gwynne1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colwell1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colwell | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Oring | first2 = L.W. | year = 1988 | title = Sex ratios and intrasexual competition for mates in a sex-role reversed shore bird, Wilson's phalarope | url = | journal = Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 165–173 | doi=10.1007/bf00300566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = J.W.A | display-authors = etal   | year = 1995 | title = Operational sex ratio, mediate by synchrony of female arrival, alters the variance of male mating success in Japanese Medaka | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 367–375 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1995.9998}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSR can also predict what will happen to mate guarding in a population. As OSR becomes more biased to one sex, it can be observed that mate-guarding will increase. This is likely due to the fact that rival numbers (number of a certain sex that are also ready to mate) are increased. If a population is male biased then there are a lot more rival males to compete for a mate, meaning that those who have a mate already are more likely to guard the mate that they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weir | first1 = L.K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = The influence of operational sex ratio on the intensity of competition for mates | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 177 | issue = 2| pages = 167–176 | doi=10.1086/657918 | pmid=21460553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further examples of factors that affect OSR==
* Sex in age at maturity is another possible factor that can affect OSR. If it takes one sex longer to mature than the other, it would be expected to see a biased OSR of the sex that matured faster, most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pitnick, S. 1993. Operational sex ratio and sperm limitation of Drosophila pachea. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 33. 863-891&lt;/ref&gt;
* Migration schedules differ between sexes which eventually leads to seasonal changes in the OSR. For example, if males arrive first to the migration site, then for a certain amount of time the population would have a male biased OSR.&lt;ref name="colwell1988"/&gt;
* [[Spatial distribution]] can also cause biased in the OSR. So if there is a wide spatial distribution difference between the sexes one would see a biased in the OSR depending on what area was being observed. There might be more males than females in one location causing a male biased OSR in that particular location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kruppa | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Sih | first2 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Experimental studies on water strider mating dynamics: spatial variation in density and sex ratio | doi = 10.1007/bf00171662 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 107–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnqvist | first1 = G | year = 1992 | title = The effects of operational sex ratio on the relative mating success of extreme male phenotypes in the water strider Gerris odongaster | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 681–683 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)81028-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mortality rate|Mortality]] can also change the OSR of a population. For example, if there is a high mortality rate in males of a specific species one would most likely observe a female biased OSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iwasa | first1 = Y. | last2 = Odendaal | first2 = F.J. | year = 1984 | title = A theory on the temporal pattern of operational sex ratio | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 886–893 | doi=10.2307/1938062| jstor = 1938062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Temperature can play a large part in OSR of a population. In many reptiles, sex determination is dependent on temperature of the environment during embryonic development. Consistently warm or cool environments can result in large biases in sex ratio of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pen | first1 = Ido | last2 = Uller | first2 = Tobias | last3 = Feldmeyer | first3 = Barbara | last4 = Harts | first4 = Anna | last5 = While | first5 = Geoffrey M. | last6 = Wapstra | first6 = Erik | year = 2010 | title = Climate-driven population divergence in sex-determining systems | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7322| pages = 436–439 | doi=10.1038/nature09512 | pmid=20981009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxy-fuel welding''' (commonly called '''oxyacetylene welding''', '''oxy welding''', or '''gas welding''' in the U.S.) and '''oxy-fuel cutting ''' are processes that use fuel gases and oxygen to [[Welding|weld]] and cut metals, respectively. French engineers Edmond Fouché and Charles Picard became the first to develop oxygen-[[acetylene]] welding in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, Rodney (2004). ''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries'', p.365. John Wright &amp; Songs, Inc., New Jersey. {{ISBN|0-471-24410-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pure oxygen, instead of [[air]], is used to increase the [[Adiabatic flame|flame temperature]] to allow localized melting of the workpiece material (e.g. steel) in a room environment.

During the early 20th century, before the development and availability of coated [[shielded metal arc welding|arc welding]] electrodes in the late 1920s that were capable of making sound welds in steel, oxy-acetylene welding was the only process capable of making welds of exceptionally high quality in virtually all metals in commercial use at the time. This not only included carbon steel but also alloy steels, cast iron, aluminum, and magnesium. In recent decades it has been obsolesced in almost all industrial uses due to various [[arc welding]] methods offering greater speed and, in the case of [[gas tungsten arc welding]], the capability of welding very reactive metals such as [[titanium]]. Oxy-acetylene welding is still used for metal-based artwork and in smaller home based shops, as well as situations where accessing electricity (e.g., via an extension cord or portable generator) would present difficulties. The oxy-acetylene (and other oxy-fuel gas mixtures) welding torch remains a mainstay heat source for manual [[brazing]] and [[braze welding]], as well as metal forming, preparation, and localized heat treating. In addition, oxy-fuel cutting is still widely used, both in heavy industry as well as light industrial and repair.  











In '''oxy-fuel welding''', a welding torch is used to weld metals. Welding metal results when two pieces are heated to a temperature that produces a shared pool of molten metal.  The molten pool is generally supplied with additional metal called filler. Filler material depends upon the metals to be welded.

In '''oxy-fuel cutting''', a torch is used to heat metal to its [[kindling temperature]].  A stream of oxygen is then trained on the metal, [[burning]] it into a metal oxide that flows out of the [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] as [[slag]].&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook"&gt;The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook, Union Carbide Corp 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Torches that do not mix fuel with oxygen (combining, instead, atmospheric air) are not considered oxy-fuel torches and can typically be identified by a single tank (oxy-fuel cutting requires two isolated supplies, fuel and oxygen). Most metals cannot be melted with a single-tank torch. Consequently, single-tank torches are typically suitable for [[soldering]] and [[brazing]] but not for welding.

==Uses==
Oxy-fuel torches are or have been used for:

*Welding metal: see below
*Cutting metal: see below.
*Heating metal: in automotive and other industries for the purposes of loosening seized fasteners. 
*Depositing metal to build up a surface, as in [[hardfacing]].
*Also, oxy-hydrogen flames are used:
**in stone working for "flaming" where the stone is heated and a top layer crackles and breaks. A steel circular brush is attached to an angle grinder and used to remove the first layer leaving behind a bumpy surface similar to hammered bronze.
**in the glass industry for "fire polishing".
**in jewelry production for "water welding" using a water torch (an oxyhydrogen torch whose gas supply is generated immediately by electrolysis of water).
**in automotive repair, removing a seized [[screw|bolt]].
**formerly, to heat lumps of [[quicklime]] to obtain a bright white light called [[limelight]], in theatres or optical ("magic") lanterns.
**formerly, in [[platinum]] works, as platinum is fusible only in the oxyhydrogen flame{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} and in an electric furnace.

In short, oxy-fuel equipment is quite versatile, not only because it is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding but also because it lends itself to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), rust or scale removal, the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and is a ubiquitous means of cutting ferrous metals.

==Apparatus==
The apparatus used in gas welding consists basically of an oxygen source and a fuel gas source (usually contained in [[gas cylinder|cylinder]]s), two [[pressure]] regulators and two flexible hoses (one for each cylinder), and a torch. This sort of torch can also be used for [[solder]]ing and [[brazing]]. The cylinders are often carried in a special wheeled [[cart|trolley]].

There have been examples of [[oxyhydrogen]] cutting sets with small ([[Diving cylinder|scuba]]-sized) gas cylinders worn on the user's back in a [[backpack]] harness, for [[rescue]] work and similar.

There are also examples of pressurized liquid fuel cutting torches, usually using gasoline. These are used for their increased portability.

===Regulator===
{{Main|Pressure regulator}}

The regulator ensures that pressure of the gas from the tanks matches the required pressure in the hose. The flow rate is then adjusted by the operator using [[needle valve]]s on the torch. Accurate flow control with a needle valve relies on a constant inlet pressure.

Most regulators have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases gas from the cylinder at a constant intermediate pressure, despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This is similar to the [[Diving regulator#First stage|first stage of a scuba-diving regulator]]. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the intermediate pressure to the low outlet pressure. The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.

Some simpler or cheaper oxygen-fuel regulators have only a single stage regulator, or only a single gauge. A single-stage regulator will tend to allow a reduction in outlet pressure as the cylinder is emptied, requiring manual readjustment. For low-volume users, this is an acceptable simplification. Welding regulators, unlike simpler LPG heating regulators, retain their outlet (hose) pressure gauge and do not rely on the calibration of the adjustment knob. The cheaper single-stage regulators may sometimes omit the cylinder contents gauge, or replace the accurate dial gauge with a cheaper and less precise "rising button" gauge.

===Gas hoses===
The hoses are designed for use in welding and cutting metal. A double-hose or twinned design can be used, meaning that the oxygen and fuel hoses are joined together. If separate hoses are used, they should be clipped together at intervals approximately {{convert|3|ft|0}} apart, although that is not recommended for cutting applications, because beads of molten metal given off by the process can become lodged between the hoses where they are held together, and burn through, releasing the pressurised gas inside, which in the case of fuel gas usually ignites.

The hoses are color-coded for visual identification. The color of the hoses varies between countries. In the [[United States]], the oxygen hose is green, and the fuel hose is red.&lt;ref name="sweethaven"/&gt; In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and other countries, the oxygen hose is blue (black hoses may still be found on old equipment), and the acetylene (fuel) hose is red.&lt;ref name="HSE, INDG297, equipment" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Safety in gas welding, cutting and similar processes

  |format=pdf
  |ref=HSE, INDG297
  |page=5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; If [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) fuel, such as [[propane]], is used, the fuel hose should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG. LPG will damage an incompatible hose, including most acetylene hoses.

The threaded connectors on the hoses are handed to avoid accidental mis-connection: the thread on the oxygen hose is right-handed (as normal), while the fuel gas hose has a left-handed thread.&lt;ref name="sweethaven"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423002452/http://64.78.42.182/sweethaven/BldgConst/Welding/lessonmain.asp?lesNum=4&amp;modNum=1|title=Fundamentals of Professional Welding|author=|date=23 April 2008|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left-handed threads also have an identifying groove cut into their nuts.

Gas-tight connections between the flexible hoses and rigid fittings are made by using crimped [[hose clip]]s or [[ferrule]]s, often referred to as 'O' clips, over barbed spigots. The use of worm-drive hose clips or [[Jubilee Clip|Jubilee clips]] is specifically forbidden in the UK and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portable Oxy-Fuel Gas Equipment|url=https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/13089/faq_oxy_aceylene_equipment.pdf|publisher=WorkSafe Victoria|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; acetylene's explosive decomposition behaviour makes this irrelevant. If a detonation wave enters the acetylene tank, the tank will be blown apart by the decomposition. Ordinary check valves that normally prevent back flow cannot stop a detonation wave because they are not capable of closing before the wave passes around the gate. For that reason a flashback arrestor is needed. It is designed to operate before the detonation wave makes it from the hose side to the supply side.

Between the regulator and hose, and ideally between hose and torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a [[flashback arrestor]] and/or non-return valve (check valve) should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode.

European practice is to fit flashback arrestors at the regulator and check valves at the torch. US practice is to fit both at the regulator.

The flashback arrestor (not to be confused with a check valve) prevents [[shock wave]]s from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the flashback arrestor, it will remain switched off until someone resets it.

====Check valve====
A check valve lets gas flow in one direction only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes the ball out of the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.

===Torch===
The torch is the tool that the welder holds and manipulates to make the weld. It has a connection and valve for the fuel gas and a connection and valve for the oxygen, a handle for the welder to grasp, and a mixing chamber (set at an angle) where the fuel gas and oxygen mix, with a tip where the flame forms. Two basic types of torches are positive pressure type and low pressure or injector type.

[[File:Types of gas torch head.jpg|thumb|The top torch is a welding torch and the bottom is a cutting torch]]

====Welding torch====
A welding torch head is used to weld metals. It can be identified by having only one or two pipes running to the nozzle, no oxygen-blast trigger, and two valve knobs at the bottom of the handle letting the operator adjust the oxygen and fuel flow respectively.

====Cutting torch====
A cutting torch head is used to cut materials. It is similar to a welding torch, but can be identified by the oxygen blast trigger or lever.

When cutting, the metal is first heated by the flame until it is cherry red. Once this temperature is attained, oxygen is supplied to the heated parts by pressing the oxygen-blast trigger. This oxygen reacts with the metal, forming iron oxide and producing heat. It is the heat that continues the cutting process. The cutting torch only heats the metal to start the process; further heat is provided by the burning metal.

The melting point of the iron oxide is around half that of the metal being cut. As the metal burns, it immediately turns to liquid iron oxide and flows away from the cutting zone. However, some of the iron oxide remains on the workpiece, forming a hard "slag" which can be removed by gentle tapping and/or grinding.

====Rose bud torch====
A rose bud torch is used to heat metals for bending, straightening, etc. where a large area needs to be heated.  It is so-called because the flame at the end looks like a [[rose bud]].  A welding torch can also be used to heat small areas such as rusted nuts and bolts.

====Injector torch====
A typical oxy-fuel torch, called an equal-pressure torch, merely mixes the two gases. In an injector torch, high-pressure oxygen comes out of a small nozzle inside the torch head which drags the fuel gas along with it, using the [[venturi effect]].

==Fuels==
Oxy-fuel processes may use a variety of fuel gases, the most common being [[acetylene]]. Other gases that may be used are [[propylene]], [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG), propane, [[natural gas]], [[hydrogen]], and [[MAPP gas]]. Many brands use different kinds of gases in their mixes.

===Acetylene===
[[File:Laskarbit.jpg|thumb|200px|Acetylene generator as used in Bali by a reaction of [[calcium carbide]] with water. This is used where acetylene cylinders are not available. The term 'Las Karbit' means acetylene (carbide) welding in Indonesian.]]
{{See also|Acetylene}}

Acetylene is the primary fuel for oxy-fuel welding and is the fuel of choice for repair work and general cutting and welding. Acetylene gas is shipped in special cylinders designed to keep the gas dissolved.  The cylinders are packed with porous materials (e.g. [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] fibre, [[diatomaceous earth]], or (formerly) [[asbestos]]), then filled to around 50% capacity with [[acetone]], as acetylene is soluble in acetone. This method is necessary because above 207 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (30 [[pound-force per square inch|lbf/in²]]) (absolute pressure) acetylene is [[instability|unstable]] and may [[explosion|explode]].

There is about 1700 [[kPa]] (250 psi) pressure in the tank when full. Acetylene when combined with [[oxygen]] burns at 3200 [[Celsius|°C]] to 3500&amp;nbsp;°C (5800&amp;nbsp;°F to 6300 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]), highest among commonly used gaseous fuels. As a fuel acetylene's primary disadvantage, in comparison to other fuels, is high cost.

As acetylene is unstable at a pressure roughly equivalent to 33 feet/10 meters underwater, water submerged cutting and welding is reserved for hydrogen rather than acetylene.

[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|right|Compressed gas cylinders containing oxygen and MAPP gas.]]

===Gasoline===
Oxy-[[gasoline]], also known as oxy-petrol, torches have been found to perform very well, especially where bottled gas fuel is not available or difficult to transport to the worksite. Tests showed that an oxy-gasoline torch can cut steel plate up to {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick at the same rate as oxy-acetylene. In plate thicknesses greater than {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} the cutting rate was better than oxy-acetylene; at {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} it was three times faster.&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/ITSR/DND/Oxy-Gasoline_Torch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The gasoline is fed either from a pressurised tank (whose pressure can be hand-pumped or fed from a gas cylinder).&lt;ref name="doe"/&gt; OR from a non pressurised tank with the fuel being drawn into the torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a foot-operated air pump, and burning the fuel-air mixture in a specialized welding torch.

===Hydrogen===
{{See also|Oxyhydrogen}}

Hydrogen has a clean flame and is good for use on [[aluminium]]. It can be used at a higher pressure than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and cutting. It is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The flame temperature is high, about 2,000&amp;nbsp;°C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure,&lt;ref name="WT"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Discovery and Invention in the Twentieth Century |author= William Augustus Tilden|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation | isbn= 0-543-91646-4 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 2800&amp;nbsp;°C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (oxyhydrogen). Hydrogen is not used for welding steels and other ferrous materials, because it causes [[hydrogen embrittlement]].

For some oxyhydrogen torches the oxygen and hydrogen are produced by [[electrolysis]] of water in an apparatus which is connected directly to the torch. Types of this sort of torch:

* The oxygen and the hydrogen are led off the electrolysis cell separately and are fed into the two gas connections of an ordinary oxy-gas torch. This happens in the water torch, which is sometimes used in small torches used in making [[jewelry]] and [[electronics]].
* The mixed oxygen and hydrogen are drawn from the electrolysis cell and are led into a special torch designed to prevent flashback.  See oxyhydrogen.

===MPS and MAPP gas===
{{Main|Methylacetylene-propadiene gas|MAPP gas}}

''Methylacetylene-propadiene'' (MAPP) ''gas'' and ''LPG gas'' are similar fuels, because LPG gas is liquefied petroleum gas mixed with MPS. It has the storage and shipping characteristics of LPG and has a heat value a little less than acetylene. Because it can be shipped in small containers for sale at retail stores, it is used by hobbyists and large industrial companies and shipyards because it does not polymerize at high pressures&amp;nbsp;— above 15 psi or so (as acetylene does) and is therefore much less dangerous than acetylene. Further, more of it can be stored in a single place at one time, as the increased compressibility allows for more gas to be put into a tank. MAPP gas can be used at much higher pressures than acetylene, sometimes up to 40 or 50 psi in high-volume oxy-fuel cutting torches which can cut up to {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} steel. Other welding gases that develop comparable temperatures need special procedures for safe shipping and handling. MPS and MAPP are recommended for cutting applications in particular, rather than welding applications.

On 31 April 2008 the Petromont Varennes plant closed its methylacetylene/propadiene crackers. As they were the only North American plant making MAPP gas, many substitutes were introduced by the companies who had repackaged the Dow and Varennes product(s) - most of these substitutes are propylene, see below.

===Propylene and Fuel Gas===
Propylene is used in production welding and cutting. It cuts similarly to propane. When propylene is used, the torch rarely needs tip cleaning. There is often a substantial advantage to cutting with an injector torch (see the [[#Butane, propane and butane/propane mixes|propane]] section) rather than an equal-pressure torch when using propylene.  Quite a few North American suppliers have begun selling propylene under proprietary trademarks such as FG2 and Fuel-Max.

===Butane, propane and butane/propane mixes===
[[Butane]], like [[propane]], is a saturated hydrocarbon.  Butane and propane do not react with each other and are regularly mixed.  Butane boils at 0.6&amp;nbsp;°C. Propane is more volatile, with a boiling point of -42&amp;nbsp;°C. Vaporization is rapid at temperatures above the boiling points. The calorific (heat) values of both are almost equal. Both are thus mixed to attain the vapor pressure that is required by the end user and depending on the ambient conditions. If the ambient temperature is very low, propane is preferred to achieve higher vapor pressure at the given temperature.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Propane does not burn as hot as acetylene in its inner cone, and so it is rarely used for welding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Jeffus | 1997 | p=742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propane, however, has a very high number of BTUs per cubic foot in its outer cone, and so with the right torch ([[#Injector torch|injector style]]) can make a faster and cleaner cut than acetylene, and is much more useful for heating and bending than acetylene.

The maximum neutral flame temperature of propane in oxygen is {{convert|2822|C}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Propane is cheaper than acetylene and easier to transport.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==The role of oxygen==
Oxygen is not the fuel. It is what chemically combines with the fuel to produce the heat for welding. This is called 'oxidation', but the more specific and more commonly used term in this context is 'combustion'. In the case of hydrogen, the product of combustion is simply water. For the other hydrocarbon fuels, water and carbon dioxide are produced. The heat is released because the molecules of the products of combustion have a lower energy state than the molecules of the fuel and oxygen. In oxy-fuel cutting, oxidation of the metal being cut (typically iron) produces nearly all of the heat required to "burn" through the workpiece.

Oxygen is usually produced elsewhere by [[distillation]] of liquefied air and shipped to the welding site in high-pressure vessels (commonly called "tanks" or "cylinders") at a pressure of about 21,000 kPa (3,000&amp;nbsp;lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres). It is also shipped as a liquid in [[Dewar flask|Dewar]] type vessels (like a large [[Thermos]] jar) to places that use large amounts of oxygen. &lt;!-- No need to say here what distillation and Dewar flasks are. That is what clickable blue links are for.--&gt;

It is also possible to separate oxygen from air by passing the air, under pressure, through a [[zeolite]] sieve that selectively adsorbs the [[nitrogen]] and lets the oxygen (and [[argon]]) pass. This gives a purity of oxygen of about 93%. This method works well for brazing, but higher-purity oxygen is necessary to produce a clean, slag-free [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] when cutting.

==Types of flame==
{{main|Oxidizing and reducing flames}}
The welder can adjust the oxy-acetylene flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment is made by adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame as the starting point for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air.&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt; The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue inner cone and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The inner cone is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this inner cone is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately {{convert|6000|F|C|-2}} and provides enough heat to easily melt steel.&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt; In the inner cone the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and [[carbon monoxide]], which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn.

An excess of acetylene creates a carbonizing flame. This flame is characterized by three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a white-hot "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. This is the type of flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately {{convert|5000|F|C|-2}}. The reducing flame is typically used for [[hard facing]] operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it. The carbonizing flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a "reducing flame".&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt;

The oxidizing flame is the third possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter than the other two flames because the combustible gases will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon.&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt; It is called an oxidizing flame because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing flame creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals. In an oxidizing flame, the inner cone acquires a purplish tinge, gets pinched and smaller at the tip, and the sound of the flame gets harsh. A slightly oxidizing flame is used in braze-welding and bronze-surfacing while a more strongly oxidizing flame is used in fusion welding certain brasses and bronzes&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt;

The size of the flame can be adjusted to a limited extent by the valves on the torch and by the regulator settings, but in the main it depends on the size of the orifice in the tip. In fact, the tip should be chosen first according to the job at hand, and then the regulators set accordingly.

===Welding===
The flame is applied to the base metal and held until a small puddle of molten metal is formed. The puddle is moved along the path where the weld bead is desired. Usually, more metal is added to the puddle as it is moved along by dipping metal from a welding rod or filler rod into the molten metal puddle. The metal puddle will travel towards where the metal is the hottest. This is accomplished through torch manipulation by the welder.

The amount of heat applied to the metal is a function of the welding tip size, the speed of travel, and the welding position. The flame size is determined by the welding tip size. The proper tip size is determined by the metal thickness and the joint design.

Welding gas pressures using oxy-acetylene are set in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The welder will modify the speed of welding travel to maintain a uniform bead width. Uniformity is a quality attribute indicating good workmanship. Trained welders are taught to keep the bead the same size at the beginning of the weld as at the end. If the bead gets too wide, the welder increases the speed of welding travel. If the bead gets too narrow or if the weld puddle is lost, the welder slows down the speed of travel. Welding in the vertical or overhead positions is typically slower than welding in the flat or horizontal positions.

The welder must add the filler rod to the molten puddle. The welder must also keep the filler metal in the hot outer flame zone when not adding it to the puddle to protect filler metal from oxidation. Do not let the welding flame burn off the filler metal. The metal will not wet into the base metal and will look like a series of cold dots on the base metal. There is very little strength in a cold weld. When the filler metal is properly added to the molten puddle, the resulting weld will be stronger than the original base metal.

Welding [[lead]] or '[[lead burning]]' was much more common in the 19th century to make some pipe connections and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. H.. ''Modern methods of welding as applied to workshop practice, describing various methods: oxy-acetylene welding, electric seam welding ... eye protection in welding operations [etc.''] .... New York: D. Van Nostrand Company, 1922. Print. Chapter 2 Lead Burning, 6-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In building construction today some lead [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until [[Metal inert gas welding|MIG welding]] became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.

===Cutting===
For cutting, the setup is a little different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with orifices placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame makes it possible to change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance.&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt; Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.

The flame is not intended to melt the metal, but to bring it to its [[ignition temperature]].

The torch's trigger blows extra oxygen at higher pressures down the torch's third tube out of the central jet into the workpiece, causing the metal to burn and blowing the resulting molten oxide through to the other side. The ideal kerf is a narrow gap with a sharp edge on either side of the workpiece; overheating the workpiece and thus melting through it causes a rounded edge.

[[File:OxygenRichBlowTorchFlame.jpg|thumb|Oxygen Rich Butane Torch Flame]]
[[File:FuelRichBlowTorchFlame.jpg|thumb|Fuel Rich Butane Torch Flame]]
[[File:Railway-cutting-2-a.jpg|thumb|Cutting a rail just before renewing the rails and the ballast.]]

Cutting is initiated by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) of the steel to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry red heat) using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting oxygen valve to release the oxygen from the central jet.&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt; The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten [[iron oxide]], producing the cut. Initiating a cut in the middle of a workpiece is known as piercing.

It is worth noting several things at this point:
*The oxygen flowrate is critical; too little will make a slow ragged cut, while too much will waste oxygen and produce a wide concave cut. Oxygen lances and other custom made torches do not have a separate pressure control for the cutting oxygen, so the cutting oxygen pressure must be controlled using the oxygen regulator. The oxygen cutting pressure should match the cutting tip oxygen orifice. Consult the tip manufacturer's equipment data for the proper cutting oxygen pressures for the specific cutting tip.&lt;ref name="The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook" /&gt;
*The oxidation of iron by this method is highly exothermic. Once it has started, steel can be cut at a surprising rate, far faster than if it were merely melted through. At this point, the pre-heat jets are there purely for assistance. The rise in temperature will be obvious by the intense glare from the ejected material, even through proper goggles. (''A [[thermic lance]] is a tool that also uses rapid oxidation of iron to cut through almost any material.'')
*Since the melted metal flows out of the workpiece, there must be room on the opposite side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for oxyacetylene blowtorches and welding torches, by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.

For a basic oxy-acetylene rig, the cutting speed in light steel section will usually be nearly twice as fast as a [[petrol]]-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a [[cut-off grinder]] is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term [[vibration white finger]]. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200&amp;nbsp;mm (8&amp;nbsp;inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;mm (8&amp;nbsp;inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.

Robotic oxy-fuel cutters sometimes use a high-speed divergent nozzle. This uses an oxygen jet that opens slightly along its passage. This allows the compressed oxygen to expand as it leaves, forming a high-velocity jet that spreads less than a parallel-bore nozzle, allowing a cleaner cut. These are not used for cutting by hand since they need very accurate positioning above the work. Their ability to produce almost any shape from large steel plates gives them a secure future in [[shipbuilding]] and in many other industries.

Oxy-propane torches are usually used for cutting up scrap to save money, as [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] is far cheaper [[joule]] for joule than acetylene, although propane does not produce acetylene's very neat cut profile. Propane also finds a place in production, for cutting very large sections.

Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium-[[carbon steel]]s and [[wrought iron]]. High-carbon steels are difficult to cut because the melting point of the slag is closer to the melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the cut. This keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of [[cast iron]], graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. Stainless steels cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1916|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:Oxygas welding station.jpg|thumb|Oxygas welding station (keep cylinders and hoses away from the flame)]]
[[File:Blowtorching goggles and helmet.jpg|thumb|Gas welding/cutting goggles and safety helmet]]

Oxyacetylene welding/cutting is not difficult, but there are a good number of subtle safety points that should be learned such as:

*More than 1/7 the capacity of the cylinder should not be used per hour. This causes the acetone inside the acetylene cylinder to come out of the cylinder and contaminate the hose and possibly the torch.
*Acetylene is dangerous above 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (15 psi) pressure. It is unstable and explosively decomposes.
* Proper ventilation when welding will help to avoid large chemical exposure.

===The importance of eye protection===
Proper protection such as [[welding goggles]] should be worn at all times, including to protect the eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder and to provide a clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. [[Didymium]] eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=White |first=Kent |title=Authentic Aluminum Gas Welding: The Method Revived |publisher=TM Technologies |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel leakage===
Fuel gases that are denser than air (Propane, Propylene, MAPP, Butane, etc...), may collect in low areas if allowed to escape.  To avoid an ignition hazard, special care should be taken when using these gases over areas such as basements, sinks, storm drains, etc.  In addition, leaking fittings may catch fire during use and pose a risk to personnel as well as property.

===Safety with cylinders===
When using fuel and oxygen tanks they should be fastened securely upright to a wall or a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous for the reason that the oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000&amp;nbsp;lbf/in² = 200 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the compressed oxygen, capable of even breaking through a brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;"Air Cylinder Rocket." [[MythBusters]] Discovery Channel, October 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
For this reason, never move an oxygen tank around without its valve cap screwed in place.

On an oxyacetylene torch system there will be three types of [[valve]]s, the tank valve, the regulator valve, and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the [[tank]]s or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding.  Acetylene cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/dmm/PDF/TRAINING/REFRESHER/MaintenanceRepairTopics/AR-oxygen-acetyleneuseandsafety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical exposure===
A less obvious hazard of welding is exposure to harmful chemicals. Exposure to certain metals, metal oxides, or carbon monoxide can often lead to severe medical conditions. Damaging chemicals can be produced from the fuel, from the work-piece, or from a protective coating on the work-piece. By increasing ventilation around the welding environment, the welders will have much less exposure to harmful chemicals from any source.

The most common fuel used in welding is acetylene, which has a two-stage reaction. The primary chemical reaction involves the acetylene disassociating in the presence of oxygen to produce heat, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen gas: C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A secondary reaction follows where the carbon monoxide and hydrogen combine with more oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor. When the secondary reaction does not burn all of the reactants from the primary reaction, the welding process can produce large amounts of carbon monoxide, and it often does. Carbon monoxide is also the byproduct of many other incomplete fuel reactions.

Almost every piece of metal is an alloy of one type or another. [[Copper]], aluminium, and other base metals are occasionally alloyed with [[beryllium]], which is a highly [[poison|toxic]] metal. When a metal like this is welded or cut, high concentrations of toxic beryllium fumes are released. Long-term exposure to beryllium may result in shortness of breath, chronic cough, and significant weight loss, accompanied by fatigue and general weakness. Other alloying elements such as [[arsenic]], [[manganese]], [[silver]], and aluminium can cause sickness to those who are exposed.

More common are the anti-rust coatings on many manufactured metal components. [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]], and [[fluoride]]s are often used to protect [[iron]]s and [[steel]]s from [[oxidizing]]. [[Galvanized]] metals have a very heavy zinc coating. Exposure to [[zinc oxide]] fumes can lead to a sickness named "[[metal fume fever]]". This condition rarely lasts longer than 24 hours, but severe cases can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anvilfire|url=http://www.anvilfire.com/iForge/tutor.php?lesson=safety3/demo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not unlike common [[influenza]], fevers, chills, nausea, cough, and fatigue are common effects of high zinc oxide exposure.

==={{visible anchor|Flashback}}===
''Flashback'' is the condition of the flame propagating down the hoses of an oxy-fuel welding and cutting system. To prevent such a situation a [[flashback arrestor]] is usually employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Swift | first = P. | last2 = Murray | first2 = J. | title = FCS Welding L2 | page = 286 | publisher = Pearson South Africa | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pworXllC8OcC&amp;pg=PA286 | isbn = 978-1-77025-226-4 | ref = harv | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flame burns backwards into the hose, causing a popping or squealing noise. It can cause an explosion in the hose with the potential to injure or kill the operator. Using a lower pressure than recommended can cause a flashback.

{{Transport}}
[[File:Pipeline-small image, seen from below.jpeg|thumb|200px|An elevated section of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alaska Pipeline]].]]
'''Pipeline transport''' is the long-distance [[transportation]] of a liquid or gas through a system of [[pipe (material)|pipes]]—a pipeline—typically to a market area for consumption. The latest data from 2014 gives a total of slightly less than {{convert|2,175,000|mi|km}} of pipeline in 120 countries of the world.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2117.html |title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency |website=www.cia.gov |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had 65%, Russia had 8%, and Canada had 3%, thus 75% of all pipeline were in these three countries.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

''Pipeline and Gas Journal'''s worldwide survey figures indicate that {{convert|118,623|mi|km}} of pipelines are planned and under construction. Of these, {{convert|88,976|mi|km}} represent projects in the planning and design phase; {{convert|29,647|mi|km}} reflect pipelines in various stages of construction. Liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pipeline101.com/why-do-we-need-pipelines/what-do-pipelines-transport | title=Pipeline transport | accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum, [[fuel]]s – such as oil, natural gas and biofuels – and other fluids including [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]], [[beer]], hot water or [[steam]] for shorter distances. Pipelines are useful for transporting water for [[drinking water|drinking]] or [[irrigation]] over long distances when it needs to move over [[hill]]s, or where [[canal]]s or [[channel (geography)|channels]] are poor choices due to considerations of [[evaporation]], [[pollution]], or environmental impact. 

Oil pipelines are made from [[steel]] or [[plastic]] tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by [[pump]] stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurised into liquids known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Natural gas pipelines are constructed of [[carbon steel]]. [[Hydrogen pipeline transport]] is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe. Pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material, such as natural gas or oil, pose special safety concerns and there have been various [[List of pipeline accidents|accidents]]. Pipelines can be the target of [[gasoline theft#Theft from pipelines|theft]], [[vandalism]], [[sabotage]], or even [[terrorist attack]]s. In war, pipelines are often the target of military attacks.

It is uncertain when the first [[crude oil]] pipeline was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Jonathan|title=How the Oil Pipeline Began|url=http://nautil.us/issue/50/emergence/how-the-oil-pipeline-began|accessdate=6 July 2017|work=[[Nautilus (science magazine)]]|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed,{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} with competing claims for [[Vladimir Shukhov]] and the [[Branobel]] company in the late 19th century, and the Oil Transport Association, which first constructed a {{convert|2|in|mm|sing=on}} wrought iron pipeline over a {{convert|6|mi|km|sing=on}} track from an oil field in Pennsylvania to a railroad station in [[Oil Creek State Park#History|Oil Creek]], in the 1860s. Pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil, [[refined oil products]] or [[natural gas]] over land. For example, in 2014, pipeline transport of crude oil cost about $5 per barrel, while rail transport cost about $10 to $15 per barrel.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; Trucking has even higher costs due to the additional labor required; employment on completed pipelines represents only "1% of that of the trucking industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cepac.cheme.cmu.edu/pasi2008/slides/cerda/library/slides/jcerda-pasi-2008-1page.pdf |format=PDF |title=Oil Pipeline Logistics |publisher=Cepac.cheme.cmu.edu |accessdate=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, 70% of crude oil and petroleum products are shipped by pipeline. (23% are by ship, 4% by truck, and 3% by rail)  In Canada for natural gas and petroleum products, 97% are shipped by pipeline.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;

Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Small NGL processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of {{convert|125|psi|kPa}}, can be shipped by rail, truck or pipeline. Propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch. EG: Propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure, 100 psi, give or take depending on temperature, and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than {{convert|125|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} at retail stations. Pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at {{convert|250|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.

The distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter, as thousands of [[natural-gas processing]] plants are located in or near oil fields. Many [[Bakken Basin]] oil companies in North Dakota, Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan gas fields separate the NGLs in the field, allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers, eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane.

The most recent major pipeline to start operating in North America, is a TransCanada natural gas line going north across the Niagara region bridges with Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources, into the Canadian province of Ontario as of the fall of 2012, supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in Ontario.

[[File:Major russian gas pipelines to europe.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Major Russian gas pipelines to Europe in 2009]]
This new US-supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to Ontario from western Canada in Alberta and Manitoba, thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer.  To avoid delays and US government regulation, many small, medium and large oil producers in North Dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to Canada to meet up with a Canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east. This allows the Bakken Basin and Three Forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the US. The distance from the biggest oil patch in North Dakota, in [[Williston, North Dakota]], is only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the Canada–US border and [[Manitoba]]. [[Mutual fund]]s and [[joint venture]]s are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines. In the fall of 2012, the US began exporting [[propane]] to Europe, known as LPG, as wholesale prices there are much higher than in North America. Additionally, a pipeline is currently being constructed from North Dakota to Illinois, commonly known as the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]].

As more North American pipelines are built, even more exports of LNG, propane, butane, and other natural gas products occur on all three US coasts. To give insight, North Dakota Bakken region's oil production has grown by 600% from 2007 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/dpr-full.pdf|title=Drilling Productivity Report|last=|first=|date=November 2017|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price, and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery. However, pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume.

Enbridge in Canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west (Line 9) and expanding it and using it to ship western Canadian bitumen oil eastward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wednesday, January 28, 2015 3:58 PM EST |url=https://www.thestar.com/projects/pipeline_journey.html |title=Line 9: Journey along the pipeline &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline, it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day. It will bring western oil to refineries in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Quebec and New York by early 2014. New Brunswick will also refine some of this western Canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to Europe from its deep water oil ULCC loading port.

Although pipelines can be built under the sea, that process is economically and technically demanding, so the majority of oil at sea is transported by [[tanker (ship)|tanker ships]]. Similarly, it is often more economically feasible to transport natural gas in the form of LNG, however the break-even point between LNG and pipelines would depend on the volume of natural gas and the distance it travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ulvestad|first1= Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title= Natural gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877_Natural_gas_and_CO2_price_variation_Impact_on_the_relative_cost-efficiency_of_LNG_and_pipelines|journal="International Journal of Environmental Studies"|volume=69|issue=3|pages=407-426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enbridge [[Sandpiper pipeline]] is proposed to transfer valuable oil from Western North Dakota through northwestern Minnesota. The pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter. It will carry over 300,000 barrels of oil a day with a volatility of 32.&lt;ref name="sandpiper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honorearth.org/enbridge_sandpiper_pipeline |title=Enbridge Sandpiper Pipeline |publisher=Honorearth.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222133526/http://www.honorearth.org/enbridge_sandpiper_pipeline |archive-date=2015-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of market===
[[File:Gasoducto junto a la B-145, Chile, 2016-02-09, DD 36.JPG|thumb|Gas pipe in the dry region of Antofagasta, Chile.]]
The market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous
growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008. After faltering in 2009, demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1977 "Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline Construction in the U.S.: Market Research Report]," November 2012, IBISWorld.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, almost 32,000 miles of North American pipeline were being planned or under construction.&lt;ref name="pipelineandgasjournal.com"&gt;[http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/2012-worldwide-pipeline-construction-report "2012 Worldwide Pipeline Construction Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325081749/http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/2012-worldwide-pipeline-construction-report |date=2013-03-25 }}," ''Pipeline and Gas Journal'' '''239''' (1). January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. When pipelines are constrained, additional pipeline product transportation options may include the use of [[drag reducing agents]], or by transporting product via truck or rail.

===Construction and operation===
Oil pipelines are made from [[steel]] or [[plastic]] tubes with inner diameter typically from {{convert|4|to|48|in}}. Most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about {{convert|3|to|6|ft}}. To protect pipes from [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], and [[corrosion]], a variety of methods are used. These can include [[wood lagging]] (wood slats), [[concrete]] coating, rockshield, [[high-density polyethylene]], imported sand padding, and padding machines.&lt;ref name="asme"&gt;{{cite book

Crude oil contains varying amounts of [[paraffin wax]] and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline. Often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using [[pigging]], the practice of using devices known as "pigs" to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline. The devices are also known as "scrapers" or "Go-devils". "Smart pigs" (also known as "intelligent" or "intelligence" pigs) are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents, metal loss caused by corrosion, cracking or other mechanical damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/go-devil go-devil – definition of go-devil] by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; These devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream, either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line.

For natural gas, pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from {{convert|2|to|60|in}} in diameter, depending on the type of pipeline. The gas is pressurized by [[compressor station]]s and is odorless unless mixed with a [[thiol|mercaptan odorant]] where required by a regulating authority.

==Ammonia==
[[File:Ammiakoprovod NS.jpg|thumb|The world's longest ammonia pipeline from Russia to [[Ukraine]]]]
Highly toxic [[ammonia]] is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} However, incidents on ammonia-transporting lines are uncommon – unlike on industrial ammonia-processing equipment.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} A major ammonia pipeline is the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ''Transammiak'' line connecting the [[TogliattiAzot]] facility in Russia to the exporting [[Black Sea]]-port of [[Odessa]].

==Alcohol fuels==

==Coal and ore==
[[Slurry pipeline]]s are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines. The material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline; at the far end, the material must be dried.
One example is a {{convert|525|km|adj=on}} slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the [[Minas-Rio]] mine (producing 26.5 million tonnes per year) to the [[Superporto do Açu|Port of Açu]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/project-profile/en/Minas-Rio-Minas-Rio|accessdate=2010-12-12|title=Project Profiles, Minas-Rio|date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An existing example is the {{convert|85|km|adj=on}} Savage River Slurry pipeline in [[Tasmania]], Australia, possibly the world's first when it was built in 1967. It includes a {{convert|366|m|adj=on}} bridge span at {{convert|167|m}} above the Savage River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pipeliner.com.au/news/the_savage_river_slurry_pipeline/054155/|accessdate=2011-05-07|title=The Savage River Slurry Pipeline – The Australian Pipeliner|date=January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518235759/http://pipeliner.com.au/news/the_savage_river_slurry_pipeline/054155/|archivedate=2011-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highestbridges.com/wiki/index.php?title=Savage_River_Pipeline_Bridge|title=Savage River Pipeline Bridge – Highestbridges.com|accessdate=2011-05-07|date=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen==
{{Main|Hydrogen pipeline transport}}
[[Hydrogen pipeline transport]] is a transportation of hydrogen through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]] as part of the [[hydrogen infrastructure]]. Hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of [[hydrogen production]] or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand, with transport costs similar to [[compressed natural gas|CNG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leightyfoundation.org/files/WHEC16-Lyon/WHEC16-Ref022.pdf|format=PDF|title=Compressorless Hydrogen Transmission Pipelines|publisher=Leightyfoundation.org|accessdate=2015-05-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210131141/http://www.leightyfoundation.org/files/WHEC16-Lyon/WHEC16-Ref022.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the technology is proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/hpwgw_airprod_remp.pdf|format=PDF|title=DOE Hydrogen Pipeline Working Group Workshop|publisher=Eere.energy.gov|accessdate=2015-05-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191048/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/hpwgw_airprod_remp.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[hydrogen]] is produced at the place of demand with every 50 to {{convert|100|mi|km}} an industrial production facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogenforecast.com/ArticleDetails.php?articleID=250] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604012854/http://www.hydrogenforecast.com/ArticleDetails.php?articleID=250 |date=June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1938 [[Rhine-Ruhr]] {{convert|240|km|adj=on}} hydrogen pipeline is still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storhy.net/train-in/PDF-TI/03_StorHy-Train-IN-Session-1_3_JToepler.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Technological Steps of Hydrogen Introduction|page=24|publisher=Storhy.net|accessdate=2015-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029214321/http://www.storhy.net/train-in/PDF-TI/03_StorHy-Train-IN-Session-1_3_JToepler.pdf|archive-date=2008-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2004}}, there are {{convert|900|mi|km}} of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the US and {{convert|930|mi|km}} in Europe.

==Water==
{{seealso|Aqueduct (watercourse)|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:LA Aqueduct Antelope Valley.jpg|thumb|The [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in [[Antelope Valley]].]]
Two millennia ago, the [[Roman Empire|ancient Romans]] made use of large [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed [[gravity]] to push the water along until it reached its destination. Hundreds of these were built throughout Europe and elsewhere, and along with [[flour mill]]s were considered the lifeline of the Roman Empire. The [[history of China|ancient Chinese]] also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works. The famous [[Han Dynasty]] court [[eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Zhang Rang]] (d. 189&amp;nbsp;AD) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet [[chain pump]]s outside the capital city of [[Luoyang]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 33"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; These chain pumps serviced the imperial [[palace]]s and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a [[stoneware]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] system.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 345 346"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 345–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipelines are useful for transporting water for [[drinking water|drinking]] or [[irrigation]] over long distances when it needs to move over [[hill]]s, or where [[canal]]s or [[channel (geography)|channels]] are poor choices due to considerations of [[evaporation]], [[pollution]], or environmental impact.

The {{convert|530|km|miles|abbr=on}} [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]] in [[Western Australia]] using 750&amp;nbsp;mm (30&amp;nbsp;inch) pipe and completed in 1903 was the largest water supply scheme of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040174b.htm Mephan Ferguson] Australian Dictionary of Biography(online version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1489302.htm The Forrest family] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817224729/http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1489302.htm |date=2016-08-17 }} ''Dynasties'', ABC.

There are two [[Los Angeles, California]] aqueducts, the ''[[Owens Valley aqueduct]]'' (completed 1913) and the ''[[Los Angeles aqueduct#Second Los Angeles Aqueduct|Second Los Angeles Aqueduct]]'' (completed 1970) which also include extensive use of pipelines.

===District heating===

{{Main|District heating}}District heating or ''teleheating'' systems consist of a network of [[insulated pipe|insulated]] feed and return pipes which transport heated water, [[pressurized hot water]], or sometimes [[steam]] to the customer. While steam is hottest and may be used in [[industrial process]]es due to its higher temperature, it is less [[thermal efficiency|efficient]] to produce and transport due to greater heat losses. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons. The typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in Norway's district heating network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nve.no/global/energi/analyser/energi%20i%20norge%20folder/energy%20in%20norway%202009%20edition.pdf|title = Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate|format = PDF|date = |accessdate = 2011-09-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144652/http://www.nve.no/global/energi/analyser/energi%20i%20norge%20folder/energy%20in%20norway%202009%20edition.pdf|archivedate = 2011-09-28|df =}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

District heating pipelines are normally installed underground, with some exceptions. Within the system, [[thermal energy storage|heat storage]] may be installed to even out peak load demands. Heat is transferred into the [[central heating]] of the dwellings through [[heat exchanger]]s at [[district heating substation|heat substations]], without mixing of the fluids in either system.

===Beer===
[[File:Thor pipeline.jpg|thumb|alt=Thor Pipeline in Randers, Denmark|Thor Pipeline in [[Randers]], Denmark]]
Bars in the [[Veltins-Arena]], a major [[football (soccer)|football]] ground in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany, are interconnected by a {{convert|5|km|adj=on}} long beer pipeline. In [[Randers]] city in Denmark, the so-called Thor Beer pipeline was operated. Originally, copper pipes ran directly from the brewery, but when the brewery moved out of the city in the 1990s, Thor Beer replaced it with a giant tank.

A three-kilometer beer pipeline was completed in [[Bruges]], Belgium in September 2016 to reduce truck traffic on the city streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2016/09/15/bruges-beer-pipeline-becomes-reality|title=Bruges' Beer Pipeline Becomes Reality|date=September 15, 2016|language=English|accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brine===
The village of [[Hallstatt]] in Austria, which is known for its long history of [[salt mine|salt mining]], claims to contain "the oldest industrial pipeline in the world", dating back to 1595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html |title=Hallstatt's White Gold – Salt |accessdate=2007-05-15 |author=Billie Ann Lopez |work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210142713/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html |archivedate = 2007-02-10 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed from 13,000 hollowed-out tree [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] to transport [[brine]] {{convert|40|km}} from Hallstatt to [[Ebensee]].&lt;ref&gt;See the article [[Hallstatt]] for details and references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1978 and 1994, a 15&amp;nbsp;km milk pipeline ran between the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] island of [[Ameland]] and [[Holwerd]] on the mainland, of which 8&amp;nbsp;km beneath the [[Wadden Sea]]. Every day, 30.000 litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland. In 1994, the milk transport was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digibron.nl/search/detail/012df08e8a4ffc97d1a4d1a1/amelandse-melk-niet-meer-door-wkddenzeepijp Amelandse melk niet meer door Waddenzeepijp], Reformatorisch Dagblad 20 January 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine pipelines==
{{Main|Submarine pipeline}}
In places, a pipeline may have to cross water expanses, such as small seas, straits and rivers.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.2"&gt;Palmer &amp; King, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, they lie entirely on the seabed. These pipelines are referred to as "marine" pipelines (also, "submarine" or "offshore" pipelines). They are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.2"/&gt; In offshore projects, a distinction is made between a "flowline" and a pipeline.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;KingP.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"&gt;Dean, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP.24"&gt;Bai &amp; Bai, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The former is an ''intrafield'' pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea [[wellhead]]s, manifolds and the [[oil platform|platform]] ''within'' a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an "export pipeline", is used to bring the resource to shore.&lt;ref name="DeanP.338"/&gt; The construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland, mainly because of wave and current dynamics, along with other [[geohazard]]s.

==Functions==
In general, pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose:

;Gathering pipelines: Group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility. In this group, pipelines are usually short- a couple hundred metres- and with small diameters. Sub-sea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems.
;Transportation pipelines: Mainly long pipes with large diameters, moving products (oil, gas, refined products) between cities, countries and even continents. These transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multi-products pipelines.
;Distribution pipelines: Composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters, used to take the products to the final consumer. Feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream. Pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups.

==Development and planning==
When a pipeline is built, the construction project not only covers the [[civil engineering]] work to lay the pipeline and build the pump/compressor stations, it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation.

The pipeline is routed along what is known as a "right of way". Pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages:

# Open season to determine market interest: Potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipeline's capacity rights.
# Route (right of way) selection
# Pipeline design: The pipeline project may take a number of forms, including the construction of a new pipeline, conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another, or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route.
# Obtaining approval: Once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity, the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies.
# Surveying the route
# Clearing the route
# Trenching – Main Route and Crossings (roads, rail, other pipes, etc.)
# Installing the pipe
# Installing valves, intersections, etc.
# Covering the pipe and trench
# Testing: Once construction is completed, the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity. These may include hydrostatic testing and line packing.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/develop.html "Natural Gas Pipeline Development and Expansion]," U.S. Energy Information Administration, Retrieved December 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia has "Pipeline Troops" as part of the [[Rear Services]], who are trained to build and repair pipelines. Russia is the only country to have Pipeline Troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://de.rian.ru/politics/20120116/262467833.html |title=Russlands Militär übt für möglichen US-Angriff auf Iran |publisher=Ria Novosti |language=de |accessdate=17 January 2012 |date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Field devices are instrumentation, data gathering units and communication systems. The field [[instrumentation]] includes flow, pressure, and temperature gauges/transmitters, and other devices to measure the relevant data required. These instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations, such as injection or delivery stations, pump stations (liquid pipelines) or compressor stations (gas pipelines), and block valve stations.

The information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local [[remote terminal unit]]s (RTU) that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems, such as satellite channels, microwave links, or cellular phone connections.

Pipelines are controlled and operated remotely, from what is usually known as the "Main Control Room". In this center, all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database. The data is received from multiple RTUs along the pipeline. It is common to find RTUs installed at every station along the pipeline.
[[File:Pipeline-Scada.jpg|thumb|500px|The SCADA System for pipelines.]]

The [[SCADA]] system at the Main Control Room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or [[SCADA#Human Machine Interface|Human Machine Interface]], showing the operational conditions of the pipeline. The operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line, as well as send operational commands (open/close valves, turn on/off compressors or pumps, change setpoints, etc.) through the SCADA system to the field.

To optimize and secure the operation of these assets, some pipeline companies are using what is called "Advanced Pipeline Applications", which are software tools installed on top of the SCADA system, that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection, leak location, batch tracking (liquid lines), pig tracking, composition tracking, predictive modeling, look ahead modeling, and operator training.

==Technology==

===Components===
[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline crossing a ridge by Tanana River.jpg|thumb|right|The Trans Alaska Pipeline crossing under the [[Tanana River]] and over ridge of the [[Alaska Range]]]]
Pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location. The main elements of a pipeline system are:

;Initial injection station: Known also as "supply" or "inlet" station, is the beginning of the system, where the product is injected into the line. Storage facilities, pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations.

;Compressor/pump stations: [[Pump]]s for liquid pipelines and [[compressors]] for gas pipelines, are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline. The location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain, the type of product being transported, or operational conditions of the network.

;Partial delivery station: Known also as "intermediate stations", these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported.

;Block valve station: These are the first line of protection for pipelines. With these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak. Block valve stations are usually located every 20 to {{convert|30|mi|km}}, depending on the type of pipeline. Even though it is not a design rule, it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines. The location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported, the trajectory of the pipeline and/or the operational conditions of the line.

;Regulator station: This is a special type of valve station, where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line. Regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak.

;Final delivery station: Known also as "outlet" stations or terminals, this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer. It could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines.

===Leak detection systems===
Since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country, it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets, and the population and environment where these pipelines run.

Pipeline companies face government regulation, environmental constraints and social situations. Government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation, operator training requirements, pipeline facilities, technology and applications required to ensure operational safety. For example, in the State of Washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less. Social factors also affect the operation of pipelines. Product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies. In this case, the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow, with a high expectation for location accuracy.

Various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines, from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance. The most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is Computational Pipeline Monitoring or CPM. CPM takes information from the field related to pressures, flows, and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported. Once the estimation is completed, the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation, which may be related to a leak.

The [[American Petroleum Institute]] has published several articles related to the performance of CPM in liquids pipelines. The API Publications are:
*RAM 1130 – Computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines
*API 1149 – Pipeline variable uncertainties &amp; their effects on leak detectability

Where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway, it is usually enclosed in a protective casing. This casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances, and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks. The ''casing vent'', a pipe protruding from the ground, often doubles as a warning marker called a ''casing vent marker''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.consolenergy.com/natural-gas-amp-coal/natural-gas/pipeline-safety.aspx Pipeline Safety] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101537/http://www.consolenergy.com/natural-gas-amp-coal/natural-gas/pipeline-safety.aspx |date=2015-05-18 }}'', CONSOL Energy, accessed 2015-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Pipelines are generally laid underground because temperature is less variable. Because pipelines are usually metal, this helps to reduce the expansion and shrinkage that can occur with weather changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oil and Gas Pipelines|last=Saxon|first=Carina|publisher=Gale|year=2016|isbn=9781410317513|location=|pages=636-639.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a [[pipeline bridge]]. Pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead. Pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as Trans-Alaska-Pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground.

==Maintenance==
Maintenance of pipelines includes checking [[cathodic protection]] levels for the proper range, surveillance for construction, erosion, or leaks by foot, land vehicle, boat, or air, and running cleaning pigs, when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive.

US pipeline maintenance rules are covered in [[Code of Federal Regulations]](CFR) sections, 49 CFR 192 for natural gas pipelines, and 49 CFR 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines.

==Regulation==
[[File:BlendonWoodsPipeline.JPG|thumb|right|An underground petroleum pipeline running through a park]]
In the US, onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] (PHMSA). Certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada–US border, by the [[National Energy Board]] (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from [[corrosion]]. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline [[Industrial coating|coating]] in conjunction with [[cathodic protection]] and technology to monitor the pipeline. Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only external protection.

==Pipelines and geopolitics==
Pipelines for major energy resources (petroleum and natural gas) are not merely an element of trade. They connect to issues of [[geopolitics]] and [[international security]] as well, and the construction, placement, and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in [[Sovereign state|state]] interests and actions. A notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009, wherein [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|a dispute]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]] ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis. Russian state-owned gas company [[Gazprom]] cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine after talks between it and the Ukrainian government fell through. In addition to cutting off supplies to Ukraine, Russian gas flowing through Ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to [[Southeastern Europe]] and some supplies to [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]—was cut off, creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on Russian gas as fuel. Russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers, and particularly the [[European Union]], from interfering in its "[[near abroad]]".

Oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]].

==Hazard identification==
&lt;!-- Hazard identification is the proper wording in risk assessment --&gt;
Because the [[solvent]] fraction of [[dilbit]] typically comprises [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] [[aromatics]] like [[naptha]] and [[benzene]], reasonably rapid carrier [[vaporization]] can be expected to follow an above-ground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a [[viscous]] residue that is slow to migrate. Effective protocols to minimize exposure to [[petrochemical]] vapours are well-established, and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the [[aquifer]] unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier (e.g. a series of torrential downpours).

The introduction of [[benzene]] and other volatile organic compounds (collectively [[BTEX]]) to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak. Particularly if followed by rain, a pipeline breach would result in BTEX [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[chemical equilibrium|equilibration]] of benzene in water, followed by [[percolation]] of the admixture into the aquifer. Benzene can cause many [[benzene#Health effects|health problems]] and is [[carcinogenic]] with EPA [[Maximum Contaminant Level]] (MCL) set at 5 μg/L for [[potable water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Basic Information about Benzene in Drinking Water|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/benzene.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not well studied, single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calabrese|first=EJ|author2=Blain, RB |title=The single exposure carcinogen database: assessing the circumstances under which a single exposure to a carcinogen can cause cancer|journal=Toxicological Sciences|year=1999|volume=50|issue=2|pages=169–85|doi=10.1093/toxsci/50.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the exposure of livestock, mainly cattle, to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues, such as [[neurotoxicity]], fetal damage and fatal poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pattanayek, M.|author2=DeShields, B.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Characterizing Risks to Livestock from Petroleum Hydrocarbons|url=http://ipec.utulsa.edu/Conf2003/Papers/pattanayek_deshields_29.pdf|publisher=Blasland, Bouck, and Lee, Inc.|accessdate=2011-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425161929/http://ipec.utulsa.edu/Conf2003/Papers/pattanayek_deshields_29.pdf|archive-date=2012-04-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach. Pooled petroleum is unambiguous, readily spotted, and indicates the location of required repairs. Because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment, gaps between [[sensors]], and data that requires interpretation, small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected

Pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks. Buried pipes draw fewer complaints. They are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] from extremes in [[ambient temperature|ambient]] temperature, they are shielded from [[ultraviolet rays]], and they are less exposed to [[photodegradation]]. Buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris, [[electrical storms]], [[tornadoes]], [[hurricanes]], [[hail]], and [[acid rain]]. They are protected from nesting birds, [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] mammals, and stray buckshot. Buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage (e.g. [[automobile accidents|automobile collisions]]) and less accessible to [[vandals]], [[saboteurs]], and [[terrorists]].

==Exposure==
Previous work&lt;ref name="stansbury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stansbury|first=John|title=Analysis of Frequency, Magnitude and Consequence of Worst-Case Spills From the Proposed Keystone XL Pipeline|url=http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117101558/http://watercenter.unl.edu/downloads/2011-Worst-case-Keystone-spills-report.pdf|archivedate=2015-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that a 'worst-case exposure scenario' can be limited to a specific set of conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off [[standard operating procedure|SOP]] developed by TransCanada, the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely.&lt;ref name="potential"&gt;{{cite web|last=US State Dept|title=Potential Releases From Project Construction and Operation and Environmental Consequence Analysis|url=http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/clientsite/keystonexl.nsf/19_KXL_FEIS_Sec_3.13_Potential_Releases.pdf?OpenFileResource|accessdate=2 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the [[detection limit|limit of detection]] and go unnoticed for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=stansbury/&gt; Leak detection is monitored through a [[SCADA]] system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (&lt;1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive spill.&lt;ref name=potential/&gt; Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or [[olfactory]] inspection, aerial surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies.&lt;ref name=potential/&gt; It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval, however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection. Benzene typically makes up 0.1 – 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and dissolution based on environmental factors.

Even with pipeline leak volumes within SCADA detection limits, sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions, or other problems. The [[Enbridge]] Line 6B [[Enbridge oil spill|crude oil pipeline failure]] in [[Marshall, Michigan]] on July 25, 2010 was thought by operators in Edmonton to be from column separation of the [[dilbit]] in that pipeline. The leak in wetlands along the Kalamazoo River was only confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in Michigan.

===Spill frequency-volume===
Although the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] (PHMSA) has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills, TransCanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design, operation, and safety.&lt;ref name="potential"/&gt; Whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates.&lt;ref name="stansbury"/&gt; Given that the pipeline crosses 247 miles of the Ogallala Aquifer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US State Dept|title=Environmental Analysis: Water Resources|url=http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/clientsite/keystonexl.nsf/09_KXL_FEIS_Sec_3.3_Water_Resources.pdf?OpenFileResource|accessdate=2 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 14.5% of the entire pipeline length, and the 50-year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11 – 91 spills,&lt;ref name="stansbury"/&gt; approximately 1.6 – 13.2 spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer. An estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer, each lasting 14 days, results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline.
In the reduced-scope worst-case exposure scenario, the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5% of max flow-rate for 14 days has been estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil.&lt;ref name="stansbury"/&gt; According to PHMSA's incident database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PHMSA|title=Incident Statistics|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library/data-stats/incidents|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 0.5% of all spills in the last 10 years were &gt;10,000 barrels.

===Benzene fate and transport===
[[File:Benzene Transport to Groundwater from Oil Spill.pdf|thumb|300px|Scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater]]
Benzene is considered a light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] with high solubility and high volatility.{{Clarify|reason = Benzene has a solubility of 1.79 g/L in water at 15 °C. Is this considered high?|date = August 2014}} It is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene, so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil (1% weight by volume) would not volatilize before equilibrating with water.&lt;ref name="stansbury"/&gt;
Using the octanol-water partition coefficient and a 100-year precipitation event for the area, a worst-case estimate of 75&amp;nbsp;mg/L of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer.&lt;ref name="stansbury"/&gt; The actual movement of the [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] through [[groundwater]] systems is not well described, although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the Ogallala Aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the MCL.&lt;ref name="stansbury"/&gt; The Final Environmental Impact Statement from the State Department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize.&lt;ref name="potential"/&gt;

===Previous dilbit spill remediation difficulties===
One of the major concerns about [[dilbit]] is the difficulty in cleaning it up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=12-P13-00027&amp;segmentID=1 "Kalamazoo River Spill Yields Record Fine"], ''[[Living on Earth]]'', July 6, 2012. Lisa Song, a reporter for Inside Climate News, interviewed by Bruce Gellerman. Retrieved 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Enbridge's Line 6B, a 30-inch crude oil pipeline, ruptured in Marshall, Michigan on July 25, 2010, mentioned above, spilled at least 843,000 gallons of dilbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2012/PAR1201.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928113319/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2012/PAR1201.pdf |date=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After detection of the leak, booms and vacuum trucks were deployed. Heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams, and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained. Remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the Kalamazoo River system. However, oil was still being found in affected waters in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/enbridgespill/ "More Work Needed to Clean up Enbridge Oil Spill in Kalamazoo River"], US EPA, October 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers and environmental impacts==

===Compared to other modes===
Fossil fuels can be transported by pipeline, rail, truck, or ship, though natural gas requires compression or liquification to make vehicle transport economical. For transport of crude oil via these four modes, various reports rank pipelines as proportionately causing less human death and property damage than rail and truck, spilling less oil than truck, and having more environmental impact than truck or rail (mostly due to impact on habitat; ship transport impacts marine habitat to a large degree).&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/04/26/pick-your-poison-for-crude-pipeline-rail-truck-or-boat/ |title=Pick Your Poison For Crude -- Pipeline, Rail, Truck Or Boat |author=James Conca |date=26 April 2014 |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
{{Main list|List of pipeline accidents}}

Pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material, such as natural gas or oil, pose special safety concerns.
*1965 – A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from [[stress corrosion cracking]] failure on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. This accident, and others of the era, led then-President Lyndon B. Johnson to call for the formation of a national pipeline safety agency in 1967. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/louisiana/53/natchitoches-la-gas-pipeline-explosion-mar-1965|title=Natchitoches, LA Gas Pipeline Explosion, Mar 1965|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jiJLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aCMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6968,2455002&amp;dq=gas+line+blast&amp;hl=en|title= Google News Archive Search|publisher=The Press-Courier|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 16, 1976 – A gasoline pipeline was ruptured by a road construction crew in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Gasoline sprayed across the area, and soon ignited, killing 9, and injuring at least 14 others. Confusion over the depth of the pipeline in the construction area seemed to be a factor in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter| recipient = Mr. C. D.

*June 4, 1989 – The [[Ufa train disaster]]: Sparks from two passing trains detonated gas leaking from a [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] pipeline near [[Ufa]], Russia. At least 575 people were reported killed.
*October 17, 1998 – [[1998 Jesse pipeline explosion]]: A [[petroleum]] pipeline exploded at Jesse on the [[Oil Rivers|Niger Delta]] in [[Nigeria]], killing about 1,200 villagers, some of whom were scavenging [[gasoline]].
*June 10, 1999 – A pipeline rupture in a [[Bellingham, Washington]] park led to the release of 277,200 gallons of gasoline. The gasoline was ignited, causing an explosion that killed two children and one adult. Misoperation of the pipeline and a previously damaged section of the pipe that was not detected before were identified as causing the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2002/PAR0202.pdf|title=Pipeline Accident Report: Pipeline Rupture and Subsequent Fire in Bellingham, Washington, June 10, 1999|last=|first=|date=2002|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|issue=|doi=|location=Washington, DC|volume=|pmid=|access-date=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031053056/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2002/PAR0202.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*August 19, 2000 – A natural gas pipeline rupture and fire near [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]]; this explosion and fire killed 12 members of an extended family. The cause was due to severe internal corrosion of the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2003/PAR0301.pdf|title=Pipeline Accident Report: Natural Gas Pipeline Rupture and Fire Near Carlsbad, New Mexico, August 19, 2000|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|issue=|doi=|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=|pmid=|access-date=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101102741/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2003/PAR0301.pdf|archive-date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 30, 2004 – A major [[natural gas]] pipeline exploded in [[Ghislenghien]], Belgium near [[Ath]] (thirty kilometres southwest of [[Brussels]]), killing at least 24 people and leaving 132 wounded, some critically.
*May 12, 2006 – An oil pipeline ruptured outside [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]. Up to 200 people may have been killed. See [[Nigeria oil blast]].
*November 1, 2007 – A propane pipeline exploded near Carmichael, Mississippi, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. Two people were killed instantly and an additional four were injured. Several homes were destroyed and sixty families were displaced. The pipeline is owned by Enterprise Products Partners LP, and runs from [[Mont Belvieu, Texas]], to [[Apex, North Carolina]]. Inability to find flaws in pre-1971 ERW seam welded pipe flaws was a contributing factor to the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/10946761.html|title=Clarke County Explosion Kills Two, Destroys Homes|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2009/PAR0901.pdf|title=Pipeline Accident Report: Rupture of Hazardous Liquid Pipeline With Release and Ignition of Propane, Carmichael, Mississippi, November 1, 2007|last=|first=|date=2009|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|issue=|doi=|location=Washington, DC|volume=|pmid=|access-date=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028062315/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2009/PAR0901.pdf|archive-date=28 October 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pothead.JPG|thumb|A three phase electric circuit terminated with a pothead]]
[[File:PotheadXarms.JPG|thumb|Crossarms with two three phase electric circuits terminated with  potheads]]

A '''pothead''' is a type of insulated electrical terminal used for transitioning between overhead line and underground [[high voltage cable]] or for connecting overhead wiring to equipment like [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Herman|first1= Stephen L. |title= Electrical Wiring: Industrial |url= https://books.google.com/?id=5Q_zbmDE-kQC&amp;dq=electrical+pothead |edition= 14th |year=2011 |publisher= Cengage Learning |isbn=1-111-12489-2 |page= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the process of [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] or encapsulation of the conductors inside the terminal's insulating [[Bushing (electrical)|bushing]].

==Description==
Potheads are used where higher voltage power lines go underground, generally voltages of 600 volts or greater. They are used mostly for [[service drop]]s for commercial and industrial buildings.   For lower voltages such as those used for residential service drops, another weather seal called a [[weatherhead]] is used.

The device consists of a molded plastic housing that attaches to the end of an [[electrical conduit]] that carries the underground cables up the utility pole to the crossarm.  Multiple [[bushing (electrical)|bushing]] [[electrical insulator|insulators]] project from the plastic body, each ending at an electrical terminal.  Each overhead wire is connected to a bushing terminal from which the current passes through a rod down the center of the bushing to the interior of the housing, where it is connected to a wire from the conduit.  Thus the device allows the overhead conductors to pass into the conduit while serving as a seal to keep out water.   The purpose of the bushings, which have corrugations moulded into their surfaces, is to provide enough [[creepage distance]] along their surface to prevent leakage current from the high voltage terminal from flowing to the grounded metal conduit.

==Superseded==
Pothead was once defined in [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Std 48-1962 "Standards for Potheads."  This standard was superseded by IEEE Std 48-1975 "IEEE Standard Test Procedures and Requirements for High-Voltage Alternating-Current Cable Terminations," and "pothead" was dropped from usage.  The current standard is IEEE Std 48-2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/48-2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

What was once called a pothead is now called a "Class I High-Voltage Cable Termination," which must meet these requirements:

# Electrical stress control
# Insulation between the conductors and ground
# An environmental seal

&lt;div style="page-break-inside:avoid"&gt;
{{clear}}

==Alternatives==
Formerly, medium- and high-voltage cables (from about 2.5 kV and above) were terminated with hand-made "stress cones" composed of multiple layers of insulating tape, semi-conductive tape, and insulating putty. By tapering the layers of tape carefully, the potential gradient from the inside of the cable to free air was reduced so as not to cause [[electrical breakdown]] and tracking along the surface of the termination. Current practice for these terminations is to use a pre-molded rubber stress cone, which can be slipped over the cable end and shrunk to fit snugly around the exposed cable insulation. This saves considerable installation labor and reduces the chance of errors.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Littler(ed),  ''Electrical Systems and Equipment: Incorporating Modern Power System Practice Third Edition'', Elsevier, 2014, {{ISBN|1483287491}} page 540&lt;/ref&gt;

High voltage terminations conforming to IEEE Std 48-1990 and not requiring potting compound are illustrated below:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5521">'''Random close packing''' (RCP) is an empirical parameter used to characterize the maximum [[packing density|volume fraction]] of [[solid]] objects obtained when they are packed randomly. For example, when a solid container is filled with [[grain]], shaking the container will reduce the volume taken up by the objects, thus allowing more grain to be added to the container. In other words, shaking increases the density of packed objects. But shaking cannot increase the density indefinitely, a limit is reached, and if this is reached without obvious packing into a regular crystal lattice, this is the empirical random close-packed density.

Experiments and computer simulations have shown that the most compact way to pack hard perfect spheres randomly gives a maximum volume fraction of about 64%, i.e., approximately 64% of the volume of a container is occupied by the
spheres. It seems as if because it is not possible to precisely define 'random' in this sense it is not possible to give an exact value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torquato|first=S.|last2=Truskett|first2=T.M.|last3=Debenedetti|first3=P.G.|year=2000|title=Is Random Close Packing of Spheres Well Defined?|url=https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.2064|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=84|pages=2064|arxiv=cond-mat/0003416|via=|bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.2064T|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.2064}}&lt;/ref&gt; The random close packing value is significantly below the maximum possible [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close-packing of (equal sized) hard spheres into a regular crystalline arrangements,]] which is 74.04% -- both the [[Cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic (fcc)]] and hexagonal close packed (hcp) crystal lattices have maximum densities equal to this upper limit.

==Definition==
Random close packing does not have a precise geometric definition. It is defined statistically, and results are empirical. A container is randomly filled with objects, and then the container is shaken or tapped until the objects do not compact any further, at this point the packing state is RCP. The definition of packing fraction can be given as: "the volume taken by number of particles in a given space of volume". In other words, packing fraction defines the packing density. It has been shown that the filling fraction increases with the number of taps until the saturation density is reached.  Also, the saturation density increases as the tapping [[amplitude]] decreases. Thus RCP is the packing fraction given by the [[Limit of a function|limit]] as the tapping amplitude goes to zero, and the limit as the number of taps goes to [[infinity]].

==Effect of object shape==
The particle volume fraction at RCP depends on the objects being packed. If the objects are [[polydispersed]] then the volume fraction depends non-trivially on the size-distribution and can be arbitrarily close to 1. Still for (relatively) monodisperse objects the value for RCP depends on the object shape; for spheres it is 0.64, for [[M&amp;M's]] candy it is 0.68.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Donev | first1 = A. | last2 = Cisse | first2 = I. | last3 = Sachs | first3 = D. | last4 = Variano | first4 = E.

==Example==
Products containing loosely packed items are often labeled with this message: 'Contents May Settle During Shipping'.  
Usually during shipping, the container will be bumped numerous times, which will increase the packing density.
The message is added to assure the consumer that the container is full on a mass basis, even though the container appears slightly empty. Systems of packed particles are also used as a basic model of [[porous media]].

'''Rheometry''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ῥέος – rheos, [[Grammatical_gender#Overview|''n'']], meaning "stream") generically refers to the experimental techniques used to determine the [[rheological]] properties of materials, that is the quantitative and qualitative relationships between [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s and [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] and their derivatives.

The choice of the adequate experimental technique depends on the rheological property which has to be determined. This can be the steady shear [[viscosity]], the linear [[viscoelastic]] properties (complex viscosity respectively [[elastic modulus]]), the elongational properties, etc.

For all real materials, the measured property will be a function of the flow conditions during which it is being measured ([[shear rate]], [[frequency]], etc.) even if for some materials this dependence is vanishingly low under given conditions (see [[Newtonian fluids]]).

Rheometry is a specific concern for [[smart fluid]]s such as [[magnetorheological fluid]]s and [[electrorheological fluid]]s, as it is the primary method to quantify the useful properties of these materials{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Of non-Newtonian fluids==
The viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid is defined by a power law:&lt;ref name="infcar"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Influence of carrier fluid on the electrokinetic and rheological properties of shear thickening fluids|first1= A. |last1= Antonsik|first2= M.|last2= Gluszek|first3 = R.|last3 = Zurowski|first4 = M.|last4 = Szafran|date= June 2017|journal= Ceramics International|volume= 43|doi= 10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.092}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

::&lt;math&gt; \eta = \eta_0\dot{\gamma}^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''η'' is the viscosity after shear is applied, ''η&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the initial viscosity, ''γ'' is the shear rate, and if
*&lt;math&gt; n &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the fluid is [[shear thinning]],
*&lt;math&gt; n &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the fluid is [[dilatant|shear thickening]],
*&lt;math&gt; n = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the fluid is Newtonian.

In rheometry, shear forces are applied to [[non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian fluids]] in order to investigate their properties.

===Shear thinning fluids===
Due to the shear thinning properties of blood, [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) is used to assess the risk of [[aneurysm|aneurysms]].  Using High-Resolution solution strategies, the results when using non-Newtonian rheology were found to be negligible.&lt;ref name="nonnewt"&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Non‐Newtonian versus numerical rheology: Practical impact of shear‐thinning on the prediction of stable and unstable flows in intracranial aneurysms|first1= M. |last1= Khan|first2= D.|last2= Steinman|first3 = K.|last3 = Valen-Sendstad|date= September 2016|journal= International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering|volume= 33|doi= 10.1002/cnm.2836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sears–Haack body''' is the shape with the lowest theoretical [[wave drag]] in supersonic flow, for a given body length and given volume.  The mathematical derivation assumes small-disturbance (linearized) supersonic flow, which is governed by the [[Prandtl–Glauert transformation|Prandtl–Glauert equation]].  The derivation and shape were published independently by two separate researchers: [[Wolfgang Haack]] in 1941 and later by [[William R. Sears|William Sears]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory indicates that the wave drag scales as the square of the second derivative of the area distribution, &lt;math&gt;D_\text{wave} \sim [ S''(x)]^2&lt;/math&gt; (see full expression below), so for low wave drag it is necessary that &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt; be [[Smoothness|smooth]].  Thus, the Sears–Haack body is pointed at each end and grows smoothly to a maximum and then decreases smoothly toward the second point.

==Useful formulas==
The cross-sectional area of a Sears–Haack body is
:&lt;math&gt; S(x) = \frac {16V}{3L\pi}[4x(1-x)]^{3/2} = \pi R_\text{max}^2[4x(1-x)]^{3/2}, &lt;/math&gt;

its volume is
:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {3\pi^2}{16}R_\text{max}^2 L, &lt;/math&gt;

its radius is
:&lt;math&gt; r(x) =  R_\text{max}[4x(1-x)]^{3/4}, &lt;/math&gt;

the derivative (slope) is
:&lt;math&gt; r'(x) = 3R_\text{max}[4x(1-x)]^{-1/4} (1-2x), &lt;/math&gt;

the second derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; r''(x) = -3R_\text{max}\{[4x(1-x)]^{-5/4} (1-2x)^2 + 2[4x(1-x)]^{-1/4}\},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''x'' is the ratio of the distance from the nose to the whole body length (this is always between 0 and 1),
* ''r'' is the local radius,
* &lt;math&gt; R_\text{max} &lt;/math&gt; is the radius at its maximum (occurs at center of the shape),
* ''V'' is the volume,
* ''L'' is the length.

From [[Slender-body theory]]{{elucidate|reason=C_D_wave is not defined here or in linked article|date=July 2016}}, it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt; D_\text{wave} = - \frac {1}{4 \pi} \rho U^2 \int_0^\ell \int_0^\ell S''(x_1) S''(x_2) \ln |x_1-x_2| \mathrm{d}x_1 \mathrm{d}x_2, &lt;/math&gt;

alternatively:

:&lt;math&gt; D_\text{wave} = - \frac {1}{2 \pi} \rho U^2  \int_0^\ell  S''(x) \mathrm{d}x \int_0^x S''(x_1) \ln (x-x_1)  \mathrm{d}x_1. &lt;/math&gt;

These formulae may be combined to get the following:

:&lt;math&gt; D_\text{wave} = \frac{64 V^2}{\pi L^4} \rho U^2 = \frac {9\pi^3R_{max}^4}{4L^2}\rho U^2, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C_{D_\text{wave}} = \frac {24V} {L^3} = \frac {9\pi^2R_{max}^2}{2L^2}, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt; D_\text{wave} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[wave drag]],
* &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid,
* ''U'' is the velocity.

==Generalization by R. T. Jones==
The Sears–Haack body shape derivation is correct only in the limit of a slender body.
The theory has been generalized to slender but non-axisymmetric shapes by [[Robert Thomas Jones (engineer)|Robert T. Jones]] in NACA Report 1284.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdas.com/refs/rep1284.pdf NACA Report 1284, Theory of Wing-Body Drag at Supersonic Speeds, by Robert T. Jones, 8 July 1953]&lt;/ref&gt; In this extension, the area &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined on the Mach cone whose apex is at location &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, rather than on the &lt;math&gt;x = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt; plane as assumed by Sears and Haack.  Hence, Jones's theory makes it applicable to more complex shapes like entire supersonic aircraft.

==Area rule==
A superficially related concept is the [[Area rule|Whitcomb area rule]], which states that wave drag due to volume in transonic flow depends primarily on the distribution of total cross-sectional area, and for low wave drag this distribution must be smooth.  A common misconception is that the Sears–Haack body has the ideal area distribution according to the area rule, but this is not correct.  The [[Prandtl–Glauert transformation|Prandtl–Glauert equation]], which is the starting point in the Sears–Haack body shape derivation, is not valid in transonic flow, which is where the [[area rule]] applies.

'''Simple shear''' is a [[Deformation_(mechanics)|deformation]] in which parallel planes in a material remain parallel and maintain a constant distance, while translating relative to each other.  

== In fluid mechanics ==

In [[fluid mechanics]], '''simple shear''' is a special case of [[Deformation_(mechanics)|deformation]] where only one component of [[velocity]] vectors has a non-zero value:

:&lt;math&gt;V_x=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_y=V_z=0&lt;/math&gt;

And the [[gradient]] of velocity is constant and perpendicular to the velocity itself:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial V_x} {\partial y} = \dot \gamma &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\dot \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear rate]] and:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial V_x} {\partial x} = \frac {\partial V_x} {\partial z} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The displacement gradient tensor Γ for this deformation has only one nonzero term:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; {\dot \gamma} &amp; 0 \\  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Simple shear with the rate &lt;math&gt;\dot \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the combination of [[Strain tensor|pure shear strain]] with the rate of {{sfrac|2}}&lt;math&gt;\dot \gamma&lt;/math&gt; and [[rotation]] with the rate of {{sfrac|2}}&lt;math&gt;\dot \gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma =
\begin{matrix} \underbrace \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; {\dot \gamma} &amp; 0 \\  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
\\ \mbox{simple shear}\end{matrix} =
\begin{matrix} \underbrace \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; {\tfrac12 \dot \gamma} &amp; 0 \\  {\tfrac12 \dot \gamma} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \\ \mbox{pure shear} \end{matrix}
+ \begin{matrix} \underbrace \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; {\tfrac12 \dot \gamma} &amp; 0 \\  {- { \tfrac12 \dot \gamma}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \\ \mbox{solid rotation} \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt; 

The mathematical model representing simple shear is a [[shear mapping]] restricted to the physical limits. It is an elementary linear transformation represented by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The model may represent [[laminar flow]] velocity at varying depths of a long channel with constant cross-section. Limited shear deformation is also used in [[vibration control]], for instance [[base isolation]] of buildings for limiting earthquake damage.

== In solid mechanics ==
{{Main|Deformation (mechanics)}}
In solid mechanics, a '''simple shear''' deformation is defined as an [[Deformation (mechanics)#Plane deformation|isochoric plane deformation]] in which there are a set of line elements with a given reference orientation that do not change length and orientation during the deformation.&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogden|first=R. W.|date=1984|title=Non-Linear Elastic Deformations|publisher=Dover|ISBN=9780486696485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This deformation is differentiated from a [[pure shear]] by virtue of the presence of a rigid rotation of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endurica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pure-Shear-Nomenclature.pdf|title=Where do the Pure and Shear come from in the Pure Shear test?|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endurica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Comparing-Pure-Shear-and-Simple-Shear.pdf|title=Comparing Simple Shear and Pure Shear|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When rubber deforms under simple shear, its stress-strain behavior is approximately linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeoh|first1=O. H.|title=Characterization of elastic properties of carbon-black-filled rubber vulcanizates|journal=Rubber chemistry and technology|date=1990|volume=63|issue=5|pages=792-805|doi=10.5254/1.3538289}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rod under torsion is a practical example for a body under simple shear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roylance|first1=David|title=SHEAR AND TORSION|url=http://web.mit.edu/course/3/3.11/www/modules/torsion.pdf|website=mit.edu|publisher=MIT|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

If '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the fixed reference orientation in which line elements do not deform during the deformation and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the plane of deformation, then the deformation gradient in simple shear can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
We can also write the deformation gradient as
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}} + \gamma\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Simple shear stress–strain relation ===
[[Shear stress]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, is related to [[shear strain]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eformulae.com/engineering/strength_materials.php#pureshear|title=Strength of Materials|work=Eformulae.com|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tau = \gamma G\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, given by

&lt;math&gt; G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)} &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is [[Young's modulus]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[Poisson's ratio]].  Combining gives

&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{\gamma E}{2(1+\nu)}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Stonehenge''' is a [[prehistoric]] [[monument]] in [[Wiltshire]], England, {{convert|2|mi|sigfig=1}} west of [[Amesbury]]. It consists of a ring of [[standing stones]], with each standing stone around {{convert|13|ft}} high, {{convert|7|ft}} wide and weighing around 25 tons. The stones are set within [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthworks]] in the middle of the most dense complex of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] monuments in England, including several hundred [[Tumulus|burial mounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Stonehenge World Heritage Site Management Plan|journal=UNESCO|date=July 2008|authors=Christopher Young, Amanda Chadburn, Isabelle Bedu|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] believe it was constructed from 3000 BC to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests that the first [[bluestone]]s were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dig pinpoints Stonehenge origins |publisher=BBC|date=21 September 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7625145.stm|accessdate=22 September 2008|first=James|last=Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

One of the most famous landmarks in the [[United Kingdom]], Stonehenge is regarded as a [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Julie|last2=Selwyn|first2=Tom|title=Thinking Through Tourism|date=2010|publisher=Berg|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a legally protected [[Scheduled monument|Scheduled Ancient Monument]] since 1882 when legislation to protect historic monuments was first successfully introduced in Britain. The [[Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites|site and its surroundings]] were added to [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by [[the Crown]] and managed by [[English Heritage]]; the [[Stonehenge Landscape|surrounding land]] is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/history/ | title = History of Stonehenge | publisher = [[English Heritage]] | access-date = 7 June 2016 | quote = The monument remained in private ownership until 1918 when Cecil Chubb, a local man who had purchased Stonehenge from the Atrobus family at an auction three years previously, gave it to the nation. Thereafter, the duty to conserve the monument fell to the state, today a role performed on its behalf by English Heritage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient ceremonial landscape of great archaeological and wildlife interest|work=Stonehenge Landscape|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stonehengelandscape|accessdate=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stonehenge could have been a [[cemetery|burial ground]] from its earliest beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pitts |first=Mike |date=8 August 2008 |title=Stonehenge: one of our largest excavations draws to a close |journal=British Archaeology |issue=102 |page=13 |issn=1357-4442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another five hundred years.&lt;ref name="burial"&gt;{{cite news |first=Randolph E. |last=Schmid |title=Study: Stonehenge was a burial site for centuries |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/topstories/2008-05-29-1711958402_x.htm |agency=Associated Press |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]]'s tenth-century glossary, in which ''henge-cliff'' is given the meaning "precipice", or stone, thus the ''stanenges'' or ''Stanheng'' "not far from Salisbury" recorded by eleventh-century writers are "supported stones". [[William Stukeley]] in 1740 notes, "Pendulous rocks are now called henges in Yorkshire...I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon signifies the hanging stones."&lt;ref name="OEDhenge"&gt;{{cite book| title = Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1989|edition=2|chapter= Stonehenge; henge&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Chippindale]]'s ''Stonehenge Complete'' gives the derivation of the name ''Stonehenge'' as coming from the [[Old English language|Old English]] words ''stān'' meaning "stone", and either ''hencg'' meaning "[[hinge]]" (because the stone [[lintel]]s hinge on the upright stones) or ''hen(c)en'' meaning "[[hanging|hang]]" or "[[gallows]]" or "instrument of torture" (though elsewhere in his book, Chippindale cites the "suspended stones" etymology). Like Stonehenge's [[trilithon]]s, medieval gallows consisted of two uprights with a lintel joining them, rather than the inverted L-shape more familiar today.

The "henge" portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as [[henge]]s.&lt;ref name="OEDhenge" /&gt; Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/henges1.htm English Heritage definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116081132/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/henges1.htm |date=16 November 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; As often happens in archaeological terminology, this is a holdover from [[antiquarian]] use. Because its bank is inside its ditch, Stonehenge is not truly a henge site. 

Despite being contemporary with true [[Neolithic]] henges and [[stone circle]]s, Stonehenge is in many ways atypical—for example, at more than {{convert|24|ft|m|order=flip}} tall, its extant trilithons' lintels, held in place with [[mortise and tenon]] joints, make it unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/stonehenge/what_is_it.php| title = Stonehenge : Wiltshire England What is it?|last=Anon|work=Megalithic Europe|publisher=The Bradshaw Foundation|accessdate=6 November 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090530224959/http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/stonehenge/what_is_it.php |archivedate= 30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/06/stonehenge/alexander-text|title=If the Stones Could Speak: Searching for the Meaning of Stonehenge|last=Alexander|first=Caroline|work=National Geographic Magazine|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Stonehenge plan.jpg|thumb|Plan of Stonehenge in 2004. After Cleal ''et al.'' and Pitts. ''Italicised numbers in the text refer to the labels on this plan.'' Trilithon lintels omitted for clarity. Holes that no longer, or never, contained stones are shown as open circles. Stones visible today are shown coloured]]

[[Mike Parker Pearson]], leader of the Stonehenge Riverside Project based at [[Durrington Walls]], noted that Stonehenge appears to have been associated with burial from the earliest period of its existence:

{{quote|Stonehenge was a place of burial from its beginning to its zenith in the mid third millennium B.C. The cremation burial dating to Stonehenge's sarsen stones phase is likely just one of many from this later period of the monument's use and demonstrates that it was still very much a domain of the dead.&lt;ref name="burial" /&gt;}}

Stonehenge evolved in several construction phases spanning at least 1500 years. There is evidence of large-scale construction on and around the monument that perhaps extends the landscape's time frame to 6500 years. Dating and understanding the various phases of activity is complicated by disturbance of the natural [[chalk]] by [[periglacial]] effects and animal burrowing, poor quality early [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] records, and a lack of accurate, scientifically verified dates. The modern phasing most generally agreed to by archaeologists is detailed below. Features mentioned in the text are numbered and shown on the plan, right.

===Before the monument (from 8000 BC)===
Archaeologists have found four{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, or possibly five, large [[Mesolithic]] [[posthole]]s (one may have been a natural [[tree throw]]), which date to around 8000 BC, beneath the nearby old tourist car-park in use until 2013. These held pine posts around {{convert|0.75|m}} in diameter, which were erected and eventually rotted ''in situ''. Three of the posts (and possibly four) were in an east-west alignment which may have had [[ritual]] significance.&lt;ref&gt;Exon, 30-31; Southern, Patricia, ''The Story of Stonehenge'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4myoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP15 Ch. 2], 2012, Amberley Publishing Limited, {{ISBN|1445615878|978-1445615875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Mesolithic astronomical site in Britain is the [[Warren Field]] site in [[Aberdeenshire]], which is considered the world's oldest Lunar calendar, corrected yearly by observing the [[Winter solstice|midwinter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue34/gaffney_index.html| title =Time and a Place: A luni-solar 'time-reckoner' from 8th millennium BC Scotland|publisher=''[[Internet Archaeology]]''| author=V.

[[Salisbury Plain]] was then still wooded, but 4,000 years later, during the earlier Neolithic, people built a [[causewayed enclosure]] at [[Robin Hood's Ball]] and [[long barrow]] tombs in the surrounding landscape. In approximately 3500 BC, a [[Stonehenge Cursus]] was built {{convert|700|m|ft}} north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the trees and develop the area. A number of other previously overlooked stone or wooden structures and burial mounds may date as far back as 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=webb&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=John|title=Stone-Henge Restored with Observations on Rules of Architecture|date=1665|publisher=Tho.

===Stonehenge 1 (c. 3100 BC)===
[[File:Stonehenge phase one.jpg|thumb|Stonehenge 1. After Cleal ''et al.'']]
The first monument consisted of a circular bank and ditch [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]] made of [[Late Cretaceous]] ([[Santonian]] Age) Seaford [[Chalk]], measuring about {{convert|110|m}} in diameter, with a large entrance to the north east and a smaller one to the south. It stood in open [[grassland]] on a slightly sloping spot.&lt;ref name="field2010" /&gt; The builders placed the bones of [[deer]] and [[ox]]en in the bottom of the ditch, as well as some worked [[flint]] tools. The bones were considerably older than the antler picks used to dig the ditch, and the people who buried them had looked after them for some time prior to burial. The ditch was continuous but had been dug in sections, like the ditches of the earlier causewayed enclosures in the area. The chalk dug from the ditch was piled up to form the bank. This first stage is dated to around 3100 BC, after which the ditch began to silt up naturally. Within the outer edge of the enclosed area is a circle of 56 pits, each about a metre ({{convert|1|m|disp=output only}}) in diameter, known as the [[Aubrey holes]] after [[John Aubrey]], the seventeenth-century [[antiquarian]] who was thought to have first identified them. The pits may have contained standing timbers creating a [[timber circle]], although there is no excavated evidence of them.

A small outer bank beyond the ditch could also date to this period.

In 2013 a team of archaeologists, led by [[Mike Parker Pearson]], excavated more than 50,000 cremated bones of 63 individuals buried at Stonehenge.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | first = Maev | last = Kennedy | title = Stonehenge may have been burial site for Stone Age elite, say archaeologists | date = 9 March 2013 | publisher =Guardian News and Media Limited | url =https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/mar/09/archaeology-stonehenge-bones-burial-ground | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 11 March 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Legge | title = Stonehenge: new study suggests landmark started life as a graveyard for the 'prehistoric elite' | date = 9 March 2012 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stonehenge-new-study-suggests-landmark-started-life-as-a-graveyard-for-the-prehistoric-elite-8527686.html| work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 11 March 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remains had originally been buried individually in the Aubrey holes, exhumed during a previous excavation conducted by [[William Hawley]] in 1920, been considered unimportant by him, and subsequently re-interred together in one hole, Aubrey Hole 7, in 1935.&lt;ref name="Sheffield Uni"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Parker Pearson|title=The Stonehenge Riverside Project|publisher=Sheffield University|date=20 August 2008|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/stonehenge|accessdate=22 September 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081026122920/http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/stonehenge |archivedate= 26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical and chemical analysis of the remains has shown that the cremated were almost equally men and women, and included some children.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; As there was evidence of the underlying chalk beneath the graves being crushed by substantial weight, the team concluded that the first bluestones brought from Wales were probably used as grave markers.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] of the remains has put the date of the site 500 years earlier than previously estimated, to around 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; A 2018 study of the [[strontium]] content of the bones found that many of the individuals buried there around the time of construction had probably come from near the source of the bluestone in Wales and had not extensively lived in the area of Stonehenge before death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strontium isotope analysis on cremated human remains from Stonehenge support links with west Wales|authors=Christophe Snoeck, et al.|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=8|issue=1|pages=10790|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28969-8|date=2 August 2018|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-28969-8|pmid=30072719|pmc=6072783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stonehenge 2 (c. 3000 BC)===
Evidence of the second phase is no longer visible. The number of postholes dating to the early 3rd millennium BC suggest that some form of timber structure was built within the enclosure during this period. Further standing timbers were placed at the northeast entrance, and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance. The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes, being only around {{convert|0.4|m|in}} in diameter, and are much less regularly spaced. The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up. At least twenty-five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later, intrusive, [[cremation]] burials dating to the two centuries after the monument's inception. It seems that whatever the holes' initial function, it changed to become a funerary one during Phase 2. Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure's ditch and at other points within the monument, mostly in the eastern half. Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an [[enclosed cremation cemetery]] at this time, the earliest known cremation cemetery in the British Isles. Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch-fill. Dating evidence is provided by the late Neolithic [[grooved ware]] pottery that has been found in connection with the features from this phase.

===Stonehenge 3 I (c. 2600 BC)===
[[File:Stonehenge dagger.jpg|thumb|[[Graffiti]] on the sarsen stones include ancient [[Stone carving|carvings]] of a dagger and an axe]]

Archaeological excavation has indicated that around 2600 BC, the builders abandoned timber in favour of stone and dug two concentric arrays of holes (the [[Q and R Holes]]) in the centre of the site. These stone sockets are only partly known (hence on present evidence are sometimes described as forming 'crescents'); however, they could be the remains of a double ring. Again, there is little firm dating evidence for this phase. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan), only 43 of which can be traced today. It is generally accepted that the [[bluestone]]s (some of which are made of [[dolerite]], an igneous rock), were transported by the builders from the [[Preseli Hills]], {{convert|150|mi}} away in modern-day [[Pembrokeshire]] in Wales. Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as [[glacial erratics]] by the [[Irish Sea Glacier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Stonehenge: glacial transport of bluestones now confirmed?|publisher=University of Leicester|last=John|first=Brian|author-link=Brian John|date=26 February 2011|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/pdf-files/uploaded-to-ebulletin-2011/Bluestones%20press%20release.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no evidence of glacial deposition within southern central England.&lt;ref name="Antiquity"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker Pearson |first1=Michael |displayauthors=etal |date=December 2015 |title=Craig Rhos-y-felin: a Welsh bluestone megalith quarry for Stonehenge |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=10057092&amp;jid=AQY&amp;volumeId=89&amp;issueId=348&amp;aid=10057091&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0003598X15001775 |journal=Antiquity |volume=89 |issue=348 |pages=1331–1352 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2015.177 |access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long distance human transport theory was bolstered in 2011 by the discovery of a megalithic bluestone quarry at [[Craig Rhos-y-felin]], near [[Crymych]] in Pembrokeshire, which is the most likely place for some of the stones to have been obtained.&lt;ref name="Antiquity"/&gt; Other standing stones may well have been small [[sarsen]]s (sandstone), used later as lintels. The stones, which weighed about two tons, could have been moved by lifting and carrying them on rows of poles and rectangular frameworks of poles, as recorded in China, Japan and India. It is not known whether the stones were taken directly from their quarries to Salisbury Plain or were the result of the removal of a venerated stone circle from Preseli to Salisbury Plain to "merge two sacred centres into one, to unify two politically separate regions, or to legitimise the ancestral identity of migrants moving from one region to another".&lt;ref name="Antiquity"/&gt;  Each monolith measures around {{convert|2|m|ft}} in height, between {{convert|1|and|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and around {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} thick. What was to become known as the [[Altar stone (Stonehenge)|Altar Stone]] is almost certainly derived from the [[Senni Beds]], perhaps from {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} east of Mynydd Preseli in the Brecon Beacons.&lt;ref name="Antiquity"/&gt;

The north-eastern entrance was widened at this time, with the result that it precisely matched the direction of the [[midsummer]] sunrise and [[Winter solstice|midwinter]] sunset of the period. This phase of the monument was abandoned unfinished, however; the small standing stones were apparently removed and the Q and R holes purposefully backfilled. Even so, the monument appears to have eclipsed the site at [[Avebury]] in importance towards the end of this phase.

The [[Heelstone]], a [[Tertiary]] sandstone, may also have been erected outside the north-eastern entrance during this period. It cannot be accurately dated and may have been installed at any time during phase 3. At first it was accompanied by a second stone, which is no longer visible. Two, or possibly three, large [[portal stones]] were set up just inside the north-eastern entrance, of which only one, the fallen Slaughter Stone, {{convert|4.9|m}} long, now remains. Other features, loosely dated to phase 3, include the four [[Station Stones]], two of which stood atop mounds. The mounds are known as "[[Tumulus|barrows]]" although they do not contain burials. [[Stonehenge Avenue]], a parallel pair of ditches and banks leading {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} to the [[River Avon (Hampshire)|River Avon]], was also added. Two ditches similar to [[Heelstone Ditch]] circling the Heelstone (which was by then reduced to a single monolith) were later dug around the Station Stones.

===Stonehenge 3 II (2600 BC to 2400 BC)===
[[File:Stone Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of the central stone structure today; after Johnson 2008]]
During the next major phase of activity, 30 enormous [[Oligocene]]-[[Miocene]] sarsen stones ''(shown grey on the plan)'' were brought to the site. They may have come from a quarry around {{convert|25|mi}} north of Stonehenge on the [[Marlborough Downs]], or they may have been collected from a "litter" of sarsens on the [[chalk]] downs, closer to hand. The stones were [[Ashlar|dressed]] and fashioned with [[mortise and tenon]] joints before 30 were erected as a {{convert|33|m}} diameter circle of standing stones, with a ring of 30 lintel stones resting on top. The lintels were fitted to one another using another woodworking method, the [[tongue and groove]] joint. Each standing stone was around {{convert|4.1|m}} high, {{convert|2.1|m}} wide and weighed around 25 tons. Each had clearly been worked with the final visual effect in mind; the [[orthostat]]s widen slightly towards the top in order that their perspective remains constant when viewed from the ground, while the lintel stones curve slightly to continue the circular appearance of the earlier monument.

The inward-facing surfaces of the stones are smoother and more finely worked than the outer surfaces. The average thickness of the stones is {{convert|1.1|m}} and the average distance between them is {{convert|1|m}}. A total of 75 stones would have been needed to complete the circle (60 stones) and the trilithon horseshoe (15 stones). It was thought the ring might have been left incomplete, but an exceptionally dry summer in 2013 revealed patches of parched grass which may correspond to the location of removed sarsens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patchmarks at Stonehenge|journal=Antiquity|date=July 2013|first=Simon|last=Banton|first2=Mark|last2=Bowden |first3=Tim |last3=Daw |first4=Damian |last4=Grady |first5=Sharon |last5=Soutar|volume=88|issue=341|pages=733–739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lintel stones are each around {{convert|3.2|m}} long, {{convert|1|m}} wide and {{convert|0.8|m}} thick. The tops of the lintels are {{convert|4.9|m}} above the ground.

Within this circle stood five [[trilithon]]s of dressed [[sarsen]] stone arranged in a horseshoe shape {{convert|13.7|m}} across, with its open end facing north east. These huge stones, ten uprights and five lintels, weigh up to 50 tons each. They were linked using complex jointing. They are arranged symmetrically. The smallest pair of trilithons were around {{convert|6|m}} tall, the next pair a little higher, and the largest, single trilithon in the south west corner would have been {{convert|7.3|m}} tall. Only one upright from the Great Trilithon still stands, of which {{convert|6.7|m}} is visible and a further {{convert|2.4|m}} is below ground. The images of a 'dagger' and 14 'axeheads' have been carved on one of the sarsens, known as stone 53; further carvings of axeheads have been seen on the outer faces of stones 3, 4, and 5. The carvings are difficult to date, but are morphologically similar to late Bronze Age weapons. [[Laser scanning at Stonehenge|Early 21st-century laser scanning of the carvings]] supports this interpretation. The pair of trilithons in the north east are smallest, measuring around {{convert|6|m}} in height; the largest, which is in the south west of the horseshoe, is almost {{convert|7.5|m}} tall.

This ambitious phase has been [[carbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to between 2600 and 2400 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Age of Stonehenge|journal=Antiquity|date=September 2007|first=Mike|last=Pearson|first2=Ros |last2=Cleal |first3=Peter |last3=Marshall |first4=Stuart |last4=Needham |first5=Josh |last5=Pollard |first6=Colin |last6=Richards |first7=Clive |last7=Ruggles |first8=Alison |last8=Sheridan |first9=Julian|last9=Thomas|authorlink9=Julian Thomas |first10=Chris |last10=Tilley |first11=Kate |last11=Welham |first12=Andrew |last12=Chamberlain |first13=Carolyn |last13=Chenery |first14=Jane |last14=Evans |first15=Chris |last15=Knüsel|volume=811|issue=313|pages=617–639}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly earlier than the [[Stonehenge Archer]], discovered in the outer ditch of the monument in 1978, and the two sets of burials, known as the [[Amesbury Archer]] and the [[Boscombe Bowmen]], discovered {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} to the west. Analysis of animal teeth found {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} away at [[Durrington Walls]], thought by Parker Pearson to be the 'builders camp', suggests that, during some period between 2600 and 2400 BC, as many as 4,000 people gathered at the site for the mid-winter and mid-summer festivals; the evidence showed that the animals had been slaughtered around 9 months or 15 months after their spring birth. [[Strontium]] [[isotope analysis]] of the animal teeth showed that some had been brought from as far afield as the Scottish Highlands for the celebrations.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news | title = Stonehenge builders travelled from far, say researchers | date = 9 March 2013 | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21724084 | work = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, a large [[timber circle]] and a second avenue were constructed at [[Durrington Walls]] overlooking the [[River Avon, Hampshire|River Avon]]. The timber circle was oriented towards the rising sun on the [[midwinter solstice]], opposing the solar alignments at Stonehenge. The avenue was aligned with the setting sun on the [[summer solstice]] and led from the river to the timber circle. Evidence of huge fires on the banks of the Avon between the two avenues also suggests that both circles were linked. They were perhaps used as a procession route on the longest and shortest days of the year. Parker Pearson speculates that the wooden circle at Durrington Walls was the centre of a 'land of the living', whilst the stone circle represented a 'land of the dead', with the Avon serving as a journey between the two.&lt;ref name="M. Parker Pearson 2005. p63-67"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=M. Parker |date=2005 |title=Bronze Age Britain |pages=63–67 |isbn=978-0713488494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stonehenge 3 III (2400 BC to 2280 BC) ===
Later in the Bronze Age, although the exact details of activities during this period are still unclear, the bluestones appear to have been re-erected. They were placed within the outer sarsen circle and may have been trimmed in some way. Like the sarsens, a few have timber-working style cuts in them suggesting that, during this phase, they may have been linked with lintels and were part of a larger structure.

===Stonehenge 3 IV (2280 BC to 1930 BC)===
This phase saw further rearrangement of the bluestones. They were arranged in a circle between the two rings of sarsens and in an oval at the centre of the inner ring. Some archaeologists argue that some of these bluestones were from a second group brought from Wales. All the stones formed well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III. The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval at this time and re-erected vertically. Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work, Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors, as the newly re-installed bluestones were not well-founded and began to fall over. However, only minor changes were made after this phase.

===Stonehenge 3 V (1930 BC to 1600 BC)===
Soon afterwards, the north eastern section of the Phase 3 IV bluestone circle was removed, creating a horseshoe-shaped setting (the Bluestone Horseshoe) which mirrored the shape of the central sarsen Trilithons. This phase is contemporary with the [[Seahenge]] site in Norfolk.

===After the monument (1600 BC on)===
[[File:Stonehenge render.jpg|thumb|Computer rendering of the overall site]]
The [[Y and Z Holes]] are the last known construction at Stonehenge, built about 1600 BC, and the last usage of it was probably during the [[Iron Age]]. [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] and [[medieval]] artefacts have all been found in or around the monument but it is unknown if the monument was in continuous use throughout [[British prehistory]] and beyond, or exactly how it would have been used. Notable is the massive Iron Age [[hillfort]] [[Vespasian's Camp]] built alongside the Avenue near the Avon. A decapitated seventh century [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] man was excavated from Stonehenge in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000109.html "Skeleton unearthed at Stonehenge was decapitated"], BBC News (9 June 2000), ABCE News (13 June 2000), Fox News (14 June 2000), New Scientist (17 June 2000), Archeo News (2 July 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The site was known to scholars during the [[Middle Ages]] and since then it has been studied and adopted by numerous groups.

==Function and construction==
{{Main|Theories about Stonehenge}}
{{See also|Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge}}
Stonehenge was produced by a culture that left no written records. Many aspects of Stonehenge, such as how it was built and which purposes it was used for, remain subject to debate. A number of myths surround the stones.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2012"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57459053/stonehenge-a-monument-to-unity-new-theory-claims/ | work=CBS News | title=Stonehenge a monument to unity, new theory claims&amp;nbsp;– CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, specifically the great trilithon, the encompassing horseshoe arrangement of the five central trilithons, the heel stone, and the embanked avenue, are aligned to the sunset of the winter solstice and the opposing sunrise of the summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/stonehenge-two-explanations-121012.htm|title=Understanding Stonehenge: Two Explanations|work=DNews|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schombert|url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/stonehenge.html|title=Stonehenge revealed: Why Stones Were a "Special Place"|website=University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A natural landform at the monument's location followed this line, and may have inspired its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/08/stonehenge-ice-age-solstice-axis |last1=Alberge |first1=Dalya |title=Stonehenge was built on solstice axis, dig confirms |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavated remains of culled animal bones suggest that people may have gathered at the site for the winter rather than the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearson|url=http://blog.stonehenge-stone-circle.co.uk/2013/06/22/stonehenge-revealed-why-stones-were-a-special-place/|title=Stonehenge|date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further astronomical associations, and the precise astronomical significance of the site for its people, are a matter of speculation and debate.

There is little or no direct evidence revealing the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders. Over the years, various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used, usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise due to their massive size. However, conventional techniques, using Neolithic technology as basic as [[shear legs]], have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones of a similar size.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} How the stones could be transported by a prehistoric people without the aid of the wheel or a pulley system is not known. The most common theory of how prehistoric people moved megaliths has them creating a track of logs on which the large stones were rolled along.&lt;ref name="Author not listed 2003"&gt;{{cite news|author=Author not listed|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Stonehenge.aspx#1|title=Stonehenge|work=Gale Encyclopedia of the Unusual and Unexplained|location=US|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another megalith transport theory involves the use of a type of sleigh running on a track greased with animal fat.&lt;ref name="Author not listed 2003"/&gt; Such an experiment with a sleigh carrying a 40-ton slab of stone was successful near Stonehenge in 1995. A team of more than 100 workers managed to push and pull the slab along the {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} journey from Marlborough Downs.&lt;ref name="Author not listed 2003"/&gt; Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory or as a religious site.

More recently two major new theories have been proposed. Professor [[Geoffrey Wainwright (archaeologist)|Geoffrey Wainwright]], president of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], and [[Timothy Darvill]],  of [[Bournemouth University]], have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing—the primeval equivalent of [[Lourdes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Satter | first = Raphael | title = UK experts say Stonehenge was place of healing | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 27 September 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-22-1046484398_x.htm | accessdate = 1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves. However, they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maev Kennedy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/23/archaeology.heritage|title=The magic of Stonehenge: new dig finds clues to power of bluestones|work=Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions. A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the "Amesbury Archer" grew up near the alpine foothills of Germany; and the "Boscombe Bowmen" probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France.&lt;ref name="medit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stonehenge boy 'was from the Med'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11421593|publisher=BBC News|date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Mike Parker Pearson of [[Sheffield University]] has suggested that Stonehenge was part of a [[ritual landscape]] and was joined to Durrington Walls by their corresponding avenues and the River Avon. He suggests that the area around Durrington Walls Henge was a place of the living, whilst Stonehenge was a domain of the dead. A journey along the Avon to reach Stonehenge was part of a ritual passage from life to death, to celebrate past ancestors and the recently deceased.&lt;ref name="M. Parker Pearson 2005. p63-67"/&gt; Both explanations were first mooted in the twelfth century by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], who extolled the curative properties of the stones and was also the first to advance the idea that Stonehenge was constructed as a funerary monument. Whatever religious, mystical or spiritual elements were central to Stonehenge, its design includes a celestial observatory function, which might have allowed prediction of eclipse, solstice, equinox and other celestial events important to a contemporary religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=GS|last1=Hawkins|year=1966|title=Stonehenge Decoded|isbn=978-0880291477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other hypotheses and theories. According to a team of British researchers led by Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield, Stonehenge may have been built as a symbol of "peace and unity", indicated in part by the fact that at the time of its construction, Britain's Neolithic people were experiencing a period of cultural unification.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interview with Mike Parker Pearson|journal=Papers from the Institute of Archaeology|year=2012|first1=Thomas|last1=Williams|first2=Hana|last2=Koriech|volume=22|pages=39–47|doi=10.5334/pia.401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the Royal College of Art in London have discovered that the monument’s bluestones possess "unusual acoustic properties"&amp;nbsp;— when struck they respond with a "loud clanging noise". According to Paul Devereux, editor of the journal ''Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture'', this idea could explain why certain bluestones were hauled nearly {{convert|200|mi|km}}—a major technical accomplishment at the time. In certain ancient cultures rocks that ring out, known as [[lithophones]], were believed to contain mystic or healing powers, and Stonehenge has a history of association with rituals. The presence of these "ringing rocks" seems to support the hypothesis that Stonehenge was a "place for healing", as has been pointed out by Bournemouth University archaeologist Timothy Darvill, who consulted with the researchers. The bluestones of Stonehenge were quarried near a town in Wales called [[Maenclochog]], which means "ringing rock", where the local bluestones were used as church bells until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=RCA Research Team Uncovers Stonehenge's Sonic Secrets|url=https://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/sonic-stones/|website=rca.ac.uk|publisher=Royal College of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The [[Devil]] bought the stones from a woman in Ireland, wrapped them up, and brought them to Salisbury plain. One of the stones fell into the [[River Avon, Hampshire|Avon]], the rest were carried to the plain. The Devil then cried out, "No-one will ever find out how these stones came here!" A friar replied, "That’s what you think!", whereupon the Devil threw one of the stones at him and struck him on the heel.

====Arthurian legend====
[[File:BLEgerton3028Fol30rStonehengeCropped.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|A giant helps [[Merlin]] build Stonehenge. From a manuscript of the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'' by [[Wace]] in the [[British Library]] (Egerton 3028). Dating back to the second quarter of the 14th century, this is the oldest known depiction of Stonehenge.]]
In the twelfth century, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] included a fanciful story in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''  ("History of the Kings of Britain") that attributed the monument's construction to the wizard [[Merlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8|''Historia Regum Britanniae'', Book 8, ch. 10.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey's story spread widely, appearing in more and less elaborate form in adaptations of his work such as [[Wace]]'s Norman French ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', [[Layamon]]'s Middle English ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'', and the Welsh ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]''.

According to Geoffrey, the rocks of Stonehenge were healing rocks, called the Giant's dance, which [[Giant (mythology)|Giants]] had brought from Africa to Ireland for their healing properties. The fifth-century king [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] wished to erect a memorial to 3,000 nobles slain in battle against the Saxons and buried at Salisbury, and, at Merlin's advice, chose Stonehenge. The king sent Merlin, [[Uther Pendragon]] ([[King Arthur]]'s father), and 15,000 knights, to remove it from Ireland, where it had been constructed on [[Mount Killaraus]] by the Giants. They slew 7,000 Irish, but as the knights tried to move the rocks with ropes and force, they failed. Then Merlin, using "gear" and skill, easily dismantled the stones and sent them over to Britain, where Stonehenge was dedicated. After it had been rebuilt near Amesbury, Geoffrey further narrates how first Ambrosius Aurelianus, then Uther Pendragon, and finally [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]], were buried inside the "Giants' Ring of Stonehenge".

In another legend of Saxons and Britons, in 472, the invading king [[Hengist]] invited Brythonic warriors to a feast, but treacherously ordered his men to draw their weapons from concealment and fall upon the guests, killing 420 of them. Hengist erected the stone monument—Stonehenge—on the site to show his remorse for the deed.&lt;ref&gt;Drawing on the writings of [[Nennius]], the tale is noted in [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s ''Faerie Queene'', and given further circulation in [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Monasticon Anglicanum'' of 1655.

===Sixteenth century to present===

[[File:Stonehenge Lucas de Heere.jpg|thumb|The earliest-known realistic painting of Stonehenge, drawn on site with [[watercolour]]s by [[Lucas de Heere]] between 1573 and 1575]]

Stonehenge has changed ownership several times since [[King Henry VIII]] acquired [[Amesbury Abbey]] and its surrounding lands. In 1540 Henry gave the estate to the [[Earl of Hertford]]. It subsequently passed to [[Lord Carleton]] and then the [[Marquess of Queensberry]]. The Antrobus family of Cheshire bought the estate in 1824. During the [[First World War]] an [[aerodrome]] ([[Royal Flying Corps]] "No. 1 School of Aerial Navigation and Bomb Dropping")&lt;ref&gt;Francis Stewart Briggs, S. H. Harris, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Joysticks_and_Fiddlesticks.html?id=KyNXNQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y "Joysticks and Fiddlesticks: (the Unofficial History of a Flying Kangaroo) Or, The Flying Kangaroo"], ''Hutchinson &amp; Company Limited'', 1938. Retrieved 11 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was built on the downs just to the west of the circle and, in the dry valley at Stonehenge Bottom, a main road junction was built, along with several cottages and a cafe. The Antrobus family sold the site after their last heir was killed in the fighting in France. The auction by [[Knight Frank &amp; Rutley]] estate agents in Salisbury was held on 21 September 1915 and included "Lot 15. Stonehenge with about 30 acres, 2 rods, 37 perches [12.44&amp;nbsp;ha] of adjoining downland."&lt;ref name=Amesbury&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.this-is-amesbury.co.uk/stonehenge.html|title=The man who bought Stonehenge|last=Heffernan|first=T.H.J.|website=This is Amesbury|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625160447/http://www.this-is-amesbury.co.uk/stonehenge.html|archivedate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge with farm carts, c. 1885.jpg|left|thumb|Farm carts near the site, c. 1885]]

[[Cecil Chubb]] bought the site for £6,600 and gave it to the nation three years later. Although it has been speculated that he purchased it at the suggestion of—or even as a present for—his wife, in fact he bought it on a whim, as he believed a local man should be the new owner.&lt;ref name=Amesbury/&gt;

[[File:Stonehengea117875.jpg|thumb|[[10th Battalion, CEF]] marches past the site, winter 1914–15 ([[First World War|WW I]]); Background: Preservation work on stones, propped up by timbers]]

In the late 1920s a nationwide appeal was launched to save Stonehenge from the encroachment of the modern buildings that had begun to rise around it.&lt;ref&gt;The London Mercury Vol. XVII No. 98 1927&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928 the land around the monument had been purchased with the appeal donations, and given to the National Trust to preserve. The buildings were removed (although the roads were not), and the land returned to agriculture. More recently the land has been part of a grassland reversion scheme, returning the surrounding fields to native [[chalk grassland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonehengeconsultation.org/Stonehenge_Consultation_Booklet.pdf|title=The Future of Stonehenge: Public consultation|year=2008|publisher=English Heritage|page=2|accessdate=18 July 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111202210539/http://www.stonehengeconsultation.org/Stonehenge_Consultation_Booklet.pdf |archivedate= 2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neopaganism====

[[File:Summer Solstice Sunrise over Stonehenge 2005.jpg|thumb|Sunrise at Stonehenge on the summer [[solstice]], 21 June 2005]]

During the twentieth century, Stonehenge began to revive as a place of religious significance, this time by adherents of [[Neopagan]]ism and [[New Age]] beliefs, particularly the [[Neo-druidism|Neo-druids]]. The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] would later remark that "it was a great, and potentially uncomfortable, irony that modern Druids had arrived at Stonehenge just as archaeologists were evicting the ancient Druids from it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; The first such Neo-druidic group to make use of the megalithic monument was the [[Ancient Order of Druids]], who performed a mass initiation ceremony there in August 1905, in which they admitted 259 new members into their organisation. This assembly was largely ridiculed in the press, who mocked the fact that the Neo-druids were dressed up in costumes consisting of white robes and fake beards.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1984, Stonehenge was the site of the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]]. After the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in 1985, this use of the site was stopped for several years and ritual use of Stonehenge is now heavily restricted.&lt;ref name="MacLeodAitchison2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacLeod|first1=Nicola E.|last2=Aitchison|first2=Cara|author2-link= Cara Aitchison|last3=Shaw|first3=Stephen Joseph| title = Leisure and tourism landscapes: social and cultural geographies|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415271660|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Druids have arranged an assembling of monuments styled on Stonehenge in other parts of the world as a form of Druidist worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/26/nation/la-na-air-force-pagans-20111127 LA air force pagans] retrieved 12 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Setting and access====
[[File:Stonehenge cloudy sunset.jpg|thumb|Stonehenge at sunset]]
When Stonehenge was first opened to the public it was possible to walk among and even climb on the stones, but the stones were roped off in 1977 as a result of serious erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchaeologicalcongress.org/site/news_rece_ston.php ''Proposals for a tunnel at Stonehenge: an assessment of the alternatives''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515200510/https://www.worldarchaeologicalcongress.org/site/news_rece_ston.php |date=15 May 2008 }}. ''The World Archaeological Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are no longer permitted to touch the stones, but are able to walk around the monument from a short distance away. English Heritage does, however, permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox. Additionally, visitors can make special bookings to access the stones throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.877 ''Planning Your Visit to Stonehenge'']. ''English Heritage''&lt;/ref&gt;

The access situation and the proximity of the two roads has drawn widespread criticism, highlighted by a 2006 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] survey. In the survey of conditions at 94 leading World Heritage Sites, 400 conservation and tourism experts ranked Stonehenge 75th in the list of destinations, declaring it to be "in moderate trouble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/troubled-stonehenge-lacks-magic-422736.html|title = Troubled Stonehenge 'lacks magic'|work=The Independent|location=UK|accessdate=11 April 2009|first=Cahal|last=Milmo|date=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As motorised traffic increased, the setting of the monument began to be affected by the proximity of the two roads on either side—the [[A344 road (England)|A344]] to [[Shrewton]] on the north side, and the [[A303]] to [[Winterbourne Stoke]] to the south. Plans to upgrade the A303 and close the A344 to restore the vista from the stones have been considered since the monument became a World Heritage Site. However, the controversy surrounding expensive re-routing of the roads has led to the scheme being cancelled on multiple occasions. On 6 December 2007, it was announced that extensive plans to build [[Stonehenge road tunnel]] under the landscape and create a permanent visitors' centre had been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071206/debtext/71206-0003.htm#07120645000002 ''A303 Stonehenge Road Scheme''] [[Hansard]] report of proceedings in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] 6 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge visitors centre.png|thumb|The visitors centre at Stonehenge]]
On 13 May 2009, the government gave approval for a £25&amp;nbsp;million scheme to create a smaller visitors' centre and close the A344, although this was dependent on funding and local authority planning consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/8047968.stm|title=Stonehenge Centre gets Go-Ahead|date=13 May 2009|work=BBC News  |quote=|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 2010 Wiltshire Council granted planning permission for a centre {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=in|order=flip}} to the west and English Heritage confirmed that funds to build it would be available, supported by a £10m grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stonehenge development saved by lottery’s £10m|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=19 November 2010|work=The Guardian|location=UK|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 June 2013 the A344 was closed to begin the work of removing the section of road and replacing it with grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=24 June 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-23026522|title=Stonehenge permanent road closure work begins|location=UK|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=End in sight after ‘decades of dithering’ as Government steps in to help secure future for Stonehenge|publisher=[[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]]|date=4 April 2011|url=http://www.dcms.gov.uk/news/media_releases/8019.aspx|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre, designed by [[Denton Corker Marshall]], opened to the public on 18 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stonehenge Visitor Centre by Denton Corker Marshall opens tomorrow|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2013/12/17/stonehenge-visitor-centre-by-denton-corker-marshall-opens-tomorrow/|work=dezeen|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stonehenge Roundtable Access====
[[File:Stonehenge84.jpg|thumb|Dancing inside the stones, 1984 [[Stonehenge Free Festival]]]]
The earlier rituals were complemented by the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]], loosely organised by the [[Politantric Circle]], held between 1972 and 1984, during which time the number of midsummer visitors had risen to around 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rivers|first1=Julian|title=The Law of Organized Religions: Between Establishment and Secularism|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1985 the site was closed to festivalgoers by a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] injunction.&lt;ref name="Hallett 2014"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-27405147 |title=The battle scars of Stonehenge |last=Hallett |first=Emma |date=2014-06-20 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-08-02 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the end of the festival in 1985 was the violent confrontation between the police and [[New Age travellers]] that became known as the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] when police blockaded a convoy of travellers to prevent them from approaching Stonehenge. Beginning in 1985, the year of the Battle, no access was allowed into the stones at Stonehenge for any religious reason. This "exclusion-zone" policy continued for almost fifteen years: until just before the arrival of the twenty-first century, visitors were not allowed to go into the stones at times of religious significance, the [[Winter solstice|winter]] and [[Summer solstice|summer]] [[solstice]]s, and the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hallett |first=Emma |title=Summer solstice: How the Stonehenge battles faded |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27405147 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |work=BBC News |date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following a [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruling obtained by campaigners such as [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]], the restrictions were lifted.&lt;ref name="Hallett 2014" /&gt; The ruling recognizes that members of any genuine religion have a right to worship in their own church, and Stonehenge is a place of [[worship]]  to [[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druids]], [[paganism|Pagans]] and other "Earth based' or 'old' religions.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  The Roundtable meetings include members of the [[Wiltshire]] Police force, [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[English Heritage]], [[paganism|Pagans]], [[Druids]], [[Spiritualists]] and others.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

At the Summer Solstice 2003, which fell over a weekend, over 30,000 people attended a gathering at and in the stones. The 2004 gathering was smaller (around 21,000 people).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====1600–1900====
Throughout recorded history, Stonehenge and its surrounding monuments have attracted attention from [[antiquarians]] and [[archaeologists]]. [[John Aubrey]] was one of the first to examine the site with a scientific eye in 1666, and in his plan of the monument, he recorded the pits that now bear his name, the [[Aubrey holes]]. [[William Stukeley]] continued Aubrey’s work in the early eighteenth century, but took an interest in the surrounding monuments as well, identifying (somewhat incorrectly) the Cursus and the Avenue. He also began the excavation of many of the barrows in the area, and it was his interpretation of the landscape that associated it with the [[Druids]].&lt;ref&gt;Stukeley, William, 1740, ''Stonehenge A Temple Restor'd to the British Druids''. London&lt;/ref&gt; Stukeley was so fascinated with Druids that he originally named [[Disc barrow|Disc Barrows]] as Druids' Barrows. The most accurate early plan of Stonehenge was that made by Bath architect [[John Wood, the Elder|John Wood]] in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John, 1747, ''Choir Guare, Vulgarly called Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain''. Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; His original annotated survey has recently been computer redrawn and published.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Anthony 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Anthony |date=2008 |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0500051559}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}} Importantly Wood’s plan was made before the collapse of the southwest trilithon, which fell in 1797 and was restored in 1958.

[[William Cunnington]] was the next to tackle the area in the early nineteenth century. He excavated some 24 barrows before digging in and around the stones and discovered charred wood, animal bones, pottery and urns. He also identified the hole in which the Slaughter Stone once stood. [[Richard Colt Hoare]] supported Cunnington's work and excavated some 379 barrows on [[Salisbury Plain]] including on some 200 in the area around the Stones, some excavated in conjunction with [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]]. To alert future diggers to their work they were careful to leave initialled metal tokens in each barrow they opened. Cunnington's finds are displayed at the [[Wiltshire Museum]]. In 1877 [[Charles Darwin]] dabbled in archaeology at the stones, experimenting with the rate at which remains sink into the earth for his book ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms]]''.

[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877]]

[[File:Stone Henge 1920 restoration - newspaperphoto.jpg|thumb|A contemporary newspaper depiction of the 1920 restoration]]

====1900–2000====
[[William Gowland]] oversaw the first major restoration of the monument in 1901 which involved the straightening and concrete setting of sarsen stone number 56 which was in danger of falling. In straightening the stone he moved it about half a metre from its original position.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Anthony 2008"/&gt; Gowland also took the opportunity to further excavate the monument in what was the most scientific dig to date, revealing more about the erection of the stones than the previous 100 years of work had done. During the 1920 restoration [[William Hawley]], who had excavated nearby [[Old Sarum]], excavated the base of six stones and the outer ditch. He also located a bottle of [[port wine|port]] in the Slaughter Stone socket left by Cunnington, helped to rediscover Aubrey's pits inside the bank and located the concentric circular holes outside the Sarsen Circle called the [[Y and Z Holes]].&lt;ref name="SiiL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleal|first=Rosamund|title=Y and Z holes|work=Archaeometry and Stonehenge|publisher=English Heritage|year=1995|url= http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/stoneh/yz.htm|accessdate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228211449/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/stoneh/yz.htm |archivedate= 28 February 2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]], [[Stuart Piggott]] and [[J.F.S. Stone|John F.S. Stone]] re-excavated much of Hawley's work in the 1940s and 1950s, and discovered the carved axes and daggers on the Sarsen Stones. Atkinson's work was instrumental in furthering the understanding of the three major phases of the monument's construction.

In 1958 the stones were restored again, when three of the standing sarsens were re-erected and set in concrete bases. The last restoration was carried out in 1963 after stone 23 of the Sarsen Circle fell over. It was again re-erected, and the opportunity was taken to concrete three more stones. Later archaeologists, including [[Christopher Chippindale]] of the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge]] and Brian Edwards of the [[University of the West of England]], campaigned to give the public more knowledge of the various restorations and in 2004 English Heritage included pictures of the work in progress in its book ''Stonehenge: A History in Photographs''.&lt;ref name="emmayoung"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Young|first=Emma|title=Concrete Evidence|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|issue=9 January 2001|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn310-concrete-evidence.html|id=|accessdate=3 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923160924/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn310-concrete-evidence.html|archivedate=23 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taverner|first=Roger|title=How they rebuilt Stonehenge|work=[[Western Daily Press]], ''quoted in'' Cosmic Conspiracies: How they rebuilt Stonehenge|date=8 January 2001|url=http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/cosmicstonehenge.htm|accessdate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Julian C.|authorlink = Julian Richards (archaeologist)|title=Stonehenge: A History in Photographs|publisher=English Heritage|year=2004|location=London|isbn=978-1850748953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1967, in advance of a new car park being built at the site, the area of land immediately northwest of the stones was excavated by [[Faith Vatcher|Faith]] and [[Lance Vatcher]]. They discovered the [[Stonehenge#History|Mesolithic postholes]] dating from between 7000 and 8000 BC, as well as a {{convert|10|m|sing=on}} length of a [[palisade]] ditch&amp;nbsp;– a V-cut ditch into which timber posts had been inserted that remained there until they rotted away. Subsequent [[aerial archaeology]] suggests that this ditch runs from the west to the north of Stonehenge, near the avenue.&lt;ref name="SiiL" /&gt;

Excavations were once again carried out in 1978 by Atkinson and [[John G. Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] during which they discovered the remains of the [[Stonehenge Archer]] in the outer ditch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stonehenge execution revealed|work=BBC News|date=9 June 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/784348.stm|accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1979 [[rescue archaeology]] was needed alongside the Heel Stone after a cable-laying ditch was mistakenly dug on the roadside, revealing a new stone hole next to the Heel Stone.

In the early 1980s [[Julian Richards (archaeologist)|Julian Richards]] led the [[Stonehenge Environs Project]], a detailed study of the surrounding landscape. The project was able to successfully date such features as [[the Lesser Cursus]], [[Coneybury Henge]] and several other smaller features.

In 1993 the way that Stonehenge was presented to the public was called 'a national disgrace' by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. Part of English Heritage's response to this criticism was to commission research to collate and bring together all the archaeological work conducted at the monument up to this date. This two-year research project resulted in the publication in 1995 of the monograph ''[[Stonehenge in its landscape]]'', which was the first publication presenting the complex stratigraphy and the finds recovered from the site. It presented a rephasing of the monument.&lt;ref name=Whitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whittle|first=Alasdair|year=1996|title=Eternal stones: Stonehenge completed|journal=Antiquity|issue=70|pages=463–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s====
More recent excavations include a series of digs held between 2003 and 2008 known as the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]], led by Mike Parker Pearson. This project mainly investigated other monuments in the landscape and their relationship to the stones&amp;nbsp;— notably Durrington Walls, where another "Avenue" leading to the River Avon was discovered. The point where the Stonehenge Avenue meets the river was also excavated, and revealed a previously unknown circular area which probably housed four further stones, most likely as a marker for the starting point of the avenue. In April 2008 Tim Darvill of the University of Bournemouth and Geoff Wainwright of the Society of Antiquaries, began another dig inside the stone circle to retrieve dateable fragments of the original bluestone pillars. They were able to date the erection of some bluestones to 2300 BC,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; although this may not reflect the earliest erection of stones at Stonehenge. They also discovered organic material from 7000 BC, which, along with the Mesolithic postholes, adds support for the site having been in use at least 4,000 years before Stonehenge was started. In August and September 2008, as part of the Riverside Project, Julian Richards and [[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]] excavated Aubrey Hole 7, removing the cremated remains from several Aubrey Holes that had been excavated by Hawley in the 1920s, and re-interred in 1935.&lt;ref name="Sheffield Uni"/&gt; A licence for the removal of human remains at Stonehenge had been granted by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] in May 2008, in accordance with the ''Statement on burial law and archaeology'' issued in May 2008. One of the conditions of the licence was that the remains should be reinterred within two years and that in the intervening period they should be kept safely, privately and decently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20787|title=StonehengeBones – epetition response|last=Anon|date=29 September 2009|work=The prime minister's office epetitions|publisher=Crown copyright:Ministry of Justice|accessdate=6 November 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091002212133/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20787 |archivedate= 2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/docs/burial-law-archaeology-statementii.pdf |title=Statement on burial law and archaeology |last=Anon |date=April 2008 |work=Review of Burial Legislation |publisher=Crown copyright:Ministry of Justice |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5n94hRQQT?url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/docs/burial-law-archaeology-statementii.pdf |archive-date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new landscape investigation was conducted in April 2009. A shallow mound, rising to about {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=in}} was identified between stones 54 (inner circle) and 10 (outer circle), clearly separated from the natural slope. It has not been dated but speculation that it represents careless backfilling following earlier excavations seems disproved by its representation in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations. Indeed, there is some evidence that, as an uncommon geological feature, it could have been deliberately incorporated into the monument at the outset.&lt;ref name="field2010" /&gt; A circular, shallow bank, little more than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=in}} high, was found between the Y and Z hole circles, with a further bank lying inside the "Z" circle. These are interpreted as the spread of spoil from the original Y and Z holes, or more speculatively as hedge banks from vegetation deliberately planted to screen the activities within.&lt;ref name=field2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=David|date=March 2010|title=Introducing Stonehedge|journal=British Archaeology|issue=111|pages=32–35|issn=1357-4442|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the [[Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project]] discovered a "henge-like" monument less than {{convert|1|km|abbr=in}} away from the main site.&lt;ref name=IAA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/iaa/departments/archaeology/news/2010/new-henge.aspx |title=A new 'henge' discovered at Stonehenge |publisher=[[University of Birmingham]] |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711182439/https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/iaa/departments/archaeology/news/2010/new-henge.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new hengiform monument was subsequently revealed to be located "at the site of Amesbury 50", a round barrow in the [[Cursus Barrows]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/arp.1422| title = The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project| journal = Archaeological Prospection| volume = 19| issue = 2| pages = 147| year = 2012| last1 = Gaffney | first1 = C. | last2 = Gaffney | first2 = V. | last3 = Neubauer | first3 = W. | last4 = Baldwin | first4 = E. | last5 = Chapman | first5 = H. | last6 = Garwood | first6 = P. | last7 = Moulden | first7 = H. | last8 = Sparrow | first8 = T. | last9 = Bates | first9 = R. | last10 = Löcker | first10 = K. | last11 = Hinterleitner | first11 = A. | last12 = Trinks | first12 = I. | last13 = Nau | first13 = E. | last14 = Zitz | first14 = T. | last15 = Floery | first15 = S. | last16 = Verhoeven | first16 = G. | last17 = Doneus | first17 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2011, archaeologists from University of Birmingham announced the discovery of evidence of two huge pits positioned within the [[Stonehenge Cursus]] pathway, aligned in celestial position towards midsummer sunrise and sunset when viewed from the Heel Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Alan, [http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/11/28/9074269-pits-add-to-stonehenge-mystery ''Pits Add to Stonehgenge Mystery''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201214350/https://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/11/28/9074269-pits-add-to-stonehenge-mystery |date=1 December 2011 }}, ''msnbc.com Cosmic Log'', 28 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UBdiscovery&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2011/11/25Nov-Discoveries-provide-evidence-of-a-celestial-procession-at-Stonehenge.aspx ''Discoveries Provide Evidence of a Celestial Procession at Stonehenge''], ''University of Birmingham Press Release, 26 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The new discovery is part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project which began in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2010/07/5july-hengesearch.aspx ''Birmingham Archaeologists Turn Back Clock at Stonehenge''], ''University of Birmingham Press Release, 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The project uses non-invasive geophysical imaging technique to reveal and visually recreate the landscape. According to team leader Vince Gaffney, this discovery may provide a direct link between the rituals and astronomical events to activities within the Cursus at Stonehenge.&lt;ref name=UBdiscovery/&gt;

On 18 December 2011, geologists from University of Leicester and the National Museum of Wales announced the discovery of the exact source of some of the [[rhyolite]] fragments found in the Stonehenge [[debitage]]. These fragments do not seem to match any of the standing stones or bluestone stumps. The researchers have identified the source as a {{convert|70|m|adj=on}} long rock outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-Felin ({{coord|51|59|30|N|4|44|41|W|type:mountain_scale:1000_region:GB|name=Craig Rhos-y-Felin|display=inline}}), near [[Pont Saeson]] in north [[Pembrokeshire]], located {{convert|220|km}} from Stonehenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keys|first=David|title=Scientists discover source of rock used in Stonehenge's first circle|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/scientists-discover-source-of-rock-used-in-stonehenges-first-circle-6278894.html|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Discovery in Stonehenge Bluestone Mystery|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1823/?article_id=642|work=National Museum of Wales|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620114843/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1823/?article_id=642|archivedate=20 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2014 the [[University of Birmingham]] announced findings including evidence of adjacent stone and wooden structures and burial mounds, overlooked previously, that may date as far back as 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=Tele&gt;{{Cite web | author = Siciliano, Leon| date = 10 September 2014 | title = Technology unearths 17 new monuments at Stonehenge | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/11086508/Technology-unearths-17-new-monuments-at-Stonehenge.html | website = telegraph.co.uk | accessdate = 20 May 2015 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area extending to {{convert|12|km2|ha}} was studied to a depth of three metres with [[ground-penetrating radar]] equipment. As many as seventeen new monuments, revealed nearby, may be Late Neolithic monuments that resemble Stonehenge. The interpretation suggests a complex of numerous related monuments. Also included in the discovery is that the [[Cursus|cursus track]] is terminated by two five-meter wide extremely deep pits,&lt;ref name="MyUser_Smithsonianmag.com_October_20_2014c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-lies-beneath-Stonehenge-180952437/ |title=What Lies Beneath Stonehenge? |newspaper=Smithsonianmag.com |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose purpose is still a mystery.

'''Stress resultants''' are simplified representations of the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress]] state in [[structural element]]s such as [[beam theory|beams]], [[plate theory|plates]], or [[Plate theory|shells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to composite materials design |last=Barbero |first=Ever J. |year=2010 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-1-4200-7915-9 |url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420079159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The geometry of typical structural elements allows the internal stress state to be simplified because of the existence of a "thickness'" direction in which the size of the element is much smaller than in other directions.  As a consequence the three [[surface traction|traction]] components that vary from point to point in a cross-section can be replaced with a set of [[resultant force]]s and resultant moments.  These are the '''stress resultants''' (also called ''[[membrane force]]s'', ''[[shear force]]s'', and ''[[bending moment]]'') that may be used to determine the detailed stress state in the structural element.   A three-dimensional problem can then be reduced to a one-dimensional problem (for beams) or a two-dimensional problem (for plates and shells).

Stress resultants are defined as integrals of stress over the thickness of a structural element.  The integrals are weighted by integer powers the thickness coordinate ''z'' (or ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Stress resultants are so defined to represent the effect of stress as a membrane force ''N'' (zero power in ''z''), bending moment ''M'' (power 1) on a beam or [[shell (structure)]].  Stress resultants are necessary to eliminate the ''z'' dependency of the stress from the equations of the theory of plates and shells.

== Stress resultants in beams ==
[[Image:Components stress tensor cartesian.svg|370px|right|thumb|Components of stress on the surfaces of a structural element.]]
Consider the element shown in the adjacent figure.  Assume that the thickness direction is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  If the element has been extracted from a beam, the width and thickness are comparable in size.  Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the width direction.  Then ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the length direction.

=== Membrane and shear forces ===
The resultant force vector due to the traction in the cross-section (''A'') perpendicular to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; axis is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F}_1 = \int_A (\sigma_{11} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{13} \mathbf{e}_3)\, dA
 &lt;/math&gt;
where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the unit vectors along ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.  We define the stress resultants such that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F}_1 =: N_{11}\mathbf{e}_1 + V_2\mathbf{e}_2 + V_3\mathbf{e}_3 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''membrane force'' and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the shear forces.  More explicitly, for a beam of height ''t'' and width ''b'', 
:&lt;math&gt;
    N_{11} = \int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \sigma_{11}\,dx_3\,dx_2 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly the shear force resultants are
:&lt;math&gt;
    \begin{bmatrix} V_2 \\ V_3 \end{bmatrix} =  \int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} 
         \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{12} \\ \sigma_{13} \end{bmatrix} \,dx_3\,dx_2 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Bending moments ===
The bending moment vector due to stresses in the cross-section ''A'' perpendicular to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-axis is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_1 = \int_A \mathbf{r} \times (\sigma_{11} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{13} \mathbf{e}_3)\, dA 
   \quad \text{where} \quad 
    \mathbf{r} = x_2\,\mathbf{e}_2 + x_3\,\mathbf{e}_3 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt; 
Expanding this expression we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_1 = \int_A \left(-x_2\sigma_{11}\mathbf{e}_3 + x_2\sigma_{13}\mathbf{e}_1 + x_3\sigma_{11}\mathbf{e}_2 - x_3\sigma_{12}\mathbf{e}_1\right)dA =: M_{11}\,\mathbf{e}_1 + M_{12}\,\mathbf{e}_2 + M_{13}\,\mathbf{e}_3\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can write the bending moment resultant components as 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} M_{11} \\ M_{12} \\M_{13} \end{bmatrix}
    := \int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \begin{bmatrix} x_2\sigma_{13} - x_3\sigma_{12} \\ x_3\sigma_{11} \\ -x_2\sigma_{11} \end{bmatrix}\,dx_3\,dx_2 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Stress resultants in plates and shells ==
For plates and shells, the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dimensions are much larger than the size in the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; direction.  Integration over the area of cross-section would have to include one of the larger dimensions and would lead to a model that is too simple for practical calculations.  For this reason the stresses are only integrated through the thickness and the stress resultants are typically expressed in units of force ''per unit length'' (or moment ''per unit length'') instead of the true force and moment as is the case for beams.

=== Membrane  and shear forces ===
For plates and shells we have to consider two cross-sections.  The first is perpendicular to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; axis and the second is perpendicular to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axis.  Following the same procedure as for beams, and keeping in mind that the resultants are now per unit length, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F}_1 = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} (\sigma_{11} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{13} \mathbf{e}_3)\, dx_3
   \quad \text{and} \quad
   \mathbf{F}_2 = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} (\sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{22} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{23} \mathbf{e}_3)\, dx_3
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can write the above as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F}_1 = N_{11} \mathbf{e}_1 + N_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 + V_1  \mathbf{e}_3 \quad \text{and} \quad
   \mathbf{F}_2 = N_{12} \mathbf{e}_1 + N_{22} \mathbf{e}_2 + V_2  \mathbf{e}_3 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the membrane forces are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} N_{11} \\ N_{22} \\ N_{12} \end{bmatrix} := \int_{-t/2}^{t/2}
      \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{11} \\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix}\, dx_3 
&lt;/math&gt;
and the shear forces are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{13} \\ \sigma_{23} \end{bmatrix}\, dx_3 \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bending moments ===
For the bending moment resultants, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_1 = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \mathbf{r} \times (\sigma_{11} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{13} \mathbf{e}_3)\, dx_3 
   \quad \text{and} \quad 
   \mathbf{M}_2 = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \mathbf{r} \times (\sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{22} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{23} \mathbf{e}_3)\, dx_3 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
Expanding these expressions we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_1 = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} [-x_3\sigma_{12}\mathbf{e}_1 + x_3\sigma_{11}\mathbf{e}_2] \,dx_3
   \quad \text{and} \quad 
   \mathbf{M}_2 = \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} [-x_3\sigma_{22}\mathbf{e}_1 + x_3\sigma_{12}\mathbf{e}_2 ]\, dx_3
 &lt;/math&gt;
Define the bending moment resultants such that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{M}_1  =: -M_{12}\mathbf{e}_1 + M_{11}\mathbf{e}_2\quad \text{and} \quad
  \mathbf{M}_2 =: -M_{22}\mathbf{e}_1 + M_{12}\mathbf{e}_2 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then, the bending moment resultants are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} M_{11} \\ M_{22} \\ M_{12} \end{bmatrix} := \int_{-t/2}^{t/2} x_3 \,\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{11} \\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix}\, dx_3 \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
These are the resultants that are often found in the literature but care has to be taken to make sure that the signs are correctly interpreted.

'''''The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World''''' is an international bestselling book by energy expert [[Daniel Yergin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYT Best Sellers List|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-10-09/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 October 2011|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Economic Bestsellers|url=http://pub.xhsd.com.cn/booksort/#ajaxTemplate=clssort.asp?weekid=327&amp;ttype=sw&amp;display=0106&amp;output=content|work=The Beijing Xinhua cultural LLC|publisher=The Beijing Xinhua cultural LLC|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published on September 20, 2011 through [[Penguin Press]] and is considered to be the follow-up to Yergin’s 1992 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning history of oil, ''[[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power|The Prize]]'', and describes the development of the current energy system and prospects for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daniel Yergin's The Quest: Human Ingenuity, Passion, the Fall of Caliphatism and the Rise of Prosperity|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2012/01/03/daniel-yergins-the-quest-human-ingenuity-passion-the-fall-of-caliphatism-and-the-rise-of-prosperity/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=18 December 2012|first=Ralph|last=Benko|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon its release, the book received praise and criticism both for its breadth of subject as well as for its impartiality.&lt;ref name="TE" /&gt; It is often suggested as a “primer” or “guide” to the energy field for the way it combines a narrative across the entire energy spectrum into a single volume.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BGates" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
''The Quest'' is divided into six sections:  ''The New World of Oil'', the first section focuses on developments worldwide in the oil industry following the first Gulf War and the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]]. It is noteworthy that ''The Quest'' has two chapters devoted to China, the only country to get such treatment in the book, whereas ''The Prize'' talked very little about China.  The second section, ''Securing the Supply'', covers the ways in which concerns over [[energy security]] and scarcity have shaped the world’s economy, policies, and planning. This section tells the story of how [[shale gas]] was developed. ''The Electric Age'', the third section, follows [[electricity]]’s rise, as well as the risks of [[nuclear proliferation]], hurdles faced in ensuring that “the lights stay on” and the current challenges for fuel choice.

The fourth section, ''Climate and Carbon'', lays out in six chapters the history of climate science from the “discovery” of the [[atmosphere]] in the late 18th Century and of the “ice age” in the early 19th century to its current central role in [[energy policy]] and debate. ''New Energies'', the fifth section, focuses on the “rebirth of [[renewables]]” and the role of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The final section, ''The Road to the Future'' describes the evolution of personal mobility and the growing global demand for [[automobiles]]. Yergin covers the topics of 3rd and 4th generation [[biofuels]], [[hydrogen fuel cells]], [[natural gas vehicles]], and what he calls “round two in the race between [[gasoline]] and the [[electric car]].” The book concludes with a discussion of the impact of the “[[globalization]] of innovation” on future energy supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2011/0921/The-Quest-Energy-Security-and-the-Remaking-of-the-Modern-World/(page)/2|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception of ''The Quest'' has been generally positive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Quest': A review of Daniel Yergin's epic oil tome|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/story/2011-09-16/quest-for-energy/50457496/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Quest': Daniel Yergin on oil's future|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/books/2016494469_br14quest.html|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' listing it as a ''Book of the Year''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Critics|title=原真人　書評委員お薦め「今年の３点」|url=http://book.asahi.com/reviews/reviewer/2012122300020.html|work=bookAsahi|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise for the book has predominantly centered on Yergin's coverage of the energy system,&lt;ref name="BGates"&gt;{{cite web|title='Review of The Quest, by Dainel Yergin'|last=Gates|first=Bill|url=http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Books/Energy/The-Quest%22|work=GatesNotes|publisher=Bill Gates|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crooks|first=Ed|title=Daniel Yergin’s guide to the essentials of energy in the 21st century is another triumph|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/d9b090be-de15-11e0-a115-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Y5awHOCg|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=Financial Times|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The New York Times]]'' referring to the book as "necessary reading" and ''[[The Economist]]'' calling it a "comprehensive guide to the world's great energy needs and dilemmas".&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Allen|title=How will mankind keep the lights on and the temperature down?|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21529001|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garner|first=Dwight|title=Visions of an Age When Oil Isn’t King|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/books/the-quest-by-daniel-yergin-review.html?_r=4&amp;ref=books&amp;|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of ''The Quest'' most often fall into three main categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book review: 'The Quest'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/25/entertainment/la-ca-daniel-yergin-20110925|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 December 2012|first=Michael|last=Hiltzik|date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics commented on the book's 800 page length, noting that it was not necessarily for the casual reader and that it felt like several different books in one.&lt;ref name="TE" /&gt; Others faulted Yergin for his impartiality and not taking a strong position on subjects such as climate change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|title=How Will We Fuel the Future?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/the-quest-by-daniel-yergin-book-review.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that the book succumbed to "the conventional alarmist storyline” on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Steven|title=In Search Of Carbon Copies|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904265504576569020549199248?KEYWORDS=the+quest%3A+energy+security+and+the+remaking+of+the+modern+world|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[peak oil]] advocates take strong issue with Yergin’s handling of the subject in the book, particularly the discussion of the founding of the peak theory and the potential for future oil discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2011/10/there-will-be-oil-but-can-you/|last= Nelder |first=Chris|title=There Will Be Oil, But At What Price?|work=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Jan Lars|title=Yergin is half-right about oil, but other half is what matters|url=http://energybulletin.net/stories/2011-09-19/yergin-half-right-about-oil-other-half-what-matters|work=Energy Bulletin|publisher=Energy Bulletin|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear waste===
{{see also|Nuclear waste}}
Attempts to create a comprehensive legislative act which would regulate radioactive waste management in Russia have been made since 1992. In 1995, a draft federal law "On the State Policy in the Sphere of Radioactive Waste Management" was developed. However, the Federation Council rejected the specified bill. A conciliation committee was established. After certain amendments have been made to the bill, its name was changed to "On Radioactive Waste Management". This wording was adopted by two chambers of Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and was submitted for signature to the president. However, Russian president dismissed the bill and sent it for revision. As a result, in 2001, the specified bill was excluded from further consideration by the State Duma. In 2008, Rosatom Federal Atomic Energy Agency promulgated the bill "On Radioactive Waste Management".

[[File:Ellern16.jpg|thumbnail|Windpark Ellern, with the village of [[Ellern]] in the foreground.]]
'''Windpark Ellern''' is a [[wind farm]] facility located in [[Ellern]] in the [[Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis]] in [[Rhineland-Pfalz]], [[Germany]]. Positioned along the crest of the [[Soonwald]], the wind farm is one of the largest in southwestern Germany, and combined with a nearby wind farm in [[Kirchberg, Rhein-Hunsrück|Kirchberg]] is among the country's major on-shore [[wind power]] areas.
According to the energy company [[juwi]], the eight [[wind turbine]] facility is capable of generating up to 46.5[[megawatts|MW]] of energy, enough to power 33,000 residences and other buildings of other purposes, and cut down 84,700 [[tonnes]] of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, equivalent to taking off the road 18,140 fossil-fed cars.

Construction of the facility began in 2012, consisting of five 135 metre tall turbines manufactured by [[Enercon]]. Three other turbines were constructed shortly thereafter. While construction activity has provided jobs to the area, the facility has been controversial. Some local residents have formed protest organizations, arguing that the turbines have negatively affected the bucolic nature of the Soonwald and the Hunsrück.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10433">The '''wood industry''' or '''lumber industry''' is a - usually [[Private sector|private]] - [[economic sector]] concerned with [[forestry]], [[logging]], [[timber trade]], and the production of [[forest product]]s, [[timber]]/lumber, primary [[Forest product|forest]] and [[wood product]]s (e.g. [[furniture]]) and secondary products like [[wood pulp]] for the [[pulp and paper industry]]. Some largest producers are also among the biggest [[Forest|timberland]] [[landowner|owners]].

The wood industry plays a dominating role in today's [[wood economy]].

==Distinction==
In the narrow sense of the terms, wood, forest, forestry and timber/lumber industry appear to point to different sectors, in the [[industrialization|industrialized]], [[multinational company|internationalized]] world, there is a tendency toward huge integrated businesses that cover the complete spectrum from [[silviculture]] and forestry in private [[Old-growth forest|primary]] or [[secondary forest]]s or [[plantation]]s via the logging process up to wood processing and [[timber trade|trading]] and transport (e.g. [[timber rafting]], [[forest railway]]s, [[logging road]]s).

Processing and products differs especially with regard to the distinction between [[softwood]] and [[hardwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardwoodind.com/hardwood-lumber/|title=Hardwood Industries - The Pacific Northwest's Source for Hardwood Lumber|website=Hardwoodind.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/softwood-bois_oeuvre/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=Softwood Lumber|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|last=Government of Canada|date=3 November 2008|website=GAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopmentinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bowe-Marketing-Tools-and-Industry-Trends.pdf|format=PDF|title=Industry Trends and Marketing Strategies for the Hardwood Lumber Industry : Great Lakes Forest, Industry Products, and Resources Summit|author=Scott Bowe|date=June 6, 2012|website=Sustainabledevelopmentinstitute.org|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwoodlumber.org/|title=Softwood Lumber, Binational Softwood Lumber Council|website=Softwoodlumber.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934101000636 | doi=10.1016/S1389-9341(01)00063-6 | volume=3 | issue=3–4 | title=Production strategies in the Swedish softwood sawmilling industry | journal=Forest Policy and Economics | pages=189–197| year=2001 | last1=Roos | first1=Anders | last2=Flinkman | first2=Matti | last3=Jäppinen | first3=Armas | last4=Lönner | first4=Göran | last5=Warensjö | first5=Mats }}&lt;/ref&gt; While softwood primarily goes into the production of wood fuel and pulp and paper, hardwood is used mainly for [[furniture]], [[Wood flooring|floors]], etc.. Both types can be of use for building and (residential) construction purposes (e.g. [[log house]]s, [[log cabin]]s, [[timber framing]]).

== Safety ==

=== Noise ===
Workers within the Forestry and Logging industry sub-sector fall within the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting (AFFH) industry sector as characterized by the [[North American Industrial Classification System]] (NAICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=11&amp;search=2012%20NAICS%20Search|title=US Census Bureau Site North American Industry Classification System main page|last=ESMD|first=US Census Bureau Classification Development Branch,|website=Census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has taken a closer look at the AFFH industry's noise exposures and prevalence of hearing loss. While the overall industry sector had a prevalence of hearing loss lower than the overall prevalence of noise-exposed industries (15% v. 19%), workers within Forestry and Logging exceeded 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masterson|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Themann|first2=Christa L.|last3=Calvert|first3=Geoffrey M.|date=January 2018|title=Prevalence of hearing loss among noise-exposed workers within the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sector, 2003-2012|url=|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=61|issue=1|pages=42–50|doi=10.1002/ajim.22792|issn=1097-0274|pmc=5905332|pmid=29152771|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-six percent of workers within Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products, a sub-sector within Forestry and Logging, experienced hearing loss, the most of any AFFH sub-sector. Workers within Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products are tasked with growing trees for [[reforestation]] and gathering products such as [[rhizome]]s and barks. Comparatively, non-noise-exposed workers have only a 7% prevalence of hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masterson|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Themann|first2=Christa L.|last3=Luckhaupt|first3=Sara E.|last4=Li|first4=Jia|last5=Calvert|first5=Geoffrey M.|date=2016-01-28|title=Hearing difficulty and tinnitus among U.S. workers and non-workers in 2007|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|language=en|volume=59|issue=4|pages=290–300|doi=10.1002/ajim.22565|pmid=26818136|issn=0271-3586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worker noise exposures in the Forestry and Logging industry have been found to be up to 102 dBA.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pyykkö|first=I.|last2=Koskimies|first2=K.|last3=Starck|first3=J.|last4=Pekkarinen|first4=J.|last5=Färkkilä|first5=M.|last6=Inaba|first6=R.|date=July 1989|title=Risk factors in the genesis of sensorineural hearing loss in Finnish forestry workers|url=|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=46|issue=7|pages=439–446|issn=0007-1072|pmc=1009807|pmid=2765417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recommends that a worker have an 8 hour time-weighted average of noise exposure of 85 dBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/20000050.html|title=NIOSHTIC-2  Publications Search - 20000050 - Criteria for a recommended standard... occupational noise exposure, revised criteria 1998|website=Cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive noise puts workers at an increased risk of developing hearing loss. If a worker were to develop a hearing loss as a result of occupational noise exposures, it would be classified as [[occupational hearing loss]]. Noise exposures within the Forestry and Logging industry can be reduced by enclosing engines and heavy equipment, installing mufflers and silencers, and performing routine maintenance on equipment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Noise exposures can also be reduced through the [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] where removal or replacement of noisy equipment serves as the best method of noise reduction.

=== Injury ===
The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) has found that fatalities of Forestry and Logging workers have increased from 2013 to 2016, up from 81 to 106 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag113.htm|title=Industries at a Glance: Forestry and Logging: NAICS 113|website=Bls.gov|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, there were 3.6 cases of injury and illness per 100 workers within this industry.
