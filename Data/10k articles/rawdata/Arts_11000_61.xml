'''''Aandhi''''' ([[translation]]: Storm) is a [[Bollywood films of 1975|1975]] Indian [[political drama]] film starring [[Sanjeev Kumar]] and [[Suchitra Sen]], and directed by [[Gulzar]]. At the time it was alleged that the film was based on the life of the then-Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and her relationship with her estranged husband, but in reality, only the look was inspired by the politician [[Tarkeshwari Sinha]] and [[Indira Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=hin/&gt; The story is based on a chance meeting of an estranged couple after several years, when wife Aarti Devi, now a leading politician happens to stay in the hotel run by her husband during an election campaign.{{sfn|Lalit Mohan Joshi|2002|p=123}} The movie is noted for its songs composed by [[Rahul Dev Burman]], written by Gulzar and sung by [[Kishore Kumar]] and [[Lata Mangeshkar]].

[[Suchitra Sen]], the noted actress from [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]], who also worked in a few Hindi films, played the lead role of Aarti Devi after actress [[Vyjayanthimala]] refused the film as she had reservations about enacting the role.

The movie was not allowed a full release when Mrs. Gandhi was in power. The film [[List of films banned in India|was banned]] during the [[The Emergency (India)|national emergency of 1975]] a few months after its release. The ban immediately made the film a national topic.{{sfn|Saibal Chatterjee|2003|p=247}} After her defeat in the [[Indian general election, 1977|1977 national elections]], the ruling [[Janata Party]] cleared it and had it premiered on the state-run television channel.&lt;ref name=yahoo-ref/&gt; It proved to be an important film in the career of Sen, and also her last Hindi film, as she retired from films altogether in 1978.{{sfn|Saibal Chatterjee|2003|p=247}} At the [[23rd Filmfare Awards]], she was nominated for Filmfare Best Actress Award, while Sanjeev Kumar won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]]. The film itself won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie]].

==Plot==
J.K. (played by [[Sanjeev Kumar]]) is a Hotel manager. One day he gallantly comes to the rescue of a politician's drunk daughter, Aarti ([[Suchitra Sen]]). Aarti falls in love with J.K. and both get married in a small ceremony. After few years, the married couple face many differences due to which they decide to separate. Years later, J.K. and Aarti meet again when she is an established politician. Despite the separation, both of them feel the closeness but fearing that her name might be tarnished and jeopardise her career, Aarti does not want to step forward.

==Production==
;Development
Gulzar said the film had no semblance with the personal life of then Prime Minister, [[Indira Gandhi]]. He wanted to make film about modern Indian politician, and so he modelled the character on Indira Gandhi and to some extent on noted parliamentarian from Bihar, [[Tarkeshwari Sinha]].&lt;ref name=hin&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/07/20/stories/09200221.htm | title = Where is reality? | author = V.Gangadhar | work =[[The Hindu]] | date = 20 July 2001 | accessdate = 27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Script
An early version of the film's story was written by veteran screenwriter [[Sachin Bhowmick]], however it did not go well with Gulzar. He had an idea of an estranged couple meeting in an hotel after years, and started developing it. Hindi writer [[Kamleshwar]] joined as the writing crew, as the film started shooting. He later went on to write a full-fledged novel, ''Kali Aandhi'' (Black Storm), which is quite different from the film.&lt;ref name="hi"/&gt; Subsequently, the film was written simultaneously along with another Gulzar film, ''[[Mausam (1975 film)|Mausam]]'' (1975), which was also written by Bhushan Banmali and Gulzar.&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=toi121&gt;{{cite web | title = ‘Sir’ wouldn’t lose her sleep over awards | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Sir-wouldnt-lose-her-sleep-over-awards/articleshow/28981326.cms |date= January 18, 2014| accessdate = 2014-03-24 | publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''[[Khushboo (1975 film)|Khushboo]]'', ''Aandhi'' also released in the same year; 1975 proving to be the most prolific for director-screenwriter Gulzar's career.&lt;ref name="hindu13"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Blast From The Past: Khushboo (1975)| url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/khushboo-1975/article4810769.ece | work =The Hindu  | date =13 June 2013  | accessdate = 14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Casting
The lead role of Aarti Devi was offered to actress [[Vyjayanthimala]], who refused as she was fazed by physical resemblance of her character with Indira Gandhi. Later in 2011, she recounted ''Aandhi'' as one of few films she regretted not doing besides ''[[Mr and Mrs 55]]'' (1955) by [[Guru Dutt]] and ''[[Bandini (film)|Bandini]]'' (1963) by [[Bimal Roy]], "I admired Indiraji (Gandhi) so much so that I got cold feet when the role was offered to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20111127/spectrum/book5.htm | title =From Naagin to nritya  | author =Nonika Singh | work = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | date =27 November 2011 | accessdate = 24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.indianexpress.com/news/down-memory-lane/874591/0 | title =Down Memory Lane | work = [[The Indian Express]] | date =12 November 2011 | accessdate = 24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, director Gulzar had approached Suchitra Sen, with screenplay for a film to be produced by Sohanlal Kanwar, however when she suggested some changes which Gulzar didn't agree upon, the film never got made. For film ''Aandhi'' producer [[J. Om Prakash]] insisted upon Gulzar to approach Sen again and actor Sanjeev Kumar was also keen on working with Sen. This time when the new script was done, Gulzar went to meet her in Kolkata, she agreed without any script issues, resulting in a ''casting coup''. In fact, Sen now promised Gulzar to not suggest any changes, and she stuck to her promise all through the filming.&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=toi121/&gt; For the role Aarti Devi's estranged husband [[Sanjeev Kumar]] was already cast, who had previously worked in Gulzar's  ''[[Koshish]]'' (1973), again as an older man. Kumar, one of finest actors of his generation, went on to collaborate with Gulzar in numerous films, like  ''Mausam'' (1975), ''[[Angoor (1982 film)|Angoor]]'' (1981) and ''[[Namkeen]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Saibal Chatterjee|2003|p=97}}

Like most of Gulzar's films, including ''Mausam'' and ''[[Ijaazat]]'', the narrative of Aandhi also unfolds through various [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. {{sfn|Saibal Chatterjee|2003|p=220}}&lt;ref name="RahejaKothari1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HixlAAAAMAAJ|title=The Hundred Luminaries of Hindi Cinema|last=|first=|publisher=India Book House Publishers|year=1996|isbn=978-81-7508-007-2|location=|page=103|pages=|via=|author1=[[Dinesh Raheja]]|author2=Jitendra Kothari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was almost shot together with ''Mausam'', with Sanjeev Kumar playing the lead of an old man in both the films. Though Aandhi was released first, it ran into political controversy and portions of it has to be reshot, meanwhile Mausam was completed and released.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{Cite web  | title =Mausam (1975) | url =http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/mausam-1975/article4766190.ece | work =The Hindu  | date =  30 May 2013 | accessdate = 13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs of the film were shot at various locations in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state, like "Tum Aa Gaye Ho" was shot around [[Pari Mahal]] gardens in [[Srinagar]], the classic "Tere Bina Zindagi Se" at the ruined  7th-8th century [[Martand Sun Temple]], near Anantnag, while "Is Mod Se Jaate Hai" was shot at [[Pahalgam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Movie &gt; Aandhi Locations |publisher= Filmapia | url = http://www.filmapia.com/published/movies/a/aandhi | accessdate = 2014-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chasing Aandhi: Kashmir sets the background|publisher=India Today| url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Chasing+Aandhi:+Kashmir+sets+the+background/1/95240.html |date=April 29, 2010| accessdate = 2014-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the songs have architectural ruins as a backdrop, depicting brokeness. Gulzar's family, wife actress [[Raakhee]] and daughter young [[Meghna Gulzar]] accompanied him on the shooting in Kashmir, however upon the return Rakhee and Gulzar separated.{{sfn|Meghna Gulzar|2004|p=121}}

==Themes and influences==
In her memoir, daughter Meghna mentioned that Gulzar's wife Rakhee had once said to him, "Agar aap shayar na hote, to bade hi ordinary hote" (If you weren't a poet, you would have been very ordinary), this line was paraphrased and spoken by Aarti Devi to her husband in the film.  {{sfn|Meghna Gulzar|2004|p=168}} The film looks at the life of a career-minded woman in the political arena, which is large dominated by men. Aarti inherits the legacy of her ambitious politician father, and comes in conflict with her role as dutiful wife. Soon she has to make choices to resolve the conflicts, and part ways with her husband, giving career rather duty as a daughter precedence over her personal life. When they meet again after nine years of separation, the dominating personality created under influence of her father has mellow and wisdom risen and she sees what she has missed. Yet she finds herself at a choice point once again, should she give up her political career or settle for matrimonial life.&lt;ref name="Madangarli"/&gt; Aandhi takes on a feminist theme, also taken up in Ray's ''[[Mahanagar]]'' before, as it questions the price women often have to pay for political aspirations or career aspiration for that matter, when her unambitious hotel manager husband refuses to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sûrya India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vo8AAAAMAAJ|year=1989|page=71|publisher=A. Anand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also satirizes the political opportunism in Indian democracy, where politicians visit the common man only every five years, at the time of elections. Through the lines of the song "Salaam kijiye aali janaab aaye hain, ye paanch saalon ka dene hisaab aaye hain. (Bow to the masters.. They have come after five years...).&lt;ref name="Madangarli"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhawana Somaaya|authorlink=Bhawana Somaaya|author2=Jigna Kothari |author3=Supriya Madangarli |title=Mother Maiden Mistress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dtec0Ykfo1sC&amp;pg=PA1973-IA1|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-93-5029-485-7|pages=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of this film was composed by [[Rahul Dev Burman]] with lyrics by [[Gulzar]]. Director-lyricist Gulzar first worked with Burman or Pancham as he commonly known as in ''[[Parichay (film)|Parichay]]'' (1972), giving popular songs like "Beeti Na Bitai Raina" and "Musafir Hoon Yaaro". In the following years their team gradually developed in the preceding years, eventually reaching a flourish in 1975 with two important film scores in the same year, ''Aandhi'' and ''[[Khushboo (1975 film)|Khushboo]]''.&lt;ref name="Bharatan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raju Bharatan|title=A Journey Down Melody Lane|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnxABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159|date=2010|publisher=Hay House, Inc|isbn=978-93-81398-05-0|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Gulzar had like the use of [[natural sign|pure notes]] (shuddha [[swara]]) in "Raina Beete Jai" from ''[[Amar Prem]]'' (1972) by Burman, a treatment which was used in the film's title music. The Lata Mangeshkar-Kishore Kumar duet "Is Mod Se Jaate Hain" extended the [[major scale]] usage with an added [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] (Teevra Madhyam) and reminiscence of Raga Yaman. Even the interludes included Indian classical instruments, like [[Bansuri|flute]] played by [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]], [[sarod]] by Zarin Daruwala (Sharma) and [[sitar]] by Jairam Acharya, aided by a violin ensemble.&lt;ref name="Vittal2012"/&gt; The tune of "Tere Bina.." another Lata Mangeshkar-Kishore Kumar duet, was originally created as [[Durga Puja]] song, "Jete Jete Potho Holo Deri" in Bengali, which Gulzar liked and wrote lyrics around the tune &lt;ref name="Vittal2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anirudha Bhattacharjee Balaji Vittal|title=R.

The film released in February 1975 amidst controversy, as rumours abound that it was based on the life of Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. Some of film's posters also hyped the similarity, with lines like, "See your Prime Minister on screen" and "the story of a great woman political leader in post-Independence India", were featured in a film magazine.  Eventually, the film was given a go ahead after it was seen by two staff members and then [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting (India)|
Information and Broadcasting minister]], [[I.K. Gujral]]. After the release, similarity was seen in the dressing and mannerism of lead Aarti Devi, played by Suchitra Sen and Mrs Gandhi, including the [[saree]]s and streak of white hair. During the June [[Elections in Gujarat|Legislative assembly election]] campaign in Gujarat, some opposition politicians were shown scenes of the film, depicting Aarti Devi smoking and drinking. As the film gained momentum, some ambitious exhibitors even started promoting the film with the line, "See Indira Gandhi in Aandhi", by now film was openly courting controversy, despite being only a mild satire on politicians. The film was eventually banned after 26 weeks after its release.&lt;ref name="hi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vittal"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anirudha Bhattacharjee Balaji Vittal|title=R. D.

==Critical reception==
Some critics, including [[Subhash K. Jha]] have drawn thematic parallels between Indira Gandhi and her father [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] as depicted in the film also references to their personal lives. Also the role of Sanjeev Kumar, having shades of Mrs. Gandhi's husband.&lt;ref name="Prasad1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Sanjeev Kumar on his part said, only the [[characterisation]] of his role was based on [[Feroze Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Aandhi |page=75 |year=1977 |volume=98, Part 2 |work=The Illustrated Weekly of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in Sydney as Agnes Adele Wangenheim. At the age of eighteen she married Barnett Kurtz, and became Agnes Kurtz. Barnett Kurtz had attempted to divorce Agnes in March 1897. Kurtz read a letter to the court in which Agnes said she wanted a divorce; Agnes said she did not want to divorce and wrote the letter just to annoy her husband; the divorce was not granted. In December 1897 Agnes sued for the divorce on the grounds of adultery by her husband and it was granted. Their divorce was highly publicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138631382 |title=A SINGULAR LETTER. |newspaper=[[The Australasian]] |location=Melbourne |date=4 December 1897 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article145860541 |title=Without Prejudice. |newspaper=[[Table Talk (Australian newspaper)|Table Talk]] |location=Melbourne |date=3 December 1897 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 1898, Agnes married stage actor [[John Gavin (director)|John Gavin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14221038 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 September 1899 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for many years they worked together in Vaudeville and [[Bland Holt]]'s stage company.

In 1904, Agnes Gavin was accused of abusing her neighbor with violent language, as well as menacing her with a hammer and threatening to chop down her door with an ax. The court ordered her bound to the peace for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113291119 |title=THEATRICALS IN COURT. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|location=Sydney |date=25 August 1904 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her first marriage she had a daughter named Isadore, who died on September 12, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15736854 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=12 September 1917 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gavin died in 1938 and Agnes followed in 1947. The couple is survived by two daughters and several grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18016149 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 January 1947 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1910, Gavin and her husband made their first film together, [[Thunderbolt (1910 film)|''Thunderbolt'']], produced by [[H. A. Forsyth]]. John Gavin played the main character.In their next film with Forsyth, ''[[Moonlite]]'', Gavin played an aboriginal girl named Bunda Bunda while wearing [[blackface]].

Agnes Gavin then went on to write several films for [[Stanley Crick|Crick]] and [[Herbert Finlay|Finlay]], which her husband directed.

In 1911, her husband started his own production company, the Gavin Photo-Play Studio. She wrote the films he directed, occasionally playing in them alongside her husband.

The pair were best known for making films about [[bushrangers]] such as [[Captain Thunderbolt]], [[Captain Moonlite]], [[Ben Hall (bushranger)|Ben Hall]] and [[Frank Gardiner]], and [[Convicts in Australia|convict-era]] melodramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article102803043 |title=A Well-known Biograph Actor. |newspaper=[[The Newsletter: an Australian Paper for Australian People]] |location=Sydney |date=4 February 1911 |accessdate=3 October 2013 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article102797743 |title=A Great Australian. |newspaper=[[The Newsletter: an Australian Paper for Australian People]] |location=Sydney |date=4 November 1911 |accessdate=13 November 2014 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article about the making of ''Ben Hall'' said the "dramatisation of the book" was in her "capable hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article221578093 |title=BUSHRANGING PICTURES. |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=161 |location=Sydney |date=4 January 1911 |accessdate=9 March 2017 |page=3|edition=CRICKET |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She adapted her 1917 film ''[[The Murder of Captain Fryatt]]'' into a play: ''Captain Fryatt; Or, For King and Country''.

In 1918 she and her husband moved to Hollywood, returning briefly to Australia in 1922 and then permanently in 1925.

==Personal life==
Holland was born in [[Warsaw]], Poland in 1948. She is the daughter of journalists Irena ([[married and maiden names|née]] Rybczyńska) and Henryk Holland, who was a prominent [[Polish United Workers' Party|Communist]] activist since 1935 and a captain of [[Polish People's Army|Polish Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/12/Agnieszka-Holland.html Agnieszka Holland profile], FilmReference.com; accessed 24 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's mother was [[Catholic]] and her father [[Jewish]], but she was not brought up in any religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Jewish Stars: Oscar time

Holland's mother participated in the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]] as a member of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]]. Holland's Catholic mother [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|aided several Jews]] during the Holocaust and received the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] medal from the [[Yad Vashem]] Institute in Israel.&lt;ref name=NPRDowell /&gt;

Holland was often ill as a child, and spent much of her time writing, drawing and directing short plays with other children.&lt;ref name="Tibbets pp. 132-143"&gt;Tibbets, John and Agnieszka Holland. “The Interview with Agnieszka Holland: The Politics of Ambiguity”, ''Quarterly Review of Film and Video''. 25:2, pp. 132-43.&lt;/ref&gt; When she was eleven, her parents, whose marriage had been continuously contentious, divorced and her mother soon remarried a Jewish journalist, Stanislaw Brodski.

Holland describes her relationship with her father as influential, but very distant. According to Holland, "he was very interesting, very intelligent, and in the last years of his life he gave me a lot of doors to the art an the film. But he wasn't really interested in the young children and he only noticed me when he wanted to make a kind of show".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1997/10/12/agnieszka-holland-a-war-on-stupidity/abdecfb2-3bd4-4ade-9a30-33a1abc82acd/|title=AGNIESZKA HOLLAND: A WAR ON STUPIDITY|last=Kempley|first=Rita|date=1997-10-12|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holland recalls beings showed off to her father's friends during late night gatherings, and then being ignored in the morning when he was no longer entertaining.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When Holland was thirteen,  her father died under police interrogation while under house arrest in Warsaw. Although official reports labeled his death a suicide, his family and others believe he was murdered by the communist police, by [[defenestration]].

Holland attended the [[Stefan Batory Gymnasium and Lyceum (Warsaw, Poland)|Stefan Batory Gymnasium and Lyceum]] in Warsaw.&lt;!--wp:nor--&gt; After high school, she studied at the [[Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] (FAMU) because, as she said in an interview, she thought the Czechoslovak films of the 1960s were very interesting: "I watched first films of [[Miloš Forman]], [[Ivan Passer]], and [[Vera Chytilova]]. They seemed to be fantastically interesting to me, unlike what was being made in Poland at that time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pk.org.pl/artykul.php?id=90 Na czeskiej fali, Agnieszka Holland - wywiad] retrieved March 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At FAMU, she also met her future husband and fellow director, Laco Adamik.

Holland witnessed the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968 while in Czechoslovakia, and was arrested for her support of the dissident movement for the government reforms and political liberalization. She describes her time in Prague as her "introduction to politics, violence, beauty, art, marriage, film and other arts...everything that happened to [her] after was based on this Czechoslovak experience".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/85231-the-only-place-to-execute-some-kind-of-power-was-the-film-set-agnieszka-holland-on-her-career/|title="The only place to execute some kind of power was the film set": Agnieszka Holland on her career {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=Tong|first=Allan|work=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time in prison, she spent time in a cell between two inmates who had fallen in love.

Though it was censored and stopped from being developed, it attracted the attention of [[Andrzej Wajda|Andrezej Wajda]], who became her mentor. Her daughter with Adamik, Kasia (born 28 December 1972), is also a director.&lt;ref name="Kasia Adamik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php?osoba=1131970|title=Kasia Adamik|publisher=Film Polski|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events and confusing identities that made up her childhood resulted in Holland being known to have a signifiant struggle with identity, which manifests itself in many of her most famous films, specifically those related to Polish-Jewish interactions during the Holocaust. According to Holland, the tense relationship between Polish natives and Jewish Poles is still an ongoing issue. She says that "some Jews from Poland are still hostile to the Polish...There are things in Catholicism and Polish nationalism which are deeply anti-Semitic".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brunette|first=Peter |date=1986|title=Lessons from the Past: An Interview with Agnieszka Holland |jstor=41686850|journal=Cineaste |volume=15 |number=1 |pages=15–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her widely acclaimed film ''Europa, Europa'' brought her success and recognition in Hollywood, but she has always, and still faces trouble in her career and life due to her past.

==Career==
[[File:Pokot w Nowej Rudzie.jpg|thumb|Discussion with Holland at the premiere of ''[[Spoor (film)|Spoor]]'' in [[Nowa Ruda]], south-western Poland]]

Holland began her career as an assistant director for Polish film directors [[Krzysztof Zanussi]] and [[Andrzej Wajda]]. Her credits include Zanussi's 1973 film, ''Iluminacja'' (''Illumination''), and Wajda's 1983 film, ''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]''. She was first assistant director on Wajda's 1976 ''[[Man of Marble]]'', an experience which gave her the capability to explore political and moral issues within the confines of an oppressive regime.&lt;ref name="Tibbets pp. 132-143"/&gt; Though she had a large role to play in the success of this film, her name was kept off of the credits because of censorship laws.&lt;ref name="Crnković 1999 pp. 2-9" /&gt; In the first part of her career, Holland was unable to release any films under her own name because of the harsh censorship of Communist authorities. Wajda offered to adopt her but she refused, convinced that she could eventually release films under own name. Her first major film was ''[[Provincial Actors]]'' (''Aktorzy Prowincjonalni''), a 1978 chronicle of tense backstage relations within a small-town theater company which was an allegory of Poland's contemporary political situation. It won the International Critics Prize at the 1980 [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Holland directed two more major films in Poland, ''[[Fever (1981 film)|Fever]]'' (Gorączka, 1980, entered in the [[31st Berlin International Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1981/03_preistr_ger_1981/03_Preistraeger_1981.html |title=Berlinale 1981: Prize Winners |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''[[A Lonely Woman]]'' (''Kobieta samotna'') in 1981, before emigrating to France shortly before the December 1981 imposition of [[martial law in Poland]].  She was told that she could not return to Poland, and was unable to see or even have any contact with her daughter for over eight months.&lt;ref name="Crnković 1999 pp. 2-9"/&gt; During this time, though safe, Holland was unable to create any successful films on her own.

Knowing she could not return to communist Poland, Holland wrote scripts for fellow Polish filmmakers in exile: Wajda's ''Danton'', ''[[A Love in Germany]]'' (1983), ''[[The Possessed (1988 film)|The Possessed]]'' (1988) and ''[[Korczak (film)|Korczak]]'' (1990). She also developed her own projects with Western European production companies, directing ''[[Angry Harvest]]'' (1985), ''[[To Kill a Priest]]'' (1988) and ''[[Olivier, Olivier]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Crnković 1999 pp. 2-9"/&gt; Holland received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Foreign Language Film for ''Angry Harvest'', a German production about a Jewish woman on the run during World War II.&lt;ref name="Oscars1986"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1986 |title=The 58th Academy Awards (1986) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holland's Depiction of the Holocaust ===
Some of Holland's most famous work has been her depictions of the Holocaust. These works have been extremely controversial because of Holland's commitment to realism, and the acceptance of all types of individuals as both victims and as flawed human beings deserving of guilt. According to an article written about Holland, her films about the Holocaust "cling to the world as she sees it. A world in which wisdom, if it exists at all, lies in accepting the violence and human frailty in everyone, without exception, including Jewish people".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is most poignant in Holland's 2011 film ''In Darkness,'' in which Jewish and Polish Catholic characters are juxtaposted as having some of the same reprehensible qualities as well as redeemable ones.

Holland's best-known film may be ''[[Europa Europa]]'' (1991), which was based on the life of [[Solomon Perel]] (a Jewish teenager who fled Germany for Poland after ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938). At the outbreak of World War II and the [[German invasion of Poland]], Perel fled to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-occupied section of the country. Captured during the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Solomon convinced a German officer that he was German and found himself enrolled in the Hitler Youth. The film received a lukewarm reception in Germany, and the German Oscar selection committee did not submit it for the 1991 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. However, it attracted the attention of Michael Barker (who handled [[Orion Classics]]’ sales at the time). ''Europa, Europa'' was released in the United States, winning the 1991 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay.&lt;ref name="Tibbets pp. 132-143" /&gt;

Almost twenty years later, Holland released ''[[In Darkness (2011 film)|In Darkness]]'' (2011), a German-Canadian-Polish co production that dramatized the story of a Polish sewage worker who aided a group of Jewish refugees by hiding them in the sewers of Lwów during the time when Jewish people in the city were being sent to extermination camps. The story focuses on the relationships between Native Poles and Jewish people during the Holocaust. The characters of ''In Darkness'' are shown to us as having some strong similarities, despite the fact that the realities for Jews and Ethnic Poles, specifically those depicted specifically in the film, are extremely different. By comparing The Polish protagonist to the Jewish ones, Holland recreates the morally confusing &amp;nbsp;and physically brutal world that though very different for those who were  hunted, was everywhere during the Third Reich. This juxtapostion seemed to be clear reflection of Holland's own personal experience, specifically her struggle with identity and anti-semitism.

=== Holland and Hollywood ===
Until her successful 1991 film ''Europa, Europa,'' Holland was barely recognized as an acclaimed filmmaker in Hollywood. The film came about because of a roller coaster ride with the future producer of the film: [[Artur Brauner]]. Holland had been treated to day at Disneyland by the American Academy when she was in the running as a nominee for a foreign Oscar for her film ''[[Angry Harvest]].'' After the difficultly she had getting ''Angry Harvest'' made, she had almost decided to give up filmmaking once and for all, but Brauner was convinced he had a perfect project for her. During her trip to Disney, Holland, "against her better judgement decided to ride a roller coaster with her producer. After they stepped off, Holland was shaking with fear as Brauner whipped a contract out of his pocket: "Sign!"".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The success of this film got the attention of mainstream Hollywood, which is what gave Holland the opportunity to direct the film adaption of the 1911 world famous novel: ''[[The Secret Garden]].'' This was Holland's first movie made for a major studio with a broad American public in mind. It was a huge change in style for Holland, who was known at the point for her generally dark and pessimistic directorial perspective.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Holland's Later Career ===
A friend of Polish writer and director [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], Holland collaborated on the screenplay for his film, ''[[Three Colors: Blue]]''. Like Kieślowski, Holland frequently examines issues of [[faith]] in her work. Much of her film work has a strong political slant. Government reprisals, stifling bureaucratic machinery, sanctioned strikes and dysfunctional families are represented in her early work.&lt;ref name="Tibbets pp. 132-143"/&gt; In a 1988 interview Holland said that although women were important in her films, [[feminism]] was not the central theme of her work. She suggested that when she was making films in Poland under the [[Communist]] regime, there was an atmosphere of cross-gender solidarity against [[censorship]] (the main political issue). Holland said that she was interested in happenings between people, not the politics occurring outside them; in this context, “maybe you could say that all my movies are political.”&lt;ref name="Crnković 1999 pp. 2-9"/&gt;
[[File:Agnieszka Holland gwiazda Lodz.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Star to honor Agnieszka Holland in [[Łódź]]]]
Holland's later films include ''Olivier, Olivier'' (1992), ''[[The Secret Garden (1993 film)|The Secret Garden]]'' (1993), ''[[Total Eclipse (film)|Total Eclipse]]'' (1995), ''[[Washington Square (film)|Washington Square]]'' (1997), the HBO production ''[[Shot in the Heart]]'' (2001), ''[[Julie Walking Home]]'' (2001), and ''[[Copying Beethoven]]'' (2006).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In a 1997 interview, when asked how her experiences as a director have influenced her films, Holland said “filmmakers of the younger generation lack life experience” and, as a result, lack many of the tools needed to breathe humanity into their characters. Compared to directors of her generation, she feels that the younger generation comes from wealthy families, goes straight to film schools and watches movies primarily on videotape. Holland suggests that this results in what she calls a “numbness” and “conventionalization” of contemporary cinema.&lt;ref name="Crnković 1999 pp. 2-9"/&gt;

In 2003, Holland was a member of the jury at the [[25th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2003 |title=25th Moscow International Film Festival (2003) |accessdate=1 April 2013 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403123906/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2003 |archivedate=April 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she directed "[[Moral Midgetry]]", the eighth episode of the third season of the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.&lt;ref name="E33"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Moral Midgetry|episodelink=Moral Midgetry (The Wire episode)|series=The Wire|serieslink=The Wire (TV series)|credits=Agnieszka Holland, David Simon (story), Richard Price (story and teleplay)|network=HBO|airdate=14 November 2004|season=3|number=08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EG33"&gt;{{cite web|year=2004|title=Episode guide - episode 33 Moral Midgetry|publisher=HBO|accessdate=9 August 2006|url=http://www.hbo.com/thewire/episode/season3/episode08.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Wire season 3 crew"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/crew/season_3.shtml|title=''The Wire'' season 3 crew|accessdate=14 October 2007|publisher=HBO|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012034651/http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/crew/season_3.shtml|archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Holland, her sister [[Magdalena Łazarkiewicz]] and her daughter Katarzyna Adamik directed the Polish political drama series ''[[Ekipa (TV Series)|Ekipa]]'', and in 2008 Holland became the first president of the [[Polish Film Academy]].

== Other work ==
Agnieszka Holland translated from Czech to Polish the novel ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''. She volunteered for this task after meeting the author, [[Milan Kundera]], in 1982, and reading the manuscript; both were living in [[Paris]] at that time. Holland found the events of the book relatable not only to her personal experience of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] but also to the [[Gdańsk Agreement#Strikes of 1980|strikes of 1980]] in Poland, and therefore wanted to introduce the book to the Polish audience. The translation was originally published by the London-based publisher ''Aneks'' and has since been widely reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agnieszka Holland: Mój Kundera |url=https://www.newsweek.pl/milan-kundera-we-wspomnieniach-agnieszki-holland/b7r3tes |website=Newsweek.pl |date=1 March 2018 |accessdate=23 October 2018 |language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Niezno%C5%9Bna_lekko%C5%9B%C4%87_bytu.html?id=rQRKPgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Nieznośna lekkość bytu'' on Google Books (modern edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cDGci0XxNIcC&amp;q=Niezno%C5%9Bna+lekko%C5%9B%C4%87+bytu+aneks&amp;dq=Niezno%C5%9Bna+lekko%C5%9B%C4%87+bytu+aneks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVypXbw53eAhVMYsAKHTIQDqkQ6AEILDAA ''Nieznośna lekkość bytu'' on Google Books (original ''Aneks'' publication)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1653">'''Argyrotype''' is an [[iron-based silver printing process]] that produces brown images on plain paper. It is an [[alternative process]] derived from the [[argentotype]], [[kallitype]], and [[Van Dyke Brown|Van Dyke processes]] of the 19th century, but has greater simplicity, improved image stability, and longer sensitizer shelf-life.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ware&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Mike Ware (photographer)|Mike Ware]].&lt;ref name="silverprint"&gt;{{cite web|author=SuperUser|title=Argyrotype|url=http://www.silverprint.co.uk/argyrotype/|website=Silverprint|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this process may not have the permanence of other processes such as [[Platinum printing|platinum]] or [[palladium printing]], it is much less expensive and more user friendly. The core resource used is [[silver sulphamate]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag) which can be prepared on site from [[sulphamic acid]].&lt;ref name="silverprint" /&gt; The sensitizer used is very slow, so printing must be by contact with a [[large format]] negative, using an [[ultraviolet]] lamp or sunlight. 

As with most alternative processes there is room for manipulating the process to achieve different effects, and since the image is produced on plain paper many drawing or print making processes can be combined with the original image.

The '''Asian American Arts Centre (AAAC)''' is a [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1974, it is one of the earliest [[Asian-American|Asian American]] community organizations in the United States. The Arts Centre presents the ongoing developments between contemporary Asian &amp; Asian American art forms and Western art forms through the presentation of performance, exhibitions, and public education. AAAC’s permanent collection, which it has accumulated since 1989, contains hundreds of contemporary Asian American art works and traditional/folk art pieces. The organization also has an Artists Archive which documents, preserves, and promotes the presence of Asian American visual culture in the [[United states|United States]] since 1945. This includes the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], especially the [[New York metropolitan area|greater New York area]]; the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]; and some artists in [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], and overseas. The artists include Asian Americans producing art, Asian artists who are active in the United States, and other Americans who are significantly influenced by Asia. [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] in outlook, the Arts Centre’s understanding of ‘Asia’ encompasses traditions and influences with sources ranging from [[Afghanistan]] to Hawaii.

== Mission ==

The mission of the Asian American Arts Centre is to affirm and promote the preservation and creative vitality of Asian American cultural growth through the arts, and its historical and aesthetic linkage to other communities. AAAC accomplishes this by utilizing art, performances, [[new media]], and public education. Aiming to engage other communities and concerns in a creative encounter, the Arts Centre brings cultural events in contemporary visual art to the general public. AAAC has come to see the arts in terms of their historical and spiritual relationship to diverse neighborhoods.

== History ==

The Asian American Arts Centre was founded in 1974 in New York as the [[Asian American Dance Theatre]] (AADT), a not-for-profit community arts organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artspiral.org/|title=Asian American Arts Centre - Home|website=artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the older community arts organizations in Chinatown, Manhattan, beginning with the start of the [[Asian American movement]] and growing out of [[Basement Workshop]] with other Asian American cultural and political organizations in New York.

In 1974, the organization operated out of the [[New York Public Library]] to offer dance classes and dance presentations to the community. It obtained its original location on the third floor of 26 Bowery Street as an Artist-In-Residence (AIR) tenant in 1976; the education programs were expanded into a Saturday Community School on-site, which included dance and later art classes for children and adults. The organization started its Arts-in-Education program in 1978, conducting workshops and lectures in city-wide public schools.

In 1982, the organization created the Asian American Artists' Slide Archive (the first public archive for Asian American artists in the United States), started an annual nine-month Artists-in-Residence program, and organized its first exhibition, ''Eye to Eye''. This exhibition, which featured a panel with [[John Yau]], [[David Diao]], [[Margo Machida]], [[Lucy Lippard]], Lydia Okumura, Kit Yin Snyder, and [[John Woo]], was the first of its kind to bring together Asian American visual artists on the East Coast.

=== Exhibitions and performances at Bowery location (1983–2010) ===

==== 1983 - 1993 ====
The ''Eye to Eye'' exhibition initiated a series of visual art exhibitions as part of a new program within the AADT called the Asian Arts Institute, consisting of three to five contemporary visual art exhibitions and one folk art exhibition each year. The Traditional Arts Presentation and Documentation program began in 1985. The organization adopted its current name, the Asian American Arts Centre (AAAC), in 1987 to encompass both the dance company (AADT) and the visual arts program.

In addition to regular exhibitions at the Bowery location in Chinatown, AAAC held many of its programs at other sites and locations in the country. In 1989, the Arts Centre organized its most ambitious exhibition, ''CHINA: June 4, 1989'', in response to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square student massacre.]] Accumulating contributions from over 300 artists over the next several months, ''CHINA: June 4, 1989'' was exhibited at the Blum Helman Gallery and PS1 (now [[MoMA PS1]]) in 1990, and travelled to Austin, Texas, Cleveland, Ohio, and later to Flint, Michigan in 1994. In conjunction with the ''CHINA: June 4, 1989'' visual art exhibition, the dance company mounted a program of performances in 1990 titled A Memorial Performance of Music, Poetry and Dance which featured [[Zuni Icosahedron|Zuni Icosahedron’s]] U.S. debut of “Deep Structure…” among other performances by contributing artists. A smaller selection of artworks from this exhibition, including art by [[Martin Wong]], was exhibited in Hong Kong in 1990 for the first memorial of the protests. The Arts Centre was contracted to curate an exhibition in the U.S. Senate’s [[Russell Senate Office Building|Russell Rotunda]] in Washington, D.C. upon the escape of [[Chai Ling]] and [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], two former leaders of the student demonstrations, from China. However, upon the rejection of two proposed artworks by [[Byron Kim]] and [[Zhang Hongtu]] for the exhibition by Senate sponsors, AAAC refused to participate and withdrew the artworks it had planned to exhibit shortly before the show’s debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artspiral.org/past_exhibitions/june4/pdfs/review_international_examiner.pdf|title=‘Controversial’ Tiananmen art show casualty of flap over NEA|last=Lau|first=Alan|date=19 September 1990|work=International Examiner|access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian American Dance Theatre continued to perform under the artistic direction of Eleanor Yung in New York and around the United States until 1992, and was structured around four areas of programming: (1) its annual New York Dance Season, (2) touring and special performances, (3) Arts-in-Education programs, and (4) the Community School. AADT held its own New York Season in contemporary dance every year from 1976 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspiral.org/aadt.php|title=Asian American Arts Centre - Asian American Dance Theatre|website=www.artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance company’s total repertoire, however, encompassed contemporary dance and traditional Asian folk/classical dance from countries such as China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali, and the Pacific Islands. For its touring performances, AADT’s programs usually consisted of traditional dances and sometimes contemporary dances. AADT also organized special programs such as the ''D’Asia Vu Performance Series'', which ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s. The Arts-in-Education programs and Community School were continued from earlier programming begun in the late 1970s.

During the 14-year run of AADT’s New York Season, the dance company performed at various sites and events throughout New York including Riverside Dance Festival, [[Marymount Manhattan College]] Theater, [[Pace University]] Schimmel Center, [[Dance Theater Workshop]], Open Eye Theater, Clark Center NYC, and Synod House. For its touring performances, AADT performed at colleges and sites in [[Texas]], [[Ohio]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], and numerous other states throughout the country. AADT collaborated with notable choreographers Saeko Ichinohe, Sun Ock Lee, and Reynaldo Alejandro in the Asian New Dance Coalition; the company also invited guest choreographers, dancers, performers, and artists such as Yung Yung Tsuai, [[Muna Tseng]], [[Zuni Icosahedron]], [[Sin Cha Hong]], poets [[Kimiko Hahn]] &amp; Shu Ting, playwright [[David Henry Hwang]], and artist [[Zhang Hongtu]]. Several dance company performances are currently archived in video format at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/asian-american-dance-theater-video-archive#/?tab=about|title=Asian American Dance Theater Video Archive - NYPL Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.nypl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAAC has produced exhibition catalogs, videos, and sound recordings that document visual arts, oral traditions,&lt;ref name="Cheung, King-Kok 1997 pp. 42"&gt;Cheung, King-Kok (editor) (1997). An Interethnic Companion to Asian American Literature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 42. {{ISBN|0-521-44790-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Fong Ten, et al. (1991). ''Singing to Remember''. (VHS tape) New York: Asian American Arts Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; music, and performances. ''ARTSPIRAL,'' a magazine published by AAAC that focuses broadly on city-wide Asian American cultural issues, ran as an annual print publication from 1988 to 1993; it was revived in 2008 as an online blog.&lt;ref name="Cheung, King-Kok 1997 pp. 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artspiral.blogspot.com/|title=Artspiral|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artists-in-Residence program, which supported 19 young artists in total, including [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Margo Machida]], Yong Soon Min, [[Byron Kim]], and [[Dinh Q. Lê]], concluded in 1993.

==== 1993 - 2010 ====
After 1993 AAAC's programs consisted of four areas: (1) contemporary Asian American art exhibitions, (2) folk art exhibitions and research, (3) public education, and (4) the development of a permanent collection. These programs encompassed the preservation of Asian cultural traditions as well as the development of contemporary Asian and Asian American art forms.

AAAC’s main annual exhibition presented young Asian American artists or artists significantly influenced by Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/15/arts/art-review-where-witty-meets-gritty.html|title=ART REVIEW; Where Witty Meets Gritty|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Centre also organized annual solo exhibitions for mid-career artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/23/arts/art-review-when-east-goes-west-the-twain-meet-here.html|title=ART REVIEW; When East Goes West, The Twain Meet Here|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=|work=|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists who have exhibited at AAAC include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Ai Weiwei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspiral.org/artspiral_magazine/issue_01/mcevilley.html|title=Asian American Arts Centre--Artspiral Magazine Issue #1|website=www.artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomie Arai]], [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Natvar Bhavsar]], [[Wafaa Bilal]], [[Luis Camnitzer]], [[Chen Zhen (artist)|Chen Zhen]], [[Emily Cheng]], [[Mel Chin]], [[Albert Chong]], [[Kip Fulbeck]], Chitra Ganesh, [[Gu Wenda]], [[Zarina (artist)|Zarina Hashmi]], [[Tehching Hsieh]], Venancio C.

[[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]] guest curated an exhibition titled ''Aurora'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AAAC partnered with the [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1994 to hold a joint conference and exhibition titled ''Asian American Art and Culture in American Ambiance'' and ''Betrayal/Empowerment'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artasiamerica.org/documents/1623/35|title=Exhibition flyer for "Betrayal / Empowerment", Asian American Arts Centre and Columbia University Teachers College, 1994|last=|first=|date=|website=artasiamerica.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Folk Art program consisted of performances, lectures, and exhibitions, and presented traditional artists during the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] every year. AAAC produced a collection of materials—including a video documentary titled ''Singing to Remember'' in 1971; and later in 2000, CD audio recordings, essays, and song lyrics compiled in a book titled ''Uncle Ng Comes to America''—that captured the life story and artistry of Ng Sheung Chi, also known as Uncle Ng.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artspiral.org/uncle-ng.php|title=Asian American Arts Centre - Uncle Ng|website=artspiral.org|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng, a native of [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan County]] in southwestern China—a region that generated the majority of Chinese immigrants to Chinatown before the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]]—immigrated to the U.S. in 1979. Ng became well-known in New York’s Chinatown as a singer and composer of ''muk’yu'', or [[wooden fish]], a type of narrative folk song typically sung in the Toisanese dialect. Gaining national recognition as a folk artist due to the Arts Centre’s efforts, Ng was awarded the [[National Heritage Fellowship]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/ng-sheung-chi|title=Ng Sheung-Chi|date=2013-01-24|work=NEA|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk Art program also showcased traditions such as [[seal carving]], [[Shadow play|shadow puppets]],  pointed brush technique in [[Chinese calligraphy]], and ornamental art in classical [[Chinese architecture]]. As a gateway for artists, dancers, staff, interns, students, teachers, volunteers, and audience, AAAC has passed on the traditional and contemporary dynamics of its community’s heritage.

The Public Education program began with [[figure drawing]] classes, evolving to offer gallery talks, performances, [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] workshops, and the on-site Saturday Community Art School for children. The off-site education programs took place in public and private schools, and in other community sites in the five boroughs in New York. “Stories of Chinatown”, an off-site program organized in partnership with M.S. 131 that ran from 2001 to 2007, brought local seniors and youth together to make ceramic mural portraits portraying the seniors’ lives.

A frequent recipient and benefactor of government grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) since the 1970s, the Arts Centre experienced a loss in funding when Congress reduced the NEA’s annual budget from $180 million to $99.5 million in 1996 as a result of pressure from conservative American interest groups and Congress members including the [[American Family Association|American Family Foundation]], [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]], and former U.S. Senator [[Jesse Helms#National Endowment for the Arts|Jesse Helms]] amid controversy around government funding toward sexually explicit art by artists such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Andres Serrano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/895438/the-national-endowment-of-the-arts-nea-has-been-under-fire-from-republicans-for-36-years/|title=People have been trying to get rid of the National Endowment for the Arts for 36 years|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also impacted the availability of state- and city-level grant funding from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] (NYSCA) and [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]] (DCLA), both of which receive funding from the NEA. As a local cultural non-profit that derived a large portion of its budget from public funding, AAAC was forced to scale back its programming from the mid-1990s to the late-2000s.

=== Norfolk location (2010–present) ===
In 2010, AAAC officially moved its location from 26 Bowery Street to 111 Norfolk Street. No longer possessing a gallery space, the Arts Centre continues to remain active in the Lower Manhattan community by organizing off-site exhibitions and panel discussions, and by pursuing public arts education through its blog, social media sites, and contributions to publications such as ''Asian American Matters: A New York Anthology'' by Russell Leong. Concurrently, AAAC has redistributed much of its organizational activity towards archival documentation, historical record-keeping, and organizing its extensive permanent collection. As part of its off-site programming, the Arts Centre has frequently collaborated with the [[New Museum|New Museum’s]] biennial Ideas City Festival—in 2013, it hosted a panel discussion at the Festival titled ''Space Time: Presence'' that addressed concepts of quantum [[Spacetime|space-time]] in both an aesthetic and scientific context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newmuseum.tumblr.com/post/48716889539/robert-lee-from-the-asian-american-arts-centre|title=Interview with Robert Lee from the Asian American Arts Centre|last=|first=|date=|work=New Museum|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Think!Chinatown in 2018, AAAC produced a video introduction to fifty artists in its archive, made public in its ''Art Across Archives'' program.

Along with 20 other New York City-based organizations including the [[Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute]], [[En Foco]], and [[Picture the Homeless]], AAAC has both endorsed and received an endorsement from the People’s Cultural Plan (PCP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peoplesculturalplan.org/|title=the Peoples Cultural Plan|website=the Peoples Cultural Plan|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; an equity initiative launched in 2017 to redistribute city government funding and support to artists, art workers, tenants, community art organizations, and various historic neighborhoods in New York City. The PCP’s policy plan for the city is made up of three platforms: equitable housing, land, and development policies; labor equity; and public funding equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/392512/how-nycs-new-cultural-plan-and-the-peoples-plan-can-work-together/|title=How NYC’s New Cultural Plan and the "People’s Plan" Can Work in Tandem|date=2017-07-26|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==

The Arts Centre includes a digital and physical archive. The archive documents Asian American art over the last 60-plus years, and in many cases, the relationship between the artist and AAAC. The physical archive, which is stored at 111 Norfolk Street, consists of approximately 1700 entries of artists’ materials, including biographical materials, publications, statements, project plans, reviews, exhibition materials (press releases, fliers, etc.), catalogs, taped interviews, and samples of works via slides, photographs and/or digital files. The digital archive, which accounts for 10% of the physical archive and contains over 170 entries, is called ''artasiamerica'' and is accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artasiamerica.org/|title=HOME - artasiamerica - A Digital Archive for Asian / Asian American Contemporary Art History|website=www.artasiamerica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Batlló Majesty''''' ({{lang-ca|Majestat Batlló}}, {{IPA-ca|məʒəsˈtad bəˈʎːo|pron}}) is a large 12th-century [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] wooden [[crucifix]], now in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. It is one of the most elaborate examples in [[Catalonia]] of an image of Christ on the Cross symbolizing his triumph over death.

== History ==
The Batlló Majesty is a 12th-century Romanesque [[polychrome]] wood carving now in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in Barcelona, [[Catalonia]]. The Batlló Majesty is one of the finest and best-preserved examples of these Catalan sculptures. Carved wooden images were a fundamental element in churches as objects of worship. One of the most elaborate types in Catalonia was the [[Christ in Majesty]], images of Christ on the Cross that symbolize his triumph over death, of which the most outstanding is the Batlló Majesty. The frontal geometric composition of the [[tunic]] decorated in circles and floral motifs is reminiscent of the refined [[Byzantine]] and Hispano-Moorish fabrics held in such high esteem in the Christian West during this time. The great reference for this type was the [[Volto Santo]] in [[Lucca]]  ([[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]), which was regarded as having miraculous origins and was the object of [[pilgrimage]] and extraordinary devotion from the end of the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/?&amp;lang=en Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Online Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 11th century wood sculpture flourished in Catalonia. Carvers used four main formats to represent the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]:
# 'Calvaries' where [[Jesus]] is represented on the cross with [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].
# 'Deposition Tableaux', or figures of the good and bad thieves [[Mary Magdalene]], [[John the Apostle]], [[Nicodemus]], and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]
# 'Majestats' where large wooden crucifixes showed a triumphant Christ wearing a [[colobium]] (a long sleeveless tunic).
# 'Nude Majestats' where Christ is wearing only a [[perizonium]] (loincloth).&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "A Monumental Catalan Crucifix", Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit. 1997, LXXI, 1-2, p.52, fig.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood carving workshops were still active in the 12th century in the western part of the region in the high valleys of the [[Pyrenees]] in Catalonia. There are over thirty examples of these large crucifixes, called ''majestats''.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "Majestat Batlló", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324.&lt;/ref&gt; The Batlló Majesty has been linked to the region of [[Olot]] near Girona. As with much [[medieval art]], its creator is unknown, although a medieval legend credits [[Nicodemus]] with producing the sculpture soon after the actual [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], a pious tradition repeated elsewhere in Europe in connection with similar monumental crosses, like the better known Volto Santo in the church of San Martino, Lucca, to which they bear a notable similarity in appearance and date, these Catalan crucifixes were believed to have miraculous powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrud Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art. Volume 2. The Passion of Jesus Christ.'' Janet Seligman (tr.), Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1972: 144-5, 472-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of majestats still exist from the Catalan provinces of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Lleida]], and the French province of [[Roussillon]], such that some scholars believe these are monumental crosses once hung in almost every [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church built in these regions as [[rood cross]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "Majestat Batlló", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the ''Majestats'' were the focus of an important and popular cult veneration in these regions as early as the tenth century. They were normally hung near portals of the churches or altars dedicated to the Savior. Often the backs of the majestats were painted with the [[Agnus Dei]] and the Evangelist's symbols suggesting that these crosses were also carried in processions.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Janice. "Majestat Batlló", The Art of Medieval Spain, a.d.500-1200, New York, 1993, p.322-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably it comes from a church in the district of [[Garrotxa]] (Girona). It entered the museum's collection donated by Enric Batlló to the [[Province of Barcelona]] on a permanent loan, 1914. Its inventory Number is 015937-000.

== Description ==
[[File:Majestat Batlló.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the ''corpus'']]
The cross was procured for the museum in 1914 by the collector Enric Batlló, for whom the piece is now named. It was also the same family that commissioned the construction of Casa Batlló in 1877 Barcelona, Catalonia.  At the time of its first arrival at the museum, it was covered with a thick coating of [[varnish]] that obscured but helped preserve its bright colors, which have now been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Trens, M., (1966) Les majestats catalanes, ( Monumenta Cataloniae, XIII) Barcelona p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have revealed the pigments used to produce the colors: the red from [[cinnabar]] and the blue from [[lapis lazuli]]. Both pigments were very expensive and the sculpture is believed to have come from a studio of some importance perhaps the studio around the monastery of [[Ripoll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/?&amp;lang=en Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Online Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
The Batlló Majesty presents Christ bearing his suffering with noble stoicism. It is a triumphant Christ wearing a [[colobium]], or a long, sleeveless tunic. Although the corners of his mouth turn slightly downward, Christ's open eyes and unfurrowed brow create the impression of a self-possessed impassivity. One of the striking features of the Batlló Majesty compared to others, is the well-conserved polychromy. Christ’s colobium, in imitation of rich oriental silk, is decorated with blue floral designs surrounded by circular red frames embellished with dots and circles. A thin belt with an elaborate [[interlace (art)|interlace]] knot pulls the tunic in above Christ’s hips, making the fabric above it swell out slightly and curving the path of its flat, wide vertical folds. Such robes, called [[colobium]]s are linked with royal and priestly functions and provide a message of strength to the viewing audience. They can be seen as a visualization of image of the Apocalyptic Christ from the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Gertrud , Iconography of Cristian Art, Volume II, (1972) London, {{ISBN|0853313245}}, pp.144-145&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition of Jesus in a colobium dates to 586 in a manuscript of the Syriac Gospels called the [[Rabbula Gospels]], written by the [[monk]] Rabbula somewhere in [[Mesopotamia]].  It is thought that the tradition of depicting Christ in such costume was brought to Catalonia by artisans from [[Pisa]] who arrived in 1114 to help [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona]] in his conquest of the [[Balearic Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;PIJOÁN, José, (1927), Historia general del arte, Volumen IX, colección Summa Artis. El arte románico siglos XI y XII, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

A Latin inscription above his head reads, "JHS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM" ("Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews”) as in biblical accounts ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 27:37, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:26, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:38, [[Gospel of John|John]] 19:19).

== Chronology ==
The chronology of the Batlló Majesty is difficult to date, but the inscription on the cross and the painting could be placed in the eleventh century, although other authors dating back to the twelfth century based on the painting’s similarity to ones seen in the area of Ripoll, mid-twelfth century, which is used as an argument to support this dating, and can now be placed into 1150. The tunic also has an analogy with an Islamic motif abacus of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Pierre de [[Moissac]], which seems to prove the spread during the Romanesque period.

A '''booktalk''' in the broadest terms is what is spoken with the intent to convince someone to read a  book. Booktalks are traditionally conducted in a classroom setting for students; however, booktalks can be performed outside a school setting and with a variety of age groups as well. It is not a [[book review]], a [[book report]], or a book analysis. The booktalker gives the audience a glimpse of the [[setting (fiction)|setting]], the [[fictional character|characters]], and/or the major conflict without providing the resolution or [[denouement]]. Booktalks attempt to make listeners care enough about the content of the book to want to read it. A long booktalk is usually about five to seven minutes long and a short booktalk is generally 180 seconds to 4 minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;Bodart, J. R. (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to Carol Littlejohn (''Keep Talking That Book! Booktalks to Promote Reading Volume II'') there is "no known inventor of booktalking".&lt;ref&gt;Bromann, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as teachers and librarians have promoted reading and literacy booktalks have existed. One of the oldest sources to mention the actual art form of booktalking is Amelia H. Munson's ''An Ample Field'' (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Bromann, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[The Fair Garden and the Swarm of Beasts]]'' Margaret Edwards discusses performing booktalks in the 1930s when it was difficult to get into Baltimore schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bromann, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; The actual term "booktalk" was coined in 1985 by [[children's author]] and literature teacher [[Aidan Chambers]],&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, p.&amp;nbsp;333&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Booktalk: occasional writing on literature and children''.

In the 1950s, booktalks were originally designed to motivate [[young adult fiction|young adults]] to read because they had the freedom to read but chose not to.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers don’t read for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to): the notion that reading is not cool, unnecessary, and uninteresting. Books also have to compete with movies, television, the Internet, and other media. By the 1980s, there are also booktalks for adults. For example, booktalks in senior centers and in adult book discussion groups in libraries. Booktalks for adults were geared towards the recommendation of new titles rather than the motivation to read.&lt;ref&gt;Bodart, J. R. (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, booktalks were also created for children to motivate kids to read at a younger age.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, K. A., &amp; Kochel, M. A. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, booktalks for children focused heavily on teaching kids to read using mostly [[picture books]].

==Purpose==
The purpose of a booktalk is to motivate listeners in order to foster good reading, writing and speaking skills by encouraging self-directed learning through reading. Booktalkers also try to incorporate learning opportunities following a book talk which include discussion topics, ideas for journals, papers, [[Poetry|poems]] or other creative writing, panel discussions or presentations (visually and/or orally).&lt;ref&gt;Schall, L. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Book talks are commonly used by school and public [[librarians]], teachers, and reading coaches, to get a reader interested in a book or to recommend similar books. It is an excellent tool for [[reading motivation]]. Booktalks were used long before the advent of the [[Digital Age]], and the "traditional" booktalk of yesterday is still used today. However, librarians and educators have been able to utilize the Internet and [[computer software]] in order to modernize and improve book talks.

==Types of Booktalks==

=== Traditional ===
The traditional booktalk consists of a presenter using few tools to engage his audience, save the [[Manuscript|script]] he has created and a copy of the book itself. Having no real "bells and whistles", the booktalker has to get and keep his audience's attention. While there are plenty of sources available, both on the Web and in print (see external links and further reading below), that provide examples of ready-to-present booktalks most librarians and teachers recommend that the presenter read at least a part of the book he will be booktalking. The presenter must engage the audience as any good public speaker would, with an excited feeling, a non-monotonous tone of voice, and [[eye contact]].

[[Genre]] booktalks and first-person booktalks are fairly popular. Genres to consider for a booktalk may include [[Classic literature|classics]], sports, [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], [[Romance novel|romance]], [[fairy tales]], short stories, [[Mystery novel|mystery]], adventure, [[non-fiction]], short or thin books, [[Horror novel|horror]], [[realistic contemporary fiction]], humor, adult books, [[graphic novels]], and [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Bromann, p.&amp;nbsp;28-41&lt;/ref&gt; A [[genre]] booktalk should consist of multiple books within one chosen genre. The number of books talked depends on the age of the audience. It is encouraged to have multiple genre booktalks ready in case the presenter starts to "lose" his audience.

The first person booktalk is considered most suitable for an "entertainer" presenter and is best suited for books written in first person. The booktalker presents himself as a character from a book.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; The presenter is not limited to characters of the same sex. However, when considering presenting an opposite sex first person booktalk the presenter must keep in mind his audience, as some audiences may be unable or unwilling to use their imagination during the booktalk.

Some librarians and educators consider the non-fiction booktalk to be the best way to win over a young adult audience. Non-fiction booktalks allow the presenter to tell astonishing yet true stories that can garner an [[emotion]]al response. Non-fiction booktalks include a wide range of topics such as poetry, history, music, entertainment, crafts, [[folklore]], [[crime]], [[psychology]], UFOs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; They lend themselves to audience participation, since the presenter can ask questions throughout the booktalk, such as, "Who has heard of a ___?" "Have you ever seen a ____?" or "Who knows what a ____ is?"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; Common approaches to nonfiction booktalks include using visual or mental imagery, vignettes, notable facts and astonishing [[statistics]], booktalking in the first-person point of view, or initially presenting a nonfiction book as though it were fiction and surprising the audience by revealing that it is nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, p.&amp;nbsp;12-13&lt;/ref&gt; Indexes and appendixes should be mentioned if they are included in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Paone, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

From creating book talks on [[Power Point]] to creating a multimedia booktalk with sound clips and video excerpts, the booktalk has gotten a makeover thanks to the [[Digital Age]] (Keane &amp; Cavanaugh, 2009). A number of websites, listed below, have been created solely for the purpose of sharing booktalks or guiding a librarian or educator on how to create one.

Teachers can use these sites to create an assignment for their students, asking them to visit a certain number of sites, browse the reviews and/or booktalks and select one book from each site that interests them. From this list the student can then choose one book to read and report on. The teacher can create a book review blog (i.e. [http://bebookreview.blogspot.com/]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and have the students post their reviews online, as well as comments on other student reviews, subject to teacher approval.&lt;ref&gt;Belben, p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt; By utilizing Web 2.0, such as wikis and podcasts, and software such as Power Point, the presenter can create multimedia booktalks that incorporate film and videos, music and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant-Cohen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Using a projection screen and computer, the presenter no longer has to pass around a book to show cover art, illustrations, or photographs.

Within the scholastic setting librarians can work with teachers to create a set of rotating video booktalks that play in any location that have access to the school's [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit television system]].&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh, p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt; The video booktalk acts as a [[book trailer]] and can be as simple as a taped presentation from a podium to as complex as a reenactment of a scene from a book. The possibilities for the contents of a video booktalk are limited only to the creator's imagination and budget. Creating a video booktalk can be used a class assignment, teaching students not only the tools of a booktalk but incorporating the use of audio/visual materials. Software programs, such as Photo Story, [[iMovie]], and [[Windows Movie Maker]], can be used to create a video booktalk without any expensive equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience==
One way to find out which types of booktalks work best is to create an evaluation form for the audience to complete. Some booktalkers may have a natural inclination for first-person booktalks, while others may present typical third-person book talks, or a book talk that's been digitally enhanced to keep the interest of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Booktalk Evaluation Form, p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt; The audience will also determine the length of the presentation, how many booktalks are presented, how much information to disclose, and the length of the individual booktalks.&lt;ref&gt;Saricks, p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt; The audiences of booktalks are broken down into the following categories: students (broken down into the sub categories: young children, older children, and teens), adults, senior citizens and professionals (for librarians and educators).

Young children have shorter attention spans so booktalks must be kept brief. Older children and teens are able to focus and sit at attention for longer periods of time and so booktalk presentations can be built in to fit within one class period (30–45 minutes). Within this timeframe 15-20 booktalks that are 2–3 minutes in length can be presented.&lt;ref&gt;Paone, p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; The presenter will want to appeal to as many students as possible so the individual booktalks should consist of many genres.

Adult and senior citizen booktalks don’t have to be strictly limited to adult titles. Choosing a children's title that will also pique the interest of adults helps keep this audience aware of current children's literature. The presenter doesn’t need to limit himself/herself to the obvious literary groups and books clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Langemack, p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt; Booktalks for senior citizens that relate to the life experiences or periods of time that the group may have lived during, help keep the audience intrigued and involved. The presenter should also take into consideration books that available in [[large print]] or audio format for older audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Langemack, p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt;

Booktalks for professionals, such as [[librarians]] and [[teachers]], should generally be up to 5 minutes in length and include plot summary, genre, interest and reading levels, and note [[controversial]] issues and curricular interests.&lt;ref&gt;Paone, p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; Booktalks of this nature can be presented in a lecture format. The presenter may also consider including critical reviews from reliable publications.

==Creating a traditional book talk==
Most booktalk creators and presenters suggest only writing an outline of a booktalk so the booktalk can be presented less as a lecture and more as a conversation. They also recommend that the presenter not memorize a script. It is up to the discretion of the presenter exactly how much of the plot to talk about in the booktalk, but it is universally acknowledged that a booktalker should never give away the ending of the book.

In ''The Booktalker's Bible'' seven parameters are considered when planning a book talk: 1. Size of the group; 2. Age of the group; 3. Geography; 4. Time; 5. Money; 6. Frequency; and 7. Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Langemack, p.&amp;nbsp;7-11&lt;/ref&gt; This title also lists six "Golden Rules of Booktalking": 1. Read the Book; 2. Like the Books You Booktalk; 3. Know Your Audience; 4. Booktalk; 5. Don't Tell the Ending!; 6. Leave a List.&lt;ref&gt;Langemack, p.&amp;nbsp;27-32&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating a booktalk, or editing a previously created booktalk, the presenter needs to remember to keep the talk short and simple. The presenter needs to be able to grab the audience's attention in the first sentence. Sonja Cole, host of the video booktalk website Bookwink.com, recommends keeping a booktalk for children to no more the seven sentences. Introduce the main character and setting in sentences 1 and 2, Summarize the conflict in 3 to 5, and sentences 6 and 7 should get the audience thinking about what happens next in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt; When booktalking it is important to remember to connect with their previous experiences and engage with them. The presenter can also define and discuss the characteristics of the type of booktalk and some audiences will benefit from a comparison of print and film versions and why the book is almost always better.&lt;ref&gt;Gruenthal, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of ways to approach a book talk. Lucy Schall&lt;ref&gt;Schall, L. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; (author of many guides to book talks) describes the three following common ways to perform a book talk for all ages:
#Sharing passages aloud and reader response
#Reflecting on specific passages for discussion or writing
#Preparing dramatic readings or performances

Caroline Feller Bauer&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, C. F. (1996). Bauer, C. F. (1997). Bauer, C. F., &amp; Laurent, R. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; offers the following unique alternatives to perform a booktalk for children:
#Making and using crafts with children appropriate to the themes of your books
#Performing simple magic tricks to illustrate the themes of your books
#Using puppets to act out certain passages in a book, to give a booktalk or to narrate a story.

==Effectiveness of book talks==
There is limited research conducted on the effectiveness of booktalks but they clearly demonstrate the increase of booktalked titles being circulated and lack of effect on reading attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Joni Bodart's dissertation (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Bodart, J. (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that:
#Booktalked titles circulated from the library.
#Overall attitudes towards reading is unaffected by booktalks.

Pamela Dahl's thesis (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, P. K. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that:
#Booktalks can have an effect on the number of pages that students report for independent reading.
#Booktalks did not have any effect on students’ reading attitudes.
#Gender breakdown in terms of reading interests was pronounced: 61 percent of females read one book a week compared to 21 percent of males.

Gail Reeder's dissertation (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Reeder, Gail M. (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that:
#Booktalking significantly increased the circulation of booktalk titles.
#Booktalking did not result in a change in reading attitudes.
#Booktalking increased circulation of selected titles but did not extend to other books.

Terrence David Nollen's dissertation (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Nollen, Terrence David (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that:
#Booktalking had no effect on reading attitudes.
#Booktalking had significant effects on student's decisions to check out the booktalked titles.
#Booktalking affected student choice, but only for a very short time.

'''Burnham Baroque''' is an [[architectural style]] developed by American architect [[Daniel Burnham]] at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century. It relies heavily on a stripped [[Classicism]] with [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] inflections. It was popular primarily during the first three decades of the 20th century, particularly among designers of railroad stations.

==Genesis and character of the style==
The term was coined in 1956 by architectural historian Carroll L.V. Meeks{{sfn|Hines|1979|pages=395-396}} in his book ''The Railroad Station: An Architectural History''.{{sfn|Meeks|1956|page=129}}{{Efn|Wolf von Eckardt, architectural critic for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', has written that Burnham Baroque is the accepted term for this particular evocation of the mixed Neoclassical-Baroque-Beaux Arts style, and is as legitimate a descriptor as any other term.{{sfn|Babb|Anderson|Parks|1978|page=141}}}} Meeks credits Burham's staff architect, [[Charles B. Atwood]], with the genesis of the design. Consulting with railroad engineer J.F. Wallace, who ensured that the layout and tracks conformed to accepted industrial practice, Atwood designed the temporary railroad station which served the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Atwood's use of the [[triumphal arch]] and [[colonnade]] in this structure was widely praised, and Meeks says Burnham strongly embraced the new style after the exposition.{{sfn|Meeks|1995|page=129}} Burnham Baroque became Daniel Burnham's favored architectural idiom.{{sfn|Harmon|Lewis|1993|page=64}}

Burnham Baroque relies heavily on Classicism,{{sfn|Hines|1979|page=288}} with restrained Baroque and Beaux-Arts styles{{Efn|Meeks points out that, at the time Burnham Baroque emerged, [[Art Nouveau]] and Beaux-Arts were often intermingled theoretically and in practice.{{sfn|Meeks|1995|page=131}}}} often incorporated into a building's fundamental structure (such as arches) as well as its details and ornament.{{sfn|Breslin|Van Dusen|2011|page=37}}{{sfn|Van Trump|1983|page=229}} [[Architectural historian]] [[Francis Morrone]] has gone further, arguing that Burnham Baroque combines the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school]] with the Neoclassic and Beaux-Arts elements used by the [[City Beautiful movement]]. But where the City Beautiful movement "slathers" ornamentation over a building, Burnham Baroque uses ornament to accentuate structure.{{sfn|Morrone|2003|page=119}}{{Efn|Morrone points out that Burnham Baroque shares many elements with the personal style of architect [[Louis Sullivan]].{{sfn|Morrone|2003|page=119}}}}

Completed in 1910, this Burnham Baroque structure was designed by the firm of Reed &amp; Stern.]]
Burnham Baroque was a highly influential architectural style.{{sfn|Meeks|1995|page=136}} Burnham Baroque was one of five architectural styles utilized by the architectural firm of [[Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White]] in the 1920s.{{sfn|Chappell|1992|page=63}}{{Efn|This firm was the successor to Burnham's firm, D.H. Burnham &amp; Company.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|page=265}}}} It was widely mimicked by architects designing large American metropolitan railroad stations.{{sfn|Meeks|1995|page=130}}

A '''creative director''' is a position often found within the [[graphic design]], [[film]], [[music]], [[video game industry|video game]], [[fashion]], [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], or [[Show business|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well.

A creative director is a vital role in all of the arts and entertainment industries. In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.

==Communication design==

===Advertising===
In the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve [[copywriting]] and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising Creative Director Job Description, Salary, and Training Information." 300+ Job Descriptions: Find Your Dream Job in 2011. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.jobdescriptions.net/business/advertising-creative-director/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.

Creative directors usually possess a [[communication design]] or [[fine art]]s &amp; animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in [[journalism]], [[language arts]], or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.

==Video games==
{{main|Video game producer}}
With the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Sam Lake]], [[Neil Druckmann]], or [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] whose influence extends across more than one project.

The creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, [[computer science]], and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in [[computer programming]] and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Careers in focus:computer and video game design. 2nd ed. New York: Ferguson, 2009. p.17-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

{{Main|Production designer}}

The creative director in the film industry is referred to as the [[production designer]]. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Department – Skillset." Welcome to Skillset – Skillset. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.skillset.org/film/jobs/productiondesign&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music director}}
Creative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active [[musician]], the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Traits and Skills of a Music Director – League of American Orchestras."

==Fashion==
Creative director is the highest creative position in a [[Fashion design|fashion house]]. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. 
A fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Director: Inside Jobs."

In some communities, "e-text" is used much more narrowly, to refer to electronic documents that are, so [[Plaintext|plain text]] file, but that it has no information beyond "the text itself"—no repboldparagraph, page, chapter, or footnote boundaries, etc. Michael S. Hart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_History_and_Philosophy_of_Project_Gutenberg_by_Michael_Hart Michael S. Hart]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, argued that this "is the only text mode that is easy on both the eyes and the computer". Hart made the correct{{Says who|date=April 2015}} point that proprietary word-processor formats made texts grossly inaccessible, but that is irrelevant to standard, open data formats. The narrow sense of "e-text" is now uncommon, because the notion of "just vanilla ASCII" (attractive at first glance) has turned out to have serious difficulties:

First, this narrow type of "e-text" is limited to the English letters. Not even Spanish ñ or the accented vowels used in many European languages cannot be represented (unless awkwardly and ambiguously as "~n" "a'"). Asian, Slavic, Greek, and other writing systems are impossible.

Second, diagrams and pictures cannot be accommodated, and many books have at least some such material; often it is essential to the book.

Third, "e-texts" in this narrow sense have no reliable way to distinguish "the text" from other things that occur in a work. For example, page numbers, page headers, and footnotes might be omitted, or might simply appear as additional lines of text, perhaps with blank lines before and after (or not). An ornate separator line might be represented instead by a line of asterisks (or not).  Chapter and sections titles, likewise, are just additional lines of text: they might be detectable by capitalization if they were all caps in the original (or not). Even to discover what conventions (if any) were used, makes each book a new research or reverse-engineering project.

In consequence of this, such texts cannot be reliably re-formatted. A program cannot reliably tell where footnotes, headers or footers are, or perhaps even paragraphs, so it cannot re-arrange the text, for example to fit a narrower screen, or read it aloud for the visually impaired. Programs might apply [[heuristics]] to guess at the structure, but this can easily fail.

Fourth, and a perhaps surprisingly{{Says who|date=April 2015}} important issue, a "plain-text" e-text affords no way to represent information ''about'' the work. For example, is it the first or the tenth edition? Who prepared it, and what rights do they reserve or grant to others? Is this the raw version straight off a scanner, or has it been proofread and corrected? Metadata relating to the text is sometimes included with an e-text, but there is by this definition no way to say whether or where it is preset. At best, the text of the title page might be included (or not), perhaps with centering imitated by indentation.

Fifth, texts with more complicated information cannot really be handled at all. A bilingual edition, or a critical edition with footnotes, commentary, critical apparatus, cross-references, or even the simplest tables. This leads to endless practical problems: for example, if the computer cannot reliably distinguish footnotes, it cannot find a phrase that a footnote interrupts.

Even raw scanner [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] output usually produces more information than this, such as the use of bold and italic. If this information is not kept, it is expensive and time-consuming to reconstruct it; more sophisticated information such as what edition you have, may not be recoverable at all.

If actuality, even "plain text" uses some kind of "markup"—usually [[control character]]s, spaces, tabs, and the like: Spaces between words; two returns and 5 spaces for paragraph. The main difference from more formal markup is that "plain texts" use implicit, usually undocumented conventions, which are therefore inconsistent and difficult to recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1987|title=Markup systems and the future of scholarly text processing|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|volume=30|issue=11|pages=933–947|doi=10.1145/32206.32209|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/coombs.html|first1=James H.|last1=Coombs|first2=Allen H. |last2=Renear|first3=Steven J. |last3=DeRose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrow sense of e-text as "plain vanilla ASCII" has fallen out of favor.{{Says who|date=April 2015}} Nevertheless, many such texts are freely available on the Web, perhaps as much because they are easily produced as because of any purported portability advantage. For many years [[Project Gutenberg]] strongly favored this model of text, but with time, has begun to develop and distribute more capable forms such as [[HTML]].

The '''Hague School''' is a group of artists who lived and worked in [[The Hague]] between 1860 and 1890. Their work was heavily influenced by the [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painters of the French [[Barbizon school]]. The painters of the Hague school generally made use of relatively somber colors, which is why the Hague School is sometimes called the ''Gray School''.

==Precursors==
[[Image:Wijnand Nuijen01.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Shipwreck on a Rocky Coast'' (1828-39) by [[Wijnand Nuyen]]]]
After the great periods of Dutch art in the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Golden Age]] of the 17th century, there were economic and political problems which diminished activity in art.  The fine arts in the Netherlands enjoyed a revival around 1830, a time now referred to as the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] in Dutch painting. The style was an imitation of the great 17th-century artists.  The most widely accepted paintings of this period were landscapes and paintings which reflected national history. [[Andreas Schelfhout]] was a painter of landscapes, especially winter scenes, but also woodlands and the dunes between The Hague and Scheveningen. His best known pupils included [[Wijnand Nuyen]], [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], and [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]]. Schelfhout's friend and occasional collaborator [[Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen]] principally composed pastoral landscapes like those of Golden Age master [[Paulus Potter]], but trained several prominent Hague School artists, notably his son [[Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen]], [[Willem Roelofs]], [[:nl:François Pieter ter Meulen|Francois Pieter ter Meulen]], [[Hubertus van Hove]], and Weissenbruch. [[Wijnand Nuyen]] was one of the best of the romantic artists of the time and he had a great influence on Weissenbruch and [[Johannes Bosboom]].

Art training at that time was usually in the form of drawing schools, with no painting classes. Many young artists who later became members of the Hague School were frustrated by this and scattered to various places to receive the training they desired. [[Gerard Bilders]] left the Hague Academy of Drawing and completed training with the Swiss animal painter, Charles Humbert. [[Paul Gabriël]] went to Kleve, just over the German border, to study with the landscape painter [[Barend Cornelis Koekkoek]]. [[Jozef Israëls]], unsatisfied with the academies at Groningen and Amsterdam, left for Paris to attend classes at the studio of [[François-Édouard Picot]]. [[Jacob Maris]] left the Hague Academy for the corresponding institution in Antwerp and from there he went to study with [[Ernest Hébert]] in Paris. His brother [[Matthijs Maris]] studied with [[Nicaise de Keyser]] in Antwerp. [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]] left Groningen to perfect his skills in Brussels under [[Willem Roelofs]]. He also received additional instructions from [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], who would later move to England.

==Oosterbeek and Barbizon==
[[Image:Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch - Bosgezicht nabij Barbizon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|'' Forest View near Barbizon'' (1900) by [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]]]]
In the 1830s artists like [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Charles-François Daubigny]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] found their way to Barbizon, a forested area near Fontainebleau. The emphasis of their work here was on painting nature as they saw it - Barbizon was not a school but a community of artists. This gave rise to the well known [[Barbizon school]] and their example was followed in the 1850s by a few Dutch painters who gathered in [[Oosterbeek]] in order to work in the surrounding countryside.

These painters had been influenced by the artists of the Barbizon School and emulated them by registering their impressions with rapid strokes of color.  [[Johannes Warnardus Bilders]], father of [[Gerard Bilders]], moved to Oosterbeek  in 1852 and attracted many pupils: [[Anton Mauve]], a cousin-in-law of [[Vincent van Gogh]], the Maris brothers ([[Jacob Maris|Jacob]], [[Willem Maris|Willem]] and [[Matthijs Maris|Matthijs]]) in the summer, as well as the regular visitors [[Willem Roelofs]] and [[Paul Gabriël]].  Some of these artists, such as [[Jozef Israëls]], [[Jacob Maris]] and [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]] visited Barbizon to paint there.

== The Hague and Düsseldorf ==
There was a slight connection between the "Düsseldorf Art Association" when an exhibition on "Fishing in Scheveningen" occurred. It concerned such artists as {{ill|Carl Hilgers|de}}, {{ill|Hermann Mevius|de}}, {{ill|Carl Adloff|fr}} and [[Andreas Achenbach]].

The call of the Düsseldorf painters' school attracted artists of the Hague school, such [[Johannes Bosboom]] and J. W. Bilders. At the beginning of his career Jozef Israëls went on a study trip to Düsseldorf. Also [[Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen]] and [[Philip Sadée]] came to Düsseldorf. The Düsseldorf academy was famous as a training center for her scenery and histories painting. The bright colour order which distinguishes those paintings is unmistakable.

==The Hague School==
[[Image:Koeien bij een plas (2).jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Cows at a Pond'' by [[Gerard Bilders]]]] [[Gerard Bilders]] had been seeking something of the kind in his own work, but on visiting the national Exhibition in Brussels in 1860, he found what he had been looking for: a colored gray tonality, or as he put it "the impression of a warm, fragrant gray." The muted tones and warm gray that Bilders found here was certainly discussed with his friends in Oosterbeek and found its way into the work of the young Hague School painters.

[[Image:Jacob Maris - Village near Schiedam.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''Village near Schiedam'' by [[Jacob Maris]]]]
The migration of these artists to The Hague began in the late 1860s. [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]] was the first, moving there in 1869.  Jacob Maris returned to The Hague in 1870 after the family's experience in Paris in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  That same year Jozef Israëls came to The Hague, as did Anton Mauve.  Willem Maris, Johannes Bosboom and Weissenbruch had always lived there.  For Mesdag, the move marked the end of his student days in Brussels.  For Maris it meant a break with the Paris dealers, who would not let him paint what he wanted.  Friendship played an important role in this group of  painters and whenever one of them was invited to take part in a major exhibition, he would arrange for his friends to also submit work.  The outside world was thus presented with a picture of a united artistic and stylized front.  The gray tonality was to become one of the characteristics of the Hague School.

[[Image:Anton Mauve - Herderin met kudde schapen.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Shepherdess With a Flock of Sheep'' by Anton Mauve]]
The name "Hague School" was coined in 1875 by a critic, [[Kolff|Jacob van Santen Kolff]],  who used the phrases "a new way of seeing and depicting things", "intent to convey mood, tone takes precedence over color",  "almost exclusive preference for so-called 'bad weather' effects", and "gray mood."  The Hague School artists were less interested in a faithful portrayal of what they saw than in conveying the atmosphere and impression of the moment.  They painted in mostly in subdued colors, with a penchant for gray. That is why the Hague School is sometimes also called the Gray School.

The painters of the Hague School conducted some of their artistic discussions as member of the [[Pulchri Studio]], which had been founded in 1847 by Bosboom,  Willem Roelofs and J. H. Weissenbruch at the home of the Hague painter Lambertus Hardenberg.  Growing discontent among the young artists in The Hague about the apparently insufficient opportunities for training and development was the reason for establishing the Pulchri Studio. Many members of the Hague School served on the board of the Pulchri Studio, so that the society became a bastion of the school for many years.
[[Image:Weissenbruch Jan Hendrik The Shipping Canal at Rijswijk, known as 'The View at Geestbrug'.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''The Shipping Canal at Rijswijk'' by Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch.]]
Over the years, the artists of the Hague School changed.  Jacob Maris enriched his palette with vivid brushwork, especially in his Amsterdam town views. Jozef Israëls had completely abandoned his anecdotal manner and somber coloring. J. H. Weissenbruch blurred the details in his later work, painting beach scenes and landscapes in magnificently conceived planes of color with an almost abstract quality. Willem Maris became the painter of light he had always tried to be, producing summer meadows with sunlight sparkling on the water and cattle—the quintessence of the Dutch landscape. Matthijis Maris' further development was also remarkable, albeit tragic. Despite the support of family and friends, he led a solitary existence. He worked for years on his paintings of brides and portraits of children, which became increasingly hazy and dreamy until finally becoming completely detached from reality.

==Sequel==
[[Image:Anton Mauve - The Return of the Flock, Laren - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''The Return of the Flock at Laren'' by Anton Mauve.]]
By the mid-1880s the united front of the Hague School began to crumble. The character of the city of The Hague changed as it became larger.  The small fishing village of  Scheveningen changed as new suburbs were built and factories transformed the area. Weissenbruch and Roelofs found The Hague to be growing too fast and retreated to the polders to continue painting.

Anton Mauve and Jozef Israëls became active in the Laren School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kettererkunst.com/dict/larener-schule.shtml |title=Larener Schule |publisher=Kettererkunst.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which  perpetuated aspects of the Hague School. [[Albert Neuhuys]], [[Hein Kever]] and [[Evert Pieters]], were especially active there between 1880 and 1900. Realistic interiors of Laren farm houses, as well as plein air landscapes were the preferred subjects of the paintings. Anton Mauve was particularly active in the latter and his views of the heathlands were quite popular with American art lovers.

[[Image:Isaac Israels - Donkeyride.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Donkeyride'' by Isaac Israëls.]]
While The Hague was becoming too large for some, it was too small for others who became influential in the [[Amsterdam Impressionism]] group which developed there. This movement drew on city life for its subject matter, although the contrast with the Hague School was less pronounced than is occasionally suggested.  This group included some  who are designated below as members of the second generation of the Hague School such as [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]] (son of Jozef Israëls),  [[Willem Bastiaan Tholen]] and [[Willem de Zwart]] (also known as William Black). In addition, [[Willem Witsen]],  [[Floris Verster]], [[Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller]] and [[Jan Toorop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/jan-toorop|title=Jan (Theodorus) Toorop|author=Oxford Grove Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; have some background with the Hague School and are considered to be in the [[Amsterdam Impressionism]] movement.

Although not usually associated with the Hague School,  [[Johan Jongkind]] was called a forerunner of impressionism who influenced [[Eugène Boudin]], who later was mentor to [[Claude Monet]]. Others who had at least a tangential connections with the artists of the Hague School are [[Charles Rochussen]], [[Richard Bisschop]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].

Around the 1890s in France, impressionism was followed by post-impressionism, which places greater emphasis on the form, structure and content of the painting. This movement, too, was picked up in the Netherlands, resulting in a Dutch post-impressionism and introducing abstract elements and cubism into modern painting. Famous examples are [[Vincent van Gogh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/index.php?id=31791&amp;langId=en|title=The Hague School and young Van Gogh|author=Haagse Gemeentemuseum}}&lt;/ref&gt; who received his first art training from [[Anton Mauve]], as well as [[Piet Mondrian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Mondrian.htm|title=Modern Landscapes|author=Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College}}&lt;/ref&gt; who initially  painted in the manner of the Hague School and then in a variety of styles and techniques documenting his search for a personal style.

[[File:Blank page intentionally end of book.jpg|thumb|350px|Intentionally blank pages at the end of a book]]
&lt;!--

If you're thinking of blanking this page: don't. It's been done. Nobody will laugh. We probably won't even be motivated enough to block you from editing, it will be treated as vandalism, but don't count on that. On the other hand, to see literal renderings of this article, please visit http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Blank_Page and http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nihilism

--&gt;
An '''intentionally blank page''' or '''vacat page''' (from Latin: ''vacare'' for "being empty") is a [[page (paper)|page]] that is devoid of content and may be unexpected. Such pages may serve purposes ranging from place-holding to space-filling and content separation. Sometimes, these pages carry a notice such as "'''This page''' [is] '''intentionally left blank.'''" Such notices typically appear in printed works, such as legal documents, manuals, and exam papers, in which the reader might otherwise suspect that the blank pages are due to a [[printing]] error and where missing pages might have serious consequences.

==Uses for intentionally blank pages==
[[File:AEC blank page.png|250px|left|thumb|An intentionally blank page on a PDF document from the [[Australian Electoral Commission]]. The document has 80 printable pages, and content ends on page 77.]]

Intentionally blank pages are usually the result of printing conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an odd-numbered page ([[Recto and verso|recto page]]); therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet in such a way that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an [[even working]], and the group of pages is called a section or '''signature'''. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages that is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.

For example, if a book with 318 pages of content is printed using 32-page signatures, it will require 10 signatures, 320 pages in total.  At the very end of the book — that is, at the end of the last signature — there will be 2 unused (blank) pages.

If a printer's document processor has been designed to skip completely blank pages, notices may also be required on intentionally blank pages to prevent incorrect [[page numbering]].

Intentionally blank pages are ubiquitous in technical and instructional manuals, directories, and other large, mass-produced volumes of text. The contents of manuals produced by a given product's vendor are often compiled from generic instructions suitable for a variety of products, with additional instructions or chapters included for the specific product or model in question. This automation of manual generation leads to intentionally blank pages to fit the requirements for mass printing.

In digital documents, pages are intentionally left blank so that the document can be printed correctly in double-sided format, rather than have new chapters start on the backs of pages. Intentionally blank pages have also been used in documents distributed in [[ring binder]]s. The intention is to leave room for expansion without breaking the document's page numbering. This allows updates to be made to a document while requiring minimal new pages, reducing printing costs. The only drawback is the increased time required by the reader to manually insert various newly updated pages into their correct locations in the document.

===Standardized tests===
[[File:No test material on this page.svg|thumb|right|250px|Intentionally blank page in the style used in [[standardized test]]s]]
Intentionally blank pages can be useful in [[standardized test]]s such as the [[GCSE]], [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]], [[SAT]], [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[ACT (examination)|ACT]], [[MCAT]], and [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]. In these exams, there are often individual, timed sections in which test-takers are prohibited from proceeding to the next section until that section's time interval has passed and the examiner allows them to continue. Because all of these separate sections are printed consecutively in the examination booklet, it may be possible for a test-taker who has finished the section early to see through the page and read the problems in the next section. By placing intentionally blank pages between these sections, the test-taker is prevented from cheating in this way. By printing a notice on the page, such as "this page has been intentionally left blank", test-takers will not be concerned that their test has been misprinted, especially as test instructions often instruct students to check for missing or blank pages and to report any defective test booklets to a proctor. These pages may also be useful as [[scratch paper]].

===Sheet music===
In books of [[sheet music]], relatively short pieces of music that span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span the left and right pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.

===Classified documents===
In the United States armed forces, classified{{how?|date=July 2017}} documents require page checks whenever custody is transferred or an inventory is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaney |first=Scott |title=NAVEDTRA 14127: Intelligence Specialist 3 &amp; 2, Volume 1 |work=Non-Resident Course |publisher=Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center ([[United States Navy]]) |url=http://www.militarynewbie.com/pubs/NAVEDTRA%2014127%20-%20Intelligence%20Specialist%203%20&amp;%202,%20Volume%201.pdf |date=November 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714094003/http://www.militarynewbie.com/pubs/NAVEDTRA%2014127%20-%20Intelligence%20Specialist%203%20%26%202%2C%20Volume%201.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blank pages are all marked "This page intentionally left blank", so page checks are unambiguous, and every page of the document is accounted for.

==Variations==
Intentionally blank pages placed at the end of books are often used to balance the [[Bookbinding|folio]]s that make up the book (see [[bookbinding]]). Often these pages are completely blank with no such statement or are used as "Notes" pages, serving a practical purpose. In the case of [[telephone directory|telephone-number directories]], these pages are often used to list important numbers and addresses.  These pages may list other books available from the same publisher.

Book publishers have also used stylized designs ([[dingbat]]s) underneath the last paragraph of a chapter to indicate that no other content is to be expected until the next chapter, allowing for the possibility of blank pages without misunderstandings by the readers.

There are also published books that, as a novelty, [[empty book|contain nothing but blank pages]].

==Examples==
*[[Andy Griffiths (author)|Andy Griffiths]]' book ''[[Just Stupid!]]'' begins with a cartoon snail saying to the reader, "This page would be blank if I were not here telling you that this page would be blank if I were not here telling you that..." on an endless loop.
*Humorist [[Don Novello]]'s 1977 book ''The Lazlo Letters'' ends with several otherwise-blank pages marked "FREE PAPER!".{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}
*Comedian [[Demetri Martin]]'s book ''This Is A Book'' contains an otherwise blank page which says, "This page unintentionally left blank."
*[[List of Iranian writers|Iranian novelist]] [[Reza Amirkhani]]'s book ''Man-e-oo'' (His Ego) has one whole chapter of blank pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ermia.ir/contents.aspx?id=762 |title= آن چه در وب راجع به من او نوشته‌اند (۱۵)  (What has been written about ''Man-e-oo'' on the web (15)|last1= Amirkhani|first1= Reza |date= 18 February 2012 |website= Reza Amirkhani's Official Website |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The phrase was a recurring joke in [[Infocom]] text adventure games. In their first title, ''[[Zork 1]]'', inspecting an engraved wooden door resulted in the text: "The engravings translate to 'This space intentionally left blank'."
*[[Idries Shah]]'s book ''[[The Book of the Book]]'' contains 10 pages describing why the following pages are important, and then a big amount of blank pages. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the theory that you shouldn't judge the content by its container.&lt;ref name="The book at google books."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Idries|title=The book of the book.|date=1969|publisher=Octagon Pr.|location=London|isbn=9780900860126|edition=4. impr.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WviNfB2q_oEC&amp;pg=PP3&amp;dq=shah+The+Book+of+the+Book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI95nJ-LeIxgIV727bCh3AvQCO#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were [[Spencer Asah]], [[James Auchiah]], [[Jack Hokeah]], [[Stephen Mopope]], [[Lois Smoky]], and [[Monroe Tsatoke]].

==Background==
'''Stephen Mopope''' (1898–1974), the oldest in the group, was born on the Kiowa Reservation in [[Oklahoma Territory]]. His relatives, including his great-uncles [[Silver Horn]] and [[Fort Marion]] [[ledger art]]ist Ohettoint, recognized his artistic talent at an early age and taught him traditional Kiowa painting techniques.&lt;ref name=mopope&gt;Watson, Mary Jo. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/M/MO017.html Mopope, Stephen (1898-1974)]. ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' (retrieved 12 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; '''Jack Hokeah''' (ca. 1900/2-1969) was orphaned at a young age and raised by his grandmother. Later in life, [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] potter [[Maria Martinez]] adopted him as a son and he lived with her family for a decade in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=jacob&gt;[http://www.jacobsonhouse.com/about_kiowafive.html "About the Kiowa Five."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307094108/http://www.jacobsonhouse.com/about_kiowafive.html |date=2009-03-07 }} ''Jacobson House Native Art Center.'' (retrieved 12 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; '''Monroe Tsatoke''' (1904–1937) was born near [[Saddle Mountain, Oklahoma]]. His father Tsatokee ("Hunting Horse") was his first artistic influence.&lt;ref name=tsatoke&gt;Watson, Mary Jo. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/T/TS001.html Tsatoke, Monroe (1904-1937)]. ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' (retrieved 12 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  '''James Auchiah''' (1906–1974) was born near present-day [[Medicine Park, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=auchiah&gt;Watson, Mary Jo. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AU001.html Auchiah, James (1906-1974)]. ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' (28 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was Red Tipi, a ledger artist, medicine man, and bundle keeper.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, 30&lt;/ref&gt; '''Spencer Asah''' (ca. 1905/1910-1954) was born in [[Carnegie, Oklahoma]]. His father, a buffalo medicine man, provided Asah with the traditional cultural background to inspire his art.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, 26&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lois Smoky''' (1907–1981), born near [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], was the youngest of the group and the only woman.&lt;ref name=smoky&gt;Watson, Mary Jo. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SM009.html Smoky, Lois (1907-1981)]. ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' (retrieved 12 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==St. Patrick's Mission School==
Five of the artists attended the St. Patrick's Mission School in Anadarko, serving Kiowa, Comanche and Apache children. Operating from 1872 to 1996, the school, also known as the Anadarko Boarding School, was the longest surviving of the seven schools for Native American children in Oklahoma operated by St. Patrick's Mission.&lt;ref&gt;White, James D. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=ST010 "St. Patrick's Mission."] ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' Retrieved February 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There, the five Kiowa artists received formal art instruction from a [[Choctaw]] nun, Sister Mary Olivia Taylor (1872–1931).&lt;ref name=smoky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chickashaarts.org/nuns-of-st-joseph-st-patrick-mission "Nuns of St.Joseph &amp; St. Patrick Mission."] ''Chickasha Area Arts Council: Cemetery Tour 2007''. (retrieved 12 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Monroe Tsatoke did not attend St. Patrick's and did not receive formal art training until the Anadarko Agency field matron, [[Susan Peters]], took an interest in the young Kiowa artists and established an art club. Peters arranged for Mrs. Willie Baze Lane of [[Chickasha, Oklahoma]], to give them painting lessons.&lt;ref name=siris&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!85940!0 Pochoir prints of ledger drawings by the Kiowa Five, 1929.] ''Smithsonian Institution Research Information System.'' (retrieved 12 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Oklahoma==
[[Susie Peters]] encouraged Swedish-American artist [[Oscar Jacobson]], the director of the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s art department to create a special program for the Kiowa artists. In 1926, Asah, Hokeah, Tsatoke, and Mopope moved to [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]]. They were soon joined by Lois Smoky in 1927&lt;ref name=siris/&gt; and lived together in a house rented by Lois Smoky's parents.

Jacobson provided studio space for the group, but felt that he did not want to interfere with the direction their painting was taking. Dr. Edith Mahler, an art professor at OU provided painting instruction and critiques. In the fall of 1927, James Auchiah joined the program at OU.&lt;ref name=siris/&gt;

Lois Smoky returned home in 1927, leaving the program. She married and was devoted to her family. Although she did not continue painting, she became a beadwork artist. Since her paintings are the rarest, they have become the most collectible of the group.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref name=smoky/&gt;

==Art career==
While Jacobson did not wish to dictate subject matter to the six artists, he actively promoted their work. He arranged for their work to be shown at the [[Denver Art Museum]]. In 1928, Jacobson entered their watercolor paintings in the First International Art Exposition in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], where they received international acclaim. Their work continued to be exhibited throughout Europe. In 1929, Jacobson collaborated with a French printer to produce  ''Kiowa Art,'' a portfolio of 24 [[pochoir]] prints of paintings by Asah, Hokeah, Tsatoke, Mopope, and Smoky of intertribal dancers, ceremonies, musicians, and Kiowa daily life.&lt;ref name=siris/&gt;

When they participated in the 1932 [[Venice Biennale]], their exhibit "was acclaimed the most popular exhibit among all the rich and varied displays assembled."&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kiowa Six are considered significant in the development of Native American painting by bridging the era of [[Ledger Art]] to flat-style Southern Plains painting.&lt;ref name=jacob/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2007-08-29|title=Jacobson brought 'Kiowa Five' to world prominence|author=David Dary|url=http://www.normantranscript.com/centennialokla/local_story_241164208.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906052043/http://www.normantranscript.com/centennialokla/local_story_241164208.html|archivedate=2012-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MY7jSgKlc14C&amp;pg=RA25|title=A Western Legacy: The National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum|author=Steven L.

==Artwork==
Inspired by the narrative, representational qualities of [[Plains hide painting]] and [[ledger art]], the Kiowa Six created a new style of painting that portrayed ceremonial and social scenes of Kiowa life and stories from [[oral history]], which is characterized by solid color fields, minimal backgrounds, a flat perspective, and emphasis on details of dance regalia.

{{Culture of Korea}}
'''Korean folklore''' is well established, going back several thousand years. The folklore's basis derives from a variety of belief systems, including Shamanism, Confucianism, Buddhism and more recently Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://koreanhistoricaldramas.com/korean-folklore-goblins-and-other-beings/|title=Korean Folklore – Goblins and Other Beings|date=2016-12-16|work=Sageuk: Korean Historical Dramas|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mythical creatures often abound in the tales, including the Korean conception of goblins.

== Types of Folklore ==
There are many types of folklore in Korean culture, including [[Imuldan]] (이물담), focused on supernatural beings such as monsters, goblins and ghosts. The most common of which are the [[Dokkaebi]] (도깨비), meaning goblin. However, this term differs from the European concept of 'goblin' in that they do not possess a evil or demonic characteristic. Instead, they are creatures with powers that seek to both bring delight to people and misery. These beings engage either in friendly or annoying behavior with humans. Their interactions with humans represent the belief in the supernatural and their interactions with humanity. The presence of these beings is meant to represent both difficulties and pleasures in life.[http://koreanhistoricaldramas.com/korean-folklore-goblins-and-other-beings/]

== Contemporary Revival ==
A revival on internet sites occurred recently, providing inspiration for artists and illustrators.

Recent achievements in keeping Korean folklore alive include the 150-part animated TV series, "[[Animentary Korean Folklore]]", telling old tales with a traditional 2-D Korean styled animation.

'''Librairie Avant-Garde ([[Mount Wutai]] Branch)'''  is a bookstore opened by [[Qian Xiaohua]] in 2004, now regarded as the most representative bookstore in [[Nanjing]], [[China]]. It has become a cultural icon of the city, and because of the adjacency to [[Nanjing University]] and the popularity among students, it is dubbed as "the second library of Nanjing University".

The bookshop is hidden in a former government parking lot underneath [[Wutaishan Stadium]], which has been used as a bomb shelter. Covering 3780 sq meter, it provides a large volume of social science and humanities books that have been recognized by the literati and history, ranging from [[literature]], [[history]], [[philosophy]],  [[Film|movie]], [[music]], [[photography]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[cartoon]] and [[Advertising|advertisement]] to [[social science]], [[business]] and [[journalism]], while excluding [[reference work]] and other practical books.

== Founding ==
After all the hardship of running the bookstore, bankruptcy in 2003 and the unpredictable, [[Qian Xiaohua]] restored energy and opened a flagship bookstore in an underground parking lot, on Guangzhou Road. Because at the time most friends of Qian were [[avant-garde]] writers, and he himself was an avid  [[French literature]] lover, he named the bookstore Librairie Avant-Garde, in which Librairie is a French word that means bookshop. He hoped the bookstore could serve as a spiritual guide for the people making their way in darkness. "A good bookshop should provide space, vision and nurture the city with its humanitarian spirit," owner Qian Xiaohua tells CNN. "It's a place for people to have dreams in the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/03/travel/worlds-coolest-bookstores-new/|title=World's coolest bookstores|last=Cha|first=Frances|date=August 4, 2015|website=CNN Travel|publisher=CNN|access-date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has three siblings and seven half-siblings on her father's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://covenantfuneralservice.com/obituary?id=307599 |website =Covenant Funeral Service |title =Thomas Bohner Goddard |access-date =27 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She got interested in politics during her childhood.&lt;ref name="adweek"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/fbdc-interview-new-author-cnns-lisa-desjardins/|title=FBDC Interview: New Author, CNN’s Lisa Desjardins|last=Dornic|first=Matt|date=6 May 2011|website=[[Adweek]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 June 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desjardins studied at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], between 1990 and 1994, earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; Subsequently, she went to Russia for two years to study at [[Herzen University]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where she studied [[Russian studies]] and learned to speak [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Starting in 1996, she attended [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University's]] [[Medill School of Journalism]]. She received a [[Master of Science]] degree in journalism from that university the following year.&lt;ref name="zombie"/&gt;

== Career ==
Desjardins' first job in journalism was at the local television station [[WBTW]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], between 1998 and 1999, when she was fired.&lt;ref name="adweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zombie"/&gt; Next, she worked as a freelance reporter for ''[[The Sun News]]'', a Myrtle Beach newspaper, and, at the same time, as a freelance reporter for the news agency [[Reuters]]. After a few months, in October 1999, she left ''The Sun News'' and joined the [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] NBC-affiliate [[WIS]] as a political reporter, while she remained a reporter for Reuters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/lisa-desjardins-joins-newshour/242529 |website =Adweek |access-date =28 June 2018 |title =Lisa Desjardins Joins ‘NewsHour’ |last =Ariens |first =Chris |date =8 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At WIS, she covered the [[South Carolina General Assembly|South Carolina Legislature]], the debate on the [[Modern display of the Confederate flag#Display at South Carolina State Capitol|display of the Confederate Flag]] at the [[South Carolina State House]], and the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Republican presidential primaries]].&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; In 2003, Desjardins became a newswoman at the [[Washington, D.C.]] bureau of the [[Associated Press]], where she reported on, among other things, the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]; [[Medicaid]]; hurricanes; and the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

After that, Desjardins joined [[CNN]], where she would work for nine years between 2005 and 2014.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; She was CNN Radio's [[United States Congress|Congress]] correspondent, but she occasionally reported for CNN.com and CNN's news channel as well.&lt;ref name="zombie"/&gt; When CNN Radio was shut down in June 2013, she was transferred to CNN's Washington Bureau, where she worked as a Capitol Hill reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/evan-perez-lisa-desjardins-join-cnn-washington-bureau/189360 |website =Adweek |access-date =27 June 2018 |date =15 July 2013 |title =Evan Perez, Lisa Desjardins Join CNN Washington Bureau |last =Knox |first =Merrill }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was part of the team that covered the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential primaries]]. CNN received a [[Peabody Award]] in 2008 for their coverage.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/coverage-of-2008-presidential-primary-campaigns-and-debates |website =[[Peabody Awards]] |title =Coverage of 2008 Presidential Primary Campaigns and Debates (CNN) |access-date =23 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, Desjardins reported on the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] for CNN Radio, whose coverage was awarded a [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.spj.org/sdxa10.asp |title =2010 Sigma Delta Chi Award Honorees |access-date =23 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at CNN, she wrote a [[personal finance]] book together with [[Rick Emerson]] called ''Zombie Economics: A Guide to Personal Finance''.

She posted a video about her departure and time at CNN on her last day on [[YouTube]], which has been viewed over 350,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://deadline.com/2014/08/cnn-reporter-laid-off-youtube-video-826978/ |title =A CNN Star Is Born As She Is Shown The Door: Video |last =de Moraes |first =Lisa |access-date =23 June 2018 |date =29 August 2014 |website =[[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date =23 June 2018 |website =[[YouTube]] |last =Desjardins |first =Lisa |date =28 August 2014 |title =Lisa's CNN Goodbye |url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmLt0rjWwr0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="217125">A '''[[New Testament minuscule]]''' is a copy of a portion of the [[New Testament]] written in a small, cursive Greek script (developed from [[Uncial script|Uncial]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minuscules 2001-2500==
* The numbers (#) are the now standard system of [[Caspar René Gregory]], often referred to as the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbers.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 100 year increment where specific date is unknown.
* Content generally only describes sections of the New Testament: [[Gospel]]s, The [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts), [[Pauline epistles]], and so on. Sometimes the surviving portion of a codex is so limited that specific books, chapters or even verses can be indicated. Linked articles, where they exist, generally specify content in detail, by verse.
* Digital images are referenced with direct links to the hosting web pages, with the exception of those at the [[INTF]]. The quality and accessibility of the images is as follows:

{| style="background:transparent"
|bgcolor="sandybrown"|Gold color indicates high resolution color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="tan"|Tan color indicates high resolution color images available locally, not online.
|-
|bgcolor="wheat"|Light tan color indicates only a small fraction of manuscript pages with color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="lightgray"|Light gray color indicates black/white or microfilm images available online.

&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates manuscript also includes a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates lost portions of manuscript replaced via supplement of a later hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;abs&lt;/sup&gt; (''abschrift'') Indicates manuscript is copy.&lt;br /&gt;
[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, was found to be written in modern Greek versus Koine Greek, was proved a forgery, or has been destroyed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36801">[[Speedruns]] are popular for a large variety of games. Most high-level speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]]. The speedrunning community originated on [[internet forum|discussion forums]] in the late 90s and early 2000s, where the fastest routes through early [[first-person shooters]] were discussed. Later-on, as speedrunning became more popular, specific video games became known as common speedrunning candidates. Some modern [[indie games]] are explicitly designed for speedrunning.

December 1993 saw the release of [[id Software|id Software's]] ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''. Among some of its major features, like at that time unparalleled graphics, LAN- and Internet-based multiplayer support, and user modification possibilities, it also gave the players the ability to record demo files of their playthrough. This particular feature was first picked up by Christina “Strunoph” Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.

This site was, however, quickly obsoleted by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'', launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060208154353/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/~fms27/dht/dht5/ DOOM Honorific Titles]&lt;/ref&gt; This site would create the basis for all DOOM demosites that would follow. The DHT were designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on pre-determined maps in the [[IWAD]]s. These 'exams' became very popular as the player had to earn each title by sending in a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify their application. Doom II was released in October 1994, and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new Doom version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles. For example, playing with only the fists and pistol while killing all monsters on a map became known as Tyson mode, named after the heavyweight boxer [[Mike Tyson]]. Pacifist-mode was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had easy, medium, and hard difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. Many legends in the Doom speedrunning scene started out in the DHT, including George Bell (Tyson), Steffen Udluft (Pacifist), Kai-Uwe “Gazelle” Humpert, Frank “Jesus” Siebers (Nightmare), Thomas “Panter” Pilger (Reality), and Yonatan Donner. Unfortunately, the DHT always had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, made public interest wane as the years rolled on.

In November 1994, the Doom speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, took off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/index.cgi |title=C O M P E T - N |publisher=Doom2.net |date=2005-06-21 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005630/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/index.cgi |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of Doom-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they all centered around one key idea: speed. Players were required to run through Doom's levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards which eventually made Doom one of the most popular games for speedrunning.{{refn|group=Note |name=Most Popular|This statement is based on both the amount of demos and the total amount of recorded demo time, which far exceed those of other games that are popular with speedrunners.}}

Like the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was even at [[Simtel|Cdrom.com]] for a while before István Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to the now defunct FTP server [ftp://ftp.sch.bme.hu/ ftp.sch.bme.hu]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}. From there on, since early 1998, it was in the hands of Ádám Hegyi, who has been the maintainer ever since. It was located for some time at [http://www.doom2.net/ Doom2.net]. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bužanić took over maintaining the site and re-created a new database for WADs and PWADs. It is currently located at http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n.

As of March 2006, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.&lt;ref name="DoomStats"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = COMPET-N | accessdate = March 25, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060212152418/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | archivedate = February 12, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was the only game to rival ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' as the most popular game to speedrun.{{refn|group=Note |name=Most Popular}} People first started recording demos of ''Quake'' playthroughs when it was released in June 1996 and sharing them with others on the &lt;tt&gt;demos/e&lt;/tt&gt; directory in [[Simtel|Cdrom.com]]'s ''Quake'' file hierarchy. There were two distinct kinds of demos: those in which the player killed all monsters and found all secrets on the map (called 100% demos) and those in which the player ignored these goals in order to finish the level as fast as possible (called runs). All levels were, at that time, recorded solely on the “Nightmare” difficulty level, the highest in the game.

In April 1997, Nolan “Radix” Pflug first started the Nightmare Speed Demos web site to keep track of the fastest demos. The first ''[[Quake Done Quick]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetquake.com/QdQ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114082242/http://www.planetquake.com/qdq/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-01-14 |title=Quake done Quick |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the game, carrying over one level's finishing statistics to the next. The run ended up finishing the entire game on Nightmare difficulty in 0:19:49;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090131110937/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqr.html Quake Done Quick: QdQr]&lt;/ref&gt; an astonishing feat at that time. It received widespread attention from gaming magazines, being distributed with free [[Compact disc|CDs]] that usually came with them. This popularized speedrunning for a much larger audience than before and attracted many newcomers. Not all of those newcomers agreed with the old-timers's dogma that runs should be made on the hardest possible skill level. Thus, in August 1997 Muad'Dib's ''Quake'' Page came to be, run by Gunnar “Muad'Dib” Andre Mo and specializing in “Easy” difficulty runs. One month after that, the famous ''Quake Done Quick'' movie was superseded by a new movie called ''Quake Done Quicker'', on September 14, 1997, which improved the game's fastest playthrough time to 0:16:35.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In April 1998, Nolan and Gunnar merged their pages, thus creating [[Speed Demos Archive]], which today is still the central repository for ''Quake'' speed demos of any kind. Ever since its creation, a large variety of tricks have been discovered in the ''Quake'' physics, which kept players interested even up to today, more than two decades after Quake's release. Subsequently, ''[[Quake Done Quick|Quake Done Quick with a Vengeance]]'' was released on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through ''Quake'' in the hugely improved time of 0:12:23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415034604/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-04-15  |title=Quake Done Quick: QdQwav |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2006, Speed Demos Archive contains a total amount of 8481 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 253 hours, 44 minutes and 39 seconds.&lt;ref name="QuakeStats"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = Quake (PC) - Speed demo collection | publisher = Internet Archive | accessdate = March 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fastest minimalist single-segment completion times that have been recorded thus far, as of June 10, 2006, are 0:13:46&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/demos/ER/all_1346.dz Downloadable demo]&lt;/ref&gt; for the easy difficulty run and 0:19:50&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/demos/NR/all_1950.dz Downloadable demo]&lt;/ref&gt; for the nightmare difficulty run, both by long-time ''Quake'' speedrunner Connor Fitzgerald.

=== ''Quake Done Quick'' ===
{{Main|Quake Done Quick}}
An important aspect of the ''Quake'' speedrunning community is ''[[Quake Done Quick]]'', a collection of movies in which the game is finished as fast as possible with special rules and aims. Unlike the normal records listed above, these movies are created one level at a time rather than in one continuous play session; as such, it is possible for multiple people to help create the movie by sending in demos of individual levels, and much faster times can be aimed for as the segmentation allows one to easily try again upon committing an error. It also allows runners to only have to focus on a small portion of the game rather than all of it.

These movies are by far more popular than the conventional records, both in the community itself and outside of it. Some of them, most notably the movies that feature a fast playthrough of the game on the Nightmare difficulty level without additional voluntary challenges, have even been distributed with gaming magazines and posted on news sites. [[Slashdot]] has published an announcement of the then newly created ''Quake Done Quick with a Vengeance'' movie on its front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/09/14/1223230&amp;tid=112 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; Quake Done Quick - With A Vengeance |publisher=Games.slashdot.org |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the series' movies, this one is also the most popular. In it, the entire game is finished in 0:12:23 on “Nightmare” difficulty, the hardest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221161546/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-21  |title=Quake Done Quick: QdQwav |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This run succeeded ''Quake Done Quicker'' and the original ''Quake done Quick'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090131110937/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqr.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; movie, in which the game was finished in respectively 0:16:35 and 0:19:49.&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuicker"&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/all_1635.txt| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080103145316/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/all_1635.txt | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 3, 2008  | title = Quake done Quicker | publisher = Quake done Quick | author = The Quake done Quick team | accessdate = December 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the latest installment being over 4 minutes faster, an improvement that surpassed the initial expectations of the runners,&lt;ref name="SequenceBreakingExample"&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?qdq/qdqwav.dz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054530/http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?qdq%2Fqdqwav.dz |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |title=History of the routes in QdQwav |publisher=FilePlanet |author=The Quake done Quick team |accessdate=March 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the discovery of [[bunny hopping]], which allowed runners to attain a much higher speed in most levels and even made it possible to save rockets or grenades for jumps that could now be done without them.&lt;ref name="BunnyHopReference"&gt;See the [[Speedrun#Techniques 2|Quake Techniques]] paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; This movie is currently being improved by new and old runners for a production called ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance Part II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/projects/qdqwavp2/ |title=Quake done Quickest |publisher=Speeddemosarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2006, the improvements that have been made thus far would result in a time of 0:11:32 for the entire game, an improvement of 51 seconds.&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeancePartIIProgress"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/projects/qdqwavp2/tables.html | title = Quake done Quick with a Vengeance Part II | publisher = Speed Demos Archive | author = Speed Demos Archive contributors | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the productions have been turned into [[Machinima]] movies, using so-called “recams” (showing the run from preset camera perspectives rather than the first-person view) and sometimes even custom skins, models, and a script to turn them into [[film]]s rather than speedrun videos.

== ''Metroid'' series ==
''[[Super Metroid]]'' (Nintendo, 1994) achieved popularity with speedrunners due to the emergence of console emulators with demo-recording features.&lt;ref name=1up&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&amp;did=1|title = Smashing the Clock|publisher = 1UP.com| last=Turner|first=Benjamin |date=2005-08-10|accessdate = August 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal ''Super Metroid'' gameplay, the player may find certain items such as "high-jump boots". Since the path through the map is non-linear, it is complicated to find the most efficient speedrunning routes: areas with seemingly essential power-ups can be bypassed at the expense of the improved mobility. This drove the discovery of [[sequence breaking]], in which a player can acquire power-ups before the game design intends, allowing whole sections of the map to be skipped.&lt;ref name=1up/&gt; As of September 2018 the current Any%{{refn|group=Note |name=Any|"Any%" refers to beating a game without having to play through any optional content, and, in Super Metroid's case, without the use of major glitches.}} world record is held by speedrunner Behemoth, with a time of 41 minutes and 18 seconds.

Because the ''Metroid'' series awards players for completing the game with a faster time, groups of player were inspired to discuss techniques on message boards such as [[GameFAQs]] and to capture and post video of full playthroughs. Despite internet limitations in the early 2000s, the ability to share video footage of ''Metroid'' runs allowed speedrunners to collaborate and learn from one another.&lt;ref name="Bad Jump"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/zelda-wind-waker-speedrun/|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|title=For the World’s Fastest Gamers, Failure Is Just One Bad Jump Away|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|date=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during online discussions of ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' that the term "sequence breaking" was first widely used.&lt;ref name="Polygon money"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/1/9/5280786/making-money-zelda-speed-runner|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|title=Making money as a Zelda speed runner|last=Li|first=Roland|date=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Super Mario'' series ==
[[File:Super_Mario_World_arbitrary_code_injection.jpg|thumb|left|By injecting [[arbitrary code execution|arbitrary code]] into the memory of ''[[Super Mario World]]'' in the form of [[video game sprite|graphical sprites]], speedrunners can reprogram the entire game on the fly.&lt;ref name="PC MAG arbitrary code" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt;]]
{{see also|List of Super Mario speedrunning records}}

Early [[platform games]] of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular in the speedrunning community. ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' are particularly notable for speedrunning accomplishments. Most notable speedruns of ''Super Mario'' games are generally carried out without [[Tool-assisted speedrun|tool-assistance]], though speedrunners make frequent use of [[video game glitch|glitches]] and even [[memory corruption]] to make optimal times.

The current record holder of the first game in the ''Super Mario'' series, ''Super Mario Bros.'', is speedrunner somewes, who beat the game in 4 minutes, 55 seconds, and 796 milliseconds on October 22, 2018. This was done by using many frame-perfect tricks and in-game warps. More novel achievements have also been accomplished in ''Super Mario Bros.'', such as beating the game with the [[Score (game)#Video games|lowest score possible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/guy-beats-super-mario-bros-with-the-lowest-score-possib-1526905435|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Guy Beats Super Mario Bros.

The record-time for beating ''Super Mario World'' is in the hands of speedrunner FURiOUS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Super Mario World Leaderboard |url=https://www.speedrun.com/smw#0_Exit |website=speedrun.com |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who beat the game in 41 seconds and 866 milliseconds on June 19, 2018. This was done by making the credits of the game roll using [[arbitrary code execution|arbitrary code injection]] in the first level of the game, however this is not considered an entirely fair way of beating the game, and is best done using tool-assistance.&lt;ref name="PC MAG arbitrary code"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|publisher=''PC Magazine''|title=Speedrunner 'Beats' Super Mario World in Under 5 Minutes|last=Murphy|first=David|date=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|publisher=''Ars Technica''|title=How an emulator-fueled robot reprogrammed Super Mario World on the fly|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/174659-super-mario-world-speedrun-hack-takes-up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a-to-the-next-level|publisher=''ExtremeTech''|title=Super Mario World speedrun hack takes up up down down left right left right B A to the next level|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/22/super-mario-world-record-_n_6522082.html|publisher=''The Huffington Post''|title='Super Mario World' Speedrun Record Smashed Using Bizarre Glitch|last=Rundle|first=Michael|date=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' is a game that is very commonly speedrun at [[Awesome Games Done Quick]]. Charlie Hall of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' has described speedruns of ''Yoshi's Island'' as a "great introduction to the showmanship and the rich community" behind the Games Done Quick marathons. Through exchanging strategies and doing theory routing, the ''Yoshi's Island'' speedrunning community collaboratively work on pushing the time down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/why-speed-running-is-the-greatest-thing-about-gaming-729|publisher=''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''|title=Why Speed-Running Is the Greatest Thing About Gaming|last=Whelan|first=David|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/27/9047665/sgdq-trihex-yoshis-island-2015|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|title=SGDQ's first run shows off the skill, community that makes it all possible|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/05/twitch-tv-speedrun-interview/|publisher=''VentureBeat''|title=Can live speedruns compete with e-sports?

It is possible to speedrun ''Super Mario 64'' in various ways. Though speedruns exist of people playing through the game as intended, it is possible to skip large portions of ''Super Mario 64'' by using glitches. Using a glitch dubbed the "backwards long jump," with which the [[player character]] can move through walls, a player can skip almost all levels of the game and beat it in only a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Bad Jump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo Glitches"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/5-nintendo-games-you-can-beat-in-minutes-because-of-glitches-6387128|publisher=''[[Houston Press]]''|title=5 Nintendo games you can beat in minutes because of glitches|last=Rouner|first=Jeff|date=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing ''Super Mario 64'' 100%—i.e., collecting all the game's "stars"—is also a popular method of playing through the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-accidentally-broken-1616736/|publisher=''Geek''|title=Super Mario 64 speedrun world record accidentally broken|last=Humphries|first=Matthew|date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/guy-breaks-super-mario-64-world-record-by-accident-1688469992|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Race Leads To New World Record For Collecting 120 Super Mario 64 Stars|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the 120 Stars category has become much more competitive. The current record time for Super Mario 64 in the "120 Stars" category was set on February 8, 2018 by the Twitch streamer Cheese05 with a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 19 seconds.

== ''The Legend of Zelda'' series ==
{{see also|List of The Legend of Zelda speedrunning records}}
The [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''The Legend of Zelda'']] and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' are popular speedrunning candidates. The record for the first game in the series is currently held by speedrunner LackAttack24 in 28 minutes and 37 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/165262422?t=02s|title=(28:37) The Legend of Zelda - any% no up+a (current world record)|last=|first=|date=2017-07-08|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any%{{refn|group=Note |name=Any}} speedruns of this game involve a great deal of movement optimization and item drop management, as well as some amount of luck.

===''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''===

''Ocarina of Time'' speedruns used to take hours to carry out, as the game contains a large amount of long, mandatory dungeons. During the 2000s, the community of Speed Demo Archives discovered various glitches in the game that allowed players to skip portions of it. The "Door of Time Skip", for instance, allows player character [[Link (character)|Link]] to sequence break and skip many of the game's levels by passing through a wall. In 2012, the "Wrong Warp" glitch was discovered, which allowed Link to [[warp (gaming)|teleport]] from the first dungeon to the final boss of the game, making 20 minute speedruns of ''Ocarina of Time'' possible.&lt;ref name="Polygon money" /&gt;

Speedruns of ''Ocarina of Time'' are somewhat dependent of the [[video game console|console]] the game is played on. Originally, speedrunners played ''Ocarina of Time'' on the Chinese-only [[iQue Player]], because it has quicker loading times and faster scrolling text than the [[Nintendo 64]] version. However, the current record was achieved with the Japanese version of ''Ocarina of Time'' played on the [[Wii Virtual Console]], as this version of the game includes an exploitable glitch not present in other versions.&lt;ref name="Gamerant Ocarina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/world-record-ocarina-of-time-speedrun-skater82297/|publisher=''Gamerant''|title=Gamer Sets New World Record for ‘Ocarina of Time’ Speedrun|last=Gates|first=Christopher|date=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' has been described as "one of the most intricate and well-documented games for speed running" because of its familiarity and potential for glitches.&lt;ref name="Polygon money" /&gt; The current any% world record is in hands of skater82297, with a time of 17 minutes and 07 seconds, beating Torje's previous record of 17 minutes and 09 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/oot|publisher=''Speedrun.com''|title=Ocarina of Time|date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current 100% world record is held at a time of 3 hours 53 minutes and 33 seconds, which belongs to American runner Zfg, who has held the 100% speedrun world record since March 19, 2015 and had previously become the first person to complete the 100% run in under 4 hours, doing so on August 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/oot#100|title=The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Leaderboard - speedrun.com|last=|first=|date=|website=speedrun.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/3/17649600/zelda-ocarina-of-time-speedrun-100-percent-world-record|title=Ocarina of Time speedrunner breaks four-hour barrier for a 100% run (Corrected)|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/08/its-been-a-groundbreaking-month-for-ocarina-of-time-speedrunning/|title=It's Been A Groundbreaking Month For Ocarina Of Time Speedrunning|date=2018-08-25|work=Kotaku Australia|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Dark Souls'' series==
''[[Dark Souls]]'', a 2011 game by [[From Software]], is known for its unforgiving gameplay, but despite this, the game is very popular among speedrunners. Through the use of several intricate skips, glitches, and wrong warps, it is possible to complete an Any%{{refn|group=Note |name=Any}} run in under 35 minutes, though average players take dozens of hours playing through the game once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5966725/watch-this-speed-run-take-down-dark-souls-in-32-minutes|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Watch This Speed Run Take Down Dark Souls in 32 Minutes|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-speed-run-record-completes-the-game-in-less-than-50-minutes/|publisher=''PC Gamer''|title=Dark Souls speed run record completes the game in less than 50 minutes |last=Presscot|first=Shaun|date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/01/19/dark-souls-how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-speed-run-record/|publisher=''[[VG247]]''|title=Dark Souls beaten in less than 50 minutes in new speed run record|last=Hillier|first=Brenna|date=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/16/dark-souls-speed-run-is-a-tour-de-force-of-tolerance/|publisher=''[[Engadget]]''|title=Dark Souls speed run is a tour de force of tolerance|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|date=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21-minute speedruns are possible because of a glitch dubbed the "Kiln Skip", which can be used to skip almost the entire second half of the game.

The current world record for the All Bosses category speedrun is held by CapitaineToinon, clocking in at 1:09:02 IGT (in-game time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://speedsouls.com/darksouls:All_Bosses|title=All Bosses - Speed Souls - A Dark Souls Speedrunning Wiki|website=speedsouls.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any% runs of its sequel, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', can be done in under 20 minutes, as it is possible to avoid almost all battles in the game and to move around the world at a "ridiculous pace" using the "binoculars" item. The tricks that make a run this short possible were patched out, but can still be used if current patches aren't downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-2-completed-in-20-minutes/1100-6420071/|publisher=''[[GameSpot]]''|title=Dark Souls 2 Completed in 20 Minutes|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/3/5775250/dark-souls-2-speed-run|publisher=''Polygon''|title=This Dark Souls 2 player can speed run through the game in 20 minutes|last=Gera|first=Emily|date=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/it-s-possible-to-beat-dark-souls-ii-in-20-minutes-275813.phtml|publisher=''Destructoid''|title=It's possible to beat Dark Souls II in 20 minutes|last=Devore|first=Jordan|date=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Spelunky''==
''[[Spelunky]]'', a 2012 indie [[platform game|platformer]] created by [[Derek Yu]], has been a common candidate for speedrunning, with its fastest runs taking between one and two minutes. As ''Spelunky'' features a large amount of random [[procedural generation]], speedrunners cannot solely rely on memorization. To have a chance in beating the current record, a speedrunner must get a specific [[random seed]], though despite this, skillful players may recognize repeating level patterns and know how to optimally use the game's items, such as a difficult to use "teleporter" that allows a player to skip large chunks of a level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-07-spelunky-speedrun-world-record-set-at-1-47-182|publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]''|title=Spelunky speedrun world record set at 1:47.182|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-14-spelunky-speed-run-sets-new-world-record|publisher=''Eurogamer''|title=Spelunky speed run sets new world record|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/18/9171939/watch-spelunky-beaten-in-101-seconds-in-a-world-record-speed-run|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|title=Watch Spelunky beaten in 101 seconds in a world record speed run|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/spelunky-world-record-speedrun-looks-like-magic-1703102779|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Spelunky World Record Speedrun Looks Like Magic|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|date=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the high difficulty of the game, even ''Spelunky''{{'s}} "Hell" levels have been used for speedrunning, with the world record sitting under four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/13/9150207/spelunky-speedrun-hell-world-record-3-minutes-44-seconds|publisher=''Polygon''|title=See someone finish Spelunky in less time than it takes us to make a sandwich|last=Kollar|first=Philip|date=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly difficult run of the game is the so-called "[[eggplant run]]", in which a player has to go through a specific set of objectives to turn the final boss into an [[eggplant]]. This was done [[single-player game|solo]] for the first time in November 2013 by speedrunner [[Bananasaurus Rex]], though it took him 90 minutes. Douglas Wilson of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' dubbed this run "2013's most fascinating video game moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/spelunkys-first-solo-eggplant-run-completed-makes-for-a-tense-hour-of-platforming/|publisher=''PC Gamer''|title=Spelunky's first solo eggplant run completed, makes for a tense hour of platforming|last=Morrison|first=Angus|date=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/11/5093020/spelunky-eggplant-run-video|publisher=''Polygon''|title=Spelunky player achieves the elusive solo Eggplant Run|last=Tach|first=Dave|date=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/23/5227726/anatomy-of-a-spelunky-miracle-or-how-the-internet-finally-beat|publisher=''Polygon''|title=A breakdown of 2013's most fascinating video game moment|last=Wilson|first=Douglas|date=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maqbool Fida Husain''' (17 September 1915&amp;nbsp;– 9 June 2011)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.culturalindia.net/indian-art/painters/m-f-hussain.html, also , India's Most Famous Painter, Dies at 95|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 June 2011|author=[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a modern [[Indian people|Indian]] painter of international acclaim, and a founding member of [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]].

Husain is associated with Indian [[modernism]] in the 1940s. His early association with the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group used modern technique, and was inspired by the "new" India after [[Partition of India|The Partition]] of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified [[Cubist]] style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—sometimes treated in series—include topics as diverse as [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Mother Teresa]], the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]], the [[British raj]], and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. Early in his painting career, and until his death, he enjoyed depicting the lively and free spirit of horses in many of his works.Husain is the most celebrated and internationally recognized Indian artist of the 20th century. Husain is primarily known for his paintings, but is also known for his drawings and his work as a printmaker, photographer, and filmmaker. Some of his later works stirred controversy, as they depicted traditional deities of India in non-traditional ways including nude portrayals of the deities.

He also directed a few movies. In 1967, he received the [[Discontinued and Intermittent National Film Awards|National Film Award for Best Experimental Film]] for ''Through the Eyes of a Painter''.&lt;ref name="15thaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dff.nic.in/2011/15th_nff_1967.pdf|title=15th National Film Awards|publisher=[[International Film Festival of India]]|accessdate=21 September 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he directed ''[[Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities]]'', a film he worked on with his artist son [[Owais Husain]], which was screened in the Marché du Film section of the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/Meenaxi-Tale-of-3-cities-screened-at-Cannes/223181|title=Meenaxi: Tale of 3 cities screened at Cannes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Husain was born on 17 September 1915 in [[Pandharpur]] to a [[Sulaymani]] Bohra family who trace their roots back to [[Gujarat]] within the last 200 years, and then originally to Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caravanmagazine.in/essay/understanding-husain|title=Understanding Husain|date=3 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked up taste in art through studying calligraphy while he stayed at a Madraasa in [[Baroda]].&lt;ref name=gulf2/&gt; Husain attended the [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar |first1=Anu |title=JJ Institute: 150 years of lettering the poor |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990109/00950535.html |work=Indian Express |date=9 January 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526071758/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990109/00950535.html |archivedate=26 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai. To earn extra money, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often travelled to Gujarat to paint landscapes when he could afford to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webindia123.com/personal/paint/husain.htm|title=MF Husain|accessdate=29 July 2015|publisher=Web India}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husain developed his painting skills in the 1930s, painting billboards for the growing Bollywood film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/arts/design/m-f-husains-modern-india-at-the-art-institute-of-chicago.html|title=M.

The artists cite "The Partition" of India and Pakistan 14 August 1947, with its resulting religious rioting and heavy loss of life as their reason for forming The Progressive Artist's Group in Bombay in December 1947. The artists saw the Partition as a "turning point" for India, and their new style of art was urged on by, and was also a turning point for, (modern) Indian Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=progressive-artists-group-of-bombay-an-overview&amp;iid=29&amp;articleid=800|title=Progressive Artists Group of Bombay: An Overview|website=www.artnewsnviews.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husain's first solo exhibit was in 1952 in Zurich.&lt;ref name="contemporaryindianart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryindianart.com/m_f_husain.htm|title=M.F.

===1990 – 2005===
His paintings allegedly hurt the religious sentiments of [[Hindutva#Cultural nationalism|Hindu nationalist groups]], which beginning in the 1990s mounted a campaign of protest against him.&lt;ref name=nytimesmfdies&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/arts/design/maqbool-fida-husain-indias-most-famous-painter-dies-at-95.html?ref=deathsobituaries|title=Maqbool Fida Husain, also , India's Most Famous Painter, Dies at 95|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 June 2011|author=[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings in question were created in 1970, but did not become an issue until 1996, when they were printed in ''Vichar Mimansa'', a Hindi monthly magazine, which published them in an article headlined "M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher".&lt;ref name=nytimesmfdies/&gt; In response, eight criminal complaints were filed against him. In 2004, [[Delhi High Court]] dismissed these complaints of "promoting enmity between different groups ... by painting Hindu goddesses – Durga and Sarswati, that was later compromised by Hindu fundamentalist groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi HC dismisses complaints against M.F.

In 1998 Husain's house was attacked by Hindu fundamentalist groups like [[Bajrang Dal]] and art works were vandalised. The leadership of another fundamentalist political party [[Shiv Sena]] endorsed the attack. Twenty-six Bajrang Dal activists were arrested by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=R.|title=Assault on art|url=http://frontlineonnet.com/fl1510/15100210.htm|newspaper=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|date=9–22 May 1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714034825/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1510/15100210.htm|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests against Husain also led to the closure of an exhibition in England.

He has also produced &amp; directed several movies, including ''[[Gaja Gamini]]'' (2000) (with his [[Artistic inspiration|muse]] [[Madhuri Dixit]] who was the subject of a series of his paintings which he signed ''Fida''). The film was intended as a tribute to Ms. Dixit herself.&lt;ref name="muse"&gt;{{cite web|title=youtube.com|work=The work of the muse|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aOqSTkZw7I|accessdate=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2013}} In this film she can be seen portraying various forms and manifestations of womanhood including the muse of [[Kalidasa]], the [[Mona Lisa]], a rebel, and musical euphoria. He also appeared in a scene in film ''[[Mohabbat (1997 film)|Mohabbat]]'', which had Madhuri Dixit in lead role. In the film, the paintings that were supposedly done by Madhuri were actually Husain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/168469/reema-nath-made-husain-act.html |title=Reema Nath made Husain act in 'Mohabbat' |newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]] |date=13 June 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make ''[[Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities]]'' (with [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]). The film was pulled out of cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to one of the songs in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=Shiv|title=Husain pulls Meenaxi out of theatres|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040417/nation.htm#8|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=16 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The All-India Ulema Council complained that the [[Qawwali]] song ''[[Meenaxi (Soundtrack)|Noor-un-Ala-Noor]]'' was blasphemous. It argued that the song contained words directly taken from the Quran. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain's son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung by the central character played by [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist withdrew his movie from cinemas. The film was well received by the critics, however, and went on to win various awards.

===2006 - 2011===
In February 2006, Husain was charged with "hurting sentiments of people" because of his nude portraits of [[Hindu deities|Hindu gods and goddesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M F Husain booked for his paintings of nude gods|url=http://ia.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/07nude.htm|publisher=[[Rediff]]|date=7 February 2006|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 6 February 2006 issue, ''[[India Today]]'', a national English weekly published an advertisement titled "Art For Mission Kashmir". This advertisement contains a painting of {Bharatmata} (Mother India) as a nude woman posed across a map of India with the names of Indian States on various parts of her body. The exhibition was organised by [[Nafisa Ali]] of Action India (NGO) and Apparao Art Gallery. Organizations like [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) have protested persistently against Husain displaying the painting on the websites and even in exhibitions in north Europe. As a result, Husain apologized and promised to withdraw the painting from an auction, which was later sold for Rs 80 lakh in the auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MF Hussain apologises for obscene paintings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-02-07/india/27814790_1_hjs-m-f-hussain-noted-painter|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=7 February 2006|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HJS lodges FIR against Nafisa Ali for selling Hussain's art|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=354472|newspaper=[[Outlook India]]|date=10 February 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204065111/http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=354472|archivedate=4 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting later appeared on Husain's official website.

Social Activist, [[Rahul Easwar]], went to Kerala High Court and it granted an interim order to stay the granting of the award until the petition had been disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/14/stories/2007091460170400.htm |title=High Court restraint on award for M.F.

M. F. Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's most highly prized artist MF Husain dies aged 95|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13708844|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the [[Royal Brompton Hospital]] in London, and was buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] on 10 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/06/09/mf-husain-dies-%E2%80%93-lauded-in-exile-by-india%E2%80%99s-artistic-fraternity/|first=John|last=Elliott|title=MF Husain dies – lauded in exile by India's artistic fraternity|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418054453/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/06/09/mf-husain-dies-%E2%80%93-lauded-in-exile-by-india%E2%80%99s-artistic-fraternity/|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Indian artists expressed criticism. [[Satish Gujral]] publicly asked Husain whether he would dare to portray Islamic figures similarly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A brush with genius|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nm17/A-brush-with-genius/Article1-153431.aspx|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=24 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022035103/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nm17/A-brush-with-genius/Article1-153431.aspx|archivedate=22 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Gujral stated that he deeply regretted the way Husain was treated and forced into an exile because of what Gujral termed "the mob culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gupta |first=Shekar |title=On the record: 'Husain's exile makes me ashamed of my culture. . . the state hasn't expelled him, mob culture has' |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/293365-3.html |newspaper=[[Indian Express]] |date=7 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511140359/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/293365-3.html |archivedate=11 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Pioneer (daily)|The Pioneer]]'', Chandan Mitra wrote, "As long as such a law exists in the statutes, nobody can be faulted for approaching the courts against Husain's objectionable paintings, nor can the judiciary be pilloried for ordering action against the artist for his persistent and deliberate refusal to appear before the court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitra |first=Chandan |title=Art for God's sake |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&amp;file_name=mitra%2Fmitra250.txt&amp;writer=mitra |accessdate=27 September 2007 |newspaper=[[The Pioneer (newspaper)|The Pioneer]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927035639/http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&amp;file_name=mitra%2Fmitra250.txt&amp;writer=mitra |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the controversy, Husain's admirers petitioned the government to grant Husain the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest award. According to [[Shashi Tharoor]], who supported the petition, it praised Husain because his "life and work are beginning to serve as an allegory for the changing modalities of the secular in modern India – and the challenges that the narrative of the nation holds for many of us. This is the opportune and crucial time to honour him for his dedication and courage to the cultural renaissance of his beloved country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tharoor|first=Shashi|title=Our stories|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/11/26/stories/2006112600090300.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=26 November 2006|authorlink=Shashi Tharoor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his part Husain stated that leading Hindu leaders have not spoken a word against his paintings, and they should have been the first ones to have raised their voice and only people with political intentions created controversy.&lt;ref name=gulf2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=365512&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |title=I just want to work in peace, says Husain |first=Nahla |last=Nainar |newspaper=[[Gulf Times]] |date=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607131252/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=365512&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |archivedate=7 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Husain's death, Shiv Sena chief [[Bal Thackeray]] said, "He only slipped up on the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses. Otherwise, he was happy and content in his field. If his demise is a loss for modern art, then so be it. May Allah give him peace!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Husain only 'slipped up' on depiction of Hindu gods: Bal Thackeray|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2091454.ece|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Ambarish|title=Gave up the country, not his obduracy|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-10/india/29642114_1_m-f-husain-sena-leader-raj-thackeray|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 June 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bal Thackeray: MF Husain 'slipped'; Raj: Time to put controversies behind|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_bal-thackeray-m-f-husain-slipped-raj-time-to-put-controversies-behind_1552998|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=9 June 2011|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Madonna of the Book''''', or the '''''Madonna del Libro''''', is a small painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Sandro Botticelli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/sandro-botticelli|title=Sandro Botticelli|publisher=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universalium.academic.ru/237120/Botticelli,_Sandro|title=Botticelli,_Sandro|publisher=/universalium.academic.ru|accessdate= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is preserved in the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli|Poldi Pezzoli Museum]] in Milan. The painting is executed in [[tempera]] on panel. It dates from between 1480 and 1483.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/en/node/631 |title=Madonna of the Book |publisher=www.museopoldipezzoli.it|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Malaguzzi|Botticelli|2004|page=40}}

==Description==
The ''Madonna of the Book'' is a soft and elegant work, in which [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus|Child]] are seated by a window in the corner of a room. She holds a [[Book of Hours]], the Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis, prayer books for laymen common in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. The infant is gazing at his mother whilst she is absorbed in reading the book. The hands of both mother and son are positioned similarly, with the right hands open as in a gesture of blessing, and left hands closed.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;
 
Symbolizing the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], the Christ Child is holding the three [[Nail (relic)|nails]] of the [[Christian cross|cross]], and the [[crown of thorns]]. These are probably later additions, added to make the message more explicit.&lt;ref name="milano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt; This is the conventional representation in the Christian [[iconography]]. In addition, the fruit in the bowl has an emblematic meaning. The [[cherry|cherries]] represent the [[blood of Christ]] or are an allusion to Paradise, [[plum]]s indicate the tenderness between Mary and the Child, and the [[Common fig|figs]] are characteristic of the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;

Mary's blue robe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/faq/faq12.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904024808/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/faq/faq12.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-04 |title=The Dayton University - The Marian Library International Marian research Institute |publisher=campus.udayton.edu |accessdate=November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a color she is often depicted wearing, has the symbolic meanings of purity, heaven, and royalty.&lt;ref name="madonna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madonnaandchild.wordpress.com/jasons-essay/|title=Madonna and Child /The artist here depicts Mary clad in her trademark blue robe.

The characters in Botticelli's work are displayed as melancholy and thoughtful."&lt;ref name="artble"/&gt;}}
&lt;!-- A more intellectual relationship between mother and son, rather than a loving one, so unlike the works painted by [[Raphael|Raphael Sanzio]], in which often she looks at her child smiling.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/madonna-and-child-with-the-book/|title=Madonna and Child with the Book, by Raphael Sanzio|publisher=totallyhistory.com|accessdate= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Botticelli interprets the scene with a sensitivity and love for small details: the set of boxes and the [[maiolica]] bowl of lush fruits are depicted as a [[still life]]; the pages of the book, the garments, and the transparent veils exhibit a realistic tactile quality.&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/22/2libro.html |first1=Emil |last1=Krén |first2=Daniel |last2=Marx |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |title=Madonna of the Book (Madonna del Libro) |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is refined with a good balance. Botticelli painted with subtle differences in colour, and he was able to put colours together so that they complement each other admirably. The painting is adorned with gold [[filigree]] decorating the clothes and objects. The use of gold was the result of the contractual agreement he made with the commissioner, and was included in the price of the painting.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-virgin-and-child-the-madonna-of-the-book/cgHULpr5dnz9JA?hl=en#!asset-viewer:l.id=cgHULpr5dnz9JA&amp;hl=en|title=The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book)1480 |publisher=[[Google Cultural Institute]] |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;{{efn-ua|"Known also as the Madonna of the Book, this painting represents the Virgin and Child in a domestic setting, intent on reading a volume, perhaps a Book of Hours. A window is open on the landscape at twilight, but the diffused light which transforms the space into a mystical setting seems to emanate from the figures themselves.}}&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt; Dating from about 1480, the painting shows all the elements of Botticelli's mature poetic style: a delicate, elegant linearity, a style which is still far from the intense pathos of his late work."&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt;  The identity of his patron is unknown.{{sfn|Malaguzzi|Botticelli|2004|page=40}}

The interrelationship of light, shapes and voids confers an ethereal quality to the work.{{efn-ua|"The glimmer which pervades them seems to be unleashed by these figures and it spreads throughout the surrounding spaces. Besides the light, even the pyramid-like layout of the two sacred figures feeds the perception of an absolutely perfect moment."&lt;ref name="milano"/&gt;}} Indeed, the painting might be considered as newly rediscovered, as a recent restoration revealed a luminescent sky and bright morning aura, which had been obscured by layers of centuries-old varnish.&lt;ref name="Backus"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/GdM_traduci_notizia.php?IDNotizia=386348&amp;IDCategotia= |title=Botticelli exhibit unveils surprises for art scholars: Show at Milan's Poldi Pezzoli museum gathers eight key works |first1=Emily |last1=Backus |newspaper=[[La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno]] |location=Milan |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Onuchina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20110104_boticelli_milan.html |title=Eight masterpieces by Botticelli in Milan |date=1 April 2011 |first1=Maria |last1=Onuchina |publisher=ARTinvestment.RU |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One is reminded of other Marian images made prior to the year 1470. Botticelli might have been influenced by [[Filippo Lippi]]'s ''Madonna and Child with an Angel'' from the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] in Florence.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt; &lt;!-- The painting has a rectangular shape, which is rare in the later production of Botticelli in the 1470s. --&gt;

Botticelli and the ''Madonna of the Book'' were the subject of renewed interest in the 19th century. In its "extraordinary beauty" it appealed to Italians in particular who saw in it a source of national identity, during Italian unification ("[[Risorgimento]]").&lt;ref name="Sidney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=8813 |title=New light on Botticelli's beauty: Discoveries at the Poldi Pezzoli Museum, Milan |date=13 March 2012 |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Botticelli's admirers was [[Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli]], who bequeathed his private collection and his apartment to the public.&lt;ref name="Sidney"/&gt;  Dr Annalisa Zanni, the Poldi Pezzoli Museum director, recently discovered more about Botticelli's technique and use of materials, as exemplified in the ''Madonna of the Book''. For example, she discovered that Botticelli's top layer of blue was [[lapis lazuli]], a "very precious and very expensive ingredient, indicating it was commissioned by a highly prestigious patron".&lt;ref name="Backus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Onuchina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidney"/&gt;

The World's '''Most Phallic Building contest''' was a contest held in 2003 by ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine to find the building which most resembled a [[human penis|human phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Gutierrez |title=Another claim to fame for Liberty Memorial |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FFE6184248A5271&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=2003-12-29 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
The contest originated when writer [[Jonathan Ames]] drew the ire of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' readers by claiming, in a diary that was later published in his book ''I Love You More Than You Know'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brendan |last=Halpin  |title=Delightful essays of life's ups, downs in 'I Love You'; I Love You More Than You Know |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/990634401.html?dids=990634401:990634401&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+21%2C+2006&amp;author=Brendan+Halpin&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=BOOK+REVIEW%3B+Delightful+essays+of+life's+ups%2C+downs+in+%60I+Love+You'%3B+I+Love+You+More+Than+You+Know+Essays+Jonathan+Ames+Black+Cat%3A+270+pp.%2C+%2413+paper&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower|Williamsburg Bank Building]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] was the world's most phallic. This led ''Cabinet'' magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the "world's most phallic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jonathanames.com/blog/archive/events/2003_07_13_archive.html| title = Most Phallic Building?| year=2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002073201/http://www.jonathanames.com/blog/archive/events/2003_07_13_archive.html|archive-date=2011-10-02|access-date=2016-11-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gawker.com/news/realestate/the-most-phallic-building-in-the-world-contest-12901.php| title = Jonathan Ames article causes stir| year=2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625120558/http://gawker.com/news/realestate/the-most-phallic-building-in-the-world-contest-12901.php|archive-date=2009-06-25|access-date=2016-11-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/willie/willie.html| title = Williamsburg Bank?| year=2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808042704/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/willie/willie.html|archive-date=2011-08-08|access-date=2015-11-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors.

==Results==
After months of entries and discussion, the [[Ypsilanti Water Tower]] in [[Ypsilanti]], [[Michigan]], was announced as the winner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A the awards: the 9 most remarkable things in culture this month.(man at his best) |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19676527_ITM |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the winner of a readers' poll was the [[Florida State Capitol]] building in [[Tallahassee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Harrison |title=Site of the week |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/05/1067989605047.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=2003-11-06 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable nominee was the [[Torre Agbar]] (Agbar Tower) in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=High Society: Contemporary Highrise Architecture and the International Highrise Award 2006 |last= Gräwe |first=Christina |author2=Schmal, Peter Cachola |year=2007 |publisher=Jovis |isbn=3-936314-77-2 |pages=Dust jacket |url=http://www.artbook.com/3936314772.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cabinet'' noted that the Ypsilanti Water Tower, called "the brick dick" by locals, "is clearly the world's most phallic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/phallic/winner.php| title = Cabinet Magazine Winner |year=2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002203209/http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/phallic/winner.php|archive-date=2007-10-02|access-date=2016-11-10|dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was designed by William R. Coats and constructed as part of an elaborate city waterworks project. Located on the highest point in [[Ypsilanti]], erection began in 1889 and was completed in 1890, at a cost of US$21,435.63.&lt;ref name="YWT"&gt;"[http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=L1591.htm Ypsilanti Water Tower] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505024904/http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=L1591.htm |date=2012-05-05 }}". Retrieved on 2009-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Made of Joliet [[limestone]], the tower is 147 feet tall, has an 85-foot base and holds 250,000 gallons when full.&lt;ref name="YWT"/&gt;

The '''Museo Archeologico Ostiense''' (or ''Archaeological Museum of Ostia'') is an [[archaeological museum]] dedicated to the ancient Roman city of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. 

The museum was built by [[Pope Pius IX]], who in 1865 had to readapt a fifteenth-century building used as a store to create a city museum. Contained in the museum are numerous archaeological objects which came to light during a long period of excavations. The collection includes, for example, a collection of portraits of famous people from ancient Ostia, including [[philosopher]]s and members of the royal family, such as busts depicting [[Asclepius]] and  Volcacius Myropnous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/valkvisuals/html/tombe_07.htm|title=tombe 7|work=ostia-antica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a portrait of [[Faustina the Elder]] and the head of [[Trajan]]. The museum also has a large collection of sculptures, including the statue of [[Perseus]] holding the head of [[Medusa]], the sculptural group of [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]] slaying the bull, and other works. There are other examples on display of great interest, such as small groups in marble depicting [[Cupid and Psyche]] and other subjects, and in another section of the museum, [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[relief]]s. On display are also examples of wall paintings from different burials and emblems of [[polychrome]] [[mosaic]]s, such as the [[Christ Blessing (Raphael)|Christ Blessing]]. These works of great historical and artistic value, are then supported by a collection of minor works such as crafts, glass, and even teaches some at the shop, and some interesting facts, such as the marble slab found in the temple of the goddess of war, [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], on which are carved two pairs of feet opposite, probably a [[Votive offering|votive]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musei.it/lazio/roma/museo-archeologico-ostiense.asp Museo Archeologico Ostiense di Roma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207024020/http://www.musei.it/lazio/roma/museo-archeologico-ostiense.asp |date=2013-12-07 }}, Retrieved 18 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music-on-demand''' is a music distribution model conceived with the growth of two-way computing, telecommunications and the [[Internet]] in the early 1990s. Primarily, high-quality music is made available to purchase, access and play back using software on the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Microsoft Windows]], set-top boxes and mobile devices from an available distribution point, such as a computer host or server located at a telephone, cable TV or wireless data center facility.

In 1992, [[computer modem]] speeds were limited to less than 28 thousand bits per second (28 kbit/s), compared with uncompressed music on [[compact disc]] (CD) that required 150 thousand [[bytes]] per second.  As a result, additional [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is required to accommodate delivering audio at CD quality standards: 16-bit frame, 44.1 [[kHz]] [[sampling rate]], stereophonic (two channel audio).  This prompted telephony, [[CATV]], cellular and satellite providers to consider changing standards, assisting in creating the [[information superhighway]], in terms of building higher capacity for existing telecommunications [[infrastructure]]s.

Early attempts at designing and developing music-on-demand technology, in accordance with the laws of the United States such as the [[Audio Home Recording Act|Home Recording Act of 1992]], include [[Access Media Network]] (AMN) by inventor [[Dale Schalow]].  Schalow, born in Virginia, was an independent audio engineer and programmer in Los Angeles, California, who helped record albums and music scores for [[David Bowie]], [[Tin Machine]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[House of Pain]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]].  A [[multiplexed]] music-on-demand model was deployed using [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio sampling devices, Apple IIci, the [[Kermit (protocol)|KERMIT]] computer file transfer protocol, and [[SCSI]] storage systems by Schalow to validate processing 16-bit multi-channel audio from [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] in a professional recording studio environment, including his own independently operated '''Dascha''' company and '''38 Fresh Recordings'''.  The model conceived was introduced by Schalow to Apple Computer in 1992 after he submitted an entry into the "I Changed the World" contest, essentially describing how an Apple computer helped shape and change the world forever based upon its usage.  Apple acknowledged the "Accessible Music Network" (AMN) by awarding Schalow Honorable Mention and sending him a simple gray T-shirt with the Apple logo on it.  Stand-alone software created by AMN for consumer-based access was then developed for the [[Microsoft Windows]] computer operating system, as well as set-top box design prototypes conceptualized with 3D prototype imaging that required a telephone connector located next to a [[coaxial]] cable TV connector to converge low speed data uplinking with high speed downloading interactive communications.

Presently, music-on-demand is still the center of controversy with a focus on illegal music downloading, [[peer-to-peer]] file swapping and the lag of legislation for rapidly changing technology on the Internet.  Record labels represented by the [[RIAA]], as well as publishers and songwriters, have vigorously defended copyrighted materials and have been successful in enforcing current laws for protecting their intellectual property.  As of 2006, the new music industry has seen a rapid growth in overall revenues for legal digital music sales that has resulted in hitting and surpassing one billion dollars annually.

Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives. pp. 111, 119–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Martin's Press]] first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for "...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'".&lt;ref name="GC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Martin's New Adult Contest|url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/st-martins-new-adult-contest|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Would you read novels aimed at 'new adults'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/10/new-adult-fiction|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=London|first=Briony|last=Chappell|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, [[Colleen Hoover]], and Jamie McGuire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=19 May 2013|first1=Deirdre|last1=Donahue|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Alexander Interview Part 3|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/karl-alexander-interview-part-3|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was originally faced criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' Fiction Is Now an Official Literary Genre Because Marketers Want Us to Buy Things|url=http://jezebel.com/5960942/new-adult-fiction-is-now-an-official-literary-genre-because-marketers-want-you-to-buy-things|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for [[HarperCollins]] described it as "a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond Wizards and Vampires, to Sex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2013|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' ''A Court of Thorns and Roses'' and ''Throne of Glass'', Jennifer L. Armentrout's ''Wait For You'', Jamie McGuire's ''Beautiful Disaster'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' books growing up|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20130420/THINGSTODO07/304200030/-New-Adult-books-growing-up|publisher=Lansing State Journal|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleen Hoover's ''Slammed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut Fiction on Bestseller Lists|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587#.UZhSmKLFVqw|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cora Carmack's ''Losing It'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are your teens ready for New Adult fiction?|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/17501716-423/are-your-teens-ready-for-new-adult-fiction.html|publisher=Sun Times|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Ryan (novelist)|Kendall Ryan]]'s ''The Impact of You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2013/06/09/kendall-ryan-the-impact-of-you-new-adult/|title=Sexy-romance author Kendall Ryan gives New Adult a try|date=2013-06-09|website=Happy Ever After|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
This category is intended to be marketed to [[Adolescence|post-adolescents]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young-adults]] ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative "cross-over" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beckett, Sandra L. |title=Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives|pages= 111, 119–126|date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/postadolescent-or-new-adult-fiction/ |title=Postadolescent or 'New Adult' Fiction |author= JJ |date=10 November 2009 |work= Publishing, Reviews |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from [[young adult fiction]] are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/books/survey-shows-publishing-expanded-since-2008.html |title=Publishing Gives Hints of Revival, Data Show |first=Julie |last=Bosman |date= August 9, 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult.

==Themes and issues==
New adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction.

Many themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullying&lt;ref&gt;[[young adult fiction]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure.

This category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions.

==Genre==
Like the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. [[Science fiction]], [[urban fiction]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Paranormal fiction|paranormal]], [[dystopia]], etc. are some examples.

==Controversies==

===Publishing industry===
Many agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingcrawl.com/2013/01/30/new-adult-passing-trend-or-legitimate-genre/|title=New Adult- Passing Trend or Legitimate Genre?|date=30 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/ | work=USA Today | first1=Deirdre | last1=Donahue | title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books | date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/11/29/with-new-digital-imprints-random-house-taps-self-published-authors/|title=With new digital imprints, Random House taps self-published authors|first=Laura|last=Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=paidcontent.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

===Sex===
In 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as ''Slammed'' by [[Colleen Hoover]], ''Easy'' by Tamarra Webber, and ''[[Beautiful Disaster (novel)|Beautiful Disaster]]'' by [[Jamie McGuire (author)|Jamie McGuire]] got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Leslie | last=Kaufman | title=Young-Adult Authors Are Creating a Steamy New Genre | date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', which featured a heroine in college.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut on Top|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=23 February 2013|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/new-adult-its-not-about-the-sex-but-dont-be-afraid-of-the-sex-either/|title=New Adult: It’s not about the sex (but don’t be afraid of the sex either)|date=25 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/novelist-special/what-is-new-adult-fiction-anyway|title=What is New Adult Fiction, Anyway? - NoveList - EBSCOhost|website=www.ebscohost.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 to present==
Following the end of the St. Martin's Press contest, the new adult category has become increasingly popular through self-publishing.  Major New York publishers are taking self-published authors of these titles and acquiring them for mass market sales.  Some authors include:

'''''Orgasmic Birth: The Best-Kept Secret''''' (also called '''''Orgasmic Birth: 11 Mothers, 12 International Experts''''' or just '''''Orgasmic Birth''''') is a 2008 [[documentary film]] that examines the intimate nature of birth.&lt;ref name="site"&gt;[http://www.orgasmicbirth.com/what-is-orgasmic-birth Orgasmicbirth.com, What is Orgasmic Birth]&lt;/ref&gt;  It had been shown at women's and film festivals since May 2008, before being shown for the first time in [[primetime]] on January 2, 2009 by ABC’s [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belkin |first=Lisa |url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/orgasms-during-childbirth/ |title=Orgasms During Childbirth? - NYTimes.com |publisher=Parenting.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles''' is a [[book collecting]] and [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] club run by, and primarily for, students at [[Oxford University]]. It was founded in 1950 by a group of young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Nash and Howes 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading [[Bibliography|bibliographers]], [[librarians]], book collectors, [[booksellers]] and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]], Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly "Warden's Meeting"&lt;ref&gt;Davies et al. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the "Warden's Meeting" continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and [[private presses]] of the age, including the [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] University Presses, the [[Rampant Lions Press]], the [[Samson Press]], the [[Fantasy Press (UK)|Fantasy Press]], the [[Kit-Cat Press]], [[Big Wheel Press]], the [[Perpetua Press]], the [[Incline Press]], the [[Whittington Press]], the [[Libanus Press]], the [[Rocket Press]], the [[Stanbrook Abbey]] Press and the [[Officina Bodoni|Stamperia Valdonega]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash and Howes 2006, plates 1-4 and pp. 25-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of difficulties and disrupted activities in the last decade of the twentieth century, the Society closed in 2000, when interest among the students had declined so far that a junior committee could no longer be formed. However, due to the efforts of a new generation of Oxford students led by Geri Della Rocca de Candal, Enrico Emanuele Prodi and Matthew Cheung Salisbury, aided by Cristina Dondi, [[Richard Ovenden]] and a few surviving members of the former Society (notably [[Colin Franklin (writer and bibliographer)|Colin Franklin]] and Paul W. Nash), the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles was refounded in [[Trinity term]] 2008 and became fully active in [[Michaelmas term]] in the same year. The first termcard for the new Society was printed by the Rampant Lions Press (and was among the last jobs printed by Sebastian Carter).

The Society's device, shown opposite, was designed by [[Michael Harvey (lettering artist)|Michael Harvey]].

'''Pál (Paul) Böhm''' (28 December 1839, [[Nagyvárad]] - 29 March 1905, [[Munich]]) was a Hungarian [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

==Life and work==
He first studied drawing with his father, who was a maintenance engineer at the bishop's manor. After finishing elementary school, he tried his hand at many crafts, including carpentry, [[coppersmith]]ing and toy making. In 1859, he joined a group of scenery painters and learned that craft from {{ill|Antal Haan|hu|Haan Antal}}.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC00523/02237.htm Böhm Pál] @ Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, he finally decided to become a painter, eventually travelling to Vienna, where he copied the works on display in the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere Palace]]. In 1865, he returned to his hometown and attempted to make a living by painting portraits and altarpieces. He also briefly operated a painting school that was attended by [[László Paál]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

Two years later, he was sufficiently established to earn a decent living and moved to Budapest, where he exhibited with the National Society of Hungarian Fine Arts. In 1871, he received a scholarship from [[Tivadar Pauler]], the Minister of Religion and Education. This enabled him to travel to Munich,&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; where he quickly became part of the city's artistic life and associated with a group of Hungarian painters led by [[Géza Mészöly (painter)|Géza Mészöly]]. On several occasions, he stayed in the [[Tisza]] region, where he painted and sketched, but settled in Munich permanently in 1875. After this point, his paintings lost some of their freshness and are generally considered by critics to be rather commercial.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

==Technology and Sustainable Design==
RWH utilizes [[ArchiCAD]] [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] [[3D modeling]] software on 8-core Apple MacPro workstations for architectural projects, and was one of the first firms in Atlanta to implement a [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] design system in 1989, and the first in Atlanta to use ArchiCAD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graphisoft.com/community/success_stories/richard.html/"Richard + Wittschiebe Architects: A Collaborative Effort'], [http://www.graphisoft.com 'Graphisoft"], July 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; RWH is also one of the few architecture firms in Atlanta to use Apple Macintosh workstations. Each workstation has access to the BIM server where realtime collaborative design and document production occurs. In addition, [http://www.rossstreethouse.com Ross Street House], the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-Platinum home in the state of Wisconsin, was designed by RWH using entirely ArchiCAD. Over 90% of the staff are [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Accredited Professionals (LEED AP).

==Notable Projects==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ASHRAE Twilight Exterior.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text|ASHRAE Headquarters Renewal]] --&gt;

[[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)]], [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].
In 2006, the ASHRAE headquarters building in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] underwent planning and development for the renewal of their {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office building. ASHRAE hired Richard Wittschiebe Hand as the architecture firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ashrae.org/pressroom/detail/16938|title=ASHRAE Hosts Industry Partners at Headquarters Renewal Event|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finished building achieved a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-Platinum rating by the [[United States Green Building Council|USGBC]]. The building renovation/addition includes a new training center, meeting and education spaces, a technical library, offices, a loading area and bulk storage.

One of the most innovative components in the building's design is an extensive measurement and verification system that monitors and measures electricity, energy consumption, water use, and local weather conditions in real-time. This monitoring was essential to ASHRAE's "walk the walk" theme by proving the tangible and financial benefits of green design. The data is available to national and international members through internet-based programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9780">'''Scams in intellectual property''' or '''invention scams''' are a type of [[scam]] in which either [[inventor]]s are lured to pay money for development of their idea but the development does not occur, or [[investors]] pay money for a non existing product or for an invention never to be developed.

[[Intellectual property]] (IP) is a very complex area and covers a vast range of diverse subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent.gov.uk/protect/protect-advice.htm UK Patent Office advice]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there are opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and organizations to take advantage of those wishing to secure protection for their IP.

==Registration services==
'''Registration services''' are organizations or individuals that contact IP applicants or owners and request payment for an apparently official registration of their IP.

Many applicants for and owners of [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[industrial design rights]] receive letters from such registration services and different IP offices and organizations around the world regularly issue warnings in connection with the offered services.

The registration services target applicants directly because patent, trademark and design applications are published a set time after filing or upon grant along with freely available information about a name and address for the applicant. Registration services use this information to send requests for payment to applicants shortly after publication.  The documents are confusing as they appear to be from official governmental agencies and to be legitimate invoices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-years-solicitations-creative-marketing-or-deceptive-advertising|title=New Years Solicitations - Creative Marketing or Deceptive Advertising? |first=Kurt|last=Anderson |work= Giordano, Halleran &amp; Ciesla, P.C.|year=2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scam increasing in frequency, as of October 2011, is an email originating from a domain name registrar or IT consulting company based in China that purports to notify a trademark holder that another entity is seeking to register the client’s trademark or business name as a domain name in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Be Aware of Trademark and Patent Scams |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/be-aware-trademark-and-patent-scams |publisher=Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein &amp; Fox P.L.L.C. |work=The National Law Review |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The email gives the brand owner a short period in time in which to secure the domain name for their own.  These notifications are essentially solicitations.  Generally, in the event there really is a third-party who is seeking to register your brand name for nefarious purposes, there are channels available for addressing such uses if and when they materialize.

'''''The Beastmaster''''' is a 1982 [[Sword and sorcery|sword and sorcery film]] directed by [[Don Coscarelli]] and starring [[Marc Singer]], [[Tanya Roberts]], [[John Amos]] and [[Rip Torn]] loosely based on the novel ''[[The Beast Master]]'' by [[Andre Norton]]. The film is about a child who is stolen from his mother's womb by a witch. The child grows into Dar, who has the ability to communicate telepathically with animals. Dar grows up in a village where he learns to do battle. But the village is destroyed by a race of beast-like warriors under the control of the sorcerer Maax. Dar vows revenge and travels with new friends to stop Maax from causing any more problems.

Commercially ''The Beastmaster'' was not considered a box office success during its original cinematic run;  however later it received extensive television exposure and success on cable in the American market on channels [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[HBO]]. The original film spawned two sequels as well as a syndicated television series that chronicled the further adventures of Dar.

==Plot==
In the kingdom of Aruk, the high priest Maax [{{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|.|æ|k|s}} {{respell|MAY|aks}}] is given a prophecy by his witches that he would die facing the son of King Zed. Learning of Maax's scheme to murder his child as a sacrificial offering to the kingdom's god Ar, Zed exiled Maax and his followers from the city. However, Maax sent one of his witches to transfer the unborn child from the womb of Zed's queen and into a cow to be born. After his birth the witch brands the infant with Ar's mark, but is killed by a villager who takes the infant in his care and raises him as his own son. Named Dar while raised in the village of Emur, the child learns how to fight while advised by his father to keep his ability to telepathically communicate with animals a secret. Years later, a fully grown Dar witnesses his people being slaughtered by the Juns, a horde of fanatic barbarians allied with Maax. Dar, the only survivor of the attack, journeys to Aruk to avenge his people. In time, Dar is joined by an eagle that he names Sharak, a pair of thieving ferrets he calls Kodo and Podo, and a black tiger whom he names Ruh.

Eventually, Dar meets a redheaded slave girl called Kiri before getting himself lost and ending up surrounded by an eerie half-bird, half-human race who dissolve their prey for nourishment. As the bird men worship eagles, they spare Dar when he summons Sharak and give him an amulet should he need their aid. Dar soon arrives to Aruk where Maax had assumed total control with the Juns support and subjects the people to witness their children being sacrificed. After having Sharak save the child of a townsman named Sacco, Dar learns that Kiri is to be sacrificed. On his way to save her, Dar is joined by Zed's younger son Tal and his bodyguard Seth, learning that Kiri is Zed's niece as the three work to save her. While Seth goes to gather their forces, Dar helps Kiri and Tal infiltrate the temple and save the now eyeless Zed and while escaping from the temple's beast-like Death Guards and Maax himself, leading his small coven of evil witches.

Consumed by revenge, Zed refuses to listen to Dar's warning against ordering an immediate attack on the city and rejects him as a freak. Forced to leave, Dar later learns that his friends are captured and races to Aruk to save them from being sacrificed. In the conflict that followed, Maax reveals Dar's relationship to Zed before slitting his throat and facing the Beastmaster. Despite being stabbed, revived by his remaining witch before she was killed, Maax was about to kill Dar when Kodo sacrifices himself to cause the high priest to fall into the sacrificial flames. But the victory is short-lived as the Jun horde are approaching Aruk, arriving by nightfall to face the trap Dar and the people set up for them. Tal gets wounded as Dar succeeds in burning most of the Juns alive while defeating their chieftain before the bird-men arrive to consume those remaining. The following day, though Seth learned that he is Zed's first born, Dar explains that Tal would make a better king as he leaves Aruk. Dar sets off into the wild with Kiri, Ruh, Sharak and Podo (who has given birth to two baby ferrets) on the path to new adventures.

==Production==
''Beastmaster'' began with a screenplay in the early 1980s written by [[Paul Pepperman]] and [[Don Coscarelli]].&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet"&gt;{{Cite AV media notes

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two writers based their film on [[Andre Norton]]'s 1959 novel ''[[The Beast Master]]''.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The writers changed the story dramatically as the original novel had the hero named Hosteen Storm who was a Navajo fighter in a futuristic science fiction setting.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; Norton was unhappy with the liberties taken with the film's script and asked for her name to be removed from the credits.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; When Coscarelli signed on as a director, Pepperman became the film's producer and brought in co-producer [[Sylvio Tabet]] to the project.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The producers went to raise funds for the film at the 1981 MIFED film market in [[Milan]] and at the 1982 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The budget of $9 million was raised, giving director Coscarelli his highest budget to work with up until that point in his career.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt;

Coscarelli was frustrated while making the film, during which he feuded with the film's executive producer predominantly over the film's editing and casting.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; Coscarelli originally wanted [[Demi Moore]] for the role of Kiri, but the executive producer overrode his choice and had [[Tanya Roberts]] cast.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The role of Maax was originally written for [[Klaus Kinski]], but he was not cast over a salary dispute.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The film was shot over the course of five-and-a-half months.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The film was shot in California's [[Simi Valley]] and in [[Los Padres National Forest]]'s [[Lake Piru]] in [[Ventura County]], and [[Valley of Fire State Park]] in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; Interior shots were done at MGM/UA lot.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt;

==Music==
The score was composed and conducted by [[Lee Holdridge]]; it was recorded in Rome with members of The Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia of Rome and the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Rome. The soundtrack album was originally issued by [[Varèse Sarabande]], and subsequently by C.A.M. In 2013 Quartet Records released a 1200-copy limited edition featuring the original album (tracks 1–13, disc 1) and most of the film's score (Holdridge wrote eighty minutes of music for the film; a few cues could not be found, but the album includes music that was not heard in the finished product).&lt;ref&gt;John Takis, liner notes, ''The Beastmaster: Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'', Quartet/Sugar, SCE076&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beastmaster'' grossed roughly $14 million on its initial theatrical release.&lt;ref name=BOM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=beastmaster.htm|title=The Beastmaster (1982) Weekend Box Office Results|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josh Milrad]] was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] for "Best Young Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture" for his co-starring role as Tal in the film.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt;

According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the film opened to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave it two stars out of four and wrote that it "isn't bad as much as it is overlong. After one of the film's major bad guys has been bumped off, the film inexplicably goes on for another 20 minutes. In this sort of brainless adventure film, one climax is enough."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (August 27, 1982). "Okay 'Beastmaster' loses in overtime". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought the film was "neither better nor worse than '[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'" and "looks both big and cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=August 20, 1982 |title=Movie: 'Beastmaster,' an Adventure-Fantasy |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=C19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "When 'The Beastmaster' begins, it is very hard to tell what it is all about. An hour later, it is very hard to care what it is all about. Another hour later, it is very hard to remember what it was all about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 18, 1982 |title=The Beastmaster |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "a veritable comic book adventure come alive" that "succeeds on its own merits."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Thomas, Kevin]] (August 19, 1982). "One For Sword-And-Sorcery Fans". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part VI, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Milne]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' found the film "marginally livelier" than ''Conan the Barbarian'' but criticized the "very basic acting, the appalling post-synching, the sets which resort to disconcertingly ramshackle models, and direction of supreme stodginesss which predictably uses helicopter shots to illustrate the eagle's spying missions (when all it sees as a rule is the hero prancing on the hilltops in self-conscious martial arts poses)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milne |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Milne |date=April 1983 |title=The BeastMaster |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=50 |issue=591 |page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a score of 46% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beastmaster/ |title=The Beastmaster |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=November 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and television series==
''The Beastmaster'' received a sequel in 1991 ''[[Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time]]''.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The film was directed by the original film producer [[Sylvio Tabet]].&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The [[direct-to-video]] third film was released in 1996 titled ''[[Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus]]''.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; Both sequels feature [[Marc Singer]] in the role of Dar.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The films were followed by a syndicated [[Beastmaster (TV series)|television series]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt; The television series changes the backstory of Dar who is played by [[Daniel Goddard (actor)|Daniel Goddard]].&lt;ref name="beastmaster-booklet" /&gt;

'''The Black Woman Is God'''&amp;nbsp;is a recurring group exhibition of Black women artists curated by Karen Seneferu and Melorra Green, which started in 2013 and in 2016 and 2017 has been located at the San Francisco city-owned nonprofit art space [[SOMArts]]. The exhibitions challenge a popular western mindset of [[God]] as a white male and instead explores new images showing "The Black Woman is God".

== History ==

=== 2013 Exhibition at the African American Art &amp; Culture Complex ===
The first iteration of The Black Woman is God was intended as a solo exhibition for Seneferu, curated by Green, at the African American Art &amp; Culture Complex. Seneferu agreed to participate in the exhibition only if other black female artists were included&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/A-room-full-of-art-affirms-The-Black-Woman-Is-8392070.php|title=A room full of art affirms ‘The Black Woman Is God’|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The exhibition included 20 visual and performance artists. The opening reception also included a performing arts show as part of the exhibition and was called "vibrant and magnificent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfbayview.com/2013/04/the-black-woman-is-god/|title=‘The Black Woman Is God’|work=San Francisco Bay View|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfbayview.com/2013/05/the-black-woman-is-god-part-ii/|title=‘The Black Woman Is God’ – Part II|work=San Francisco Bay View|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peopleseye.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/The-Black-Woman-Is-God/C0000Lih_hWEMNkk|title=The Black Woman Is God {{!}} PEOPLE'S EYE PHOTOGRAPHY|website=peopleseye.photoshelter.com|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 Exhibition ===
The second, expanded iteration of The Black Woman is God, with 60 artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaklandpost.org/2017/07/14/80-women-artists-annual-black-woman-god-exhibit/|title=80 Women Artists Showcased in Annual “Black Woman Is God” Exhibit|last=|date=2017-07-14|website=Oakland Post|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, opened on July 7, 2016 and ran through August 16, 2016.

Art critics called it as "timely", "organic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afropunk.com/2016/07/feature-new-exhibit-the-black-woman-is-god-crucially-illustrates-the-social-activism-and-creativity-following-female-artists-of-color/|title=FEATURE: New exhibit 'The Black Woman is God' crucially illustrates the social activism and creativity following female artists of color - AFROPUNK|date=2016-07-01|work=AFROPUNK|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and "vivid"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cocoafly.com/2016/08/the-black-woman-is-god-is-beautiful.html|title=‘The Black Woman Is God’ is a Beautiful, Spiritual Experience|website=www.cocoafly.com|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Sheila Bapat of&amp;nbsp;[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch Magazine]] said "The exhibit intentionally turns the historic devaluation of Black women and their contributions—social, political, economical—on its head. This exhibit asserts Black women’s power and beauty and does not seek to devalue any other group in the process..... It applies pressure to the beliefs and values undergirding the laws and policies that exclude Black women’s lives from economic policymaking and their labor from economic value and protection."

=== 2017 Exhibition ===
The third iteration of The Black Woman is God, also curated by Karen Seneferu and Melorra Green, returned to SOMArts on July 20, 2017, running through August 26, 2017. The exhibition has the work of 80 artists on view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.somarts.org/theblackwomanisgod2017|title=The Black Woman is God, July 20–August 26, 2017 — SOMArts|website=www.somarts.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaklandpost.org/2017/07/14/80-women-artists-annual-black-woman-god-exhibit/|title=80 Women Artists Showcased in Annual “Black Woman Is God” Exhibit|last=by|date=2017-07-14|website=Oakland Post|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOMArts, the [[California Digital Library]] and [[Art Practical]] held a Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon on July 22 in conjunction with the exhibition "to raise the online visibility of Black women artists and challenge the gaps in art history that erase or minimize Black women’s contributions as artists, activists and social change-makers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.somarts.org/theblackwomanisgodwikipedia/|title=The Black Woman is God Wikipedia Edit-a-thon|website=www.somarts.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They plan for 2018 to have more events in Oakland where many artists live and would like future exhibitions to travel around the country and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/Black-female-creativity-celebrated-at-SOMArts-11959100.php|title=Black female creativity celebrated at SOMArts|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Great Escape''''' is an insider's account by [[Australian]] [[writer]] [[Paul Brickhill]] of the 1944 [[Stalag Luft III#The great escape|mass escape]] from the German [[prisoner of war]] camp [[Stalag Luft III]] for British and Commonwealth airmen.  As a prisoner in the camp, he participated in the escape plan but was debarred from the actual escape 'along with three or four others on grounds of claustrophobia'.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', foreword&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction to the book is written by George Harsh, an American POW at Stalag Luft III. This book was made into the 1963 film [[The Great Escape (film)|''The Great Escape'']].

== Summary ==
[[File:Great escape harry exit.jpg|thumb|View looking through fence to where tunnel Harry exited, just shy of the tree line.]]
The book covers the planning, execution and aftermath of what became known as ''The Great Escape''. Other escape attempts (such as the [[The Wooden Horse|Wooden Horse]]) are mentioned as well as the postwar hunt for the [[Gestapo]] agents who murdered fifty of the escapees on Hitler's direct order. The book was published in 1950. Brickhill, a journalist before and after the war, had previously written the story four different ways, initially as a BBC talk, then as newspaper and ''Reader's Digest'' articles, and in the 1946 book ''Escape to Danger'' which he co-wrote with Conrad Norton. By the time of the 1950 book, Brickhill had eliminated some of the less heroic aspects of the story, including the fact that a large proportion of the compound's population had no interest in the escape.&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins, ''The Hero Maker''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the book is focused on [[Royal Air Force]] [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell]], also known as "''Big X''", including his capture, early escape attempts, and [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|planning of the escape]]. All the major participants and their exploits are described by Brickhill. Among these are Tim Walenn, the principal forger, who 'gave his factory the code name of "[[Dean and Dawson]]", after a British travel agency';&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Al Hake, the compass maker;&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Des Plunkett, the ingenious chief map tracer, who made a [[mimeograph]] for reproducing maps;&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; and Tommy Guest, who ran a team of tailors.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Johnnie Dodge|John Dodge]], who was related by marriage to [[Winston Churchill]], was one of the escapees. The German officers and guards (called 'goons' by the prisoners) included teams of 'ferrets' who crawled about under the raised huts looking for signs of tunnels. They were carefully watched by teams of POW 'stooges', one of whom was Paul Brickhill, 'boss of a gang of "stooges" guarding the forgers'.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', foreword&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, seventy-six men escaped. Seventy-three were recaptured and fifty of those were shot by the Gestapo against the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention]] which stated that POW's could not be killed for trying to escape.  Four of the remaining twenty-three later tunnelled out of [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] (a [[concentration camp]]), but were recaptured and chained to the floor of their cells.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 285–289&lt;/ref&gt;  One of them, Major [[Johnnie Dodge|John Dodge]], was released to secure a cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 290–294&lt;/ref&gt; Three made it home safely.

The book is dedicated "to The Fifty".

In the aftermath of the escape, according to Brickhill, 5,000,000 Germans spent time looking for the prisoners, many of them full-time for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brickhill's biographer Stephen Dando-Collins, while this may have been an aspiration of the escapees, there is no foundation for such an exaggerated claim, which added to the story's heroic narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins, ''The Hero Maker'' p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

== The tunnels ==
Three tunnels were dug for the escape.  They were named ''Tom'', ''Dick'', and ''Harry''.  The operation was so secretive that everyone was to refer to each tunnel by its name.  Bushell took this so seriously that he threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word "tunnel" aloud.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Tom'' was dug in hut 123 and extended west into the forest.  It was found by the Germans and dynamited.  ''Dick'' was dug in the shower room of hut 122 and had the most secure trap door.  It was to go in the same direction as ''Tom'' and the prisoners decided that the hut would not be a suspected tunnel site as it was more inward than the others.  ''Dick'' was abandoned for escape purposes because the area where it would have surfaced was cleared for camp expansion.  ''Dick'' was then used to store dirt, supplies, and as a workshop.  ''Harry'', which was in hut 104, was the tunnel ultimately used for the escape.  It was discovered as the escape was in progress with only seventy-six of the planned two hundred and twenty prisoners free.  To avoid the disaster of ''Tom'', ''Harry'' was filled with sewage, sand, and sealed with cement.  After the escape, the prisoners started digging another tunnel called ''George'', but this was abandoned when the camp was evacuated.

== After 'The Great Escape' ==
On October 2, 2012, [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] released ''Human Game: The True Story of the 'Great Escape' Murders and the Hunt for the Gestapo Gunmen'' by author and journalist Simon Read. The book details the 50 murders that took place following the escape and the three-year manhunt by the Royal Air Force to bring the killers to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simon-read.com/war-of-words/|title=My Books &lt;&lt; Simon Read}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Human-Game-Escape-Murders-Gestapo/dp/0425252736/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332220047&amp;sr=1-1|title=Human Game: The True Story of the 'Great Escape' Murders and the Hunt for the Gestapo Gunmen|last=Read|first=Simon|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=[[Berkley Hardcover]]|isbn=0425252736|edition=1|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television adaptation===
On January 27, 1951, NBC broadcast a live drama adaptation as an episode of ''[[The Philco Television Playhouse]]'', starring [[E. G. Marshall|E.G. Marshall]], [[Everett Sloane]], [[Horace Braham]], and [[Kurt Katch]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Escape'', the Internet Movie Database. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0674407/&lt;/ref&gt; The live broadcast was praised for engineering an ingenious set design for the live broadcast, including creating the illusion of underground tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Robert J. "The Great Escape." ''Radio Age'' 10.3 (April 1951). Available at https://archive.org/stream/radioageresearch195052newyrich#page/n103/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Holy Kinship''''' is a circa 1495 [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting of [[Holy Kinship]] by the workshop of the renaissance artist [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/58546 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''The Holy Kinship'' shows the Virgin and Child in the left center with Saint Elizabeth and [[John the Baptist]] slightly more prominently positioned center right.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The "kinship" members have been further identified as Saint Anne with a book on the left with her husband Joachim behind her and behind him [[Saint Joseph]] holding a lily towards his wife as a gesture of the immaculate conception. Three young cousins of the infants, the later disciples Simon, Jacob and John, pour wine into a chalice in the centre of the painting which is a reference to the [[Eucharist]], and beyond them a sculpture of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac]] on the altar represents God's sacrifice of [[Jesus]]. A young [[Judas]] stands lighting the candles of the choir gate. In the doorways of the choir gate stand the other two former husbands of Saint Anne, the fathers of the other two Marias who are positioned behind St. Elisabeth.

==Provenance==
This painting is a former altarpiece of an unspecified church, though it is tempting to imagine similarities to the ''Commanderie van Sint-Jan'' where Geertgen is known to have lived and worked: [[Janskerk, Haarlem]].&lt;ref name=Geertgen&gt;''Geertgen was hier: meesterschilder, lekenbroeder en inspirator''’, exhibition catalog Geertgen tot Sint-Jans in De Vishal and Janskerk (18 September – 13 October), Haarlem, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The provenance of this painting only goes back to a Brussels sale in 1797 however, and indeed the painting was purchased in 1808 as a work by Jan and [[Hubert van Eyck]]. It wasn't until 1888 that it was identified as a work by the Haarlem master.&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-500/catalogus-entry Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several attempts have been made to determine the origins of the painting. In his translated ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'', [[Hessel Miedema]] reported that Geertgen died somewhere between 1486 and 1492, while recent [[dendrochronology]], on the other hand, places the painting around 1496 at the earliest.&lt;ref name=Wallert&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2001/11/wallert01.html The Holy Kinship.

This painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all ''Highlights of the Rijksmuseum'' catalogs. It was the subject of a mini-exhibition after 17 years were spent 1983-2000 restoring 12 centimeters of water damage at the bottom of the painting.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

Klein]] as a classic in the field of the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="American Supernatural Tales 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers, Robert W(illiam) |first=T. E.

"The Yellow Sign" inspired a [[The Yellow Sign#Film|film of the same name]] released in 2001.

The British first edition was published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1895 (316 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?25609 |title= The King in Yellow |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:

* A play in book form entitled ''The King in Yellow''
* A mysterious and malevolent supernatural entity known as the King in Yellow
* An eerie symbol called the [[Yellow Sign]]

These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters that are often artists or [[decadence|decadents]], inhabitants of the ''demi-monde''.

The first and fourth stories, "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The Yellow Sign", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories, "The Mask" and "In the Court of the Dragon", are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: "Have you found the Yellow Sign?"

The weird and macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.

===List of stories===
The stories in the book are:
[[File:Repairer of Reputations Chapter 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hildred Castaigne in "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]", illustration by Tucker Sherry.]]
* "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]" – A weird story of egotism and paranoia which carries the imagery of the book's title.
* "The Mask" – A dream story of art, love, and uncanny science.
* "[[In the Court of the Dragon]]" – A man is pursued by a sinister church organist who is after his soul.
* "[[Yellow Sign|The Yellow Sign]]" – An artist is troubled by a sinister churchyard watchman who resembles a coffin worm.
* "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" – A ghost story, the theme of which anticipates [[H. G. Wells]]' "[[H. G. Wells bibliography#Stories|The Door in the Wall]]" (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129798.The_King_in_Yellow_and_Other_Horror_Stories | title=The King in Yellow and Other Horror Stories by Robert W. Chambers - Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists | publisher=[[Goodreads]] | accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[The Prophets' Paradise]]" – A sequence of eerie prose poems that develop the style and theme of a quote from the fictional play ''The King in Yellow'' which introduces "The Mask".
* "The Street of the Four Winds" – An atmospheric tale of an artist in Paris who is drawn to a neighbor's room by a cat; the story ends with a macabre touch.
* "The Street of the First Shell" – A war story set in the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Paris Siege]] of 1870.
* "The Street of Our Lady of the Fields" – Romantic American bohemians in Paris.
* "Rue Barrée" – Romantic American bohemians in Paris, with a discordant ending that playfully reflects some of the tone of the first story.

==The play called ''The King in Yellow''==
The fictional play ''The King in Yellow,'' has at least two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla and "The Stranger", who may or may not be the title character.

Chambers' story collection excerpts some sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, "Cassilda's Song" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:

:Along the shore the cloud waves break,
:The twin suns sink behind the lake,
:The shadows lengthen
::In [[Carcosa]].

:Strange is the night where black stars rise,
:And strange moons circle through the skies,
:But stranger still is
::Lost Carcosa.

:Songs that the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] shall sing,
:Where flap the tatters of the King,
:Must die unheard in
::Dim Carcosa.

:Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
:Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
:Shall dry and die in
::Lost Carcosa.&lt;ref name="Cassilda"&gt;"The King in Yellow" in e.g. {{cite book

 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories
 | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction
 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "The Mask" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:

:''Camilla: You, sir, should unmask.''
:''Stranger: Indeed?''
:''Cassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.''
:''Stranger: I wear no mask.''
:''Camilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!''&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;"The Mask" in e.g. {{cite book

 | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction
 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also stated, in "The Repairer of Reputations", that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, "Not upon us, oh, king! Not upon us!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chambers | first = Robert W. | authorlink = Robert W. Chambers | year = 2004 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction | publisher = [[Chaosium]] | isbn = 1-56882-170-0 | page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the "irresistible" revealed truths. "The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect." Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: "If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it [...]" ("The Repairer of Reputations").

Chambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar passage occurs in "The Yellow Sign", in which two protagonists have read ''The King in Yellow'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influences==
Chambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali and [[Hastur]] from [[Ambrose Bierce]]: specifically, his [[short story|short stories]] "[[An Inhabitant of Carcosa]]" and "Haïta the Shepherd". There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in "Haïta the Shepherd", but is implicitly a location in "The Repairer of Reputations", listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Stableford]] pointed out that the story "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" was influenced by the stories of [[Théophile Gautier]], such as "Arria Marcella" (1852); both Gautier and Chambers' stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural [[time travel|time slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, "The King in Yellow" in Frank N. Magill, ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. (pp. 844-847).&lt;/ref&gt; The name Jeanne d'Ys is also a [[homophone]] for the word [[jaundice]] and continues the symbolism of The King in Yellow.

In [[Raymond Chandler]]'s 1938 detective story, also titled "The King in Yellow", the protagonist says "The King in Yellow. I read a book by that title once."

The first season of HBO's ''[[True Detective]]'' television series revolves around a string of crimes committed by the elusive "Yellow King" with [[Carcosa]] also being mentioned on numerous occasions. Black stars are also prominent in reference and imagery during the series.

[[SCP Foundation]] entry SCP-701, The Hanged King, is possibly a reference to this. The titular play being one that causes violence and insanity among both the cast and audience members.


===Cthulhu Mythos===

one of his main [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers' method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The play ''The King in Yellow'' effectively became another piece of [[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature|occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos]] alongside the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' and others.

In the story, Lovecraft linked the Yellow Sign to [[Hastur]], but from his brief (and only) mention it is not clear what Lovecraft meant Hastur to be. [[August Derleth]] developed Hastur into a [[Great Old One]] in his controversial reworking of Lovecraft's universe, elaborating on this connection in his own mythos stories. In the writings of Derleth and a few other latter-day Cthulhu Mythos authors, the King in Yellow is an [[Avatar]] of Hastur, so named because of his appearance as a thin, floating man covered in tattered yellow robes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In Lovecraft's cycle of horror sonnets, ''Fungi from Yuggoth'', sonnet XXVII "The Elder Pharos" mentions the last Elder One who lives alone talking to chaos via drums: "The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide a face not of this earth...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-345-02147-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thing with a silken mask of yellow also features in ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]''. 

In the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' roleplaying game]] published by [[Chaosium]], the King in Yellow is an avatar of Hastur who uses his eponymous play to spread insanity among humans. He is described as a hunched figure clad in tattered, yellow rags, who wears a smooth and featureless "Pallid Mask". Removing the mask is a sanity-shattering experience; the King's face is described as "inhuman eyes in a suppurating sea of stubby maggot-like mouths; liquescent flesh, tumorous and gelid, floating and reforming".{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}}

Although none of the characters in Chambers' book describe the plot of the play, Kevin Ross fabricated a plot for the play within the ''Call of Cthulhu'' mythos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

''[[The Secret World]]'', a Lovecraft-inspired [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]], quotes Cassilda's Song and other elements from ''The King in Yellow'' during a quest.

The theft of a supposed manuscript of the play ''The King in Yellow'' from the British Library forms a major plot element of [[Charles Stross]]'s Lovecraft-inspired book ''[[The Annihilation Score]]''.

In Alan Moore's comic series [[Providence (Avatar Press)|''Providence'']], as well as its sequel ''[[Neonomicon]]'', Moore re-imagines the Lovecraftian mythos while referencing and borrowing heavily from ''The King in Yellow''. The book is referenced by name throughout ''Providence'', as well as referencing a fictional variation ''Sous Le Monde'', French for "Under the World." In both ''Providence'' and its sequel, a recurring character named Johnny Carcosa appears as an avatar/speaker for a Lovecraftian entity, possibly [[Nyarlathotep]] or [[Azathoth]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://factsprovidence.wordpress.com/moore-lovecraft-comics-annotation-index/providence-10/ |title=Providence 10 |access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Game designer [[Robin D. Laws]], having written a collection of Chamber-inspired stories entitled ''New Tales of the Yellow Sign'', has converted the story "Repairer of Reputations" for ''[[Trail of Cthulhu]]''. He is currently writing a Yellow King Roleplaying Game, including crossover content for the Cthulhu Mythos.

'''''Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis''''' is [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s account of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The book was released in 1969, a year after [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|his assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Haruya Anami, "'Thirteen Days' Thirty Years After: Robert Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited," ''Journal of American &amp; Canadian Studies'' (1994) Issue 12, pp 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thirteen Days'' describes the meetings held by the Executive Committee ([[ExComm]]), the team assembled by US President [[John F. Kennedy]] to handle the tense situation that developed between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] following the discovery of Soviet [[nuclear missiles]] in [[Cuba]], {{convert|90|mi}} from [[Florida]]. Robert Kennedy, who was the [[US Attorney General]] at the time, describes his brother John's leadership style during the crisis as involved, but not controlling. Robert Kennedy viewed the military leaders on the council sympathetically, and recognized that their lifelong concentration on war was difficult to set aside.

The book was used as the basis for the 1974 television play ''[[The Missiles of October]]''. In 2000, the theatrical film ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' was produced using the same title, but based on an entirely different book, ''The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis'' by [[Ernest May (historian)|Ernest May]] and [[Philip Zelikow]]. That book contained some information that Kennedy was not able to reveal because it was classified at the time.

The '''Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts''' (TIPA) was founded by [[Tenzin Gyatso]], [[the 14th Dalai Lama]] on reaching [[McLeod Ganj]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[India]] in exile from [[Tibet]] in August 1959. It was then called  Tibetan Music, Dance and Drama Society, which was one of the first institutes set up by the Dalai Lama,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMqBvtL_nI0C&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Norbulingka+Institute&amp;as_brr=0#PPA514,M1 Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts] ''Frommer's India'', by Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, Niloufer Venkatraman, Shonar Joshi. Published by Frommer's, 2008. {{ISBN|0-470-16908-7}}. ''Page 514''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was established to preserve Tibetan artistic heritage, especially opera, dance, and music.

==Opera company==
The new opera company employed both professional and amateur performers and entertained the Tibetan refugee camps and staged numerous performances of the folk [[Lhamo]] operas. These performances lasted all day and were "a reminder of home" for refugees.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

'''''Time Squad''''' is an American children's animated television series created by [[Dave Wasson]] for [[Cartoon Network]], and the 10th of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. It follows the adventures of Otto Osworth, Buck Tuddrussel, and the robot Larry 3000, a trio of hapless "time cops" living in the far distant future who [[time travel|travel back in time]] attempting to correct the course of history. During their adventures, they run into major [[historical figure]]s such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], and [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]], who have taken a drastically different course of life than history dictates. The mission of the Time Squad is to guide these figures onto the correct path and ensure the integrity of the future.

The series premiered during Cartoon Network's marathon block "Cartoon Cartoon Summer" on June 8, 2001, and ended after two seasons on November 26, 2003, airing 26 episodes in total. In the course of its run, the series received five [[Annie Award]] nominations. Creator Dave Wasson described the series as "a C-student's guide to history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon Net Gives Go to 4 New Shows|first=Paula|last=Bernstein|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/cartoon-net-gives-go-to-4-new-shows-1117794058/|date=February 21, 2001|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the final Cartoon Network original series to premiere during [[Betty Cohen]]'s tenure, as she later resigned due to creative disagreements with [[Jamie Kellner]], then-head of [[Turner Broadcasting System]].

==Overview==
The show is set in the year 100,000,000 AD, on a satellite which orbits Earth. This future Earth is never visited directly, though it is referred in dialogue as a peaceful [[utopia]] where there are no longer any problems to solve. All nations of the world have merged into one, and according to Tuddrussel, there are "no wars, no pollution, and [[bacon]] is good for your [[heart]]".

Despite this cheerful vision of the future, the space station on which the characters live and from which they travel to the past is remarkably [[dystopia|dystopic]]. It features a shooting range, a [[terrarium]] and a prison for repeat offenders, but it is dank, outdated (for the time) and unclean. Mostly this seems to be down to officer Buck Tuddrussel ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a scruffy and immature perennial bachelor, who nevertheless happens to be the station's most senior officer.

The only other official member of Buck's unit is Larry 3000 ([[Mark Hamill]]), a translator robot and former diplomat who was rendered more or less obsolete when all of the world's nations merged. Buck's mindless machismo clashes with Larry's effete sensibilities, and the two bicker terribly. Added to this the fact that neither of them has any great knowledge of history, they made a rather poor team together.

However, when they encounter Otto Osworth ([[Pamela Adlon]]), an 8-year-old boy who happens to be an orphan from the 21st century, he is quickly recruited and added to the team. Otto is shown to be the only one on the team with any enthusiasm or competence for the job. The problem is, neither of the other two are particularly willing to listen to his advice, and he must often resort to trickery to make sure the mission is completed.

The Time Squad organization is set up to ensure that history is maintained and the future protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Eli Whitney's Flesh-Eating Mistake|series=Time Squad|network=Cartoon Network|date=June 8, 2001|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Larry 3000, "time is like a rope", and, as it is woven at one end, ages and gradually unravels and frays at the other. In the context of the show, this often means that historical figures have made different, sometimes [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], choices in life (see [[free will]]), and as such will not be able to fulfill the role that history says they fulfilled (an example of this [[Henry Ford]] did not invent the automobile assembly line due to constant hostility of the [[Dodo Bird|dodo birds]] that never became extinct). According to creator Dave Wasson, "We started by basically knowing what a guy did in history, then found the most outlandish way he could go wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Time Squad' Aims to Rewrite History|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=June 8, 2001|work=[[USA Today]]|section=Life|page=15E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* {{anchor|Otto Osworth}}Otto Osworth (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]): An orphan illegally traveling along with Tuddrussel and Larry, taken on board due to their incompetence and his impressive historical knowledge (and for Otto to escape his brutal life at the orphanage). Despite being a bookworm, his demeanor is far from boring; he is just as childlike and jocular as any regular eight-year-old. Even though he is the youngest, he is also the most responsible out of the squad, being the only one pure enough to not let himself get swayed by temptations. Depending on who he's siding with, he can either become loud and destructive (when Tuddrussel has him company) or composed and calm (when it's Larry he agrees with). It's unknown what happened to Otto's parents.
* {{anchor|Larry 3000}}Lawrence "Larry" 3000 (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]): A grumpy robot and the only one on board able to operate the computer. It's his job to make sure the squad ends up at the right time and place. Initially, he was programmed as a polyglotic robot for diplomatic purposes; when all of the nations rejoiced into one, huge country, his consular abilities were no longer needed. Larry is famous for his effeminate behaviour and interests, which are portrayed all but subtly. Unusually, he is extremely dramatic and open in showing his emotions whilst still being the snarkiest of the trio. He prides himself in having knowledge of proper etiquette and manners. For Otto, he has been repeatedly depicted as a maternal figure.
* {{anchor|Buck Tuddrussel}}Beauregard "Buck" Tuddrussel (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): An immature time cop, who possesses all the physical requirements for his job and none the intellectual. Whenever there's someone who needs a beating up (and even when they do not), he's the best person to get assigned for such a task. Impulsiveness, aggressiveness and air-headedness are traits which define Tuddrussel quite nicely. Not much of his backstory is known, aside from his Southern heritage and a short-lived marriage to fellow time cop Sheila Sternwell.

===Recurring===
* {{anchor|Sheila Sternwell}}Sheila Sternwell Tudrussel (voiced by Mari Weiss): A lieutenant within Time Squad ranks, Sheila is a no-nonsense woman that takes her job seriously. The ex-wife of Tuddrussel, it's made clear that while she regrets making the mistake of marrying him in the first place, and can be slightly bitter towards him, she does not actually resent him and still does her job and helps out Tuddrussel and his unit when needed. She even seems to go far in not ratting out Tuddrussel and Larry over Otto, and other screw ups that she should be reporting.
* {{anchor|XJ5}}XJ5 (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]): An advanced robot that is more qualified for the job of a time cop than Larry, and he loves to rub it in. Working with Officer Sternwell, XJ5 provides actual help and guidance on missions.
* {{anchor|J.T. Laser}}J.T. Laser (voiced by [[Jim Wise]]): Professional and competent, J.T. is the best officer of what Time Squad has to offer; but he is also an arrogant jerk that gladly makes trouble for Tuddrussel and Larry.
* {{anchor|Lance Nine Trillion}}Lance Nine Trillion (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]): A high-tech robot in Time Squad that provides with the most ranked officer. Lance is the perfect (obnoxious) partner for J.T.
* {{anchor|Sister Thornley}}Sister Thornley (voiced by [[Dee Dee Rescher]]): Otto's former caretaker and nasty [[nun]] of the show before getting "adopted" by Larry and Tuddrussel. Otto had good reason to fear her, as did the other kids that she kept. Obviously not afraid of the police or anyone coming after her, Sister Thornley freely abuses kids that are put into her care, while at the orphanage and even more disturbingly in public. Her motives are despairingly questionable, such making the children work under horrific conditions in order to make a quick buck, or why she had a problem with Otto reading books (or any child reading, for that matter. She apparently had an entire policy against it). At the end, Larry and Tuddrussel officially takes Otto much to her dismay, but to her joy she finds another genius child she could abuse.

'''''Woman with a Water Jug''''', also known as '''''Young Woman with a Water Pitcher''''', is a painting finished between 1660–1662 by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] in the [[Baroque]] style. It is oil on canvas, 45.7cm x 40.6 cm, and is on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]]. 

==Description==
A young woman is found in the center of the picture. She is opening a window with her right hand, while she holds a water jug with her left hand. This jug rests on a larger platter. Both of these, among other objects, are upon on a table. This is decorated with a red-colored tablecloth. Behind the table stands a chair upon which lies a blue material. The woman gazes out the window. The clothing of the woman consists of a dark blue dress with a black and gold overpiece. A white cloth serves as her headpiece. A map hangs in the background on the wall. 

This painting is one of a closely related group painted in the early to mid-1660s as the artist was not using linear perspective and geometric order and the light was his only source of emphasis.

==Provenance==
''Young Woman with a Water Pitcher'' was purchased by [[Henry Gurdon Marquand]] in 1887 at a Paris gallery for $800. When Marquand brought it to the United States, it was the first Vermeer in America. Marquand donated the artwork along with other pieces in his collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. &lt;ref&gt; [http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Henry_Gurdon_Marquand_Papers_b17500448.pdf Finding aid for the Henry Gurdon Marquand Papers, 1852-1903].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hittite empire|Hittite]] '''İmamkullu relief''' (previously also ''İmamkulu'') is a [[rock relief]] near the town of [[İmamkullu]] in [[Tomarza]] district in [[Kayseri Province]], [[Turkey]]. In Turkish it is known as ''Yazılı Kaya'' ("inscribed cliff") and ''Şimşekkaya'' ("lightning cliff").  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The [[trachyte]] block with the relief is located on the flank of the 3045 m high Bey Dağı to the south of İmamkullu. This spot marks the start of the Gezbel pass, where two routes met and crossed the [[Taurus Mountains]] in ancient times. One of them came from the Hittite heartland through [[Kayseri]] and Tomarza, following the Zamantı Irmağı river; the other came from [[Cappadocia]] via [[Develi]],passing the [[Fıraktın relief|Fıraktın]] and [[Taşçı reliefs]] on the way. The [[Hanyeri relief]] stands at the other end of the Gezbel pass, to the southeast.

== Description ==
The relief is about 3.25 x 2 metres and was engraved on the northwest side of a large boulder, on a slightly convex, but conveniently flat surface. It is now very worn. It consists of three sections. The left section features a human figure, moving to the right, perhaps the creator of the monument, holding a spear in his left hand and a bow in his left (the string is only roughly indicated). On his belt there are knobs and some traces of a sword. He wears a round cap and there are traces also of a horn and pointed shoes. [[Luwian hieroglyphs]] were engraved in front of his head, which name him as a son of the king. His name is given as Kuwalanamuwa. A prince of this name is also known from the Hanyeri and [[Manisa relief]]s. Whether they are all the same person is not certain, though certainly possible.

The central portion is the largest. In the upper part, the weather god is depicted in a chariot, driving to the right. He wears pointy shoes, a short soldier's kilt and a pointed hat with horns, which identifies him as a god. Traces of a sword can also be seen on his belt. He has a mace in his right hand and holds the reins of the galloping bulls which pull his chariot with his left hand. Above his outstretched hand there are three hieroglyphs which name him as the weather god of heaven; a fourth hieroglyph below the others is no longer legible. The god and his chariot stand on the bent necks of three mountain gods, in a manner similar to the main scene at [[Yazılıkaya]]. The wear the long robes and peaked hats which are usual for mountain gods, and are armed with swords. They themselves stand on top of three chimaeric creatures with cat's heads and raised human arms.

The top part of the right portion of the relief shows a facing goddess with raised arms, who is probably [[Šauška]]/[[Ishtar]]. Her head is in profile, looking left towards the approaching weather god. Her arms hold her robe open. On her head there are four&lt;ref&gt;Kohlmeyer. "Felsbilder der hethitischen Großreichszeit." ''Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica'' 15 (1983) pp. 80-86.&lt;/ref&gt; or five&lt;ref&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften. Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei.'' Zabern, Mainz 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; prongs of a crown or coiffure. Wings rise up from her shoulders. Ehringhaus identifies a six-pointed star above her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften. Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei.'' Zabern, Mainz 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Her legs are depicted without feet, in the manner of cult statues and she stands on top of a stylised tree. Between the weather god and the goddess, is a bird flying to the left. The motif of the weather god and an undressing goddess, often with a bird between them, is attested from the early [[Bronze age]] on Syrian cylinder seals (and other media). Jutta Börker-Klähn proposes a connection with the [[Asherah|Asherdu]] myth, in which Ishtar in the form of a bird catches the weather god having sex with Asherdu, the wife of [[Elkunirsa]].

The relief is dated to the 13th century BC, the late Hittite empire, like the Hanyeri relief.

== Research history ==
A report was first published by the French orientalist [[Louis Delaporte]] after its discovery by Kemaleddin Karamete of Kayseri in 1934. In 1935 the American orientalist [[Ignace Gelb]] visited the site. [[Sedat Alp]] and [[Ekrem Akurgal]] recorded the inscription in their Anatolian work of 1947. In 1975, [[Markus Wäfler]] published a description of the relief and its inscriptions. In the same year, [[Piero Meriggi]] proposed a reading of the hieroglyphs, which [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]], who visited the relief in 1978, supported. A different reading of the left hand figure's name was proposed by Jutta Börker-Klähn. In 1983, [[Kay Kohlmeyer]] published a detailed description and discussion of the monument. Finally, [[Horst Ehringhaus]] provides another description of the image and inscriptions in his 2005 book on the cliff inscriptions of the Hittite empire.

A cast of the relief is displayed outside the Archaeological Museum of Kayseri.
