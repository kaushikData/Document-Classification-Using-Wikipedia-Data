'''Ahmad Rifaat Pasha''' (8 December 1825 – 15 May 1858) was a member of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. He was [[heir presumptive]] to [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]].

However, in 1858, a special train conveying Ahmad Rifaat Pasha was being carried on a [[car float]] across the Nile at [[Kafr el-Zayyat]].&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes |first=Hugh |year=1981 |title=Middle East Railways |location=Harrow |publisher=Continental Railway Circle |isbn=0-9503469-7-7 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train fell off the car float into the river and the prince was drowned.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

Sa'id outlived Ahmad Rifaat until 1863, when he was succeeded by [[Isma'il Pasha]].

A '''breed''' is a specific group of domestic animals having [[homogeneous]] appearance ([[phenotype]]), homogeneous [[behavior]], and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same [[species]]. Breeds are formed through [[genetic isolation]] and either natural [[adaptation]] to the environment or [[selective breeding]], or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of "breeds" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.&lt;ref&gt;The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a [[term of art]] amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.&lt;ref&gt;''The Genetics of Populations''. Jay L Lush. Iowa State University Press. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

When bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this ability{{snd}}known as "[[breeding true]]"{{snd}}is a requirement for a breed. [[Plant]] breeds are more commonly known as [[cultivar]]s. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as [[crossbreed]]s or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|botanical ''variety'']], even different [[Genus|genera]]) are referred to as ''[[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Banga, Surinder S. (November 25, 1998).  ''Hybrid Cultivar Development'', p. 119.  Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3-540-63523-8}} &lt;!--This is cited only for the fact that plant crosses above the cultivar level are called hybrids; doesn't address animals.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[breeder]] (or group of breeders) who initially establishes a breed does so by [[Selective breeding|selecting]] individual animals from within a [[gene pool]] that they see as having the necessary qualities needed to enhance the breed model they are aiming for. These animals are referred to as [[foundation stock]]. Furthermore, the breeder mates the most desirable representatives of the breed from his or her point of view, aiming  to pass such characteristics to their [[Offspring|progeny]]. This process is known as [[selective breeding]]. A written description of desirable and undesirable breed representatives is referred to as a [[breed standard]].

==Breed characteristics==
Breed specific characteristics, also known as breed traits, are inherited, and [[purebred]] animals pass such traits from [[generation]] to generation. Thus, all specimens of the same breed carry several genetic characteristics of the original foundation animal(s). In order to maintain the breed, a breeder would select those animals with the most desirable traits to achieve further maintenance and developing of such traits. At the same time, the breed would avoid animals carrying characteristics undesirable or not typical for the breed, including faults or [[genetics|genetic]] defects. The [[population]] within the same breed should consist of a sufficient number of animals to maintain the breed within the specified parameters without the necessity of forced [[inbreeding]]. 

Domestic animal breeds commonly differ from country to country, and from nation to nation. Breeds originating in a certain country are known as "native breeds" of that country.

Channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) and Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) from the model organism ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' are the first discovered channelrhodopsins. Variants have been cloned from other algal species, and more are expected.

==Structure==
[[File:3ug9.png|thumb|Crystal structure of channelrhodopsin. [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] {{PDBe|3ug9}}&lt;ref name="pmid22266941"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kato HE, Zhang F, Yizhar O, Ramakrishnan C, Nishizawa T, Hirata K, Ito J, Aita Y, Tsukazaki T, Hayashi S, Hegemann P, Maturana AD, Ishitani R, Deisseroth K, Nureki O | title = Crystal structure of the channelrhodopsin light-gated cation channel | journal = Nature | volume = 482 | issue = 7385 | pages = 369–74 |date=February 2012 | pmid = 22266941 | doi = 10.1038/nature10870 | pmc = 4160518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In terms of structure, channelrhodopsins are [[retinylidene protein]]s. They are [[seven-transmembrane protein]]s like [[rhodopsin]], and contain the light-isomerizable [[chromophore]] all-''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]''-[[retinal]] (an [[aldehyde]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[vitamin A]]). The retinal chromophore is covalently linked to the rest of the protein through a protonated [[Schiff base]]. Whereas most 7-transmembrane proteins are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s that open other ion channels indirectly via [[Second messenger system|second messenger]]s (i.e., they are [[metabotropic]]), channelrhodopsins directly form ion channels (i.e., they are [[ionotropic]]).&lt;ref name="Nagel_2003" /&gt; This makes cellular depolarization extremely fast, robust, and useful for bioengineering and neuroscience applications, including [[photostimulation]].

==Function==
[[Image:ChR2scheme.png|frame|right|Scheme of ChR2-RFP fusion construct]]

The natural ("wild-type") ChR2 absorbs blue light with an absorption and [[action spectrum]] maximum at 480&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Bamann_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bamann C, Kirsch T, Nagel G, Bamberg E | title = Spectral characteristics of the photocycle of channelrhodopsin-2 and its implication for channel function | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 375 | issue = 3 | pages = 686–94 |date=January 2008 | pmid = 18037436 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.10.072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the all-''trans''-retinal complex absorbs a [[photon]], it induces a conformational change from all-''trans'' to 13-''cis''-retinal. This change introduces a further one in the transmembrane protein, opening the pore to at least 6 Å. Within milliseconds, the retinal relaxes back to the all-trans form, closing the pore and stopping the flow of ions.&lt;ref name="Nagel_2003" /&gt; Most natural channelrhodopsins are nonspecific [[cation]] channels, conducting H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Recently, [[anion-conducting channelrhodopsin]]s have been discovered.&lt;ref name="Govorunova_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Govorunova EG, Sineshchekov OA, Janz R, Liu X, Spudich JL | title = Natural light-gated anion channels: A family of microbial rhodopsins for advanced optogenetics | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6248 | pages = 647–650 | date = 2015 | doi=10.1126/science.aaa7484 | pmid=26113638 | pmc=4764398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designer-channelrhodopsins==
Channelrhodopsins are key tools in [[optogenetics]]. The [[C-terminal]] end of Channelrhodopsin-2 extends into the intracellular space and can be replaced by [[fluorescent protein]]s without affecting channel function. This kind of [[fusion construct]] can be useful to visualize the morphology of ChR2 expressing cells.&lt;ref name="Boyden_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyden ES, Zhang F, Bamberg E, Nagel G, Deisseroth K | title = Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity | journal = Nat. Neurosci. | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 1263–8 |date=September 2005 | pmid = 16116447 | doi = 10.1038/nn1525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang_Oertner_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang YP, Oertner TG | title = Optical induction of synaptic plasticity using a light-sensitive channel | journal = Nat.

===Kinetics===
Closing of the channel after optical activation can be substantially delayed by mutating the protein residues C128 or D156. This modification results in super-sensitive channelrhodopsins that can be opened by a blue light pulse and closed by a green or yellow light pulse (Step-function opsins).&lt;ref name="Berndt_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berndt A, Yizhar O, Gunaydin LA, Hegemann P, Deisseroth K | title = Bi-stable neural state switches | journal = Nat.

===Photocurrent amplitude===
H134R and T159C mutants display increased photocurrents, and a combination of T159 and E123 (ET/TC) has slightly larger photocurrents and slightly faster kinetics than wild-type ChR2.&lt;ref name="Berndt_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berndt A, Schoenenberger P, Mattis J, Tye KM, Deisseroth K, Hegemann P, Oertner TG | title = High-efficiency channelrhodopsins for fast neuronal stimulation at low light levels | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 18 | pages = 7595–600 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21504945 | pmc = 3088623 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1017210108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among ChR variants, ChIEF, a chimera and point mutant of ChR1 and ChR2, demonstrates the largest photocurrents and the least desensitization and has kinetics similar to wild-type ChR2.&lt;ref name="Lin_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin JY | title = A user's guide to channelrhodopsin variants: features, limitations and future developments | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–25 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20621963 | pmc = 2995811 | doi = 10.1113/expphysiol.2009.051961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wavelength===
Chimeric channelrhodopsins have been developed by combining transmembrane helices from ChR1 and VChR1, leading to the development of ChRs with red spectral shifts (such as C1V1 and ReaChR).&lt;ref name="Yizhar_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin JY, Knutsen PM, Muller A, Kleinfeld D, Tsien RY | title = ReaChR: a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin enables deep transcranial optogenetic excitation | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 1499–508 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23995068 | pmc = 3793847 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ReaChR has improved membrane trafficking and strong expression in mammalian cells, and has been used for minimally invasive, transcranial activation of brainstem [[motoneurons]]. Searches for homologous sequences in other organisms has yielded spectrally improved and stronger red-shifted channelrhodpsins (Chrimson).&lt;ref name="Klapoetke_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klapoetke NC, Murata Y, Kim SS, Pulver SR, Birdsey-Benson A, Cho YK, Morimoto TK, Chuong AS, Carpenter EJ, Tian Z, Wang J, Xie Y, Yan Z, Zhang Y, Chow BY, Surek B, Melkonian M, Jayaraman V, Constantine-Paton M, Wong GK, Boyden ES | title = Independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–46 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24509633 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2836 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with ChR2, these yellow/red light-sensitive channelrhodopsins allow controlling two populations of neurons independently with light pulses of different colors.&lt;ref name="Hooks_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hooks BM, Lin JY, Guo C, Svoboda K | title = Dual-channel circuit mapping reveals sensorimotor convergence in the primary motor cortex | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 10 | pages = 4418–26 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25762684 | pmc = 4355205 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3741-14.2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A blue-shifted channelrhodopsin has been discovered in the alga ''Scherffelia dubia''.

==Applications==
Channelrhodopsins can be readily expressed in excitable cells such as [[neurons]] using a variety of transfection techniques (viral [[transfection]], [[electroporation]], [[gene gun]]) or [[transgenic animals]]. The light-absorbing pigment [[retinal]] is present in most cells (of [[vertebrates]]) as [[Vitamin A]], making it possible to [[Photostimulation|photostimulate]] neurons without adding any chemical compounds. Before the discovery of channelrhodopsins, neuroscientists were limited to &lt;u&gt;recording&lt;/u&gt; the activity of neurons in the brain and &lt;u&gt;correlate&lt;/u&gt; this activity with behavior. This is not sufficient to prove that the recorded neural activity actually &lt;u&gt;[[Causality|caused]]&lt;/u&gt; that behavior. Controlling networks of genetically modified cells with light, an emerging field known as [[Optogenetics]]., allows researchers now to explore the [[Causality|causal]] link between activity in a specific group of neurons and [[mental event]]s, e.g. [[Decision-making|decision making]]. Optical control of behavior has been demonstrated in nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice.&lt;ref name="Douglass_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Douglass AD, Kraves S, Deisseroth K, Schier AF, Engert F|date=August 2008|title=Escape behavior elicited by single, channelrhodopsin-2-evoked spikes in zebrafish somatosensory neurons|journal=Curr.

==History==
Motility and photoorientation of microalgae have been studied over more than hundred years in many laboratories worldwide. In 1980, Ken Foster developed the first consistent theory about the functionality of algal eyes.&lt;ref name="Foster &amp; Smyth 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster KW, Smyth R| title = Light Antennas in Phototactic Algae | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 44| issue = 4 | pages = 572–630 | year = 1980 | PMID = 7010112 | pmc=373196}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also analyzed published action spectra and complemented blind cells with retinal and retinal analogues, which led to the conclusion that the photoreceptor for motility responses in Chlorophyceae is [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref name="Foster et al. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foster KW, Saranak J, Patel N, Zarilli G, Okabe M, Kline T, Nakanishi K | title = A rhodopsin is the functional photoreceptor for phototaxis in the unicellular eukaryote Chlamydomonas | journal = Nature | volume = 311| pages = 489–491 |date=October 1984 | pmid = 6493336 | doi = 10.1038/nature311756a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Photocurrents of the Chlorophyceae ''Heamatococcus pluvialis'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' were studied over many years in the groups of Oleg Sineshchekov and [[Peter Hegemann]], resulting in two seminal publications in the years 1978 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Litvin et al. 1978"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Litvin FF, Sineshchekov OA, Sineshchekov VA | title = Photoreceptor electric potential in the phototaxis of the alga Haematococcus pluvialis. | journal = Nature | volume = 271| issue = 5644 | pages = 476–478 | year = 1978 | PMID = 628427| doi =  10.1038/271476a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harz &amp; Hegemann 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harz H, Hegemann P | title = Rhodopsin-regulated calcium currents in Chlamydomonas. | journal = Nature | volume = 351| issue = 6326 | pages = 489–491 |date=June 1991 | doi =  10.1038/351489a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on action spectroscopy and simultaneous recordings of photocurrents and flagellar beating, it was determined that the photoreceptor currents and subsequent flagellar movements are mediated by rhodopsin and control phototaxis and photophobic responses.

The nucleotide sequences of the rhodopsins now called channelrhodopsins ChR1 and ChR2 were finally uncovered in a large-scale [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] sequencing project in ''C. reinhardtii''.

Meanwhile, their roles in generation of photoreceptor currents in algal cells were characterized by Oleg Sineshchekov, Kwang-Hwan Jung and John Spudich,&lt;ref name = "Sineshchekov_2002" /&gt; and Peter Berthold and Peter Hegemann.&lt;ref name="Berthold et al._2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berthold P, Tsunoda SP, Ernst OP, Mages W, Gradmann D, Hegemann P | title = Channelrhodopsin-1 initiates phototaxis and photophobic responses in chlamydomonas by immediate light-induced depolarization.| journal = Plant Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 1665–1677 |date=June 2008 | pmid = 18552201 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.108.057919 | pmc=2483371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, three groups sequentially established ChR2 as a tool for [[Genetic engineering|genetically]] targeted optical remote control ([[optogenetics]]) of [[neuron]]s, neural circuits and behavior. At first, [[Karl Deisseroth]]'s lab (in a paper published in August 2005) demonstrated that ChR2 could be deployed to control [[mammal]]ian neurons ''[[in vitro]]'', achieving temporal precision on the order of milliseconds (both in terms of delay to spiking and in terms of temporal jitter).&lt;ref name="Boyden_2005" /&gt; This was a significant finding, since, first, all opsins (microbial as well as vertebrate) require [[retinal]] as the light-sensing co-factor and it was unclear whether central mammalian nerve cells would contain sufficient retinal levels, but they do; second, it showed, despite the small single-channel conductance, sufficient potency to drive mammalian neurons above action potential threshold; and, third, it demonstrated channelrhodopsin to be the first optogenetic tool, with which neural activity could be controlled with the temporal precision at which neurons operate (milliseconds).  An earlier tool for photostimulation, cHARGe, demonstrated proof of principle in cultured neurons&lt;ref name="Zemelman_2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zemelman BV, Lee GA, Ng M, Miesenböck G | title = Selective photostimulation of genetically chARGed neurons | journal = Neuron | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–22 |date=January 2002 | pmid = 11779476 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00574-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was never used by other groups since it operated with a precision on the order of seconds, was highly variable, and did not allow control of individual [[action potential]]s.

A second study was published later by Peter Hegemann's and Stefan Herlitze's groups confirming the ability of ChR2 to control the activity of [[vertebrate]] neurons, at this time in the chick spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Li_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li X, Gutierrez DV, Hanson MG, Han J, Mark MD, Chiel H, Hegemann P, Landmesser LT, Herlitze S | title = Fast noninvasive activation and inhibition of neural and network activity by vertebrate rhodopsin and green algae channelrhodopsin | journal = Proc.

U.S.A. | volume = 102 | issue = 49 | pages = 17816–21 |date=December 2005 | pmid = 16306259 | pmc = 1292990 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0509030102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was the first wherein ChR2 was expressed alongside an optical silencer, vertebrate [[rhodopsin]]-4 in this case, demonstrating for the first time that excitable cells could be activated and silenced using these two tools simultaneously, illuminating the tissue at different wavelengths.

The groups of Alexander Gottschalk and Ernst Bamberg (with Georg Nagel taking the experimental lead) demonstrated that ChR2, if expressed in specific neurons or muscle cells, can evoke predictable behaviors, i.e. can control the nervous system of an intact animal, in this case the invertebrate ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.&lt;ref name="Nagel_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagel G, Brauner M, Liewald JF, Adeishvili N, Bamberg E, Gottschalk A | title = Light activation of channelrhodopsin-2 in excitable cells of Caenorhabditis elegans triggers rapid behavioral responses | journal = Curr.

Although both aspects had been illustrated earlier that year by another group, the [[Gero Miesenböck|Miesenböck]] lab, deploying the indirectly light-gated ion channel P2X2,&lt;ref name="Lima_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lima SQ, Miesenböck G | title = Remote control of behavior through genetically targeted photostimulation of neurons | journal = Cell | volume = 121 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–52 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15820685 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was henceforth microbial opsins like channelrhodopsin that dominated the field of genetically targeted remote control of excitable cells, due to the power, speed, targetability, ease of use, and temporal precision of direct optical activation, not requiring any external chemical compound such as caged ligands.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang F, Wang LP, Boyden ES, Deisseroth K | title = Channelrhodopsin-2 and optical control of excitable cells | journal = Nat.

To overcome its principal downsides — the small single-channel conductance (especially in steady-state), the limitation to one optimal excitation wavelength (~470&amp;nbsp;nm, blue) as well as the relatively long recovery time, not permitting controlled firing of neurons above 20–40&amp;nbsp;Hz — ChR2 has been optimized using [[genetic engineering]]. A [[point mutation]] H134R (exchanging the amino acid Histidine in position 134 of the native protein for an Arginine) resulted in increased steady-state conductance, as described in a 2005 paper that also established ChR2 as an optogenetic tool in ''C. elegans''.&lt;ref name="Nagel_2005"/&gt; In 2009, [[Roger Tsien]]'s lab optimized ChR2 for further increases in steady-state conductance and dramatically reduced desensitization by creating chimeras of ChR1 and ChR2 and mutating specific amino acids, yielding ChEF and ChIEF, which allowed the driving of trains of action potentials up to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Lin_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin JY, Lin MZ, Steinbach P, Tsien RY | title = Characterization of engineered channelrhodopsin variants with further improved photocurrents and kinetics | journal = Biophys.

The groups of Hegemann and Deisseroth also discovered that the introduction of the point mutation C128S makes the resulting ChR2-derivative a step-function tool: Once "switched on" by blue light, ChR2(C128S) stays in the open state until it is switched off by yellow light – a modification that deteriorates temporal precision, but increases light sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Berndt_2009" /&gt; They also discovered and characterized VChR1 in the multicellular algae ''Volvox carteri''. VChR1 produces only tiny photocurrents, but with an absorption spectrum that is red-shifted relative to ChR2.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2008a" /&gt; Using parts of the ChR1 sequence, photocurrent amplitude was later improved to allow excitation of two neuronal populations at two distinct wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Yizhar_2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24588">This article documents traditional and some modern '''[[childbirth]]''' practices in '''[[Thailand]]'''. Traditional principles are largely influenced by the [[Thai folklore|folk beliefs]] in [[Central Thailand|Central]] and [[North Thailand]], and modern practices by the western medical model.

==Background==
===Health and illness theories===
'''Traditional Thai medicine''' is based on the mixed indigenous traditions of Indian, Chinese, and Khmer influences. Historically, [[Jīvaka|Jivaka Kumar Bhaccha]] is considered the "Father Doctor" of Thai medicine.&lt;ref name="Salguero" /&gt; The "circle of life" is a central concept in Thai medical philosophy, which involves the three essences of the human body that must be kept in balance to maintain health. The three essences are: (1) ''Energy'' (holds mind, body, and heart together, similar to qi/chi/prana), (2) ''Body'' (physical substance), and (3) ''Citta'' (mind/heart, non-physical being that holds all thoughts, emotions, spirit, inner self).&lt;ref name="Salguero" /&gt; Thai traditional medicine has three branches that correspond to the three essences: [[Thai massage]], [[herbalism]] (including dietary regimen), and spiritual or religious healing.&lt;ref name="Salguero" /&gt; The three branches are used to balance each of the essences. For example, there are ten tastes of foods and herbs that are recognized by the Thai medicine, and tastes opposite of the disease process would be used to treat it.&lt;ref name="Salguero" /&gt; Similarly, the four elements of the body (fire, water, air, and earth) must be kept in balance by eating certain foods.&lt;ref name="Salguero" /&gt;

===Women's health statistics===
Female life expectancy at birth in Thailand is 76.08 years (as compared to 71.24 years for men).&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; Two percent of Thai women smoke.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; The current (2011) birth rate is estimated to be 12.95 births per 1,000 population.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; The maternal mortality ratio is 20.63 per 100,000 live births, and the major causes of maternal death are [[Postpartum hemorrhage|hemorrhage]] (27.8%), sepsis (8.73%), toxemia (16.7%), amniotic fluid embolism (11.9%), and other causes (8.73%) (2003).&lt;ref name="Improving" /&gt;

A high percentage of laboring women (97%) are attended by skilled health personnel, which is much higher than the regional average (49%) (2008).&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; Women in Thailand are also much more likely to attend four or more ante-natal visits (74%) compared to women in other countries in Southeast Asia (43%) and use contraception (81% compared to 58%) (2008).&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

The under-5 mortality rate (per 1000 live births) has decreased to 14 (2008) &lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; from 28 (2002).&lt;ref name="Improving" /&gt; Infant mortality has also decreased from 20 (2002)&lt;ref name="Improving" /&gt; to 16.39 deaths per 1000 births (2011).&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

==Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs==
[[File:XRF-krasue.jpg|thumb|''Krasue'', a nocturnal [[ghost]] of [[Thai folklore]] haunting pregnant village women]]

There are many traditional beliefs associated with the way pregnancy should be carried out. According to the [[Central Thailand|central Thai]] beliefs, [[Fertilisation|conception]] occurs when a '''''khwan''''' (soul) flies into the womb during a sexual encounter.&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; A woman whose period stops and who starts [[food craving|craving]] sour foods is thought to be pregnant.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Once a woman finds out she is pregnant, she is to tell her partner first, followed by her mother and her mother-in-law.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; [[Infertility]] is seen as imbalance in one of the "essences". Certain [[acupressure]] points, however, are used to resolve the issue.&lt;ref name="Salguero2" /&gt;
[[Abortion]] is seen by Buddhists as "impeding an individual's rebirth and disobeying a religious prohibition on taking life" &lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; and it is currently illegal in Thailand. Only in the following three cases it is allowed: (1) if mother’s life is in danger, (2) if mother's physical or mental health is at risk, or (3) if the pregnancy is a result of an offense or seduction of a girl under 15.&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt; However, about two-thirds of women seek help outside of the main healthcare system to terminate the unplanned pregnancy, and 12% attempt to do it themselves.&lt;ref name="Improving" /&gt;

In [[Thai folklore]] there is a ghost known as ''[[Krasue]]'' (กระสือ) who haunts pregnant women in their homes just before or after the childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phraya Anuman Rajadhon]], Essays on Thai Folklore, Editions Duang Kamol, {{ISBN|974-210-345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Village legends say that it hovers around the house of the pregnant woman uttering sharp cries to instill fear. It uses an elongated proboscis-like tongue&lt;ref&gt;[http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k247/AMFrank/KRASUE/snapshot20061023170035.jpg Krasue tongue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q217/Taliesin_ttlg/krasue/krasue_tongue.jpg Krasue tongue extended]&lt;/ref&gt; to reach the [[fetus]] or its [[placenta]] within the womb. This habit, among other unmentionable things that this spirit does, is believed to be the cause of many diseases affecting mainly rural women during their pregnancy.

===Diet during pregnancy===
Since pregnancy is considered to be a "hot" condition in Thai medicine, foods to maintain warmth are preferred, such as ginger tea, [[coconut milk]], young coconut meat, salty foods, tamarind, fish, garlic, onion, and warm liquids.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; Those who consume '''''pak plang''''', a slippery vine-like green vegetable, will have an easy birth, since it will make the baby’s body slippery.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; '''''Ya tom''''' herbal medicine could be prepared as tea and would make the baby strong and easy to deliver if the pregnant woman drinks the tea three times a day for three consecutive days.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt;
However, '''''khong salaeng''''' (allergic foodstuffs) must be avoided by pregnant women, since it may cause unwanted problems during labor or for the unborn child. ''Khong salaeng'' foods include papaya salad, pickled food, spicy hot food (baby may be born hairless), coffee and tea (baby will be not intelligent), shellfish (prevents perineum from drying after delivery), and Thai eggplants (may cause anal pain after delivery).&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Women are also advised to eat only half a banana, since birth may become obstructed if she eats a whole banana.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt;

===Behavior during pregnancy===
According to traditional beliefs, strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, farm work, and even driving a car may lead to a [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]], however this may sometimes be unavoidable by the rural poor.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Regular activity, however, would promote easy birth by making the abdomen "loose" (''tong klon'') and therefore aiding in the downward rotation of the baby. Idleness and frequent resting, on the other hand, complicates birth.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt;

There are accounts that sexual activity was promoted during pregnancy in central Thailand since sperm would make the baby strong,&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; however, in the northern parts of Thailand it is seen as a form of vigorous activity that may result in miscarriage.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Although pregnant women are prohibited from attending a funeral, wearing a brooch on the abdomen would counteract any negative effects on the fetus. Women should also not make any advanced preparations, such as buying or making baby clothes, as this may result the death of the baby.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Other pregnancy-related beliefs include not sitting in the stairway (causes obstructed birth), not burying anything in the soil (difficult birth),&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; and having "magical showers" (to promote easy delivery and emotional calmness). These showers should be blessed with sacred words known as ''nam mon''  by ''mor mon''' (a magical healer, or even a monk); they are usually done in an open-aired space from the eighth to ninth month of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; During the last weeks of normal pregnancy, a woman may choose to go to a masseuse for "lifting of the uterus (''yok thong'') to increase comfort".&lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt;

===Modern pregnancy===
Today, [[pregnancy test|pregnancy test kits]] are available at pharmacies. Pregnancy can also be confirmed at a gynecologist's office using blood and urine tests.&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt; Currently, pregnant women are required to attend at least four ante-natal visits.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Normal pregnancies can be managed by gynecological nurses or midwives, while high-risk pregnancies must be monitored by obstetricians.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; Ideally, a woman would attend ante-natal check-ups "every month until 28 weeks of gestation, then every fortnight from 28–32 weeks and every week after 32 weeks",&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; however, the number of visits will depend on the woman and her healthcare providers. In Thailand, ante-natal care is free in the public health services sector. There is a private and public sector in healthcare, the latter provided by the Ministry of Public Health and teaching hospitals.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; In the 2005 study by Liamputtong, et al., women of [[Chiang Mai]] (northern Thailand) revealed that they "only incorporate cultural knowledge when it is practicable and suitable to their daily living situations".&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt;

==Labor and birth==

===Setting===
In the 1960s, 99% of the women in villages gave birth at home.&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt; Today the number is much lower, as most Thai women give birth in hospitals and clinics, generally where they go for ante-natal care.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; However, [[homebirth]]s are becoming popular, but they may not be fully covered by insurance policies.&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt; Traditionally, Thai women would give birth at home, either in the bedroom &lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt; or the kitchen.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; The delivery room at home is usually decorated with '''''Yant Trinisinghé''''', "small flags inscribed with sacred numbers from one to nine" or with letters and signs; each flag is a "symbol of a long mantra passage, believed to have power to ward off evil spirits". Buffalo leather can be used instead of flags.&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt;

===Birth assistant and attendants===
According to WHO's 2008 Thailand health profile, 99% of urban, 97% or rural, and 93% of the poorest 20% of women have their children delivered by skilled health persons, which is a much better compared to the regional average of 49%.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; As a part of the four-year curriculum, all nurses go through half a year of midwifery training, and may later choose to specialize. However, an obstetrician carries most responsibility during a birth in the hospitals &lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt; It is unclear how the traditional delivery assistants are trained, but most likely through observational experiences.

The traditional delivery assistant, who is usually a woman, is called ''Mo Tamaye'' in the central Thailand &lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt; and ''Mae Jang'' in the north.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; It is generally accepted that labor starts when the water breaks.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; If the family cannot get to the nearest medical facility, or does not want to, ''Mo Tamaye'' is called. Usually, the husband and ''Mo Tamaye'' are present during delivery, but relatives and children may attend as well; however, the woman in labor must be covered from the waist to knee.&lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt;

===Birth positions===
There are variations in the traditional [[Childbirth positions|birthing positions]]. In one, a folded mattress would be supporting a woman’s back while her husband would provide support sitting behind her and letting her grab onto his thighs. There would be foot supports made out of bamboo that a woman can push on during contractions.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; In another position, a woman would be sitting, with ''Mo Tamaye'' supporting her from behind, and would pull on a rope that is hanging from the ceiling to alleviate some pain. The woman must take an active role in the process by breathing and pushing with contractions, with the help of ''Mo Tamaye''.&lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt; In a medical setting, a woman would most likely have limited options for positions and would be laid flat on the bed to deliver. Culturally, there is no need to keep silent during the birthing process, but pain management is available in most clinics.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; There are no data regarding the use of fetal monitoring; however, it is likely used in the westernized hospital settings, which would limit woman's mobility during labor.  Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital &lt;ref&gt;https://www.samitivejhospitals.com/srinakarin/&lt;/ref&gt;in Bangkok is currently the only hospital in the country that offers natural and [[water birth]].&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt;

===Traditions during labor===
In case of birth complications, the traditional birth assistant would give the woman some holy water or press on her belly.&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt; There were no specific foods mentioned to eat during labor. To promote an easy delivery, all windows and doors must be open and the woman must be facing east to symbolize the emergence of new life.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; The husband should also pile logs outside facing east.&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt; Any fastened nails must be undone,&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt; and no one should be nailing nails to avoid stalled birth.&lt;ref name="Liamputtong" /&gt; To be born with an umbilical (holy) cord wrapped abound neck was considered a sign of fortune.&lt;ref name="Hanks2" /&gt;

===Caesarean section===
In the medical model of pregnancy, [[Caesarean section]] is performed should complications arise. However, the rate of C-sections has been increasing globally, which may be due to financial incentives.&lt;ref name="MSN" /&gt; Thailand is no exception, with rates rising from 15.2% (1990) to 22.4% (1996) &lt;ref name="Implications" /&gt; to 34% (2007).&lt;ref name="MSN" /&gt; A study in 2000 concluded that "private cases have a 5.83 higher chance of primary cesarean section than non-private cases" because "physicians feel obliged to provide personal delivery services, when triggered by leisure and time conflict, [which] leads to higher and possibly unnecessary cesarean procedures".&lt;ref name="Implications" /&gt;

==Postpartum==
The [[postpartum period]] begins right after the birth of the child, but it is not specified when it ends. It takes place at home following home birth, or in the hospital for 2–3 days and then at home following hospital birth.&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt;

===The cord and placenta===
Following a traditional delivery, ''Mo Tamaye'' would milk the [[umbilical cord]] three times away from the baby “to remove dirt,” then push it back, tie the cord in two places with a special cotton string, and cut the cord in between the two fastened places.&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; The cut cord is then burned, and [[placenta]] is buried, usually by the father.

===Woman's rite of passage===
After a woman gives birth to her first child, she is considered an adult. She then undergoes the ''Yu Fai'' when she must "lie near fire" for an odd number of days, usually around 11 days, so that her uterus will shrink back to normal size. After each following birth, the number of days spent near fire may be decreased.&lt;ref name="Ayabe" /&gt; Also, a wooden box with a fire pot may be placed on the woman's stomach to serve the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; Fire is also said to scare off evil spirits, especially combined with the lemongrass aroma.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; After a ''Yu Fai'', a woman is allowed to move out of her parents' residence, where she would live before and during the pregnancy, since she is now a mature adult.&lt;ref name="Ayabe" /&gt;

===Postpartum diet and behavior===
As with the pregnancy diet, warm foods are encouraged, such as hot [[curry|curries]].&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; A woman's diet must consist of rice and vegetables in the first few months after pregnancy; meat, with exception of fish, must be avoided.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; From a traditional Thai medicine perspective, "sour tastes [do] not dry out the body, but built up water; egg [is] too cooling; jackfruit [brings] in wind [air]; glutinous rice and the sugar of sweets wet the uterus; fruits [do] not give strength and [are] excessively cooling".&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; Herbal teas (''naam puu loey'') should be consumed, and showers with herbal water (''naam puu loeyand naam bai paw'') should be taken daily without washing hair the first two weeks.&lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt;

===Postnatal care and maternal leave===
Household duties would be taken care by female relatives, and older children.&lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt; Traditionally, female relatives would also check on the new mother. Within 4 to 8 weeks a woman must attend a health clinic for a check-up and to register her child's birth.&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt; '''Labour Protection Act of 1998''' guarantees women to have three months of maternity leave, to retain the job a woman had prior to pregnancy, and to temporary change duties with a doctor's letter.&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt; In practice, labor rights are very weak in Thailand and these laws are not generally enforceable. Labor activists are prosecuted, migrant laborers are exploited, and trafficked workers in the sex and fishing industries are common.

==Newborn==

===Traditional rituals===
There are many variations in tradition across Thailand most include the beautification of the child. Central Thai people say the baby is ''tog fag'' (falls on bamboo) when he or she is born. After ''Mo Tamaye'' cuts the umbilical cord, she washes and beautifies the baby with yellow and white powder.&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt; On the third day after birth, the ''Lon Dek Nai Kadon'' rite (translates to "rock the cradle in which a new born baby is sleeping") &lt;ref name="Ayabe" /&gt; is carried out. A baby is placed into a basket with a pencil and a notebook (for brightness) and money (for richness); girls are also given knives (to cut and comb hair) (Attagara 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;103) and cooking utensils.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; The basket with the baby and instruments is then handed over to "a respectable man in the village". This means that the baby became his adopted child temporarily, which reflects that the parents expect their baby to be rich and respectable like the adoptive.”&lt;ref name="Ayabe" /&gt;

Another tradition includes making offerings at a temple (''[[wat]]'') on the third day after the baby is born to obtain a blessing from a [[monk]].&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; The "fire shaving ceremony" takes place when the child reaches the age of one month and one day, which involves cutting of the baby's hair. As a precaution, babies must be kept away from the rain.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; [[Circumcision]] is not very prevalent in Thailand; only 13% of Thai male population are circumcised.&lt;ref name="circinfo" /&gt;

It is not specified when the newborn period ends. There is also no information on the significance of vernix, the baby’s rest, activity, and movement, as well as [[meconium]] and handling of the urine and feces.

===Care for the baby===
For the first month of the baby’s life, the mother must stay very close and "breastfeed the newborn on its slightest demand".&lt;ref name="Muecke" /&gt; Babies are also sometimes given a mixture of banana, honey, and water to prevent diarrhea.&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt; If the baby cries too much and cannot sleep, it is believed that the baby's [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]], ''Mae Sue'', is teasing the newborn too much. Usual interaction with ''Mae Sue'' is normal, during which the baby will play and laugh by itself.&lt;ref name="Attagara" /&gt;

===Naming===
Traditionally, a name is given to the child on the fourth or fifth day after birth by the father,&lt;ref name="Ayabe" /&gt; however, there are variations in this practice across Thailand. Today, both the mother and father can take part in deciding on a name. A child may not hold the same name as [[Thai Royal Family|royalty]].&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt;

===Twins===
There is a variation in the view of [[twins]]. While some view twins as needing more resources and being too demanding on a family, others see having twins as lucky, since it is convenient to take care of them at the same time.&lt;ref name="Hanks" /&gt;

===Modern newborn care===
An infant is examined in the first week of life followed by six examinations in the first year. There are three examinations during the second year, and six examinations every other year until the child turns six. [[Vaccines]] coincide with the exams, but are not obligatory except for the [[BCG vaccine|BCG for tuberculosis prevention]].&lt;ref name="Angloinfo" /&gt;

[[Image:Danylo Skoropadskiy.jpg|thumb|200px|Danylo Skoropadsky]]

'''Danylo Skoropadsky''' ({{lang-uk|Данило Скоропадський}}; 13 February 1904, [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]] – 23 February 1957, [[London]], [[Great Britain]]) was a famous Ukrainian [[politician]] and leader of the Ukrainian [[monarchism|monarchist]] movement in 1948-1957 (now called the United Hetman Association).  He was the son of [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]]. 

During the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] he studied at the First Gymnasium in Kiev in 1918. In 1919 Skoropadskyi (with the whole House of [[Skoropadskyi]]) had to flee from [[Ukraine]]. He lived and studied first in [[Switzerland]] and then in [[Germany]]. In 1939 Danylo resettled to [[England]]. 

From 1932 he assisted his father Pavlo Skoropadsky in leading the Ukrainian monarchist movement. In 1948 after the death of Hetman Pavlo, Danylo Skoropadsky became the leader of Ukrainian monarchists. 

Danylo Skoropadsky had a child with Olesya Tukhai-Bei who he had walked out on, and became engaged on the 13th February 1957 to Halyna Melnyk-Kaluzhynska,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/reviews/2010/10/24/1126/ Наречена Гетьманича]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narodnapravda.com.ua/history/4cc4ac42551fb/ Наречена гетьманича Скоропадського]&lt;/ref&gt; however, in a week and a half he died on 23 February 1957 in [[London]] after being poisoned probably by the [[KGB]] agents. On the 40th day after the death of Danylo, Halyna lost their mutual child, but Olesya fled to Canada with Danylo's child, Borys.

Halyna Kaluzhynska was born in Volhynia near Trostyanka in March 1914. After [[World War I]], she lived in [[Warsaw]] and later married changing her last name to Melnyk-Kaluzhynska. From her first marriage she had a son, Andriy, while her husband had disappeared. After [[World War II]], Kaluzhynska relocated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Eventually through a mutual friend she met Danylo Skoropadsky.

'''Decommunization''' is a process of dismantling the legacies of the [[communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-communist states. It is sometimes referred to as political cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer A. Yoder (1999) "From East Germans to Germans?: The New Postcommunist Elites", {{ISBN|0-8223-2372-9}},, pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly applied to the former countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[post-Soviet states]] to describe a number of legal and social changes during their periods of [[postcommunism]].

In some states decommunization included [[bans on Communist symbols]]. While sharing common traits the processes of decommunization have run differently in different states.&lt;ref name="Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols"&gt;{{citation|title = Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7459976.stm|publisher = BBC News|date = 17 Jun 2008|accessdate = 3 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32267075 |first= Vitaly |last= Shevchenko |title= Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols |work= [[BBC News]] |date=14 April 2015 |accessdate= 3 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decommunization organizations==

===Investigators and prosecutors===
* Cambodia - The [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]
* Czech Republic - The [[Office of the Documentation and the Investigation of the Crimes of Communism]]
* Slovakia - The [[Institute of National Memory]] - Ústav pamäti národa (Sk)
* Estonia - The [[Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity]]
* Germany - The [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] (BStU)
* Indonesia - The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order Government]]
* Hungary - The [[Institute for the History of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution]]
* Lithuania - The [[Lithuanian Center for the Research of Genocide and Resistance]]
* Poland - The [[Institute of National Remembrance|Institute of National Remembrance — Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation]]
* Romania - The [[Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania]]
* Moldova - The [[Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Moldova]]
* Ukraine - The [[Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance]]

==Prosecution of former communists==
{{Main article|Lustration}}
[[Lustration]] came to refer to government policies of limiting the participation of former communists, and especially informants of the communist [[secret police]], in the successor political appointee positions or even in [[civil service]] positions.

===Prosecution of Communist state leaders===
* Afghanistan - [[Mohammad Najibullah]] was sentenced to death and hanged.
* Bulgaria - [[Todor Zhivkov]] was sentenced to 7 years in prison, but served only one day because he was freed for "health reasons".
* Cambodia - [[Kang Kek Iew]] is so far the only indicted [[Khmer Rouge]] leader, while [[Pol Pot]] and others lived free without charges.
* East Germany - [[Eric Honecker]] was arrested, but soon released due to ill health. Several people, such as [[Egon Krenz]], were convicted.
* Ethiopia - [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] sentenced to death in absentia
* Poland - [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] avoided most court appearances citing poor health. He died in 2014.
* Romania - [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] was sentenced to death and executed.

==Results==
Communist parties outside the Baltic states were not outlawed and their members were not prosecuted. Just a few places attempted to exclude even members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries, the communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] of the [[University of Chicago]] argued in 1996 that after a period of active decommunization, it was met with a near-universal failure. After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions. Holmes notes that the only real exception was former [[East Germany]], where thousands of former [[Stasi]] informers have been fired from public positions.&lt;ref name=mandelbaum&gt;Michael Mandelbaum (Ed., 1996) "Post-Communism: Four Perspectives", ''Council on Foreign Relations''{{ISBN|0876091869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes suggests the following reasons for the turnoff of decommunization:&lt;ref name=mandelbaum/&gt;
*After 45–70 years of [[state communism]], nearly every family has members associated with the state. After the initial desire "to root out the reds" came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice.
*The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past "old news" for many citizens.
*Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites.
*The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a [[totalitarian state]] to disenfranchise the "[[enemies of the people]]" quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice.
*Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise. People begin remembering that [[Lenin]]'s idea (though misattributed from ''Vladimir Ilyich Lenin'', a poem critical of Lenin, by Vladimir Mayakovsky) that "every cookwoman may govern the state", failed.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Deaths attributed to decommunization==
[[Matthew White (atrocitologist)|Matthew White]] found an ''[[LA Times]]'' article from 1998 and a ''Times of London'' article from 2000, which both reported that from 3 to 6 million [[Russians]] and natives of other former [[Communist states]] died or were not born due to decreased living conditions after the [[fall of communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hough|first1=Jerry|url=http://necrometrics.com/all20c.htm|agency=LA Times|date=18 August 1998|accessdate=March 5, 2018|title=Deaths attributed to decommunization (1991-2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three fellow students escorted Smart back to her hall of residence after a party. Her disappearance is an actively investigated missing person case.

On September 6, 2016, the [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] Sheriff Department reported it had received information about the possible location of Smart's remains, resulting in a hillside excavation on the Cal Poly campus. After three days of digging, bones were recovered from at least one excavation site.&lt;ref name="LATimesSep12"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winton|first=Richard|title=Remains found during dig for missing Cal Poly student Kristin Smart could be human or animal|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-kristin-smart-remains-20160912-snap-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 27, 2018|date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was initially unclear if the findings were animal or human, and forensic analysis may take months to determine this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/crime/article100210677.html|title=Kristin Smart may be buried near Cal Poly 'P,' sheriff says as excavation begins|date=September 6, 2016|work=San Luis Obispo Tribune|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAMissingPersons"&gt;{{cite web|title=#Missing Kristin Smart has been missing since May 1996, following a party just off the Cal Poly campus.|url=http://www.missingandunsolved.com/california/|website=California - Missing Persons and Unsolved Cold Cases|accessdate=September 10, 2016|date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristin Smart is not related to [[Elizabeth Smart]], a [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] teen who was [[Elizabeth Smart kidnapping|abducted]] in June 2002 and found alive in March 2003.

==Disappearance==
Kristin Smart was enrolled at [[California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo|California Polytechnic State University]], or Cal Poly, in [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. On the night she disappeared, Smart attended a birthday party for a fellow student, which fell on [[Memorial Day]] weekend. At approximately 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May 25, 1996, she was found passed out on a neighbor's lawn by two fellow students, Cheryl Anderson and Tim Davis, who both had just left the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winton|first1=Richard|title=Cal Poly student Kristin Smart vanished 20 years ago. Now, authorities are digging the campus for her body|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-smart-missing-student-20160906-snap-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=September 7, 2016|date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They helped Smart to her feet and decided to walk her back to her nearby [[dormitory]]. Another student from the party, Paul Flores, joined their group and offered to help the two return Smart to her dorm room safely.

Davis departed the group first since he lived off campus and had driven to the party. Anderson was the second to depart the group after she told Flores that he could walk Smart back to her dorm, since he lived closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Catherine|title=A New Investigation Into The Disappearance of Kristin Smart, Who Vanished From Her College Campus 20 Years Ago - CrimeFeed|url=http://crimefeed.com/2016/09/where-is-kristin-smart/|accessdate=October 8, 2017|work=CrimeFeed|date=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flores stated to police that he walked Smart as far as his dormitory, Santa Lucia Hall, and then allowed her to walk back to her Muir Hall dorm by herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where is Kristin Smart? 19 years later, Cal Poly student still missing|url=http://mustangnews.net/where-is-kristin-smart-19-years-later-cal-poly-student-still-missing/|accessdate=October 8, 2017|work=Mustang News Staff|publisher=Mustang News|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last known sighting of her. She did not have any money or [[credit card]]s at the time she went missing.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Ralph|title=A break in a cold case on Cal Poly campus|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/us/missing-cal-poly-student/index.html|accessdate=October 8, 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Correction, Cheryl did not live off campus at the time. She lived in a different dorm - Sierra Madre tower 1.:&lt;This needs a source and then better integration --&gt;

==Official investigation==
The University Police Department&lt;ref name="Cal Poly-UPD"&gt;{{cite web|title=University Police Department|url=https://afd.calpoly.edu/police/|website=Cal Poly, Administration &amp; Finance|publisher=California Polytechnic State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally suspected that Smart had gone on an unannounced [[vacation]], as was common among students over the holidays, and as a result were slow in reporting her as a [[missing person]] to local law enforcement.

During the [[Laci Peterson]] murder [[Criminal procedure|investigation]], there were unfounded rumors in the media that Laci's husband [[Scott Peterson]] had something to do with Smart's disappearance due to their simultaneous attendance at the Cal Poly campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for missing woman fruitless|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-01-18-missing-woman_x.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2018|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a brief initial inquiry into whether Peterson was tied to the disappearance, with Peterson denying any involvement, and he was eventually ruled out as a suspect by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modbee.com/2003/01/19/128724/no-link-found-to-missing-student.html|title=No link found to missing student|work=modbee|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's disappearance remains an unsolved case, with no compelling evidence having been discovered to indicate what happened to her, and no body ever having been discovered. Between 1996 and 2007, many searches were conducted, some using police dogs trained to detect the scent of human remains, including searches of properties owned by the Flores family. No useful leads were found.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lambert|first=Cynthia|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/crime/article100287482.html|title=Searches for Kristin Smart spanned from Cal Poly to Paul Flores’ home|work=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]]|location=San Luis Obispo|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2016, officials from the [[San Luis Obispo County]] Sheriff's Office announced they were investigating a new lead in the case.&lt;ref name="keyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scholl|first1=Claire|title=SLO County Sheriff, FBI Begin Excavation at Cal Poly campus in Search for Missing Kristin Smart|url=http://www.keyt.com/news/slo-county-sheriff-says-new-developments-found-in-kristin-smart-disappearance-case/41537164|accessdate=September 6, 2016|agency=[[KEYT-TV|KEYT]]|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadaver dogs from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] were brought in and investigators were preparing to spend approximately four days excavating an area on the Cal Poly campus.&lt;ref name="keyt"/&gt; After three days, items were found at all three dig sites located on the same hillside near Smart's dorm. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said, "The items are being analyzed to see whether they are connected to the case, which could take days, weeks or months".&lt;ref name=remains&gt;{{cite news|author1=Morgan Winsor|author2=Roger Lee|author3=Kayna Whitworth|title=Kristin Smart's Family Is Cautiously Hopeful as Excavation Begins at Cal Poly|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/kristin-smarts-family-remains-cautiously-hopeful-excavation-underway/story?id=41973113|accessdate=September 11, 2016|work=ABC News|date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items uncovered are still being investigated {{as of|2017|lc=y|df=US}}.&lt;ref name="excavate"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Matt Fountain|title=Kristin Smart investigation continues 6 months after Cal Poly excavation|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/crime/article136300703.html|accessdate=August 8, 2017|work=The Tribune|date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Smart's disappearance and slow response by the campus police resulted in the Kristin Smart Campus Security Act being written and sponsored by [[California State Senate|State Senator]] [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]], passed 61–0 by the [[California State Legislature]], and signed into effect by then-[[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] on August 19, 1998. The law took effect on January 1, 1999, and requires all [[List of colleges and universities in California|public colleges]] and publicly funded educational institutions to have their security services make agreements with local police departments about reporting cases involving or possibly involving violence against students, including missing students.

Smart was declared [[legally dead]] on May 25, 2002, the sixth anniversary of her disappearance.&lt;ref name=ABCNews2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=131950&amp;page=1|title=Laci Presence Hangs Over Kristin Smart|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Denise and Stan Smart, took a [[civil law (common law)|civil case]] of [[wrongful death]] against Flores, one of the three students who walked Smart to her dorm, in 2005. Flores has denied any involvement in the disappearance. The Flores family had also filed a lawsuit against the Smart family for [[emotional distress]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

The San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office still reviews the case regularly, having spent thousands of hours and dollars in the last five years (2011–2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pasoroblesdailynews.com/sheriffs-detectives-searching-kristin-smarts-remains-cal-poly/61486/|title=Sheriff’s detectives searching for Kristin Smart’s remains at Cal Poly|work=Paso Robles Daily News|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]] have her on file as a high priority missing person investigation, with a reward of $75,000 for information leading to finding her or resolving her case.&lt;ref name="NVRegister"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlton|first1=April|title=Cal Poly freshman Kristin Smart missing for 20 years|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/cal-poly-freshman-kristin-smart-missing-for-years/article_faaa953c-c4e9-54d0-952f-ddd8a92d15f0.html|accessdate=October 8, 2016|work=Napa Valley Register|date=May 31, 2016|quote=offers a $75,000 reward for information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Black, a [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|Delta]]-area man, offered a $100,000 reward for Smart's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Ellen|title=Family hopes for break in Smart case|url=http://www.recordnet.com/article/20070524/A_NEWS/705240316|accessdate=September 7, 2016|work=recordnet.com|date=May 24, 2007|quote=Delta-area resident Terry Black has offered a $100,000 reward in the case, despite not knowing the Smart family personally.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doomsday Man''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Primarily an enemy of [[Carol Danvers]], the character exists within Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Buscema]], the character first appeared in ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' Vol. 1, #13 (February 1970).

== Publication history ==

The Doomsday Man was introduced in ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' Vol. 1, #13 and reappeared in ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' Vol. 1, #3-4 in a two-part storyline that ended with it fusing with '''Kerwin Korman''', a villain who had previously appeared in ''Ms. Marvel'' Vol. 1, #1-2 under the name '''Destructor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Jeff Rovin]]|title = The Encyclopedia of Super Villains|year = 1987|publisher = [[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File]]|isbn = 9780816013562|page = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate of Doomsday Man and Korman was subsequently featured in a story-arc that took place in ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 3, #15-17&lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine|author = Eric Nolen-Weathington|title = Marvel, Alan Moore, and the McCarthy Era|magazine = Modern Masters|location = United States|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = 28 August 2007|language = English|volume = 1|issue = 13|page = 79}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://insidepulse.com/2015/09/11/retro-reviews-avengers-vol-3-1-34-by-kurt-busiek-george-perez-with-others-for-marvel-comics/|title = Retro-Reviews: ''Avengers'' Vol. 3 #1-34 By Kurt Busiek &amp; George Perez With Others For Marvel Comics|last = Fulton|first = James|publisher = Inside Pulse|date = 11 September 2015|website = insidepulse.com|accessdate = 9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; before making its final appearance to date in ''Ms. Marvel'' Vol. 2, #11-12.

== Fictional character biography ==

After the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, the United States government commissioned Doctor John Kronton to create an automaton that could assist mankind with exploring and colonizing other worlds, a project supervised by [[Carol Danvers]]. When construction of the nigh-invincible robot was complete, Danvers, fearing that it could possibly turn against humanity, successfully convinced a Senatorial Commission to abandon the project and seal the android away with other apocalyptic weapons on a desolate island in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name = "SS13"&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Stan Lee|penciller = John Buscema|inker = Don Adkins|letterer = Sam Rosen|editor = Stan Lee|story = The Dawn of the Doomsday Man!|title = Silver Surfer|volume = 1|issue = #13|date = February 1970|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MM4"&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Chris Claremont|penciller = Jim Mooney|inker = Joe Sinnott|colorist = Janice Cohen|letterer = Irving Watanabe|editor = Archie Goodwin|story = Death is the Doomsday Man!|title = Ms. Marvel|volume = 1|issue = #4|date = April 1977|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robot (dubbed "the Doomsday Man" by the tabloids) activates and breaks free of its prison, taking with it a Cobalt Bomb. Learning of the Doomsday Man's existence, the [[Silver Surfer]] attempts to destroy it and prevent the detonation of the Cobalt Bomb with the assistance of Doctor Kronton, who eventually reveals that he had secretly programmed the Doomsday Man to awaken and threaten mankind, intending to stop it himself, thus becoming a hero in the eyes of the people of Earth. The Surfer separates the Doomsday Man from the Cobalt Bomb and attempts to trap it in a pit formed with his Power Cosmic. Doctor Kronton tries to help his creation climb back up to the surface and is killed by it when the Doomsday Man swats him away, an act that causes it to lose its grip and fall deep beneath the Earth's surface while the Surfer safely disposes of the Cobalt Bomb.&lt;ref name = "SS13"/&gt;

[[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] acquires and gains control of the Doomsday Man, which they attach to a rocket set for the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Carol Danvers, now the superheroine [[Ms. Marvel]], intercepts the projectile, causing it to crash land near the [[Florida]] cave where she had first become Ms. Marvel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Chris Claremont|penciller = John Buscema|inker = Joe Sinnott|colorist = Dan Warfield|letterer = John Costanza|editor = Archie Goodwin|story = The Lady's Not for Killing!|title = Ms. Marvel|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = March 1977|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommencing her battle with the Doomsday Man, Ms. Marvel manages to deactivate it by attacking the weak point that had been secretly installed in the back of its head by Doctor Kronton. Ms. Marvel is then ambushed by Kerwin Korman, the villainous Destructor. Searching for the source of Ms. Marvel's powers, Korman stumbles onto and opens a spare energy core for the nearby Psyche-Magnitron, unleashing an explosive blast of radiation that launches Ms. Marvel out of the cave and fuses Korman with the Doomsday Man.&lt;ref name = "MM4"/&gt;

A.I.M.'s leader, [[MODOK]], eventually loses interest in the Doomsday Man, which is left abandoned beneath a warehouse in [[The Bronx]]. When the building is destroyed during an altercation involving A.I.M., the [[New Warriors]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and Lord Templar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Kurt Busiek|penciller = George Perez|inker = Al Vey and Scott Koblish|colorist = Tom Smith|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft/WA|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = Lords &amp; Leaders|title = The Avengers|volume = 3|issue = #13|date = February 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doomsday Man escapes and, after concluding that Korman's usefulness as [[Wetware computer|wetware]] is waning, sets out to replace him with Ms. Marvel.&lt;ref name = "A17"/&gt;

Doomsday Man breaks the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] out of prison and orders them to capture Ms. Marvel, who has since become Warbird. When the Wrecking Crew are cornered by the Avengers after mistakenly attacking [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]], Doomsday Man attempts to execute them from afar to prevent them from revealing its existence and then abducts Warbird itself, bringing her to its base in the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Kurt Busiek|penciller = George Perez|inker = Al Vey and Scott Koblish|colorist = Tom Smith|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft/WA|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = The Three-Fold Path|title = The Avengers|volume = 3|issue = #15|date = April 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Jerry Ordway|penciller = Jerry Ordway|inker = Al Gordon|colorist = Tom Smith|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = Mistaken Identity|title = The Avengers|volume = 3|issue = #16|date = May 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it and Warbird fight, Doomsday Man rants about how it requires her to be complete and about how they both share "the [[Kree]] warrior's bond" due to being "born of the Psyche-Magnitron". The Avengers, having tracked Warbird down, arrive and manage to damage the Doomsday Man enough to incapacitate it and reveal the trapped Korman.&lt;ref name = "A17"/&gt; [[Hank Pym|Goliath]] begins studying the Doomsday Man to try and find a way to separate Korman from it, but his work is cut short when he is abducted by [[Ultron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Jerry Ordway|penciller = Jerry Ordway|inker = Al Vey, Jerry Ordway and George Perez|colorist = Tom Smith|letterer = RS/Comicraft|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = The Battle for Imperion City!|title = The Avengers|volume = 3|issue = #18|date = July 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doomsday Man was subsequently reacquired by A.I.M. and once again placed in storage after the organization found itself unable to discern how to control it or how to replicate its fusion with Korman. After spending months in a vegetative state, Korman awoke, assumed control of his and Doomsday Man's shared body and embarked on a rampage, intent on murdering both Warbird (who had gone back to being Ms. Marvel) and "a great number of people" by releasing the Targoth, infectious zombies that A.I.M. had manufactured for Slorenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Reed|penciller = Roberto de la Torre|inker = Jon Sibal|colorist = Chris Sotomayor|letterer = Dave Sharpe|editor = Bill Rosemann and Warren Simons|story = Doomsday|title = Ms. Marvel|volume = 2|issue = #11|date = 3 January 2007|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms. Marvel combats Korman while her sidekick, [[Anya Corazon|Araña]], destroys the Targoth.

Emergency services are able to stabilize Korman, who is later revealed to have been intentionally awakened and given control of the Doomsday Man by a rogue A.I.M. faction which had also manipulated Ms. Marvel into fighting Korman as a part of a "test run" intended to gauge whether or not Korman would be of use against MODOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Reed|penciller = Roberto De La Torre and Patrick Zircher|inker = Jon Sibal|colorist = Chris Sotomayor|letterer = Dave Sharpe|editor = Bill Rosemann|story = Something Dark is Coming|title = Ms. Marvel|volume = 2|issue = #12|date = 7 February 2007|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==

As it was constructed to be able to withstand and function in every conceivable environment, the Doomsday Man is nigh-invulnerable and superhumanly strong. It also has a laser cannon mounted on its right arm and a "[[Photonics|photonic]] nullifier" hidden within its mouth. A.I.M. provided the Doomsday Man with further armaments, including [[tachyon]] blasters attached to its head and gun-arm and the power to teleport itself and others.

Kerwin Korman merging with it increased the Doomsday Man's mental faculties, giving it a human-like mind and personality, as well as the ability to improvise. Korman himself was a genius inventor and engineer and like Carol Danvers he was mutated into a human-Kree hybrid entity via exposure to the radiation emitted by the Psyche-Magnitron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27829">{{short description|The hypothesis that, in the course of evolution, some entirely new properties, such as mind and consciousness, appear at certain critical points}}
'''Emergent evolution''' was the [[hypothesis]] that, in the course of [[evolution]], some entirely new properties, such as mind and [[consciousness]], appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The term was originated by the psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 140-142, pp. 376-384. {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis was widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in [[teleology]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Brian P. (1992). ''The Rise and Fall of British Emergentism''. In A. Beckerman, H. Flohr, and J. Kim, eds., ''Emergence or Reduction? Essays on the Prospects of Nonreductive Physicalism''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. pp. 49–93. {{ISBN|3-11-012880-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Charles A. (1929). ''The Philosophic Functions of Emergence''. ''[[The Philosophical Review]]''. Vol. 38, No. 4. pp. 372-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The term ''[[emergence|emergent]]'' was first used to describe the concept by [[George Lewes]] in volume two of his 1875 book ''Problems of Life and Mind'' (p.&amp;nbsp;412).  [[Henri Bergson]] covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' on the [[Élan vital]].  Emergence was further developed by [[Samuel Alexander]] in his [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] during 1916–18 and published as ''Space, Time, and Deity'' (1920).  The related term ''emergent evolution'' was coined by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and published as ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of [[Roy Wood Sellars]]'s ''Evolutionary Naturalism'' (1922).

== Origins ==

=== Response to Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' ===

[[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s presentation of [[natural selection]], coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert G.B.|title=Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262182572|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism of [[natural selection]] described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time.

{{quote|Darwin knew that nature had to produce variations before natural selection could act …The problem had been caught by other evolutionists almost as soon as ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was first published. [[Sir Charles Lyell]] saw it clearly in 1860 before he even became an evolutionist…(Reid, p.3)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

[[St. George Jackson Mivart|St. George Jackson Mivart's]] ''On the Genesis of Species'' (1872) and [[Edward Drinker Cope|Edward Cope]]'s ''Origin of the Fittest'' (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. [[William Bateson]] in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (''Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species'').&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

=== Wallace's further thoughts ===

Wallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, ''Darwinism'', was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it.

{{quote|the most prominent feature is that I enter into popular yet critical examination of those underlying fundamental problems which Darwin purposely excluded from his works as being beyond the scope of his enquiry. Such are the nature and cause of Life itself, and more especially of its most fundamental and mysterious powers - growth and reproduction ...

Darwin always ... adduced the "laws of Growth with Reproduction," and of "Inheritance with Variability," as being fundamental facts of nature, without which Natural Selection would be powerless or even non-existent ...

... even if it were proved to be an exact representation of the facts, it would not be an explanation... because it would not account for the forces, the directive agency, and the organising power which are essential features of growth …&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Theory of Life|year=1911|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_of_life.html?id=M6UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In examining this aspect, excluded ''ab initio'' by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that ''Life'' itself cannot be understood except by means of a theory that includes "an organising and directive Life-Principle." These necessarily involve a "Creative Power", a "directive Mind" and finally "an ultimate Purpose" (the development of Man). It supports the view of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] that "life is the cause, not the consequence" of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and when it infuses matter, forms living matter (protoplasm).

{{quote|a very well-founded doctrine, and one which was often advocated by John Hunter, that life is the cause and not the consequence of organisation ... if so, life must be antecedent to organisation, and can only be conceived as indissolubly connected with spirit and with thought, and with the cause of the directive energy everywhere manifested in the growth of living things ... endowed with the mysterious organising power we term life ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}
Wallace then refers to the operation of another power called "mind" that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter:

{{quote|evidence of a foreseeing mind which...so directed and organised that life, in all its myriad forms, as, in the far-off future, to provide all that was most essential for the growth and development of man's spiritual nature ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

Proceeding from Hunter's view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of [[consciousness]], which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.

{{quote|If, as John Hunter, T.H. Huxley, and other eminent thinkers have declared, "life is the cause, not the consequence, of organisation," so we may believe that mind is the cause, not the consequence, of brain development.

... So there are undoubtedly different degrees and probably also different kinds of mind in various grades of animal life&amp;nbsp;... And&amp;nbsp;... so the mind-giver&amp;nbsp;... enables each class or order of animals to obtain the amount of mind requisite for its place in nature&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

== Emergent evolution ==

=== Early roots ===
The issue of how change in nature 'emerged' can be found in classical Greek thought -  order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity. [[Aristotle]] spoke of wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist [[Galen]] also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Hegel]] spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to [[John Stuart Mill]] (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72]&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

The idea of an emergent quality that was something new in nature was further taken up by [[George Henry Lewes]] (1874–1875), who again noted, as with Galen earlier, that these evolutionary "emergent" qualities are distinguishable from adaptive, additive "resultants." [[Henry Drummond (evangelist)|Henry Drummond]] in ''The Descent of Man'' (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to the inertial inorganic realm.

{{quote|When we pass from the inorganic to the organic we come upon a new set of laws - but the reason why the lower set do not seem to operate in the higher sphere is not that they are annhilated, but that they are overruled. (Drummond 1883, p. 405, quoted in Reid)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

As Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p.&amp;nbsp;73)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Samuel Alexander]] took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):

{{quote|If we turn reductionism on its head we add levels. More carefully, we add new laws that satisfy the constraints imposed by laws already in place. Moreover these new laws apply to complex phenomena that are consequences of the original laws; they are at a new level.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=John|title=Emergence. From Chaos to Order|year=1998|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== C. Lloyd Morgan and emergent evolution ===
Another major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], a zoologist and student of [[T.H. Huxley]], who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of [[Saltation (biology)|saltation]] but was best regarded as "a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point."(quoted in Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;73-74)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the  continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read [[anthropomorphism]] into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon:
 
{{quote|In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.|Morgan, 1894, p. 53}}
However, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his ''An Introduction to Comparative Psychology'' (1903):

{{quote|To this, however, it should be added, lest the range of the principle be misunderstood, that the canon by no means excludes the interpretation of a particular activity in terms of the higher processes, if we already have independent evidence of the occurrence of these higher processes in the animal under observation.|Morgan, 1903, p. 59}}

As Reid observes,

{{quote|While the so-called historiographical "rehabilitation of the canon" has been underway for some time now, Morgan's emergent evolutionist position (which was the highest expression of his attempt to place the study of mind back into such a "wider" natural history) is seldom mentioned in more than passing terms even within contemporary history of psychology textbooks.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

Morgan also fought against the [[Behaviorism|behaviorist school]] and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution:

{{quote|An influential school of 'behaviorists' roundly deny that mental relations, if such there be, are in any sense or in any manner effective... My message is that one may speak of mental relations as effective no less 'scientifically' than... physical relations...|Morgan, 1930, p. 72}}

His ''Animal Conduct'' (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three "grades" or "levels of mentality" which he labeled: 'percipient, perceptive, and reflective.' (p.&amp;nbsp;42)

=== Alexander and the emergence of mind ===

Morgan's idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don’t. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Samuel|title=Space, Time and Deity|year=1916–18|publisher=Gifford Lectures|location=Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Deity.html?id=v70tAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And mental process is also "something new, "a fresh creation", which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

At the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, a new "thing" not reducible to its initial neural parts.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new “complexities of motion” in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior “complexities of motion” but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, “complexes of motion.” Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of “body” (lower order) and an element of “mind” (higher order), or “the conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.”

Mind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level.

{{quote|Life is not an epiphenomenon of matter but an emergent from it&amp;nbsp;... The new character or quality which the vital physico-chemical complex possesses stands to it as soul or mind to the neural basis.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the "directing agency" or entelechy is found "in the principle or plan".

{{quote|a given stage of material complexity is characterised by such and such special features…By accepting this we at any rate confine ourselves to noting the facts…and do not invent entities for which there seems to be no other justification than that something is done in life which is not done in matter.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

While an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it.
 
{{quote|Ascent takes place, it would seem, through complexity.[increasing order] But at each change of quality the complexity as it were gathers itself together and is expressed in a new simplicity.
Within a given level of emergence, there are degrees of development.
 
... There are on one level degrees of perfection or development; and at the same time there is affinity by descent between the existents belonging to the level. This difference of perfection is not the same thing as difference of order or rank such as subsists between matter and life or life and mind ...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

The concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the “mind” of motion, materialising is the “mind” of matter, living the “mind” of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter “materialising” (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life “living” (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind “minding” (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity.

{{quote|let us describe the empirical quality of any kind of finite which performs to it the office of consciousness or mind as its 'mind.' Yet at the same time let us remember that the 'mind' of a living thing is not conscious mind but is life, and has not the empirical character of consciousness at all, and that life is not merely a lower degree of mind or consciousness, but something different. We are using 'mind' metaphorically by transference from real minds and applying it to the finites on each level in virtue of their distinctive quality; down to Space-Time itself whose existent complexes of bare space-time have for their mind bare time in its empirical variations.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Alexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being “out there” in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.

{{quote|There is no consciousness lodged, as I have supposed, in the organism as a quality of the neural response; consciousness belongs to the totality of objects, of what are commonly called the objects of consciousness or the field of consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Consciousness is therefore "out there" where the objects are, by a new version of Berkleyanism&amp;nbsp;... Obviously for this doctrine as for mine there is no mental object as distinct from a physical object: the image of a tree is a tree in an appropriate form...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Because of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it.
 
{{quote|In being conscious of its own space and time, the mind is conscious of the space and time of external things and vice versa. This is a direct consequence of the continuity of Space-Time in virtue of which any point-instant is connected sooner or later, directly or indirectly, with every other...

The mind therefore does not apprehend the space of its objects, that is their shape, size and locality, by sensation, for it depends for its character on mere spatio-temporal conditions, though it is not to be had as consciousness in the absence of sensation (or else of course ideation). It is clear without repeating these considerations that the same proposition is true of Time; and of motion&amp;nbsp;... I shall call this mode of apprehension in its distinction from sensation, intuition.&amp;nbsp;... Intuition is different from reason, but reason and sense alike are outgrowths from it, empirical determinations of it...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

In a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is “enjoyed” (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated.

{{quote|The universe for Alexander is essentially in process, with Time as its ongoing aspect, and the ongoing process consists in the formation of changing complexes of motions. These complexes become ordered in repeatable ways displaying what he calls "qualities." There is a hierarchy of kinds of organized patterns of motions, in which each level depends on the subvening level, but also displays qualities not shown at the subvening level nor predictable from it… On this there sometimes supervenes a further level with the quality called "life"; and certain subtle syntheses which carry life are the foundation for a further level with a new quality. "mind." This is the highest level known to us, but not necessarily the highest possible level. The universe has a forward thrust, called its "nisus" (broadly to be identified with the Time aspect) in virtue of which further levels are to be expected...&lt;ref name=Emmet&gt;{{cite web|last=Emmet |first=Dorothy |title=Whitehead and Alexander |url=http://www.religion-online/showarticle.asp?title=2834 |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Robert G. B. Reid===

Emergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid, a biology professor at the [[University of Victoria]]. In his book ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis'' (1985), he stated that the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] with its emphasis on [[natural selection]] is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Mary B. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''. Vol. 61, No. 2, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, John F. (1987). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Vol. 20, No. 3. pp. 424-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an "obsolete conceptual framework", provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a [[Orthogenesis|teleological process of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. [[Isis (journal)|Isis]]. Vol. 77, No. 2, pp. 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid later published the book ''Biological Emergences'' (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christopher S. (2008). ''Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Integrative and Comparative Biology]]''. Vol. 48, No. 6. pp. 871-873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biological-emergences "Biological Emergences"]. [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Massimo Pigliucci]] "Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims." Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pigliucci, Massimo. (2009). [http://philpapers.org/archive/MASDWN/ "Down with Natural Selection?"] ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]''. 52: 134-140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that "the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;Badyaev, Alexander V. (2008). ''Evolution Despite Natural Selection? Emergence Theory and the Ever Elusive Link Between Adaptation and Adaptability''. ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 56: 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticized Reid's unorthodox views on emergence and evolution. Biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid's "presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date."&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, Samuel M. (2004). ''The Metamorphosis of Evo-Devo''. ''[[BioScience]]''. Vol. 54, No. 12.  pp. 1150-1151.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fulminant''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊ|l|m|ɪ|n|ən|t}}) is a descriptor for any event or process that occurs suddenly and escalates quickly, and is intense and severe to the point of lethality, i.e., it has an [[explosion|explosive]] character. The word comes from [[Latin]] ''fulmināre'', to strike with [[lightning]]. Its most frequent uses are those in the field of [[medicine]], and there are several diseases described by &lt;!--or "whose names contain "--&gt;this adjective:

* Fulminant [[acute liver failure|liver failure]]
*  Fulminant [[colitis]]
*  Fulminant [[pre-eclampsia]]
*  Fulminant [[meningitis]]
* Fulminant hepatic venous thrombosis ([[Budd-Chiari syndrome]])
* Fulminant jejunoileitis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81571-8| pmid = 9568712| title = Fulminant Jejuno-Ileitis following Ablation of Enteric Glia in Adult Transgenic Mice| journal = Cell| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 189| year = 1998| last1 = Bush | first1 = T.

Some [[virus|viral]] [[hemorrhagic fever]]s, such as [[Ebola]], [[Lassa fever]], and [[Lábrea fever]], may kill in as little as two to five days. Diseases that cause rapidly developing [[lung edema]], such as some kinds of [[pneumonia]], may kill in a few hours. It was said of the "[[black death]]" (pneumonic [[bubonic plague]]) that some of its victims would die in a matter of hours after the initial symptoms appeared. Other pathologic conditions that may be fulminating in character are [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[asthma]], acute [[anaphylaxis]], [[septic shock]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].

The most rapid deaths are those provoked by massive body [[Physical trauma|trauma]], such as [[explosion]] injuries, airplane crashes, falling from a significant height, or  industrial machinery incidents. Other examples include ''[[Commotio cordis]]'', a sudden cardiac arrest caused by a blunt, non-penetrating trauma to the [[precordium]], which causes [[ventricular fibrillation]] of the heart. [[Cardiac arrest]] and [[stroke]] in certain parts of the [[brain]], such as in the [[brainstem]] (which controls [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] and [[respiratory system]] functions), and massive [[hemorrhage]] of the great [[artery|arteries]] (such as in perforation of the walls by trauma or by sudden opening of an [[aneurysm]] of the [[aorta]]) may be very quick, with death ensuing in less than one minute. [[Sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) is still a mysterious cause of respiratory arrest in infants. Certain infections of the brain, such as [[rabies]], [[Meningococcal disease#Meningitis|meningococcal meningitis]], or [[primary amebic meningoencephalitis]] can kill within hours to days after symptoms appear.

Some [[toxin]]s, such as [[cyanide]], may also provoke fulminant death. Abrupt [[hyperkalemia]] provoked by intravenous injection of [[potassium chloride]] leads to fulminant death by cardiac arrest.

==Related terms==
{{wiktionary|fulminate}}
* '''To fulminate''' is to hurl verbal denunciations, severe criticisms, or menacing comments at someone. Rarely, it is used in its original sense, "to kill by lightning".
* [[Fulminate]]s are a class of [[explosive]]s used in [[detonator]] caps. They are named for the startling suddenness with which they explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/fulminant |title=Fulminant - Medical Definition and More from|publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fulgurites]] are natural tubes, clumps, or masses of sintered, vitrified, and/or fused soil, sand, rock, organic debris and other sediments that can form when lightning discharges into ground.

Varmus|Harold Varmus]], a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[Jack W. Szostak|Jack Szostak]], recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.{{cn|date=August 2017}}
 
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted [[dengue fever]], an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a [[Henry Luce Scholar]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moukheiber|first1=Zina|last2=Dolan|first2=Kerry A.|title=The Golden Age of Antiviral Drugs|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2003/1027/090.html|work=Forbes|date=27 October 2003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Riordan recruited [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by [[Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.]], [[Gordon Moore]], and [[George P. Shultz]]. Riordan tried to recruit [[Warren Buffett]] as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers ([[gene therapy]]). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&amp;D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was [[tenofovir]], a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===1990-1999: IPO===
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline|Glaxo]] for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as [[antisense]]. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to [[Ionis Pharmaceuticals]]. Gilead debuted on the [[NASDAQ]] in January 1992. Its [[initial public offering]] raised $86.25 million in proceeds.

In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide ([[cidofovir]] injection) for the treatment of [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) [[retinitis]] in patients with [[AIDS]]. The company cooperated with [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]] to market the product outside the United States.

In January 1997, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release |title=Donald H. Rumsfeld Named Chairman of Gilead Sciences |publisher=Gilead Sciences |date=1997-01-03 |url=http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619044137/http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |archivedate=2007-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed [[United States Secretary of Defense]] at the start of [[George W. Bush]]'s first term as President.

In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of [[Boulder, Colorado]] following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales.  NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an [[oncology]] drug taken by [[HIV]] patients.  Also in 1999, [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced first approval of [[Tamiflu]] ([[oseltamivir]]) for the treatment of [[influenza]]. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread ([[tenofovir]]) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.

===2000 to 2009===
In 2002 Gilead changed its corporate strategy to focus only on antivirals, and sold its cancer assets to [[OSI Pharmaceuticals]] for $200 million.&lt;ref name=LAT2002/&gt;

In December 2002, Gilead and Triangle Pharmaceuticals announced that Gilead would acquire Triangle for around $464 million; Triangle's lead drug was [[emtricitabine]] that was near FDA approval, and it had two other antivirals in its pipeline.&lt;ref name=LAT2002&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellene|first1=Denise|title=Gilead Sciences to Buy Triangle Pharmaceuticals|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/05/business/fi-gilead5|work=Los Angeles Times|date=5 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gilead to Pay $464 Million For Triangle Pharmaceuticals|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1039013783682043153|work=Wall Street Journal|date=4 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera ([[adefovir]]) was approved for the treatment of chronic [[hepatitis B]], and Emtriva ([[emtricitabine]]) for the treatment of HIV.

In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of [[tenofovir]] and [[emtricitabine]].

In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the [[cardiovascular]] and [[respiratory]] therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Myogen marketed [[Flolan]] ([[epoprostenol sodium]]) in the United States for the treatment of [[primary pulmonary hypertension]]. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=darusentan&amp;submit=Search |title=ClinicalTrials.gov - Information on Clinical Trials and Human Research Studies: Darusentan |accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant [[hypertension]].

In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with [[cystic fibrosis]] who are infected with ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. In July 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[Atripla]], a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva ([[efavirenz]]), a [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] product, and Truvada ([[emtricitabine]] and [[tenofovir disoproxil]]), a Gilead product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pollack | first = Andrew | title = F.D.A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Gilead Sciences Completes Acquisition of Raylo Chemicals Inc.|publisher= Gilead Sciences|date= 2006-11-03|url= http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_926645|accessdate= 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raylo Chemical, based in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Degussa AG]], a German company.  Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then its largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.

Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an [[epithelial sodium channel]] inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and [[bronchiectasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Parion Sciences and Gilead Sciences Sign Agreement to Advance Drug Candidates for Pulmonary Disease | publisher = Gilead Sciences | date = 2007-08-15 | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_1040975 | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company  acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, via the New York Times. 12 March 2009. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/business/13biotech.html?_r=0 Gilead, a White Knight, to Buy CV Therapeutics]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by ''[[Forbes]]''.

===2010 to 2019===
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Gilead Sciences to Acquire Arresto Biosciences for $225 Million; Deal Adds Pipeline Candidates for Fibrotic Diseases | publisher   = Gilead Sciences | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_1509319 | date = 2010-12-20 | accessdate = 2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Gilead Sciences to Acquire Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 Million; Deal Adds Pipeline Candidates in Oncology and Inflammation -- | publisher  = Gilead Sciences | url = http://investors.gilead.com/preview/phoenix.zhtml?c=69964&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1531190&amp;highlight= | date = 2011-02-22 | accessdate = 2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of  [[Pharmasset]], Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the [[hepatitis C virus]] by giving it control of [[sofosbuvir]] (see below).

On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's [[Truvada]] for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure ([[Pre-exposure prophylaxis#PrEP for HIV|PrEP]]) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perrone|first=Matthew|title=FDA approves first pill to help prevent HIV|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48198452/ns/today-today_health/t/fda-approves-first-pill-help-prevent-hiv/#.UARSd_VdDvY|work=Today Health|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate [[CYT387]], an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the [[Janus kinase]] (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.

In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:
*It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as [[nonalcoholic steatohepatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/gilead-to-acquire-phenex-s-fxr-program-for-up-to-470m/81250770/|title=Gilead to Acquire Phenex's FXR Program for Up-to-$470M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of [[Demethylase#Histone demethylation|histone demethylases]] involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/gilead-boosts-cancer-pipeline-with-65m-epitherapeutics-buy/81251237/|title=Gilead Boosts Cancer Pipeline With $65M EpiTherapeutics Buy|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug [[filgotinib]], which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, [[ulcerative colitis]], and [[Crohn's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N/A|first1=Zack's Market Research|title=Gilead (GILD) Collaborates with Galapagos for Filgotinib|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gilead-gild-collaborates-galapagos-filgotinib-214009221.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=Yahoo/Zack's|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of [[non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] and for the potential treatment of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.gilead.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=69964&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2153767#sthash.J8GnM3pl.dpuf|title=Gilead - Investors - News Release|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentherald.com/articles/35157/20160406/gilead-sciences-nimbus-drug-acquired-offering-cure-fatty-liver.htm|title=Gilead Sciences: Nimbus Drug Acquired, Offering Cure For Fatty Liver|work=Parent Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016, the company was named the most generous company on the 2016 Fortune list of The Most Generous Companies of the [[Fortune 500]]. Charitable donations to HIV/AIDS and liver disease organizations totaled over 440 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/22/fortune-500-most-charitable-companies/|title=The Giving 20: The Most Generous Companies in America|work=Fortune|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the company announced it would acquire [[Kite Pharma]] for $11.9 billion,&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-kite-pharma-m-a-gilead-sciences-idUKKCN1B810Y&lt;/ref&gt; equating to $180 cash per share, a 29% premium over the closing price of the shares.

====Sovaldi and Harvoni====
The drug [[sofosbuvir]] had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the [[hepatitis C virus]]. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of [[Pharmasset]] for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/12/31/grading-pharma-in-2013-16-drug-companies-ranked/ |title= Grading Pharma in 2013|publisher=Forbes |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Bank]] estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Gilead+(GILD)+Q4+Sovaldi+Sales+Tracking+at+$53M+-+Deutsche+Bank/9020948.html |title= Q4 Sovaldi Sales Tracking at $53 Million |publisher=Street Insider |date=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2014/01/02/gilead-sciences-sovaldi-to-boost-shares-in-2014-maxim-group-says/|title= Stocks to Watch |publisher=Barrons |date=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2014, the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]] investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman [[Ron Wyden]] ([[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-[[Oregon]]) and ranking minority member [[Chuck Grassley]] ([[U.S. Republican Party|R]]-[[Iowa]]) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Critics Raise Concerns About Sovaldi|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/upshot/is-a-1000-pill-really-too-much.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-08-02|access-date = 2015-10-04|issn = 0362-4331|first = Margot|last = Sanger-katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.&lt;ref name="Martin_2014"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2880996-gilead-sciences-gild-ceo-john-martin-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=4|title=Gilead Q4 2014 Earnings Call}}&lt;/ref&gt; For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-29/the-price-keeps-falling-for-a-superstar-gilead-drug-in-india|title=The same pill that cost $1,000 in the U.S. sold for $4 in India|author=Ketaki Gokhale|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilead later combined Sovaldi with other antivirals in single-pill combinations. First, Sovaldi was combined with [[ledipasvir]] and marketed as [[ledipasvir/sofosbuvir|Harvoni]]. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).&lt;ref name=Ke2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keating GM |title=Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir: a review of its use in chronic hepatitis C |journal=Drugs |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=675–85 |year=2015 |pmid=25837989 |doi=10.1007/s40265-015-0381-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/09/i-was-wrong-about-gilead-sciences.aspx|title=I Was Wrong About Gilead Sciences|author=Michael Douglass|publisher=The Motley Fool|date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later single-pill combinations were [[Epclusa]] (with [[velpatasvir]]) and [[Vosevi]] (with [[velpatasvir]] and [[voxilaprevir]]).

====Finances====
For the fiscal year 2017, Gilead Sciences Insurance reported earnings of US$4.628 billion, with an annual revenue of US$26.107 billion, a decline of 14.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Gilead Sciences's shares traded at over $70 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$93.4 billion in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GILD/gilead-sciences/revenue|title=Gilead Sciences Revenue 2006-2018 {{!}} GILD|website=www.macrotrends.net|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prospects for the future====
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] to repeal taxes imposed by the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of [[Medicaid]] in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/technology/will-gileads-hiv-franchise-plan-be-dashed-on-trumpcare/|title=Will Gilead's HIV Franchise Plan Be Dashed On TrumpCare?|author=Allison Gatlin|publisher=Investors Business Daily|date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2017/03/13/gilead-sciences-is-an-incyte-deal-reasonable/|title=Gilead Sciences: Is an Incyte Deal ‘Reasonable’?|author=Ben Levisohn|publisher=Barron's|date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/4045199-pharma-m-2017-likely-deal-hunters|title=Pharma M&amp;A In 2017: The Most Likely Deal Hunters|author=Ioannis Stamatopoulos|publisher=Seeking Alpha|date=2017-02-12|accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Glasgow smile''' (also known as a '''Chelsea smile''', or a '''Glasgow''', '''Chelsea''' or '''Cheshire grin''') is a [[wound]] caused by making a cut from the corners of a victim's mouth up to the ears, leaving a [[scar]] in the shape of a smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/68037/Surgeon-says-hospitals-treat-a-knife-victim-every-six-hours|work=[[The Daily Express]]|title=Surgeon Says Hospitals Treat a Knife Victim Every Six Hours|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If the Booze Doesn't Get You, The Blade Will|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/2683007/Suns-look-at-Broken-Britain-day-four-Glasgows-East-End.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=2009-11-20|location=London|first=Oliver|last=Harvey|date=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/city-slicker-glasgow-1616900.html|title=City Slicker Glasgow|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2009-11-20 | location=London | first=John | last=Arlidge | date=1995-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act is usually performed with a [[utility knife]] or a piece of broken glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Maxillofacial trauma and esthetic facial reconstruction |page=555 |author1=Peter Ward Booth |author2=Barry L.

'''Green Man''' is the name of two [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es, both [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet Uxor in the [[Vega]] star system, one a member of the [[Omega Men]] and both members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. Green Man first appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 2) # 164 (May 1983), and was created by writer [[Todd Klein]] and artist [[Dave Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=15281 Todd Klein's Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
"Green Man" is the adopted name of the Green Lantern from the Space Sector designated 2828 by the Green Lantern Corps. Uxorians frown upon individuality, and in Green Man’s own words, “On Uxor, all are one.” Green Man was a misfit who rebelled against his society’s anti-individualism, and longed for a personal identity. When the [[Guardians of the Universe]] offered him a position as a member of their Green Lantern Corps, Green Man jumped at the chance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Green Man | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 135 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the complications of this choice was that Green Man could never again legally enter his home star system, because of the pact the Guardians made with the Psions of Vega, which prohibits the Corps presence in that sector. Green Man's enlistment of the aid of the [[Omega Men]] in attacking the nestworld of a group of [[humanoid]] [[arachnids]] called the Spider Guild a few light years outside the Vega system resulted in a reprimand by the Guardians, which ultimately led to the Green Man quitting the Green Lantern Corps and joining the Omega Men. 

As a member of the Omega Men, Green Man encountered many other beings in his adventures, such as the goddess [[X'Hal]], who lived inside the star Vega; the [[whale]]-like Viathans; the [[Psion (comics)|Psions]], who performed experiments on Green Man when he was brought to their research center, Wombworld; the [[Tamaran]]s, and others. The Green Man was killed by [[Durlan (comics)|Durlans]] in [[Invasion! (DC Comics)|the ''Invasion!'' mini-series]] when the Omega Men were attacked by a coalition of aliens who were eliminating any opposition, including members of the then-disbanded Green Lantern Corps. 

In the non-canonical ''[[Green Lantern Versus Aliens]]'' Green Man assists in placing the titular aliens on the planet Mogo. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Green Lantern Versus Aliens]]'' #1-4 (September - December 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Green Man===

[[Image:GreenManStel.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Green Man (right), with his partner [[Stel]], from ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' #4 (February 2006). Art by [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]] and Prentis Rollins.]]
A second Uxorian also known as Green Man is partnered with the robot [[Stel]], the Green Lantern of the planet Grenda, in Sector 3009, as seen in the [[miniseries]] ''Green Lantern Corps: Recharge''. Green Man is one of the Lanterns who participated in the defense of Oa against the onslaught of [[Superboy-Prime]], as depicted in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7. Showing remorse over the apparent death of his partner, Green Man searched for Stel, and found him badly damaged, but functioning. The two then retreated to Mogo to ready themselves physically and mentally for the attacking Sinestro Corps.

Following the [[Sinestro Corps War]], the [[Guardians of the Universe]] established a new unit within the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps to uphold the Ten New Laws of the Book of Oa. This unit became known as the [[Alpha Lantern]] Corps. Green Man has been confirmed as a member of the Alpha Lanterns. He is later shown in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1. He appears again in issue #5, during Hal Jordan's trial and the subsequent events that clarify fellow Alpha Lantern Kraken is possessed by [[Granny Goodness]].

===Death===

As part of DC's "[[Brightest Day]]" storyline, [[Cyborg Superman]] hijacked the Alpha Lantern Corps. After he was defeated and the Alphas freed from his control, [[Ganthet]] managed to restore their emotions, including Green Man's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Tony Bedard|penciller=Ardian Syaf|inker=Vicente Cifuentes|story=Revolt of the Alpha Lanterns|title=Green Lantern Corps|volume=|issue=52|date=November 2010|publisher=DC Comics|page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[War of the Green Lanterns]] storyline, Alpha Lantern Varix felt that all the Alphas had become dangerously mentally unstable. He caused a reaction which killed all the Alpha Lanterns. &lt;ref&gt;"Green Lantern Corps" (vol. 3) #12 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The Green Man, after being stripped of his ring and lantern by the Guardians, demonstrated an ability to produce a portal which he could hear and see though and use to transport himself. He was also able to pick up on the brainwaves of others in a form of telepathy. 
After becoming a cyborg, Green Man has no more need for sleeping, resting or eating. Fully powered by his internal power battery, Green Man is mainlined to the Central Battery and the Book of Oa.

Uxorians possess a deadly nerve toxin in their blood stream, which acts as a defense mechanism against predators. Uxorians are also amphibious. Upon his induction in the [[Alpha Lanterns]] Corps he is turned into a [[cyborg]], fully covered with metallic plates. He carries a power battery embedded into his chest, no longer needing to recharge his ring from an external source, and a secondary face under his faceplate able to drain power rings, like the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]] have.

==In other media==
Green Man is one of the Green Lanterns who appear in the animated film ''[[Green Lantern: First Flight]]'' fighting [[Sinestro]].

Green Man also appears in a cameo in the ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' live-action film. His appearance in the film differs to some extent from the comics, as he is shown as less humanoid, although his design retains his more prominent features from the comics, such as his spotted green skin, the mask and robust frame. He is also part of the film toyline.

'''Inbreeding depression''' is the reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] in a given [[population]] as a result of [[inbreeding]], or breeding of related individuals. Population biological fitness refers to an organism's ability to survive and perpetuate its genetic material. Inbreeding depression is often the result of a [[population bottleneck]]. In general, the higher the [[genetic variation]] or [[gene pool]] within a breeding population, the less likely it is to suffer from inbreeding depression.

Inbreeding depression seems to be present in most groups of organisms, but varies across mating systems. [[Hermaphroditic]] species often exhibit lower degrees of inbreeding depression than [[outcrossing]] species, as repeated generations of [[selfing]] is thought to [[genetic purging|purge]] deleterious [[allele]]s from populations. For example, the outcrossing nematode (roundworm) ''[[Caenorhabditis remanei]]'' has been demonstrated to suffer severely from inbreeding depression, unlike its hermaphroditic relative ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', which experiences [[outbreeding depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dolgin|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00118.x |title=Inbreeding and Outbreeding Depression in Caenorhabditis Nematodes|first1=Elie S.|last2=Charlesworth|first2=Brian|last3=Baird|first3=Scott|last4=Cutter|first4=Asher D.|journal=Evolution|volume=61|issue=6|pages=1339–1352|pmid=17542844|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:Shetland pony inbred.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Example of inbreeding depression]]
Inbreeding (i.e., breeding between closely related individuals) results in more [[recessive]] traits manifesting themselves, as the [[genome]]s of pair-mates are more similar.  Recessive traits can only occur in an offspring if present in both parents' genomes. The more genetically similar the parents are, the more often recessive traits appear in their offspring. Consequently, the more closely related the breeding pair is, the more [[homozygous]], deleterious [[gene]]s the offspring may have, resulting in very unfit individuals. For [[allele]]s that confer an advantage in the [[heterozygous]] and/or homozygous-dominant state, the fitness of the homozygous-recessive state may even be zero (meaning [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]] or unviable offspring).

An example of inbreeding depression is shown to the right. In this case, ''a'' is the recessive allele which has negative effects. In order for the ''a'' phenotype to become active, the gene must end up as homozygous ''aa'' because in the geneotype A''a'', the A takes dominance over the ''a'' and the ''a'' does not have any effect. Due to their reduced phenotypic expression and their consequent reduced selection, recessive genes are, more often than not, detrimental phenotypes by causing the organism to be less fit to its natural environment.

Another mechanism responsible for inbreeding depression is the fitness advantage of heterozygosity, which is known as [[overdominance]]. This can lead to reduced fitness of a population with many homozygous genotypes, even if they are not deleterious or recessive. Here, even the dominant alleles result in reduced fitness if present homozygously (see also [[hybrid vigour]]).

Currently, it is not known which of the two mechanisms is more prevalent in nature. For practical applications, e.g. in [[livestock]] breeding, the former is thought to be&lt;!-- delete "thought to be" if sourced --&gt; more significant &amp;ndash; it may yield completely unviable offspring (meaning outright failure of a [[Purebred|pedigree]]), while the latter can only result in relatively reduced fitness.

==Natural selection==
[[Natural selection]] cannot effectively remove all deleterious recessive genes from a population for several reasons. First, deleterious genes arise constantly through mutation within a population. Second, in a population where inbreeding occurs frequently, most offspring will have some deleterious traits, so few will be more fit for survival than the others. Different deleterious traits are extremely unlikely to equally affect reproduction &amp;ndash; an especially disadvantageous recessive trait expressed in a homozygous recessive individual is likely to eliminate itself, naturally limiting the expression of its [[phenotype]]. Third, recessive deleterious alleles will be "masked" by heterozygosity, and so in a dominant-recessive trait, heterozygotes will not be selected against.

When recessive deleterious alleles occur in the heterozygous state, where their potentially deleterious expression is masked by the corresponding wild-type allele, this masking phenomenon is referred to as complementation (see [[complementation (genetics)]]).

In general, sexual reproduction in eukaryotes has two fundamental aspects: recombination during meiosis, and outcrossing.  It has been proposed that these two aspects have two natural selective advantages respectively.  A proposed adaptive advantage of meiosis is that it facilitates recombinational repair of DNA damages that are otherwise difficult to repair (see [[Origin and function of meiosis#DNA repair as the adaptive advantage|DNA repair as the adaptive advantage of meiosis]]).  A proposed adaptive advantage of outcrossing is complementation, which is the masking of deleterious recessive alleles&lt;ref name="sex"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = H | last2 = Byerly | first2 = HC | last3 = Hopf | first3 = FA | last4 = Michod | first4 = RE | year = 1985 | title = Genetic damage, mutation, and the evolution of sex | url = | journal = Science | volume = 229 | issue = 4719| pages = 1277–1281 | pmid = 3898363 | doi=10.1126/science.3898363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eros"&gt;Michod, R.E.  Eros and Evolution: A Natural Philosophy of Sex. (1996) Perseus Books {{ISBN|0201442329}} {{ISBN|978-0201442328}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor or heterosis]]).  The selective advantage of complementation may largely account for the general avoidance of inbreeding (see [[kin recognition]]).

==Management==
Introducing alleles from a different population can reverse inbreeding depression. Different populations of the same species have different deleterious traits, and therefore their cross breeding will not result in [[zygosity|homozygosity]] at most [[locus (genetics)|loci]] in the offspring. This is known as [[Heterosis|outbreeding enhancement]], practiced by conservation managers and zoo captive breeders to prevent homozygosity.

However, intermixing two different populations can give rise to unfit polygenic traits in [[outbreeding depression]] (i.e. yielding offspring which lack the genetic [[adaptation]]s to specific environmental conditions). These, then, will have a lowered fitness than pure-bred individuals of a particular [[subspecies]] that has adapted to its local environment.

==In humans==
The biological effects of inbreeding depression in humans are largely obscured by socioeconomic and cultural influences on reproductive behavior.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v17/n5/full/ejhg2008237a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in human populations have shown that age at [[marriage]], duration of marriage, il[[literacy]], [[contraceptive]] use, and [[reproductive compensation]] are the major determinants of apparent fertility, even amongst populations with a high proportion of [[consanguinous]] unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03014460110075657 | volume=29 | title=Does inbreeding lead to decreased human fertility? | journal=Annals of Human Biology | pages=111–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several small effects on increased mortality,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377721 | pmid=9915962 | doi=10.1086/302198 | volume=64 | title=Inbreeding effects on fertility in humans: evidence for reproductive compensation | date=January 1999 | journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. | pages=225–31 | last1 = Ober | first1 = C | last2 = Hyslop | first2 = T | last3 = Hauck | first3 = WW}}&lt;/ref&gt; longer inter-birth intervals&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; and reduced overall productivity&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; have been noted in certain isolated populations.

[[Charles Darwin]] was one of the first scientists to demonstrate the effects of inbreeding depression, through numerous experiments on plants. Darwin's wife, [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], was his first cousin, and he was concerned about the impact of inbreeding on his ten children, three of whom died at age ten or younger; three others had childless long-term marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berra|year=2010|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.5.7 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2010.60.5.7|title=Was the Darwin/Wedgwood Dynasty Adversely Affected by Consanguinity?|first1=Tim M.|last2=Alvarez|first2=Gonzalo|last3=Ceballos|first3=Francisco C.|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=5|pages=376–383|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inbreeding May Have Caused Darwin Family Ills, Study Suggests|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100503111420.htm|publisher=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R.W.

==Factors reducing inbreeding depression==

Whilst inbreeding depression has been found to occur in almost all sufficiently studied species, some taxa, most notably some angiosperms, appear to suffer lower fitness costs than others in inbred populations.&lt;ref name="Frankham et al." /&gt; Three mechanisms appear to be responsible for this: purging, differences in [[ploidy]], and selection for [[heterozygosity]].&lt;ref name="Frankham et al."&gt;{{cite book|last=Frankham, Ballou, Briscoe|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be cautioned that some studies failing to show an absence of inbreeding depression in certain species can arise from small sample sizes or where the supposedly outbred control group is already suffering inbreeding depression, which frequently occurs in populations that have undergone a recent bottleneck, such as those of the [[naked mole rat]].&lt;ref name="Frankham et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liberg|first=Paul|author2=Firmin B.|title=Role of inbreeding depression and purging in captive breeding and restoration programmes|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=2007|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03433.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03433.x/abstract|accessdate=9 May 2014|pages=334–343|pmid=18173505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purging selection===
[[genetic purging|Purging selection]] occurs where the phenotypes of [[deleterious]] [[recessive]] [[alleles]] are exposed through inbreeding, and thus can be selected against. This can lead to such detrimental mutations being removed from the population, and has been demonstrated to occur rapidly where the recessive alleles have a lethal effect.&lt;ref name="Frankham et al." /&gt; The efficiency of purging will depend on the relationship between the magnitude of the deleterious effect that is unmasked in the homozygotes and the importance of [[genetic drift]], so that purging is weaker for non-lethal than for recessive lethal alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = García-Dorado | first1 = A | year = 2012 | title = Understanding and predicting the fitness decline of shrunk populations: inbreeding, purging, mutation and standard selection | journal = Genetics | volume = 190 | issue = | pages = 1461–1476 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.111.135541 | pmid=22298709 | pmc=3316656}}&lt;/ref&gt; For very small populations, drift has a strong influence, which can cause the fixation of sublethal alleles under [[weak selection]].&lt;ref name="Frankham et al." /&gt; The fixation of a single allele for a specific gene can also reduce fitness where [[heterozygote advantage]] was previously present (i.e., where heterozygous individuals have higher fitness than homozygotes of either allele), although this phenomenon seems to make a usually small contribution to inbreeding depression. Although naturally occurring, purging can be important for population survival, deliberately attempting to purge deleterious mutations from a population is not generally recommended as a technique to improve the fitness of captive bred animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garcia-Dorado | first1 = A | year = 2015 | title = On the consequences of ignoring purging on geentic recommendations of MVP rules | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 115| issue = | pages = 185–187| doi = 10.1038/hdy.2015.28 | pmc = 4814235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leberg | first1 = P.

===Polyploidy===
Many [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants) can self-fertilise for several generations and suffer little from inbreeding depression. This is very useful for species which disperse widely and can therefore find themselves growing in a novel environment with no [[conspecifics]] present.&lt;ref name="Frankham et al." /&gt; [[Polyploidy]] (having more than two paired sets of each chromosome), which is prevalent in angiosperms, ferns and a select few animal taxa, accounts for this. By having several copies of a chromosome, as opposed to two, homozygosity is less likely to occur in inbred offspring. This means that recessive deleterious alleles are not expressed as frequently as with many copies of a chromosome; it is more likely that at least one will contain a functional allele.&lt;ref name="Frankham et al." /&gt;

===Selection for heterozygosity===
Inbreeding depression has also been found to occur more gradually than predicted in some wild populations, such as in the highly inbred population of Scandinavian wolves. This appears to be due to a selection pressure for more [[heterozygous]] individuals, which generally are in better condition and so are more likely to become one of the few animals to breed and produce offspring.&lt;ref name="Bensch et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bensch|first=Staffan |author2=Andren, Hanson |author3=Pederson, Sand |author4=Sejberg, Wabakken |author5=Akesson, Liberg|title=Selection for heterozygosity gives hope to wild wolves|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2006|volume=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000072|pages=e72 |pmid=17183704 |pmc=1762340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonid Borisovich Rozhetskin''' ({{lang-ru|Леонид Борисович Рожецкин}}, born August 4, 1966; disappeared March 16, 2008) was a financier and [[lawyer]] who went missing under suspicious circumstances after disappearing from his village in [[Jūrmala|Jūrmala, Latvia]].&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mailsun08"/&gt; In 2013, remains found nearby the year before were confirmed to be Rozhetskin's.&lt;ref name=dlymail&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Will|title=Body found in remote Russian woods IS missing City AM tycoon... but was he victim of mafia hit?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2508737/Leonid-Rozhetskin-confirmed-dead-body-Latvian-woodland.html|website=MailOnline|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Rozhetskin was born in 1966 to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Leningrad]], [[Soviet Union]]; he and his mother Elvira emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt; where he became a [[citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizen]]. Rozhetskin was a "brilliant student", winning scholarships to [[Columbia University]], where he graduated with distinction.&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;  In 1990, Rozhetskin graduated ''[[cum laude]]''{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} from [[Harvard Law School]].

Rozhetskin received a Certificate of Distinction in Teaching from [[Harvard University]],{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} for teaching Harvard and [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]] undergraduates during the 1989-90 academic year.

== Legal career ==
Rozhetskin began his legal career as a [[law clerk]] for Judge [[Stephen Victor Wilson|Stephen V. Wilson]], a federal judge in Los Angeles, California; he then joined the law firm [[White &amp; Case]].&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;

At the age of 26, Rozhetskin returned to Russia, first as a lawyer at White &amp; Case's Moscow office, and then as the head of his own law firm,&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt; representing clients such as the [[International Finance Corporation]] (a division of the [[World Bank]]), [[Credit Suisse]], [[Morgan Grenfell]] and ''[[The Moscow Times]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Career in investments, mining and media ==
In 1995, Rozhetskin's focus shifted from the law to financial ventures. Rozhetskin was part of a group that founded [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]], Russia's first [[investment bank]], in partnership with [[Boris Jordan]], an American of Russian origin, and [[New Zealand]]er Stephen Jennings.&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;

Rozhetskin "amassed his fortune in the [[Mobile phone industry in Russia|mobile phone industry]] during [[Privatization in Russia|Russia's privatisation]] of telecom companies."&lt;ref name="mailsun08"/&gt; In 1998, Rozhetskin left Renaissance Capital to co-found the independent [[venture capital]] firm LV Finance. With help from [[Leonid Reiman]], LV Finance secured 25% of [[MegaFon]] at the time Reiman was Russia's [[Ministry of Communications and Mass Media (Russia)|telecommunications minister]].&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt; In 2003, Rozhetskin sold the MegaFon stake to [[Alfa Group]].&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;

From October 2001 until January 2005, Rozhetskin served as Executive Vice Chairman of [[Norilsk Nickel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/20/pressandpublishing|title=City AM founder disappears in Latvia|first1=Stephen|last1=Brook |date=20 March 2008 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582361/Russian-born-City-AM-backer-disappears.html |title=Russian-born City AM backer disappears |first=Richard |last= Edwards |date=21 March 2008 |publisher= [[Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's largest mining company and the world's largest miner of [[nickel]] and [[palladium]] metals. Rozhetskin was also a board member and founding shareholder of ''[[City A.M.]]'', London's first free daily business newspaper.

Rozhetskin founded a production company called L + E Productions with [[Eric Eisner]], son of former Disney executive [[Michael Eisner]].  Through L + E Productions, he was credited as a producer of ''[[Hamlet 2]]''; he was also credited as an executive producer of the 2009 film ''[[Boogie Woogie (film)|Boogie Woogie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|2811837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Rozhetskin married model Natalya Belova, who gave birth to their son in 2005.&lt;ref name="mailsun08"/&gt;  According to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (and other sources&lt;ref name="mailsun08"/&gt;), Rozhetskin's friends suspected he lived a [[closeted]] life, prompted by what the newspaper called Russia's "[[machismo]] and deep-seated homophobia"; the "extraordinary lengths to [he went to] conceal his homosexuality included withholding the truth on the subject from his mother, who characterized claims of her son's homosexuality as a "[[smear campaign]]."&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;

== Disappearance and death ==
Rozhetskin was last seen on the night of his disappearance by two men who were picked up at his villa by a taxi that took them to a club called XXL, [[Riga]]'s largest gay nightclub.&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt; Many Western media sources quickly assumed he was dead,&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mailsun08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1582793/City-AM-backer-Leonid-Rozhetskin-feared-dead.html |title=City AM backer Leonid Rozhetskin feared dead |first1=Caroline |last1=Gammell |first2=Adrian |last2=Blomfield |date=25 March 2008 |publisher= Daily Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Russian press claimed he was living in California under the [[Federal Witness Protection Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/23/09/2008/247611.shtml |title=В Лондоне исчезла жена Леонида Рожецкина (Leonid Rozhetskin's wife disappeared in London |date=23 September 2008 |publisher=[[RBC TV]] }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a body found in a forest near [[Tukums]] was that of Rozhetskin, according to preliminary [[DNA]] tests;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gain|first=Bruce|title=Missing Americans body a DNA match in Latvia|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/blog/2012/09/05/missing-americans-body-a-dna-match-in-latvia/index.html|work=www.crimelibrary.com|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; these findings were confirmed in November 2013.&lt;ref name=dlymail /&gt;
&lt;!-- As of June 2009, most of Rozhetskin's assets&amp;mdash;estimated at "several hundred million dollars"&amp;mdash;are in a [[Trust law|trust]] controlled by an American lawyer in Geneva, who has full legal powers over how to manage Rozhetskin's assets until Rozhetskin is declared dead.&lt;ref name="sundtimes09"/&gt; --&gt;

The following is a list of '''Presidents of the United States by date of death''', plus additional lists of presidential death related statistics.

While the incumbent president, Donald Trump, is the nation's 45th president, he is only the 44th person to serve as president.

'''Marvelous Marvin Hagler''' (born '''Marvin Nathaniel Hagler'''; May 23, 1954)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/8684 |title=Marvin Hagler |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1973 to 1987. He reigned as the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] [[middleweight]] champion from 1980 to 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; making twelve defenses of that title, and currently holds the highest [[knockout]] percentage of all undisputed middleweight champions, at 78%, while also holding the [[unified champion|second longest unified championship reign in boxing history]] at twelve consecutive defenses. At six years and seven months, his reign as undisputed middleweight champion is the second longest of the last century, behind only [[Tony Zale]], who reigned during World War II. In 1982, annoyed that network announcers often did not refer to him by his nickname, "Marvelous", Hagler legally changed his name to Marvelous Marvin Hagler.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Bob. "[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_hagler_marvin]", ESPN.com, September 26, 2006. Accessed August 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagler is an inductee of the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. He was named Fighter of the Decade (1980s) by ''Boxing Illustrated'' magazine, and twice named Fighter of the Year by [[The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|''The Ring'' magazine]] and the [[Sugar Ray Robinson Award|Boxing Writers Association of America]]. In 2001 and 2004, ''The Ring'' named him the fourth greatest middleweight of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Division-By-Division_-_The_Greatest_Fighters_of_All-Time |title=Division-By-Division – The Greatest Fighters of All-Time |publisher=Boxrec.com |date=March 13, 2013 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 named him the 17th greatest fighter of the past 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/ring-magazines-best-fighters-424112|title=Are These Really the 80 Best Boxers Ever?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Boxing Research Organization rates Hagler as the 6th greatest middleweight of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibroresearch.com/?p=424 | title=Middleweight | work=IBRO | accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[BoxRec]] rates him the 12th greatest boxer of all time, [[pound for pound]]; and the 4th best middleweight of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxrec.com/en/ratings?r%5Bcountry%5D=&amp;r%5Bdivision%5D=Middleweight&amp;r%5Bsex%5D=M&amp;r%5Bstance%5D=&amp;r%5Bstatus%5D=&amp;r_go= | title=World all middleweight ratings | work=BoxRec | accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts and boxing writers consider Hagler to have one of the most durable [[chin (combat sports)|chins]] in boxing history.

==Early life and amateur career==
Hagler spent his early years in [[Newark, New Jersey]]'s Central Ward. Following the [[1967 Newark riots|Newark Riots]] of July 12–17, 1967, in which 26 people were killed and $11 million in property damage was caused, including the destruction of the Hagler family's [[tenement]], the Haglers moved to [[Brockton, Massachusetts]]. In 1969, Hagler took up [[boxing]] after walking into a gym owned by brothers Pat and [[Goody Petronelli]], who became his trainers and managers. In 1973, Hagler won the National [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] 165-pound title after defeating [[Atlanta]]'s Terry Dobbs.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Hagler was a top-ranked [[middleweight]] boxer for many years before he could fight for the title. Hagler struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to face him in his early years. [[Joe Frazier]] told Hagler, 'You have three strikes against you, "You're black, you're a southpaw, and you're good.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a.espncdn.com/boxing/columns/kellerman_max/1512173.html |title=ESPN boxing |publisher=A.espncdn.com |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often had to travel to his opponents' hometowns to get fights. His first break came when he was offered --on two weeks' notice-- a chance against Willie 'the Worm' Monroe, who was being trained by Frazier. Hagler lost the decision but the fight was close, so Monroe gave him a rematch. This time Hagler knocked out Monroe in 12 rounds. In a third fight, he stopped Monroe in two rounds.

Boston promoter Rip Valenti took an interest in Hagler and began bringing in top ranked opponents for Hagler to face. He fought [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]] gold medalist [[Sugar Ray Seales]]; Hagler won the first time, the second was a draw and Hagler knocked out Seales in the third fight. Number 1 ranked Mike Colbert was knocked out in the twelfth and also had his jaw broken by Hagler. Briton [[Kevin Finnegan]] was stopped in eight. Afterwards Finnegan required 40 stitches in his face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093545/3/index.htm |title=A Sinister Reputation |work=Sports Illustrated|date=April 17, 1978 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped a controversial decision to [[Bobby 'Boogaloo' Watts]], but knocked out Watts in two rounds in a rematch. Hagler won a ten-round decision over [[Bennie Briscoe|'Bad' Bennie Briscoe]]. By then, promoter [[Bob Arum]] took notice and signed him.

===First title shot===
In November 1979, Hagler fought World Middleweight Champion [[Vito Antuofermo]] at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]]. After fifteen rounds, most thought that Hagler had won. Hagler claimed the ref said he won, but the ref denied ever saying it.     Hagler claimed he  and many others were surprised when the decision was announced as a draw and Antuofermo retained his title. This only added to Hagler's frustrations. Hagler had the boxing skills and killer instinct to knock Vito out, but instead he played it safe and it cost him the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126379/3/indx.htm |title='&amp;#39;Sports Illustrated'&amp;#39; December 10, 1979 |work=Sports Illustrated|date=December 10, 1979 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World champion===
Antuofermo lost his title later to British boxer [[Alan Minter]], who gave Hagler his second title shot. Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter. The tense atmosphere was stoked further when Minter was quoted as saying that "No black man is going to take my title"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   }}&lt;/ref&gt;—Minter would later insist he meant "''that'' black man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Gammon |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123817/index.htm |title=It Was Blood, Sweat And Beers |work=Sports Illustrated|date=October 6, 1980 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut-prone Minter. With Hagler dominating the action, referee Carlos Berrocal halted the fight during the third round to have the four glaring cuts on Minter's face examined. Minter's manager, Doug Bidwell, almost immediately conceded defeat.  Once Berrocal waved the bout off, a riot broke out among the spectators. Clive Gammon of Sports Illustrated described the scene as "a horrifying ululation of howls and boos."  Hagler and his trainers had to be escorted to their locker room by a phalanx of policemen, all the while enduring a steady rain of beer bottles and glasses.  After seven years and 50 fights, Hagler was the World Middleweight Champion.

Hagler proved a busy world champion. He defeated future world champion [[Fulgencio Obelmejias]] of [[Venezuela]] by a knockout in eight rounds and then former world champ Antuofermo in a rematch by TKO in four rounds. Both matches were fought at the [[Boston Garden]] near Hagler's hometown, endearing him to Boston fight fans. Syrian born [[Mustafa Hamsho]], who won his shot in an eliminator with [[Wilfred Benítez]] and would later defeat future world champion [[Bobby Czyz]], became Hagler's next challenger, put up a lot of resistance but was finally beaten in 11 tough rounds. Michigan fighter [[William "Caveman" Lee]] lasted only one round, and in a rematch in Italy, Obelmejias lasted five rounds. British Champion (and mutual [[Alan Minter]] conqueror) [[Tony Sibson]] followed in Hagler's ever-growing list of unsuccessful challengers.  Sibson provided one of the most entertaining (to this point) fights of Marvelous Marvin's career, but he ultimately fell short, lasting six rounds. Next, came [[Wilford Scypion]], who only lasted four.  By then, Hagler was a staple on [[Home Box Office|HBO]], the [[Pay Per View]] of its time.

===Hagler vs. Durán===
A fight against [[Roberto Durán]] followed. Durán was the first challenger to last the distance with Hagler in a world-championship bout. Durán was the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[Light Middleweight]] Champion and went up in weight to challenge for Hagler's middleweight crown. Hagler won a unanimous 15-round decision, although after 13 rounds, Duran was ahead by one point on two scorecards and even on the third. Hagler, with his left eye swollen and cut, came on strong in the last two rounds to win the fight.

===More title defenses===
Then came [[Juan Roldán]] of [[Argentina]], who became the only man to be credited with a knockdown of Hagler, scoring one [[Knockout#Knockdown|knockdown]] seconds into the fight – which was clearly a slip to anyone who saw it. Hagler protested bitterly that he had been pulled/pushed to the canvas. Hagler cut Roldan's left eye, then brutalized him over ten rounds and stopping him in the middle of round ten. Sugar Ray Leonard was calling the fight ringside with HBO analyst Barry Tompkins. He noted to Tompkins between rounds that Hagler looked older and slower. "Marvin might finally be slowing down, Barry" Leonard remarked. Many people believe this is the fight that gave Sugar Ray Leonard the idea that he could actually win a fight with the aging Hagler.
Hamsho was given a rematch, but the Syrian was again TKO'd, this time in only three rounds. Hamsho angered Hagler with a trio of intentional headbutts in the second round and a fourth early in the third, goading the normally patient and cautious Hagler into a full-out attack that left Hamsho battered and defenseless in a matter of seconds.

===Hagler vs. Hearns===
{{Main|Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns}}
On April 15, 1985, Hagler and [[Thomas Hearns]] met in what was billed as The Fight; later it would become known as "[[The War (boxing)|The War]]."  
Round One: Three minutes of blistering violence. Within the first fifteen seconds, Hearns lands his best punch, a straight right, onto Hagler's chin. The champion steps back, then comes forward. At this point, Hagler begins to walk through Tommy's power punches.
Round Two: Hagler is cut on his head from an unintentional elbow or headbutt. Despite the blood, the champion continues to now push the fight forward. Hearns is fighting hurt as well, having suffered a broken right hand in the last minute of the first round. The pace continues as before, but now Hearns is backing up, trying to move around the ring. Hearns' trainer Manny Stewart would later reveal Hearns had a leg massage, much to his dismay, before the fight. Tommy's legs by the end of the round are weakening.
Round Three: The pace slows until Referee Richard Steele calls a time out to have the ringside doctor examine the cut on Hagler's head. The crowd is on its feet for the next ten seconds, before the doctor allows the fight to continue. Hagler charges the much taller Hearns, drilling in an overhand right behind Tommy's ear. Hearns' legs wobble, and Hagler is on him quickly. Tommy topples to the canvas, rising at the count of eight, but collapses into Referee Steele's arms. The fight is then halted.

The fight only lasted eight minutes and one second, but it is rightly regarded as a classic.  Commentator [[Al Michaels]] uttered the now-immortal line, "It didn't go very far, but it was a beauty!" The fight was named "[[Ring Magazine fights of the year|Fight of the Year]]" by [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']].

===Hagler vs. Mugabi===
Next was Olympic silver medalist [[John Mugabi]] of [[Uganda]], who was 25–0 with 25 [[knockout]]s and was ranked the number one contender by all three major bodies. The fight took place on March 10, 1986 as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight on the first date booked in 1985. Hagler stopped Mugabi in the 11th round of a brutal fight. Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age.  He was much slower of hand and foot and seemed much easier to hit. He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes. Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Lq9RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xG4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7013,987559&amp;dq |title=Hagler Considers Retirement |publisher=News.google.com |date=July 3, 1986 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagler's promoter [[Bob Arum]] was quoted as saying he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.

===Hagler vs. Leonard===
{{Split section|Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Marvin Hagler|discuss=Talk:Sugar Ray Leonard#Split proposal|date=September 2017}}
Hagler's next challenger was [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], who was returning to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years.) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler a larger share of the purse Leonard obtained several conditions which would be crucial to his strategy; a 22x22ft ring, 12oz gloves and the fight was to be over 12—not 15—rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19870407&amp;id=GadAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ngYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6015,4144686&amp;hl=en |title=Decision Shocks Hagler |publisher=News.google.com |date=April 7, 1987 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yXniUJ-cBwC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=hagler+20+foot+ring&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ziVQ-gjGND&amp;sig=vUimCK3CfJEoKAOF8uLN0ypt74c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BN4OVcSUHYHoUPeShJgO&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hagler%2020%20foot%20ring&amp;f=false |title=Four Kings: Leonard, Hagler, Hearns, Duran and the Last Great Era of Boxing |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard was 2 years younger, had half as many fights, and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' fights behind closed doors (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no head gear) in order to shake off his ring rust. The fight took place at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the betting favorite.

Hagler, a natural [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]], opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, though Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill kept him in the fight. But by the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. As he tired Leonard began to clinch with more frequency (in total referee Richard Steele gave him over 30 warnings for holding, although never deducted a point). Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and run less.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;Sugar Ray...Still In Style, Nigel Collins, ''The Ring'' August 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In rounds seven and eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent. Round nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard was in trouble, then furiously tried to fight his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. Round ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round. Clearly tiring, Leonard boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier, if not as effective. In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a flurry and danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. Hagler began dancing in celebration of his performance while Leonard alternately collapsed to the canvas and raised both his arms in triumph.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Leonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC1430F93AA35757C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print New York Times], April 9, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagler later said that, as the fighters embraced in the ring after the fight, Leonard said to him, "You beat me man". Hagler said after the fight, "He said I beat him and I was so happy". Leonard denied making the statement and claimed he only told Hagler, "You're a great champion". [[HBO]] cameras and microphones supported Hagler's version of events.

Leonard was announced as winner by split decision, which remains hotly disputed to this day.

====Post-fight reaction====
Official ringside judge JoJo Guerra, whose 118–110 scorecard was derided in many quarters, commented that:

{{quote|Leonard outpunched Hagler, outsmarted him, outboxed him. He looked just great. Sugar Ray Leonard was making him miss a lot, and then [[Counterpunch (boxing)|counterpunch]]ing him. Sugar Ray Leonard was beating him to the punch. They should call him Marvelous Sugar Ray Leonard. Boxing is the art of self-defense, and Sugar Ray was in command at all times. He was very fast and he was very clever. He made Marvin Hagler come to him. He dictated the fight.&lt;ref name = "shivambu"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ira Berkow |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/09/sports/sports-of-the-times-no-hoosegow-for-jojo-guerra.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm |title=Sports of the Times; No Hoosegow for JoJo Guerra |date=April 9, 1987 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-04-08/sports/26192262_1_pat-petronelli-jojo-guerra-middleweight-championship-fight |title=Self-defense Guerra Brushes Off Critics, Praises Leonard Performance |date=April 8, 1987| newspaper=The Inquirer |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Judge Dave Moretti, who scored it 115–113 for Leonard:

{{quote|Obviously, Hagler was the aggressor, but he was not the effective aggressor. You can't chase and get hit and chase and get hit, and get credit for it. Besides, the hardest punching was by Leonard.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Phil|title=Judgment Day For Ring Judge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/sports/judgment-day-for-ring-judge.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=April 8, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lou Filippo, who scored it 115–113 for Hagler and felt that Hagler's bodyshots and aggression earned him the nod, said:

{{quote|Hagler was doing all the work. The referee, Richard Steele, warned Leonard at least once every round about holding. Leonard fought in spurts. Leonard would run in and grab and hold. He did what he had to do. But I can't see a guy holding that much and getting points for it.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;}}

[[Hugh McIlvanney]], commenting in the British ''Sunday Times'' and ''Sports Illustrated'':

{{quote|What Ray Leonard pulled off in his split decision over Hagler was an epic illusion. He had said beforehand that the way to beat Hagler was to give him a distorted picture. But this shrewdest of fighters knew it was even more important to distort the picture for the judges. His plan was to "steal" rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurries and to make the rest of each three-minute session as unproductive as possible for Hagler by circling briskly away from the latter's persistent pursuit. When he made his sporadic attacking flourishes, he was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power, and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champion's gloves and arms.&lt;ref&gt;The Hardest Game, Hugh McIlvanney, Contemporary Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065875/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=April 20, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McIlvanny also referred to [[Budd Schulberg]]'s contention about a 'compound optical illusion', namely that simply being more competitive than expected meant that Leonard appeared more effective and to be doing more than he actually was.&lt;ref name="Video"/&gt; [[Harry Gibbs (referee)|Harry Gibbs]], the British judge who ironically had been rejected by the Hagler camp, said he also scored it for Hagler.

[[Jim Murray (sportswriter)|Jim Murray]], long-time sports columnist for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship, and writing:

{{quote|It wasn't even close...He didn't just outpoint Hagler, he exposed him. He made him look like a guy chasing a bus. In [[snowshoes]]. Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often. He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him. If you moved, he was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3cUlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iPwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3643,2396700&amp;dq=jim-murray+sugar+ray+leonard+hagler&amp;hl=en |title=Sugar Ray Exposed Him, Jim Murray, 1987 |publisher=News.google.com |date=April 8, 1987 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The scorecards from the ringside press attest to the closeness of the fight (6–5, 3 drawn) more pundits awarded the fight to Leonard rather than to Hagler, although counting those who scored it even, more felt Hagler deserved to keep his title than did not:

====Rematch====
Hagler requested a rematch but Leonard chose to retire again (the third of five high-profile retirements announced by Leonard), having said he would do so beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winderman|first=Ira|title=After A Year's Prefight, Bell Tolls For These|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-05/sports/8701220087_1_hagler-and-leonard-marvelous-marvin-hagler-fight|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=Sun-Sentinel|location=Fort Lauderdale|date=April 5, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="champsuk.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.champsuk.com/i-543/sugar-ray-leonard-post-fight-press-conference-after-defeating-marvin-hagler-original-wire-photograph-.html |title=Sugar Ray Leonard Post Fight Press Conference After Defeating Marvin Hagler |publisher=Champsuk.com |date=April 6, 1987 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagler himself retired from boxing in June 1988, declaring that he was "tired of waiting" for Leonard to grant him a rematch. In 1990, Leonard finally offered Hagler a rematch which reportedly would have earned him $15m, but he declined. By then he had settled down to a new life as an actor in Italy and was now uninterested in boxing.&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick|last=Telander|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136738/index.htm |title=With Friends Like These, Who Needs Sugar Ray? |work=Sports Illustrated |date=July 2, 1990 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_hagler_marvin |title=You Look Marvelous |first=Bob |last=Carter |work=ESPN Sport|date=September 26, 2006 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said "A while ago, yeah, I wanted him so bad, but I'm over that."&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"/&gt; At the 1994 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] Hagler and Leonard had a mock rematch by playing against each other in the video game ''[[Boxing Legends of the Ring]]'', and claimed that an actual rematch was being planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Famous Boxers Duke it Out|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=57|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1994|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training style==
Hagler had a unique training regimen in which he would hole up on [[Cape Cod]] in motels that had closed for the winter. For his "road work" he would take to the pavement in army boots, declaring running shoes "sissy shoes." He would run much of his route backwards to prepare for movements in the boxing ring.

'''Michael J. Halberstam''' (August 9, 1932 {{ndash}} December 5, 1980) was an [[United States|American]] [[cardiologist]] and [[author]]. In 1980 Halberstam was killed by a gunshot wound during an attempted burglary of his residence in [[Washington, District of Columbia |Washington, D.C.]]

==Early life and education==
Halberstam was born on August 9, 1932 in [[The Bronx|The Bronx, New York]], the first of two sons for Dr. Charles Abraham, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] surgeon and Blanche Levy Halberstam, a teacher.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/12/07/michael-j-halberstam-physician-author-and-sportsman/50d3207a-5174-4916-842f-e2dd28532131/|title=Michael J.

Halberstam attended [[Harvard College]], where he was managing editor of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' (as his brother David would also be) and won the Dana Reed Prize for the best piece of writing published in a Harvard student publication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Halberstam earned an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in History with honors from Harvard in 1953 and earned a [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[Boston University School of Medicine]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Halberstam served in the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]], then completed his internship and residency in New York City and [[Burlington, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1962 Halberstam became a [[fellow]] in cardiology at [[George Washington University Hospital]] and later taught at the university's [[George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences|medical school]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Halberstam established a private practice in 1964.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to medical papers in his field, Halberstam wrote on topics including [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]&lt;ref name="halbmedicare"&gt;Halberstam, Michael J. (August 13, 1967). A Doctor's Diagnosis Of Medicare; Diagnosis of Medicare (Cont.) Medicare is converting hospitals into geriatric institutions.

''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as television reviews of medical shows like ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' In 1978 Halberstam wrote a novel, ''The Wanting of Levine'', about a self-made millionaire real estate investor who becomes the first Jewish U.S. President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/president-levine-the-wanting-of-levine.html|title=President Levine|last=Sherrill|first=Robert|date=1978-05-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 journalist [[Ira Stoll]] described ''The Wanting of Levine'' as having "most cannily anticipated" the presidency of [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/national/how-trumps-electorial-triumph-was-predicted-in/89987|title=Trump's Electoral Triumph Was Imagined in a Novel Written 40 Years Ago|accessdate=2017-05-24|work=New York Sun|publisher=nysun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Death==
On December 5, 1980, Halberstam was shot at his Washington, D.C. home by Bernard C. Welch Jr., a prolific thief and escaped convict who lived in nearby [[Great Falls, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="ledbetter"&gt;Ledbetter, Les (December 6, 1980). Michael J.

Despite having been shot twice in the chest by Welch, Halberstam told his wife to get into their car, and he drove them toward [[Sibley Memorial Hospital|Sibley Hospital]]. On the way to the hospital, Halberstam saw Welch, shouted, "That's the guy!" and swerved to hit him. Welch was wounded, but not fatally injured. Halberstam crashed his car into a tree near the hospital, and was taken to the emergency room by ambulance. Halberstam died on the operating table approximately 90 minutes after he was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/12/11/oh-baby-youre-shot/4d7a6621-da16-4b54-aa72-4e49d343557d/|title='Oh, Baby, You're Shot'|last=Mansfield|first=Stephanie|date=1980-12-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; District of Columbia police arrested the wounded Welch.&lt;ref name="lyons80"&gt;Lyons, Richard D.

'''Miguel Ângelo Laporta Nicolelis''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] ({{IPA-pt|miˈɡɛw ˈɐ̃ʒelu lɐˈpɔɾtɐ nikoˈlɛlis}}, born March 7, 1961), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[scientist]] and [[Physician]], best known for his pioneering work surrounding brain-machine interface technology. 

==Biography==
He and his colleagues at [[Duke University]] implanted [[electrode]] arrays into a [[monkey]]'s [[brain]] that were able to detect the monkey's motor intent and thus able to control reaching and grasping [[Human musculoskeletal system|movements]] performed by a [[robot]]ic arm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This was possible by decoding signals of hundreds of [[neuron]]s recorded in volitional areas of the [[cerebral cortex]] while the monkey played with a hand-held [[joystick]] to move a shape in a video game. These signals were sent to the robot arm, which then mimicked the monkey's movements and thus controlled the game. After a while the monkey realised that thinking about moving the shape was enough and it no longer needed to move the joystick. So it let go of the joystick and controlled the game purely through thought.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} A system in which brain signals directly control an artificial actuator is commonly referred to as [[brain-machine interface]] or [[brain-computer interface]].

On January 15, 2008, Dr. Nicolelis lab saw a monkey implanted with a new BCI successfully control a  robot walking on a treadmill in Kyoto, Japan.  The monkey could see the robot, named CB, on a screen in front of him, and was rewarded for walking in sync with the robot (which was under the control of the monkey).  After an hour the monkey's treadmill was turned off, but he was able to continue to direct the robot to walk normally for another few minutes, indicating that a part of the brain not sufficient to induce a motor response in the monkey had become dedicated to controlling the robot, as if it were an extension of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=monkey-think-robot-do |title=Monkey Think, Robot Do |work=Scientific American |date=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15robo.html |title=Monkey's Thoughts Propel Robot, a Step That May Help Humans |work=The New York Times |date=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolelis is a co-founder and scientific director of the Edmond and Lily Safra [[International Institute for Neuroscience of Natal]], a brain research facility in Brazil{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

On August 3, 2010, Nicolelis was awarded an NIH Director's Pioneer Award to continue his research on brain-machine interface technology. On January 5, 2011, Dr. Nicolelis was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as an ordinary member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Nicolelis is a fan of [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]], a Brazilian football club; a football ball with Palmeiras crest can be seen at his website. He is currently working on a project that allowed [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] Juliano Pinto, a 29-year-old with complete paralysis of the lower trunk to deliver the kickoff at the opening game of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27812218 |title= Paraplegic in robotic suit kicks off World Cup|work=BBC News |date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain to brain==
In 2013 a report of research by Nicolelis and others was published which showed brain to brain communication between two rats using [[brain–computer interface]]s. This result may demonstrate the feasibility of a [[biological computer]] consisting of a [[Computer network|network]] of animal, or human, brains.&lt;ref name=NYT022813&gt;{{cite news |title=In a First, Experiment Links Brains of Two Rats |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/science/new-research-suggests-two-rat-brains-can-be-linked.html |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |newspaper=The [[New York Times]] |date=February 28, 2013 |first=James |last=Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= FT022813&gt;{{cite news |title=Telepathic rats solve problems together |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/422e4e8a-8197-11e2-904c-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=February 28, 2013 |first=Clive |last=Cookson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Pais-Vieira | Lebedev | Kunicki | Wang | 2013}}  Currently, researchers are divided on their views of this research. Critics state that there are flaws in the scientific methods used and that there is lack of controls.&lt;ref name=Cossins /&gt; They claim that some of the scientific claims are rendered "far-fetched at best."&lt;ref name= Cossins /&gt; One researcher stated the work was similar to a "poor Hollywood science fiction script."&lt;ref name= Cossins /&gt; Proponents have praised this research for drawing attention to Brain to Brain Interfaces as a way of studying neural systems: “The study helps to promote the role of BMIs not only in prosthetic applications, but also as scientific tools. It's a contribution to that.”&lt;ref name=Cossins&gt;{{cite news |title=A Brain-to-Brain Interface for Rats |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/34547/title/A-Brain-to-Brain-Interface-for-Rats/ |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |magazine=The Scientist |date=February 28, 2013 |first=Dan |last=Cossins}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ron Frostig, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, has described this brain to brain work as "an amazing paper” and a “beautiful proof of principle” that information can be transferred from one brain to another in real time.&lt;ref name=NYT022813 /&gt;

'''''Per stirpes''''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɜr|_|ˈ|s|t|ɜr|p|iː|z}}; "by branch") is a legal term from [[Latin (language)|Latin]]. An [[Estate (law)|estate]] of a decedent is distributed ''per stirpes'' if each  ''branch'' of the family is to receive an equal share of an [[Estate (law)|estate]]. When the heir in the first generation of a branch predeceased the decedent, the share that would have been given to the heir would be distributed among the heir's issue in equal shares. It may also be known as '''strict per stirpes'''&lt;ref&gt;BAR/BRI, ''2L/3L Outlines'' (Dallas, Tex.: Barbari, 2015), Wills: 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''the old English approach''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Wendel |title=Wills, Trusts, and Estates |edition=8th |location=New York |publisher=Aspen |year=2010 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and differs from distribution ''[[per capita]]'', as members of the same generation may inherit different amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Per stirpes |work=Black's Law Dictionary |url=http://thelawdictionary.org/per-stirpes/ |edition=2nd |publisher=West Publishing |first=Henry Campbell |last=Black |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Per stipes example A.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1. ''A''{{'}}s estate is divided equally between each of the three branches. ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' each receive one-third. As ''B'' pre-deceased ''A'', ''B''{{'}}s two children - ''B1'' and ''B2'' - each receive one-half of ''B''{{'}}s share, equivalent to one-sixth of the estate.]]

'''Example 1A:''' The [[testator]] ''A'', specifies in his [[Will (law)|will]] that his estate is to be divided among his descendants in equal shares ''per stirpes''. ''A'' has three children, ''B'', ''C'', and ''D''. ''B'' is already dead, but has left two children (grandchildren of ''A''), ''B1'' and ''B2''. When ''A''{{'}}s will is executed, under a distribution ''per stirpes'', ''C'' and ''D'' each receive one-third of the estate, and ''B1'' and ''B2'' each receive one-sixth. ''B1'' and ''B2'' constitute one "branch" of the family, and collectively receive a share equal to the shares received by ''C'' and ''D'' as branches (figure 1).

'''Example 1B:''' If grandchild ''B1'' had predeceased ''A'', leaving two children ''B1a'' and ''B1b'', and grandchild ''B2'' had also died leaving three children ''B2a'', ''B2b'' and ''B2c'', then distribution ''per stirpes'' would give one-third each to ''C'' and ''D'', one-twelfth each to ''B1a'' and ''B1b'', who would constitute a branch, and one-eighteenth each to ''B2a'', ''B2b'' and ''B2c''. Thus, the ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' branches receive equal shares of the whole estate, the ''B1'' and ''B2'' branches receive equal shares of the ''B'' branch's share, ''B1a'' and ''B1b'' receive equal shares of the ''B1'' branch's share, and ''B2a'', ''B2b'' and ''B2c'' receive equal shares of the ''B2'' branch's share.

==Per capita at each generation==

'''Per capita at each generation''' is an alternative way of distribution, where heirs of the same generation will each receive the same amount. The estate is divided into equal shares at the generation closest to the deceased with surviving heirs. The number of shares is equal to the number of original members either surviving or with surviving descendants. Each surviving heir of that generation gets a share. The remainder is then equally divided among the next-generation descendants of the deceased descendants in the same manner.

'''Example 2A:''' In the first example, children ''C'' and ''D'' survive, so the estate is divided at their generation. There were three children, so each surviving child receives one-third. The remainder - ''B''{{'}}s share - is then divided in the same manner among ''B''{{'}}s surviving descendants. The result is the same as under ''per stirpes'' because ''B''{{'}}s one-third is distributed to ''B1'' and ''B2'' (one-sixth to each).

[[Image:Comparison of per stirpes and per capita inheritance.PNG|thumb|500px|right|Figure 2. Comparison between ''per stirpes'' inheritance and ''per capita by generation'' inheritance. On the left, each branch receives one third of the estate. On the right, ''A''{{'}}s only surviving child, ''C'', receives one third of the estate. The remaining two thirds are divided among the descendants in the next generation.]]

'''Example 2B:''' The ''per capita'' and ''per stirpes'' results would differ if ''D'' also pre-deceased with one child, ''D1'' (figure 2). Under ''per stirpes'', ''B1'' and ''B2'' would each receive one-sixth (half of ''B''{{'}}s one-third share), and ''D1'' would receive one-third (all of ''D''{{'}}s one-third share). Under ''per capita'', the two-thirds remaining after ''C''&amp;nbsp;'s one-third share was taken would be divided equally among all three children of ''B'' and ''D''. (Two-thirds = six ninths) Each would receive two-ninths:  ''B1'', ''B2'', and ''D1'' would all receive two-ninths.

''Notes:''
*To give the effect indicated in these examples the clause should also include a provision that no beneficiary being a grandchild or remoter descendant will take a share if his or her parent is alive and takes a share.
*The spouses of the children (that is, spouses of ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'') are not considered. Spouses are not a part of the branch. Therefore, even if ''B'', ''C'', or ''D'' died leaving a spouse as well as children, all (100%) of the assets pass to the children and (0%) nothing passes to the spouses of ''A''{{'}}s children ''B'', ''C'', and ''D''. From the example above, if ''A''{{'}}s child ''B'' died before ''A''{{'}}s death, ''A''{{'}}s grandchildren ''B1'' and ''B2'' would each receive half of ''B''{{'}}s share. Even if ''B'' had a living spouse at the time of ''A''{{'}}s death, that person would receive nothing from ''A''{{'}}s estate.

==Per capita with representation==
In many U.S. states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], a statute has modified the ''per stirpes'' approach and utilizes instead a '''per capita with representation''' approach (also known as modern American per stirpes).&lt;ref&gt;Wendel 2010, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the per capita with representation approach, the number of branches is determined by reference to the generation nearest the testator which has a surviving descendant. Thus, in the first example, if ''C'' and ''D'' also are already dead, and each left one child, named (respectively and appropriately) ''C1'' and ''D1'', then each of ''B1'', ''B2'', ''C1'' and ''D1'' would receive one quarter of the estate. This method is also utilized in the states of [[Alaska (state)|Alaska]], [[Arizona (state)|Arizona]], [[California (state)|California]], [[Colorado (state)|Colorado]], [[Hawaii (state)|Hawaii]], [[Maine (state)|Maine]], [[Michigan (state)|Michigan]], [[New Jersey (state)|New Jersey]], [[New Mexico (state)|New Mexico]], [[Ohio (state)|Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania (state)|Pennsylvania]], [[Utah (state)|Utah]], and [[West Virginia]].

'''Praskovia Ivanovna Kovalyova-Zhemchugova''' also '''Kovaleva''' or '''Kovalyova''', '''Kovaleva-Zhemchugova''', '''Zhemchugova-Sheremeteva''', and '''Sheremeteva''' or '''Sheremetyeva''' (''Прасковья Ивановна Жемчугова'', ''Ковалёва'', ''Шереметева'') (July 20, 1768 &amp;ndash; February 23, 1803) was a Russian [[serf]] actress and [[soprano]] [[opera]] singer.

== Career ==
Praskovia was one of the best opera singers in eighteenth-century Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Smith. ''The Pearl: A True Tale of Forbidden Love in Catherine the Great's Russia.'' New Haven CT, Yale University Press, 2008, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; She was born into the family of a serf [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]] by the name of Ivan Gorbunov (a.k.a. Kovalyov) probably on the estate of Voshchazhnikovo in the province of [[Yaroslavl]]. Praskovia and her family belonged to the Sheremetevs, one of the richest noble families in Russia at the time. As a young girl she moved with her family to the estate of [[Kuskovo]] outside Moscow. Soon thereafter she was taken from her family to serve as a chambermaid to Princess Martha Dolgorukaya, a relative of her master, Count [[Pyotr Sheremetev]], who lived in the manor house.

Blessed with a fine voice, Praskovia was trained to be a singer in the opera company then being put together by Count Pyotr and his son, [[Nikolai Sheremetev]]. She debuted in 1779 on the stage of the serf theatre at Kuskovo in the role of the servant Gubert in the comic opera ''L'Amitié à l'épreuve'' by [[André Grétry]]. Following her success, Praskovia was given the leading role of Belinda in [[Antonio Sacchini]]'s opera ''La colonie''.  In this 1780 performance the actress for the first time appeared under the stage name Zhemchugova, "The Pearl", (''zhemchug'' means "pearl" in Russian). The other stars of the company were also given new names: Arina "The Sapphire", Fekla "The Turquoise", Tatyana "The Garnet", Nikolai "The Marble", Andrei "The Flint", etc.

After the role of Belinda, Praskovia was promoted to the position of the first actress of the theatre. By the age of 17, she could read and write [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] fluently, played the [[harp]] and [[clavichord]], and was acknowledged by her contemporaries for her operatic and dramatic abilities.

In a career that spanned almost two decades, Praskovia performed in over a dozen operas, including [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]]'s ''[[Le déserteur]]'' and ''Aline, reine de Golconde'', [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]]'s ''L'infante de Zamora'', [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''Le Devin du village'', and [[Piccinni]]'s ''La buona figliuola maritata''.

Her most important role was Eliane in Grétry's opera ''[[Les Mariages samnites]]''. Assuming the part for the first time in 1785, Praskovia sang Eliane for 12 years &amp;mdash; a first in the history of serf theatre. In 1787 Praskovia sang the role of Eliane at Kuskovo for [[Catherine II of Russia|Empress Catherine II]] and her suite. Catherine was so impressed by her performance that she requested to meet Praskovia and later gave her a diamond ring.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Massie. ''Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman.'' New York, Random House, 2011, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1780s, Praskovya became the mistress of Count Nikolai Sheremetev. Nikolai was the impresario of the family serf theater, and he had helped train Praskovia over the years, eventually falling in love with the young star of the troupe. The circumstances surrounding the early years of their relationship, like so much of Praskovia's life, are unknown. After the death of Nikolai's father in 1788, Nikolai and Praskovia set up a private household in a secluded corner of the Kuskovo estate. Their unorthodox relationship soon became the subject of gossip among aristocratic society.

In 1795 Praskovia, Nikolai, and the theatre troupe moved from Kuskovo to [[Ostankino Palace|Ostankino]], a brilliant new palace constructed north of Moscow with a large theatre intended for large-scale operas and immense balls. The year 1795 was marked by the premiere of the opera ''Zelmira and Smeloy, or the Capture of Izmail'' ([[Osip Kozlovsky]], text by [[Pavel Potemkin]]); Praskovia acted in the role of the captive Turkish woman Zelmira). Praskovia performed here for [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], the last king of Poland.

== Later life ==
At the height of the theatre's flowering in the late 1790s Praskovia became ill, possibly with consumption ([[tuberculosis]]), and was forced to retire. In late 1796, Nikolai was appointed to the court of [[Emperor Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and Praskovia moved with him to St. Petersburg.

Although they lived as man and wife, Nikolai and Praskovia had to keep the nature of their relationship secret from polite society. It was taboo for an aristocrat like Sheremetev to move about in society with a serf as his social equal. Finally, in 1798 Sheremetev emancipated Praskova and later the entire Kovalyov family from serfdom. Understanding that her health would not allow her to return to the stage, he closed the theatre.

In 1801 Nikolai and Praskovia married in Moscow in the strictest secrecy. As part of the arrangements, Nikolai had created a phony genealogy for Praskovia claiming that she was the long-lost descendant of a Polish nobleman by the name of Kovalevskii. Around the time of the wedding he sent a forger to Poland with a purse full of money to purchase a patent of nobility from a willing noble family.

Within months of their wedding Praskovia became pregnant. On February 3, 1803 she gave birth to a son, [[Dmitri Sheremetev|Dmitry]], but pregnancy and childbirth destroyed her poor health and she died on February 23 at the Sheremetev palace in St. Petersburg. Just before she died Nikolai informed [[Emperor Alexander I]] of his marriage and requested official recognition, which he granted. News of the marriage scandalized society and angered Nikolai's family. Nikolai's two nephews, the Razumovsky brothers, had planned to inherit their uncle's vast fortune, and upon hearing that they were to lose it all to the son of a serf they contemplated murdering the infant.

Praskovia was buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery attended by clergy and servants from the Sheremetev household. Nikolai was too overcome with grief to attend, and the nobility stayed away to signal its disapproval of Nikolai's marriage.

In memory of Praskovia Nikolai built in Moscow on [[Sukharev Tower|Sukharevskaya square]], a large almshouse that tended to the sick, poor, and orphaned up until the revolution of 1917. Under the Soviets the almshouse was shut down and replaced by a scientific research institute named after [[N. Sklifosovsky]].

==Quotations==
"The love affair between Count Sheremetyev and his serf actress set the rumour mill rolling with the high society really shocked to see the count to be so madly in love with his servant and even preparing to build a theatre for her in his Ostankino estate just north of Moscow. And still, this public criticism of his choice was really playing on the young count's nerves who realised all too clear that the society would never forgive him if he ever married the commoner girl. In the meantime, Praskovya the actress was making strides on stage and her theatre's fortnightly performances always played to a full house." (Lyubov Tsarevskaya Russian Culture).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.ru/culture/cultarch10_eng.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107131331/http://www.vor.ru/culture/cultarch10_eng.html |date=January 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaque on Praskovia's grave reads--

"This plain marble, unfeeling and impermanent,&lt;br&gt;
Hides the priceless remains of a wife and mother.&lt;br&gt;
Her soul was a temple of virtue,&lt;br&gt;
In which peace, piety, and faith resided,&lt;br&gt;
Where pure love and friendship dwellt.&lt;br&gt;
Even in her final hour she remained devoted,&lt;br&gt;
Feeling the full grief of those she was leaving behind.&lt;br&gt;
What is to become of her wretched spouse,&lt;br&gt;
Fated to drag out the rest of his days without his friend?&lt;br&gt;
His heart lives on nothing but barren sighs, wailing, sorrow, and heavy moans.&lt;br&gt;
Yet her death was the path to immortality,&lt;br&gt;
Her innocent spirit is now in God's embrace,&lt;br&gt;
Robed in the radiant cloak of imperishability,&lt;br&gt;
And forever surrounded by the faces of angels.&lt;br&gt;
Fill this dwelling place with righteous blessings,&lt;br&gt;
O God, and lay her pure soul to rest for all eternity."

The '''RepRap Snappy''' is an [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[fused deposition modeling]] [[3D printer]], part of the [[RepRap project]], it is the most self replicating 3D printer in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2015/09/12/the-most-self-replicating-reprap-yet/|title=The Most Self-Replicating RepRap Yet|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-utopian-promise-of-reprap-the-3d-printer-that-can-almost-print-itself|title=The Utopian Promise Of RepRap, the 3D Printer That Can—Almost—Print Itself|date=2016-02-24|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Suicide sidebar}} 
The '''right to die''' is  a concept based on the opinion that a [[human being]] is entitled to [[Suicide|end their own life]] or to undergo [[voluntary euthanasia]]. Possession of this right is often understood to mean that a person with a [[terminal illness]], or without the will to continue living, should be allowed to end their own life or to use [[assisted suicide]] or to decline life-prolonging treatment. The question of whom, if anyone, should be empowered to make this decision is often central to debate.

Some academics and [[philosopher]]s, such as [[David Benatar]], consider humans to be overly optimistic in their view of the quality of their lives, and in their view of the balance between the positive and the negative aspects of living. This can be considered in terms of [[antinatalism]] and the lack of agency regarding one’s own birth and who should have authority over one’s choice to live or die.

Proponents typically associate the right to die with the idea that [[self-ownership|one's body and one's life are one's own]], to dispose of as one sees fit. However, a legitimate [[state interest]] in preventing irrational suicides is sometimes argued. Pilpel and Amsel write: &lt;blockquote&gt;Contemporary proponents of "rational suicide" or the "right to die" usually demand by "rationality" that the decision to kill oneself be both the autonomous choice of the agent (i.e., not due to the physician or the family pressuring them to "do the right thing" and commit suicide) and a "best option under the circumstances" choice desired by the [[Stoicism|stoics]] or [[utilitarian]]s, as well as other natural conditions such as the choice being stable, not an impulsive decision, not due to [[mental illness]], achieved after due deliberation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is Wrong with Rational Suicide|author1=A Pilpel |author2=L Amsel |url=http://www.avitalpilpel.com/uploads/What_is_wrong_with_rational_suicide_April_2010.pdf|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Hinduism]] accepts the right to die for those who are tormented by terminal diseases or those who have no desire, ambition or no responsibilities remaining; and allows death through the non-violent practice of fasting to the point of starvation ([[Prayopavesa]]).&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml|title= Hinduism — Euthanasia and Suicide|date= 2009-08-25|publisher= [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism]] has a similar practice named ''[[Santhara]]''. Other [[religious views on suicide]] vary in their tolerance, and include denial of the right as well as condemnation of the act. In the [[Christian views on suicide#Modern Catholicism|Catholic faith]], suicide is considered a grave sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/knowledge/2007/04-01/do-people-who-commit-suicide-go-to-hell|title=Catholic Digest - The Magazine for Catholic Living - Do people who commit suicide go to hell?|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219215546/http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/knowledge/2007/04-01/do-people-who-commit-suicide-go-to-hell|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
There is a question in ethics as to whether or not a right to die can coexist with a right to life. If, it is argued, the right to life is [[Inalienable right|inalienable]], it cannot be surrendered, and therefore may be incompatible with a right to die.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Joel. (April 1, 1977). "[https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/f/feinberg80.pdf Voluntary Euthanasia and the Inalienable Right to Life]", ''The Tanner Lecture on Human Values'', The University of Michigan. Retrieved June 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; A second debate exists within [[bioethics]] over whether the right to die is universal, only applies under certain circumstances (such as [[terminal illness]]), or if it exists. It is also stated that 'right to live' is not synonymous to 'obligation to live'. From that point of view, the right to live can coexist with the right to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://www.humanistischverbond.nl/beginselverklaring-humanistisch-verbond Humanistisch Verbond: 'Recht op leven, plicht tot leven' (translated: Dutch Humanist Association: 'Right to live, obligation to live')]&lt;/ref&gt;

A court in the American state of [[Montana]], for example, has found that the right to die applies to those with life-threatening medical conditions.  [[Suicide]] advocate [[Ludwig Minelli]], [[euthanasia]] expert Sean W. Asher and bioethics professor Jacob M. Appel, in contrast, argue that ''all'' competent people have a right to end their own lives. Appel has suggested that the right to die is a test for the overall freedom of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/assisted-suicide-for-heal_b_236664.html|title=Next: Assisted Suicide for Healthy People|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 December 2014|date=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1991 [[Patient Self-Determination Act]] passed by the [[US Congress]] at the request of the financial arm of Medicare does permit elderly Medicare/Medicaid patients (and by implication, all "terminal" patients) to prepare an advance directive in which they elect or choose to refuse life-extending and/or life-saving treatments as a means of shortening their lives to shorten their suffering unto certain death.  The treatment refused in an advance directive under US law, because of the 1991 PSDA,  does not have to be proved to be "medically futile" under some existing due-process procedure developed under state laws, such as TADA in Texas.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

As of June 2016, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in [[Canada]],&lt;ref name=canada/&gt; [[Colombia]],&lt;ref name=canada/&gt; [[Belgium]],&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2600923.stm |title=Euthanasia and the law |publisher=BBC News |date=23 December 2002 |first=Ursula |last=Smartt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxembourg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000136#Luxembourg|title=Euthanasia &amp; Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) around the World - Euthanasia - ProCon.org|last=|first=|date=2016-07-20|website=euthanasia.procon.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|Netherlands]],&lt;ref name=law/&gt; and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=law/&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{main|Euthanasia in Canada}}

As of August 2011 a [[British Columbia]] [[B.C. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] judge had been requested to speed up a right-to die lawsuit so that [[Gloria Taylor (patient)|Gloria Taylor]] could have a doctor assist her in committing suicide. She suffered from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/08/02/bc-assisted-suicide-lawsuit.html|title=B.C. court asked to fast-track right-to-die lawsuit|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=14 December 2014|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died of an infection in 2012.

A British Columbia [[civil liberties]] lawsuit is representing six plaintiffs and challenges the laws that make it a criminal offence to assist seriously and incurably ill individuals to die with dignity.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

On 6 February 2015 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that denying the right to assisted suicide is unconstitutional. The court’s ruling limits physician-assisted suicides to “a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of life and has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease or disability, that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.” The ruling was suspended for 12 months to allow the Canadian parliament to draft a new, constitutional law to replace the existing one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-on-doctor-assisted-suicide/article22828437/ Supreme Court rules Canadians have right to doctor-assisted suicide] Sean Fine, Globe and Mail 6 Feb. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The court decision includes a requirement that there must be stringent limits that are “scrupulously monitored.” This will require the death certificate to be completed  by an independent medical examiner, not the treating physician, to ensure the accuracy of reporting the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/assisted-dying-four-problems-one-simple-solution/article27924838/|title=Assisted dying: Four problems, one simple solution|last=Guichon, Alakija, Doig, Mitchell and Thibeault|first=|date=28 December 2015|newspaper=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto, Canada|access-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Medical Association]] (CMA) reported that not all doctors were willing to help a patient die. However, the belief in late 2015 was that no physician would be forced to do so but the CMA was offering educational sessions to members as to the process that would be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canadian-doctors-express-mixed-opinions-on-assisted-dying-1.2715008|title=Canadian doctors express mixed opinions on assisted dying|last=|first=|date=27 December 2015|website=CTV News|publisher=Bell Media|access-date=2 January 2016|author=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2016, legislation passed both houses of the [[Parliament of Canada]] and received [[Royal Assent]] to allow euthanasia within Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.her.ie/news/canada-legalises-euthanasia-for-the-terminally-ill/298541 |title=Canada legalises euthanasia for the terminally ill|last=Keane|first=Rebecca|date=20 June 2016 |website=Her.ie |publisher=Maximum Media; Dublin, Ireland |access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/17/senate-votes-not-to-send-assisted-dying-bill-back-to-mps.html |title=Assisted dying to become law after Senate backs Liberals' bill |last=MacCharles |first=Tonda |date=17 June 2016 |website=thestar.com |publisher=Toronto Star |access-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
On 20 May 1997, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that "the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient" and urged [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]] to regulate [[voluntary euthanasia| euthanasia]] "in the shortest time possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dmd.org.co/pdf/sentencia-c-239.pdf|title= REPÚBLICA DE COLOMBIA Corte Constitucional Sentencia No. C-239/97 |author=[[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] |date=20 May 1997 |access-date=24 November 2016}} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the [[Ministry of Health and Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Health and Social Protection]] 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/vivir/los-principios-regular-eutanasia-articulo-544675|title=Los principios para regular la eutanasia|publisher=ElEspectador.com|date=19 February 2015|author=Redacción Salud|language=sp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
{{main|Euthanasia in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] legalized [[voluntary euthanasia]] in 2001 and is one of the few countries in the world to have done so. Under current Dutch law, euthanasia by doctors is only legal in cases of ''"hopeless and unbearable"'' suffering. In practice this means that it is limited to those suffering from serious medical conditions (including mental illness) and in considerable suffering like pain, hypoxia or exhaustion. Helping somebody to commit suicide without meeting the qualifications of the current Dutch euthanasia law is illegal.&lt;ref name="Buiting-2009"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Buiting H, van Delden J, Onwuteaka-Philpsen B, etal |title=Reporting of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands: descriptive study |journal=BMC Med Ethics |volume=10 |issue= |pages=18 |year=2009 |pmid=19860873 |pmc=2781018 |doi=10.1186/1472-6939-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life.&lt;ref name="Buiting-2009"/&gt;

In February 2010 a citizens' initiative called ''Uit Vrije Wil'' (Out of Free Will) further demanded that all Dutch people over 70 who feel tired of life should have the right to professional help in ending it. The organization, initiated by Milly van Stiphout and Yvonne van Baarle, started collecting signatures in support of this proposed change in Dutch legislation. A number of prominent Dutch citizens supported the initiative, including former ministers and artists, legal scholars and physicians. Among them were former politicians [[Frits Bolkestein]], [[Hedy d'Ancona]] and [[Jan Terlouw]], as well as television personality [[Mies Bouwman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2478619.ece/Citizens_group_argues_right_to_die|title=Citizens group argues 'right to die'|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/right-die-elderly-back-centre-dutch-debate|title='Right to die' for elderly back at centre of Dutch debate|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182919/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/right-die-elderly-back-centre-dutch-debate|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/224/BINNENLAND/article/detail/278678/2010/02/09/70-plus-eist-zachte-dood.dhtml|title=70-plus eist zachte dood|publisher=[[Het Parool]]|date=2007-02-10|author=Frans Bosman en Corrie Verkerk|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative has never been legalised.

===New Zealand===
{{main|Euthanasia in New Zealand}}
Euthanasia is illegal in New Zealand.  In 2015, lawyer and cancer sufferer [[Lecretia Seales]] brought a case ([[Seales v Attorney-General]]) to the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] to challenge [[New Zealand law]] for her right to die with the assistance of her GP, asking for a declaration that her GP would not risk conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lecretia Seales: Lawyer with cancer embarks on challenge to New Zealand's euthanasia laws|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-10/new-zealand-lawyer-embarks-on-euthanasia-legal-challenge/6385148|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/274807/judge-thanks-woman-for-right-to-die-case |title=Judge thanks woman for right-to-die case |access-date=5 June 2015|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{main|Euthanasia in the United States}}

The term ''right to die'' has been interpreted in a number of ways, including issues of suicide, passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, assisted suicide, and physician-assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-14/35-right-to-die.html&lt;/ref&gt; As the health of citizens is considered a police power left for individual states to regulate, it was not until 1997 that the US Supreme Court made a ruling on the issue of assisted suicide and one's right to die. That year, the Supreme Court heard two appeals arguing that New York and Washington statutes that made physician assisted suicide a felony violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10644975876581235704&amp;q=vacco+v.+quill&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000006&lt;/ref&gt; In a unanimous vote, the Court held that there was no constitutional right to physician assisted suicide and upheld state bans on assisted suicide. While in New York this has maintained statutes banning physician assisted suicide, the Court's decision also left it open for other states to decide whether they would allow physician assisted suicide or not.

Since 1994, five states in the US have passed assisted suicide laws: Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California, and Colorado passed legislation in 1994, 2008, 2013, 2015, and 2016, respectively, that provides a protocol for the practice of physician assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3551560/brittany-maynard-right-to-die-laws/ | work=Time | first=Emily | last=Barone | title=See Which States Allow Assisted Suicide | date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law in these five states allows terminally ill adult patients to seek lethal medication from their physicians. In 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that nothing in state law prohibits physician-assisted suicide and provides legal protection for physicians in the case that they write a prescription for lethal medication upon patient request.  In California, the governor signed a controversial physician assisted-suicide bill, the [[California End of Life Option Act]], in October 2015 that passed during a special legislative session intended to address Medi-Cal funding,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.ca.gov/docs/6.16.15_Health_Care_Special_Session.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; after it had been defeated during the regular legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article33269166.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because the bill was passed during a special session, it did not take effect until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-end-of-life-option-act-qa-20160511-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article37818555.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/19/nation/la-na-new-mexico-aid-dying-20140120 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Saba | last=Hamedy | title=New Mexico judge affirms right to 'aid in dying' | date=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate decision will be made with the outcome of New Mexico's Attorney General's appeal to the ruling.
=== India ===
{{main|Euthanasia in India}}

Since 2018, the Supreme Court of India has legalised passive euthanasia in India during a case involving [[Aruna Shanbaug]] under strict conditions, namely that the patient's consent (or relatives) is needed, and that he/she must be in a terminally ill or vegetative state.

'''Roy Kelton Orbison''' (April 23, 1936&amp;nbsp;– December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician known for his powerful voice, wide vocal range, impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. The combination led many critics to describe his music as [[operatic]], nicknaming him "the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]"&lt;ref name="amburn97"&gt;Amburn, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the Big O". While most male [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead conveyed vulnerability. His voice ranged from [[baritone]] to [[tenor]], and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Terence J. |date=February 2000 |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-02294.html |title=Orbison, Roy |website=American National Biography |url-access=subscription |access-date=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During performances, he was known for standing still and solitary, and for wearing black clothes, to match his dyed jet-black hair and dark sunglasses, which lent an air of mystery to his persona.

Born in Texas, Orbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]], of [[Sun Records]], in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including "[[Only the Lonely]]" (1960), "[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]" (1961), "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" (1961), "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" (1963), and "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" (1964). Soon afterward, Orbison was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined. In the 1980s, he experienced a resurgence in popularity through the success of several [[cover version]]s of his songs, and in 1988, co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. He died of a heart attack later that year, at the age of 52. One month later, his song "[[You Got It]]" (1989), co-written with Lynne and Petty, was released as a solo single and became his first to break the U.S. Top 10 in 25 years.

His honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the "Greatest Artists of All Time" and number 13 on their list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 27, 2008 |via=Rolling Stone website |access-date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2002|p=524}}

==Early life==

Roy Kelton Orbison was born in [[Vernon, Texas]], the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 – May 28, 1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nurse. Both of his parents were unemployed during the [[Great Depression]], and searching for work, moved the family to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1942. He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon. Later, in 1946, they moved to [[Wink, Texas]]. Orbison later described life in Wink as "football, oil fields, oil, grease, and sand"&lt;ref name="escott"&gt;Escott, Colin (1990). Biographical insert with ''The Legendary Roy Orbison'' CD box set. Sony. ASIN: B0000027E2.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town.{{efn|Ellis Amburn argues that Orbison was bullied and ostracized while in Wink and that after he became famous, he gave conflicting reports to local Texas newspapers, claiming it was still home to him while simultaneously maligning the town to ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 11–20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Pond&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/roy-orbison-1936-1988-19890126 | title=Roy Orbison's Triumphs and Tragedies | website=Rolling Stone | date=January 26, 1989 | accessdate=August 15, 2014 |last=Pond |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the Orbison children were afflicted with poor eyesight; Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age. He was not confident about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He was quiet, self-effacing, and remarkably polite and obliging—a product, biographer Alan Clayson wrote, of his Southern upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was readily available to sing, however, and often became the focus of attention when he did. He considered his voice memorable, if not great.&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt;

On Roy's sixth birthday, his father gave him a guitar. He later recalled that by the age of seven, "I was finished, you know, for anything else"; music would be his life.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; (When he later joined the British-American supergroup the [[Traveling Wilburys]], he adopted the name “Lefty” Wilbury). He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], who was playing on the back of a flatbed truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to many forms of music: "sepia" (a euphemism for [[rhythm and blues]]), [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and [[cajun]]. The cajun favorite "[[Jole Blon]]" was one of the first songs he sang in public. At the age of eight, he began singing on a local radio show. By the late 1940s, he was the show's host.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 8, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, Orbison and some friends formed a band, the Wink Westerners. They played country standards and [[Glenn Miller]] songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on [[KERB (AM)|KERB]] in [[Kermit, Texas|Kermit]].&lt;ref name="royorb1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |title=History Maker |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401175007/http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |website=The Official Roy Orbison Site |access-date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they were offered $400 to play at a dance, Orbison realized that he could make a living in music. After graduating from [[Wink High School]], he enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison heard that his North Texas State schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, which further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. While at North Texas State College, Roy heard a song called "Ooby Dooby", composed by [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore in mere minutes atop a fraternity house at the college, and after his first year of college, he returned to Wink with "Ooby Dooby" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Orbison moved to [[Odessa, Texas]], and enrolled in [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College]]. As two members of the band quit, one to attend school elsewhere and one to join the Navy, two new members were added to the group,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} who won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.

While living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by [[Elvis Presley]], who was only a year older and a rising star.{{efn|Orbison later said that he "couldn't overemphasize how shocking [Presley] looked and seemed to [him] that night".&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Johnny Cash]] toured the area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records, the home of rockabilly artists Presley, [[Carl Perkins]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (in late 1956), and Cash. Orbison telephoned Phillips and during their conversation was curtly told, "Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!"{{efn|Both Orbison and Cash mentioned this anecdote years later, but Phillips denied that he was so abrupt on the phone with Orbison or that he hung up on him. One of the Teen Kings later stated that the band did not meet Cash until they were on tour with him and other Sun Records artists.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The success of their KMID television show got them another show on KOSA-TV, and they changed their name to the Teen Kings,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} as they were appealing more and more to a younger audience.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Due to the initial rejection from Sam Phillips, the Teen Kings recorded "Ooby Dooby" for the Odessa-based [[Je–Wel]] label.&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; According to the official Roy Orbison discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=245}} this was the first release by Orbison in March 1956. Phillips was impressed with the song, after the local record store owner Poppa Holifield played it for him over the telephone, and offered the Teen Kings a contract in 1956.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}}

The Teen Kings went to [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where Phillips wanted to record "Ooby Dooby" again, in his studio. The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing "everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record".&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including "[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]" and "Rockhouse". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips's home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; A ballad Orbison wrote, "The Clown", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbison had some success at Sun Records, however, and was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote "Claudette"—about Claudette Frady whom he married in 1957—and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it for their subsequent release as the B-side of their smash hit "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; after touring with [[Patsy Cline]],{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=72}} [[Eddie Cochran]], and [[Gene Vincent]]. 

For a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was "Seems to Me", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of "a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then—softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him."&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing shows late into the night and living with his wife and young child in his tiny apartment, Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to try to write some songs together.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]], with Atkins producing, but only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA;&lt;ref name="Zak, p. 32."&gt;Zak, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].

Orbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the "[[Nashville sound]]", doing so with a group of session musicians known as the [[The Nashville A-Team|A-Team]]: guitarists [[Grady Martin]], [[Harold Bradley]], [[Fred Carter, Jr.]], and Ray Edenton; bassist [[Bob Moore]]; pianists [[Floyd Cramer]] or [[Hargus "Pig" Robbins]]; drummer [[Buddy Harman]]; and backup vocals by [[the Jordanaires]] or the [[Anita Kerr|Anita Kerr Singers]]. The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, "Paper Boy", backed by "With the Bug", but neither charted.&lt;ref name="Zak, p. 33."&gt;Zak, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], who experimented with [[Microphone practice|close miking]] the [[doo-wop]] backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a "polished, professional sound&amp;nbsp;... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein".&lt;ref name="Zak, p. 32."/&gt; To augment the Nashville sound, Orbison requested a string section in the studio. With this combination, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was "Uptown", written with Joe Melson.&lt;ref name="Lehman, p. 48."&gt;Lehman, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, "We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world."&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville "brought a new splendor to rock", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].&lt;ref name=decurtis155&gt;DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Uptown" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Elvis Presley was serving in the US Army, [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] had become disgraced after marrying his 13-year-old cousin, and [[Buddy Holly]] had died in a plane crash. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top-10 hits===
====1960–62====

Experimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from "Uptown", and another song they had written called "Come Back to Me (My Love)", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.&lt;ref name="Zak, p. 35."&gt;Zak, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, "came not from his throat but deeper within".&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The song was "[[Only the Lonely]]". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.&lt;ref name="Lehman, p. 48."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fremer&gt;{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter – Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.&lt;ref name="Zak, p. 35."/&gt;

"Only the Lonely" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, "I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of "Ooby Dooby" and "Only the Lonely", it kind of turned into a good voice."&lt;ref name="rockhall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard "Only the Lonely" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.&lt;ref name="amburn98"&gt;Amburn, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex "Blue Angel", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. "I'm Hurtin'", with "I Can't Stop Loving You" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}

Orbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of "Only the Lonely" and "I'm Hurtin'", Orbison worked on a new song, "[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Boléro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.&lt;ref name=decurtis155/&gt; On that third take, "Running Scared" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, "He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before."&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; Just weeks later "Running Scared" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected "Running Scared": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}

"Crying" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&amp;B song, "Candy Man", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as "The Big O", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with "[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer would later form [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970, while releasing a few singles and two albums of their own). Also in 1962, he charted with "The Crowd", "Leah", and "Workin' for the Man", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2002|p=524}}&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1963–64====
[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he "wasn't trying to be weird ...  I didn't have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything, but the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really."&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Orbison eventually developed a persona and an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an "anonymous celebrity".&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume that the stationary performer was blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Fontenot |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/a/oldiesmyths.htm |title=Top 10 Oldies Myths: Urban Legends and Other Misperceptions about Early Rock and Roll: 2.

His string of top-40 hits continued with "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" (US number seven, UK number six), "Falling" (US number 22, UK number 9), and "[[Mean Woman Blues]]" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with "[[Blue Bayou]]" (US number 29, UK number three).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2002|p=524}}&lt;ref name="britishhits"&gt;Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=249}} a rare alternate version of "Blue Bayou" was released only in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], "[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).

As "In Dreams" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace the guitarist [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]], whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of them, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, "What's a Beatle, anyway?" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, "I am".&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]] stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores.&lt;ref name="clayson109-113"&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 109–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, when the audience began chanting "We want Roy!" again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Starr later said, "In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything."&lt;ref name="clayson109-113"/&gt; Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.

Touring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette began having an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to tour, traveling to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, "a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was."&lt;ref name="amburn134"&gt;Amburn, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen

|description=The opening guitar riff of "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" was a direct influence on "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Orbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote "[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, "A pretty woman never needs any money".&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Just 40 minutes later, "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic."&lt;ref name="amburn128"&gt;Amburn, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1965–69: Career decline and tragedies==
[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]
Following "Oh, Pretty Woman", Orbison endured some upheavals.  Claudette and he divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but the two reconciled 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) (though in Europe he remained with [[Decca Records|Decca's]] [[London Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9986 |title=Roy Orbison - Ride Away / Wondering - London - UK - HLU 9986 |website=45cat |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for $1 million, and the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, would dedicate time to seeing up to three films a day.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.&lt;ref name="Zak, p. 33."/&gt; Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964–65, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

While on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}

Orbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a large collection of cars by the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Orbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, "I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time", with—according to biographer Colin Escott—"zero conviction".&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

He recorded an album dedicated to the songs of [[Don Gibson]] and another of [[Hank Williams]] covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: "[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again."&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During a tour of England and playing [[Bournemouth]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it. On March 25, 1969, Orbison married German teenager [[Barbara Orbison|Barbara Jakobs]], whom he had met several days before his sons' deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents. Orbison and Barbara had a son ([[Roy Orbison Jr.|Roy Kelton]]) in 1970 and another ([[Alex Orbison|Alexander]]) in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s–80s==
===Struggles===
Orbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but none of them sold more than a handful of copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: "Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone."&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of "[[Love Hurts]]", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by [[Hard Rock music|hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[blues]] adept [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]] sent "Only the Lonely" to No. 1 on the country music charts.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of "Dream Baby". 

A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered "[[Blue Bayou]]" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded "[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.

In late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in [[Hawaii]]. While there, he checked into a hospital where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]]. He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1980, [[Don McLean]] charted with "Crying"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like [[Bulgaria]] for example in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet "That Lovin' You Feelin' Again" (from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of "Oh, Pretty Woman" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's legacy.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}

=== Career revival ===

[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|left|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]

Orbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of "In Dreams" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was "Crying"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}}); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by  [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Amburn, p. 193"&gt;Amburn, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, "I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&amp;nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&amp;nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'."&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt;

By 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. A song he recorded, "Life Fades Away", written with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]], was featured in the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of "Crying" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film, ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987), winning a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].&lt;ref name="grammy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=GRAMMY Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison."&lt;ref name="clayson202-203"&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt "validated" by the honor.&lt;ref name="clayson202-203"/&gt; A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional."&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===

It was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; By that evening, the group had written "[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the [[Traveling Wilburys]], representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself "Lefty Wilbury" after Lefty Frizzell.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: "Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister."&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynne later spoke of the recording sessions: "Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time."&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison was given one solo track, "[[Not Alone Any More]]", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].&lt;ref name="grammy"/&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.

''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elvis Costello]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was "[[You Got It]]", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2002|p=524}}&lt;ref name="britishhits"/&gt;

In 2014, a demo of Orbison's "The Way Is Love" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of ''Mystery Girl''. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by [[John Carter Cash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the video for the Wilburys' "Handle with Care" was filmed with Orbison, the video for "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" was filmed and released posthumously. During Orbison's vocal parts in "End of the Line", the video shows a guitar in a rocking chair, next to Orbison's framed photo.

Orbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom, but he expressed amazement at his success: "It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it."&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, as well as the newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.&lt;ref name=Pond/&gt; In November 1988, ''Mystery Girl'' was completed, and ''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains and said he would have to do something about his health, but he never did. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for "You Got It" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in [[Boston]] was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbison performed at the Front Row Theater in [[Highland Heights, Ohio]], on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, he spent the day flying [[model aircraft|model airplanes]] with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville. Later that day, he died of a [[heart attack]], at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tabloid ''[[National Enquirer]]'' suggested on its cover that Orbison had worked himself to death. A memorial was held in Nashville, and another in Los Angeles. He was buried at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, pp. 233–235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|1463}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an unmarked grave. On April 8, 1989, Orbison became the first deceased musician since [[Elvis Presley]] to have two albums in the US Top Five at the same time, with the Traveling Wilburys album at number 4 and his own ''Mystery Girl'' at number 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1989/BB-1989-04-08.pdf |date=April 8, 1989 |magazine=Billboard |title=Top Pop Albums |page=80 |volume=101 |issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, he achieved even greater posthumous success, with two solo albums in the Top 3 in the chart dated February 11, 1989, ''Mystery Girl'' at number 2 and the compilation ''The Legendary Roy Orbison'' at number 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19890205/7502/ |title=Official Albums Chart Top 75: 05 February 1989 - 11 February 1989 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbison is regarded as a rock-and-roll pioneer and has been cited by numerous critics as one of the genre's most influential musicians, but his style is notable for how it departed from the norm.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving [[beat (music)|backbeat]], heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, "He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth."&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison’s sons to administer their father’s catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018 release of "Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra" album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called"In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songwriting===
====Structures====

Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions "define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music".&lt;ref name="Lehman, p. 20"&gt;Lehman, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, "He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity".&lt;ref name="watrous"&gt;Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). "Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[thirty-two-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like "Ooby Dooby" and "Claudette". Orbison's "In Dreams" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In "Running Scared", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. "Crying" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before "Only the Lonely", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:&lt;ref name="nswhof"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way....So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes...But that's always after the fact—as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me." | Roy Orbison}}

[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made "radical left turns", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of "Running Scared" eventually depends on the final note, one word.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, "Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you."&lt;ref name="amburn128"/&gt;

====Themes====

Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as "Go! Go! Go!" and "Mean Woman Blues" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: "Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy—try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention."&lt;ref name="escott"/&gt; After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are "dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces".&lt;ref name="watrous"/&gt; Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the "apocalyptic romanticism" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was "so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia", striking "a postmodern nerve".&lt;ref&gt;DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&amp;B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: "The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically."&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt;

The loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&amp;nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely."&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt; His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it."&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt; Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: "When ["Crying"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry."&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt; Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual [[Sadomasochism|masochism]].&lt;ref name="Lehman, p. 20"/&gt;

===Voice quality===

{{Quote box
 | width = 30%
 | quote = "What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time. All his vocal gymnastics were just a means to a powerful end, not a mission unto themselves. Roy Orbison didn't just sing beautifully—he sang brokenheartedly."
| source = —[[Stephen Thompson (producer)|Stephen Thompson]], [[NPR]]&lt;ref name="NPRsongswelove"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/28/135734524/roy-orbison-songs-we-love?sc=fb&amp;cc=fp |title=Roy Orbison: Songs We Love |author=NPR staff |date=April 27, 2011 |access-date=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Orbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until "Only the Lonely" in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its "flowering".&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Jeanette MacDonald]] standard "[[Indian Love Call]]", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to the Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with "a passionate intensity" that, according to ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', made "his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an end—not with a whimper, but an agonized, beautiful bang".&lt;ref name=decurtis155/&gt;

Bruce Springsteen and [[Billy Joel]] both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison's voice. [[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like "the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window".&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard "Crying" for the first time, "That was it. To me that was the voice of God."&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Hall, Mark. (director) ''In Dreams: The Roy Orbison Story'', Nashmount Productions Inc., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Elvis Presley stated his voice was the greatest and most distinctive he &lt;!--check who 'they' are---&gt; had ever heard.&lt;ref name="amburn175_193"&gt;Amburn, pp. 175, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison's music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter [[Will Jennings]], among others.{{sfn|Lehman|p=21}} Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s: {{cquote|With Roy, you didn't know if you were listening to mariachi or opera. He kept you on your toes. With him, it was all about fat and blood. He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop. [After "Ooby Dooby"] he was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff. He sang like a professional criminal&amp;nbsp;... His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, 'Man, I don't believe it'.&lt;ref name="dylan33"&gt;Dylan, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with "Crying" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: "The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation."&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, "Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it."&lt;ref&gt;Scheff, Jerry (2012). ''Way Down: Playing Bass with Elvis, Dylan, the Doors &amp; More.'' Backbeat Books. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.&lt;ref name="Lehman, p. 24"&gt;Lehman, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.

===Performance===
[[File:Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|250 px|Orbison, center (in white), performing in 1976]]
Orbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like "Mean Woman Blues" did offer that.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like [[Chubby Checker]] or [[Bobby Rydell]] in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them."&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, Alan, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lang, k. d. |date=April 15, 2004 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |title=The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: 37) Roy Orbison |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 2, 2009 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506004850/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |archive-date=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by [[John Belushi]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing "Oh, Pretty Woman", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again.&lt;ref name="Lehman, p. 24"/&gt; However, Lang quantified this style by saying, "It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there."&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt;

Orbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time."&lt;ref&gt;Amburn, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Rudolph Schildkraut '''(27 April 1862 – 15 July 1930) was an Austrian [[actor|film]] and [[theatre actor]].

== Life and career ==
Schildkraut was born in [[Constantinople]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]], to a [[Judaism|Jewish]] family. His parents ran a [[hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, Joel (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aVScEpo6CS4C&amp;pg=PA184 Shakespeare on the American Yiddish Stage]''. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press. {{ISBN|0877458006}}. p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Brăila]], [[Romania]]. In [[Vienna]], he received acting lessons from Friedrich Mitterwurzer. He debuted in the early 1880s in [[Sopron]]; his first solid role came in 1885 in [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]].

In 1893 he moved to [[Vienna]] to an engagement at the newly opened [[Raimund Theater]]. In 1898 he moved to the Carl Theatre. Among other things, he played the character Wurm in'' [[Love and Intrigue]]''. In 1900 he came to the German Theatre in [[Hamburg]], 1905 to the German Theatre in [[Berlin]]. There he became one of the most important actors in the theatre company of [[Max Reinhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Performance to Touch the Heart|last=Edmonds|first=Richard|date=September 22, 2000|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|page=16|quote=Shylock was played by Rudolph Schildkraut, and his portrait in the famous Max Reinhardt production hung in the Deutsches Theater in Berlin until Goebbels personally had it burned. }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Shylock]], which he played in 1905 and 1913, in Reinhardt's productions of'' [[The Merchant of Venice]]'', was praised by [[Fritz Kortner]] as a "monument to the art of acting." Other major roles were the title role in ''[[King Lear]]'' (1908), [[Mephistopheles|Mephisto]] in ''[[Faust I]]'' (1909), Muley Hassan in [[Friedrich Schiller|Friedrich Schiller's]] ''[[Fiesco (play)|Fiesco]]'' (1909), the [[grave-digger]] in'' [[Hamlet]]'' (1909), and Peter Bast in [[Knut Hamsun]]'s'' From the Devil Fetched'' (1914). Schildkraut performed for the first time in the United States in 1910-11.

Schildkraut was known as a film actor in the [[German Empire]] in the early silent era. He starred in several [[Drama film|film dramas]]. His last European-made film was a biography of the German [[Zionism]] founder [[Theodor Herzl]], in which he played Herb Schildt "The Struggling Israel." In 1920 he moved permanently to the United States and made his debut the same year in [[New York City|New York]] in the play ''Silent Forces''. From 1922 he also played in the English language. In 1925 he founded his own Jewish theatre in [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joseph Green: 'I Knew Exactly What I Wanted'|last=Edelman|first=Rob|date=January 10, 2003|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|quote=First, I became an actor with Rudolph Schildkraut's acting company in the Bronx. He and his son Joseph were soon engaged in Hollywood to play in [Cecil B.] DeMille's "King of Kings."|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last five years he appeared in several Hollywood productions. His most notable film, which raised his profile in America, was ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] (1927), in which he played the High Priest [[Caiaphas]].

He was married to Erna (Weinstein), with whom he had a son, [[Joseph Schildkraut]] (1896–1964), who was also known as an actor.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;

Schildkraut died at the age of 67 years of a [[heart attack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1930/07/16/archive/rudolph-schildkraut-noted-jewish-actor-dies-at-70|title=Rudolph Schildkraut, Noted Jewish Actor, Dies at 70|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working a film studio, in [[Los Angeles]]. He is interred in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], California. His son also died at the same age, also of a heart attack.

'''Saint Abundantia''' (died 804) was a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]]. Her [[feast day]] is 19 January.

==Life==
She was born at [[Spoleto]], and was educated by [[Majolus of Cluny]]. She later made a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Jerusalem]] with her mother. She would go on to spend five years in the cave of [[Onuphrius]] in the desert of [[Upper Egypt]].

She is said to have cultivated devotion in honor of [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]].

She returned to Spoleto, where she died in 804.

The story of her life has been challenged, and is considered by at least some as unreliable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3011">'''Spike-triggered covariance (STC)''' analysis is a tool for characterizing a neuron's response properties using the [[covariance]] of stimuli that elicit spikes from a neuron.  STC is related to the [[spike-triggered average]] (STA), and provides a complementary tool for estimating linear filters in a [[linear-nonlinear-Poisson cascade model|linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP)]] cascade model.  Unlike STA, the STC can be used to identify a multi-dimensional feature space in which a neuron computes its response.

STC analysis identifies the stimulus features affecting a neuron's response via an eigenvector decomposition of the spike-triggered [[covariance matrix]].&lt;ref name="brenner00"&gt;Brenner, N., Bialek, W., &amp; de Ruyter van Steveninck, R.R. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Schwartz, O., Chichilnisky, E. J., &amp; Simoncelli, E. P. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bialek05"&gt;
Bialek, W. &amp; de Ruyter van Steveninck, R. (2005). Arxiv preprint q-bio/0505003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schwartz06"&gt;Schwartz O., Pillow J. W., Rust N. C., &amp; Simoncelli E. P. (2006).  Spike-triggered neural characterization.  ''Journal of Vision'' 6:484-507&lt;/ref&gt; Eigenvectors with eigenvalues significantly larger or smaller than the eigenvalues of the raw stimulus covariance correspond to stimulus axes along which the neural response is enhanced or suppressed.

STC analysis is similar to [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), although it differs in that the eigenvectors corresponding to largest ''and'' smallest eigenvalues are used for identifying the feature space.  The STC matrix is also known as the 2nd-order [[Volterra Series|Volterra]] or [[Wiener series|Wiener kernel]].

== Mathematical definition ==

===Standard STC===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i}&lt;/math&gt; denote the spatio-temporal stimulus vector preceding the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th time bin, and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; the spike count in that bin.  The stimuli can be assumed to have zero mean (i.e., &lt;math&gt;E[\mathbf{x}]=0&lt;/math&gt;).  If not, it can be transformed to have zero-mean by subtracting the mean stimulus from each vector.  The spike-triggered covariance (STC) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{STC} = \frac{1}{n_{s}-1}\sum_{i=1}^T y_i (\mathbf{x_i}-STA)(\mathbf{x_i}-STA)^T,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_s = \sum y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of spikes, and STA is the [[spike-triggered average]].
The covariance of the stimulus is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C} = \frac 1 {n_p-1}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{x_i}\mathbf{x_i^T},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; is the number of stimuli &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i}&lt;/math&gt; used during the experiment. The eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;(STC-C)&lt;/math&gt; associated to significantly positive eigenvalues correspond to excitatory vectors, whereas eigenvectors associated to significantly negative eigenvalues are inhibitory eigenvectors.&lt;ref name="schwartz06"/&gt;

[[File:Spiral image 17.jpg|thumb|The spiral shares the global (blue) and intensive (red) behavior.]]
The '''spiral optimization (SPO) algorithm''' is an uncomplicated search concept inspired by spiral phenomena in nature. 
The first SPO algorithm was proposed for two-dimensional unconstrained optimization 
&lt;ref name=tamura11a /&gt;
based on two-dimensional spiral models. This was extended to n-dimensional problems by generalizing the two-dimensional spiral model to an n-dimensional spiral model.&lt;ref name=tamura11b /&gt;
There are effective settings for the SPO algorithm: the periodic descent direction setting 
&lt;ref name=tamura16a /&gt;
and the convergence setting 
.&lt;ref name=tamura17a /&gt;

== Metaphor ==
The motivation for focusing on [[spiral]] phenomena was due to the insight that the dynamics that generate logarithmic spirals share the diversification and intensification behavior. The diversification behavior can work for a global search (exploration) and the intensification behavior enables an intensive search around a current found good solution (exploitation).

== Algorithm ==
[[File:spo_movie4.gif|thumb|Spiral Optimization (SPO) algorithm]]
The SPO algorithm is a multipoint search algorithm that has no objective function gradient, which uses multiple spiral models that can be described as deterministic dynamical systems. As search points follow logarithmic 
spiral trajectories towards the common center, defined as the current best point, better solutions can be found and the common center can be updated.
The general SPO algorithm for a minimization problem under the maximum iteration &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; (termination criterion) is as follows:

 0) Set the number of search points &lt;math&gt;m\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum iteration number &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;.
 1) Place the initial search points &lt;math&gt;x_i (0) \in \mathbb{R}^n~(i=1, \ldots, m)&lt;/math&gt; and determine the center &lt;math&gt; x^{\star}(0)= x_{i_\text{b} }(0) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i_\text{b} =\mathop{\text{argmin}}_{i=1,\ldots,m} \{ f(x_{i}(0)) \} &lt;/math&gt;,and then set &lt;math&gt; k = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
 2) Decide the step rate &lt;math&gt;r(k)&lt;/math&gt; by a rule.
 3) Update the search points: &lt;math&gt; x_i(k+1) = x^{\star}(k) + r(k) R(\theta) (x_i(k) - x^{\star}(k))\quad(i=1, \ldots, m).&lt;/math&gt;
 4) Update the center: &lt;math&gt;
x^{\star}(k+1) =
\begin{cases}
x_{i_\text{b}}(k+1) &amp; \big( \text{if } f(x_{i_\text{b}}(k+1)) &lt; f(x^{\star}(k)) \big),\\
x^{\star}(k) &amp; \big(\text{otherwise} \big),
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i_\text{b} = \mathop{\text{argmin}}_{i=1,\ldots,m} \{ f(x_i (k+1)) \} &lt;/math&gt;.
 5) Set &lt;math&gt;k := k+1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;k=k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied then terminate and output &lt;math&gt;x^{\star}(k)&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, return to Step 2).

== Setting ==
The search performance depends on setting the composite rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, the step rate &lt;math&gt;r(k)&lt;/math&gt;, and the initial points &lt;math&gt;x_i(0)~(i=1,\ldots,m)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The following settings are new and effective.

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Setting 1 (Periodic Descent Direction Setting)
&lt;ref name=tamura16a /&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This setting is an effective setting for high dimensional problems under the maximum iteration &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;. The conditions on &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i(0)~(i=1,\ldots,m)&lt;/math&gt; together ensure that the spiral models generate descent directions periodically. The condition of &lt;math&gt;r(k)&lt;/math&gt; works to utilize the periodic descent directions under the search termination &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Set &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; as follows:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
0_{n-1}^\top &amp;-1\\
I_{n-1}&amp; 0_{n-1}\\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;I_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)\times (n-1)&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix and &lt;math&gt;0_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)\times 1&lt;/math&gt; zero vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the initial points &lt;math&gt;x_i(0) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(i = 1,\ldots, m)&lt;/math&gt; at random to satisfy the following condition:
&lt;math&gt;
\min_{i=1,\ldots,m} \{ \max_{j=1,\ldots,m} \bigl \{ \text{rank} \bigl[ d_{j,i}(0)~R(\theta)d_{j,i}(0)~~
\cdots~~R(\theta)^{2n-1}d_{j,i}(0) \bigr]\bigr\} \bigr\} = n 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d_{j,i}(0) = x_{j}(0) - x_i(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this condition is almost all satisfied by a random placing and thus no check is actually fine.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Set &lt;math&gt;r(k)&lt;/math&gt; at Step 2) as follows:&lt;math&gt;r(k) = r = \sqrt[ k_{\max} ]{\delta }~~~~\text{(constant value)}&lt;/math&gt; where a sufficiently small &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;\delta = 1/k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta = 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Setting 2 (Convergence Setting)
&lt;ref name=tamura17a /&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
This setting ensures that the SPO algorithm converges to a stationary point under the maximum iteration &lt;math&gt;k_{\max} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The settings of &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and the initial points &lt;math&gt;x_i(0)~(i=1,\ldots,m)&lt;/math&gt; are the same with the above Setting 1. The setting of &lt;math&gt;r(k)&lt;/math&gt; is as follows.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Set &lt;math&gt;r(k)&lt;/math&gt; at Step 2) as follows:&lt;math&gt;r(k) =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; (k^\star \leqq k \leqq  k^\star + 2n-1), \\
h &amp; (k \geqq k^\star + 2n),
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k^\star&lt;/math&gt; is an iteration when the center is newly updated at Step 4) and &lt;math&gt;h = \sqrt[ 2n ]{\delta }, \delta \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;\delta = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have to add the following rules about &lt;math&gt;k^\star&lt;/math&gt; to the Algorithm:  
:•(Step 1) &lt;math&gt;k^\star = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
:•(Step 4) If &lt;math&gt;x^{\star}(k+1)\neq x^{\star}(k)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;k^\star = k+1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

== Future works ==
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The algorithms with the above settings are deterministic. Thus, incorporating some random operations would make this algorithm powerful for the global optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find an appropriate balance between diversification and intensification spirals depending on the target problem class (including &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;) is important to enhance the performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

== Extended works ==
Many extended studies have been conducted on the SPO due to its simple structure and concept; these studies have helped improve its global search performance 
and proposed novel
applications

[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] '''Sir Henry John Studholme Brownrigg''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (3 September 1882 – 24 January 1943) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer who was [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore]].

==Naval career==
Brownrigg joined the [[Royal Navy]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27499|page=8256|date=28 November 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in [[World War I]] and took part in the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916,&lt;ref name=lh&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/BROWNRIGG.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; as executive officer of [[HMS Barham (04)|HMS ''Barham'']] (with rank of Commander).&lt;ref name=nl&gt;Navy List, 1916&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to be [[Chief of Staff]] at the Africa Station and, from 1925, Deputy Director of the Gunnery Division.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He became Director of the Gunnery Division in 1926 and Chief of Staff at Plymouth in 1927.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He was made Captain of [[HMS Courageous (50)|HMS ''Courageous'']] in 1929 and then joined the staff of the Director of Naval Ordnance in 1931.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;

He became Rear Admiral commanding 3rd Cruiser Squadron in 1933 and Vice-Admiral [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He was Admiral commanding the Reserves from 1936 and [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore]] from January to December 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11284897 Naval Command Changed] The Melbourne Argus, 6 December 1939&lt;/ref&gt; He served in [[World War II]] as officer commanding the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] from 1940 to 1941.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He came out of retirement&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1943/02/18/archives/jutland-hero-lost-on-convoy-service-sir-studholme-brownrigg-61-had.html Jutland Hero Lost on Convoy Service] New York Times, 18 February 1943&lt;/ref&gt; to take charge of convoys. He sailed as Commodore of Convoy ON 16 in SS ''Ville de Tamatave'' (a ship captured from the Vichy French in 1941), departing [[Liverpool]] on 12 January 1943 en route for [[New York City|New York]]. The convoy ran into a violent storm in the North Atlantic towards the evening of 23 January. Messages were received from the ''Ville de Tamatave'' indicating that she had lost her rudder and, an hour later, that she was sinking. The other ships were not able to render assistance, and ''Ville de Tamatave'' was lost with all hands, including Brownrigg, on 24 January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Convoy ON 16 | url=http://www.warsailors.com/convoys/on160.html | accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17837614 Admiral presumed dead] Sydney Morning Herald, 19 February 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems Chemistry''' is the science of studying networks of interacting molecules, to create new functions from an ensemble of molecular components at different hierarchical levels with emergent properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sadownik |last2=Otto |year= 2015| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Encyclopedia of Astrobiology | pages = 1–3 | url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-27833-4_1095-2| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/research/centre-systems-chemistry/|title=Centre for Systems Chemistry|website=University of Groningen|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-systems-chemistry-and-how-does-it-differ-from-systems-biology|title=What is systems chemistry and how does it differ from systems biology?|first=Kristina|last=Kučanda|year=2014|website=Quora|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems chemistry also related to the origin of life ([[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2010| title = Welcome Home, Systems Chemists! | journal = Journal of Systems Chemistry |volume = 1| pages = 1 | url = https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations to Systems Biology==
Systems chemistry is a relatively young sub-discipline of [[chemistry]], where the focus does not lie on the individual chemical components but rather on the overall network of interacting molecules and on their emergent properties. Hence, it combines the classical knowledge of chemistry (structure, reactions and interactions of molecules) together with a systems approach inspired by [[systems biology]] and [[systems science]].

==History==
While multicomponent reactions have been studied for centuries, the idea of deliberately analyzing mixtures and reaction networks is more recent. The first mentions of systems chemistry as a field date from 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Stankiewicz | last2=Eckardt |year= 2006| title = Chembiogenesis 2005 and Systems Chemistry Workshop | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |volume = 45| pages = 324–344 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200504139/full }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kindermann | last2=Kiedrowski |year= 2005| title = Systems Chemistry: Kinetic and Computational Analysis of a Nearly Exponential Organic Replicator | journal = Angew. Chem. |volume = 117| pages = 6908–6913 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.200501527/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Early adopters focused on prebiotic chemistry combined with [[supramolecular chemistry]], before it was generalized to the study of emergent properties and functions of any complex molecular systems. A 2017 review in the field of systems chemistry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ashkenasy |last2=Taylor |year= 2017| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Chem. Soc. Rev. |volume = 46| pages = 2543–2554 | url = https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; described the state of the art as out-of-equilibrium self-assembly, fuelled molecular motion, chemical networks in compartments and oscillating reactions.

==Examples==
[[Dynamic combinatorial chemistry]] has been used as a method to develop ligands for biomolecules and receptors for small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |last2=Otto |year= 2013| title = Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries: From Exploring Molecular Recognition to Systems Chemistry | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume = 135 | pages = 9222–9239 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja402586c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligands that can recognize biomolecules are being identified by preparing libraries of potential ligands in the presence of a target biomacromolecule. This approach sets the stage for their application as diagnostic biosensors for fast monitoring of imbalances and illnesses and therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Verma |last2=Rotello | year= 2005 | title = Surface recognition of biomacromolecules using nanoparticle receptors | journal = Chem. Comm. |volume = 3| pages = 303–312 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2005/CC/b410889b#!divAbstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual components of certain chemical system will self-assemble to form receptors which are
complementary to target molecule. In principle, the preferred library members will select and
amplify based on the strongest interactions between the template and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2008| title = Systems chemistry | journal =  Chem. Soc. Rev. |volume = 37| pages = 101–108 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2008/cs/b611921m }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular networks &amp; equilibrium==
A fundamental difference exists between chemistry as it is performed in most laboratories and chemistry as it occurs in life. Laboratory processes are mostly designed such that the (closed) system goes thermodynamically downhill; i.e. the product state is of lower [[Gibbs free energy]], yielding stable molecules that can be isolated and stored. Yet the chemistry of life operates in a very different way: Most molecules from which living systems are constituted are turned over continuously and are not necessarily thermodynamically stable. Nevertheless, living systems can be stable, but in a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] sense. Such homeostatic (open) systems are far-from-equilibrium and are dissipative: they need energy to maintain themselves. In dissipative controlled systems the continuous supply of energy allows a continuous transition between different supramolecular states, where systems with unexpected properties may be discovered. One of the grand challenges of Systems Chemistry is to unveil [[complex network|complex reactions networks]], where molecules continuously consume energy to perform specific functions.

'''''The Blob''''' is a 1988 American [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Chuck Russell]], co-written with [[Frank Darabont]], and starring [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Kevin Dillon]], [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]], [[Jeffrey DeMunn]], [[Candy Clark]] and [[Joe Seneca]]. The titular Blob is an amorphous acidic amoeba-like organism that devours and dissolves anything in its path as it grows.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti, Carlo.  [http://leonardmaltin.com/original-vs-remake-the-blob-1958-vs-the-blob-1988/ "Original vs. Remake: The Blob (1958) vs. The Blob (1988)." ''Leonard Maltin''.  30 July 2018.  29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Film remake|remake]] of the 1958 [[The Blob|horror film of the same name]], the film was theatrically released in 1988, and was a [[Box office bomb|box office disappointment]], earning $8.2 million. It received mixed reviews but was praised for its special effects. Much like the original film, the remake has since gained a cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenousmonster.com/featured-article/the-blob-remake-retrospective/ |title=The Blob: A Great Horror Remake 25 Years Later |publisher=Ravenous Monster |author=Gregory Watson|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. --&gt;
A [[meteorite]] crashes near Arbeville, Colorado. An elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a massive [[slime mold]]-like substance that adheres to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being devoured by the growing Blob. While she tries freeing him, his arm dissolves off, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious, and the Blob fully dissolves Paul and oozes out of the hospital.

Scott, Paul's friend and classmate, &amp; his date Vicki prove to be the Blob's next victims.  Vicki passes out after Scott gets her drunk - The varsity football player prepares a mass-produced class ring to seduce her and mixes her another drink while the Blob enters the car and kills Vicki.  Scott, thinking Vicki is still just asleep, reaches his hand into her shirt and is grabbed by the Blob that is consuming Vicki from the inside out.  Scott is consumed.

After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman is violently dragged headfirst into a sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but the Blob retreats after entering the freezer. After consuming the diner's owner Fran Hewitt and Sheriff Geller, the Blob reenters the sewers. Meg and Brian return to the police station, where the dispatcher tells them Deputy Briggs is near the meteor-landing site. They discover a military operation led by a scientist, Dr. Meddows, who orders the town and the two teens quarantined. While Brian escapes, Meg is taken to town where she learns her younger brother, Kevin, is missing. Meg learns he and his friend, Eddie, snuck into the movie theater. The Blob enters the theater, attacking the staff and audience. Meg arrives as the audience flees the theater, rescuing Eddie and Kevin.

Brian eavesdrops on Meddows and learns that the Blob is a [[biological warfare]] experiment created during the [[Cold War]], launched into space because it was so dangerous. Learning that the Blob has entered the sewers, Meddows decides to trap it there, even if that means allowing Meg, Kevin, and Eddie to die. Brian is discovered listening in and evades military personnel by driving his motorcycle into the sewers. In the sewers, Meg and Kevin flee from the Blob when it emerges and devours Eddie. Kevin escapes by scaling a pipe to the surface, and Meg is saved by Brian, who confronts Meddows in front of the townsfolk and Briggs. After failing to convince everyone Brian is contaminated and must die, Meddows attempts to shoot him, but is killed by the Blob as it oozes into his [[NBC suit|chemical suit]] and drags him into the sewer. Then, Meddows' second in command, Colonel Hargis attempts to kill the Blob by shooting it to death and blowing it up with a bomb. But this only succeeds in enraging the creature. The Blob bursts out of the sewer and kills Hargis before feasting on the town's population. The town's Reverend Meeker proclaims the scene to be the prophesied end of the world, after which a failed flamethrower attack on the Blob sets him ablaze. Meg saves him with a fire extinguisher, and in the process blasts the Blob with it. When the monster backs off, she realizes that the Blob cannot tolerate cold.

The survivors retreat to the town hall and hold the Blob off with furniture-barricades and fire extinguishers, but it is a losing battle; the Blob engulfs half the building and devours Briggs. Brian goes to the town's garage and gets a [[snowmaking|snow maker]] truck that has canisters of [[liquid nitrogen]] attached. As the Blob is about to consume Meg and her family, Brian shoots snow at the creature, which is angered and knocks the truck over. As the Blob surges toward Brian, Meg lures it away from him toward the canisters, which she has rigged with an explosive charge taken from a dying soldier. She tries getting clear, but snags her foot between two pieces of metal, trapping her. Brian regains consciousness and runs over to free her. The Blob is about to overrun them when the charge goes off, blowing up the canisters and covering the Blob in liquid nitrogen. The creature is flash-frozen, shattering into a mass of [[crystallization|crystallized]] pieces. Moss Woodley has its remains stored in the town ice house.

Later, at a tent-meeting church service in a field, Meeker, disfigured by his burns and secretly driven insane, preaches a doomsday sermon resembling the Blob's attack. He has a still-living piece of the Blob, trapped inside a glass jar, to eventually unleash it once more upon the world.

==Production==
Screenwriter Frank Darabont first met director Chuck Russell in 1981, while working as a production assistant on the film ''[[Hell Night]]''.&lt;ref name=Emery&gt;Emery, Robert J. ''The Directors - Take Four.'' Allworth Communications, Inc., 2003, p. 201. {{ISBN|1581152795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before working together on ''The Blob'', the two also collaborated on the script for ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]''.&lt;ref name=Emery /&gt;

Actor Del Close had been scheduled to direct a "mock opera" about [[Ronald Reagan]] at New York's [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] during the filming of ''The Blob'',&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson, Kim "Howard." ''The Funniest One in the Room: The Lives and Legends of Del Close.'' Chicago Review Press, 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|1556527128}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the production was cancelled and he was unexpectedly available to audition for ''The Blob''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Production began on January 11, with the cast and crew of approximately 150 staying at a [[Travelodge]] in [[Abbeville, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large amount of night shooting, the cast often slept during the day.&lt;ref name=Johnson305&gt;Johnson, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; On their off days, they watched videos at the hotel and ate [[crawfish]], a popular item of local cuisine.&lt;ref name=Johnson305 /&gt;

Special effects in the film were handled by [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]].&lt;ref name=timpone&gt;Timpone, Anthony. "Men, makeup, and monsters." Macmillan, 1996, p. 187. {{ISBN|0-312-14678-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner was originally supposed to provide only a few small effects, but after personnel changes he ended up running a crew of 33, including artist [[Chet Zar]] and mechanical effects designer Bill Sturgeon.&lt;ref name=timpone /&gt; Close's makeup for his role as Reverend Meeker required extensive preparation time: five-and-a-half hours for scenes where Meeker had fresh burns, and seven-and-a-half hours for scenes after his burns had healed.&lt;ref name=Johnson305 /&gt;

==Analysis==
The film functions as a [[conspiracy theory]] film. The threat of the original film was an alien entity from outer space. The remake differs in making the threat a [[Biological agent|biological weapon]], created by a secret government agency. The Blob is closely followed by soldiers and scientists in [[Environmental suit|protective suits]]. The change reflects the mentality of a more cynical era.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"&gt;O'Neill (2007), unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; The sinister government agents are opposed by rebellious teenager Brian Flagg ([[Kevin Dillon]]). His depiction as a rebel and a "tough guy punk" includes wearing a leather jacket, sporting [[long hair]], riding a motorcycle, and distrusting authority figures.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan (2011), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
The film was released theatrically in the [[United States]] by [[TriStar Pictures]] in August 1988. It grossed $8,247,943 at the box office, making it a box office flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blob.htm|title=The Blob|publisher=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on {{nowrap|19 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 5.8/10.&lt;ref name="rottomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Blob (1988) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_blob_1988 |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixer |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two out of a possible four stars, calling it a "Needless, if undeniably gooey, remake".&lt;ref name="maltin14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maltin|first1=Leonard|last2=Carson|first2=Darwyn|last3=Sader|first3=Luke|title=Leonard Maltin's 2014 Movie Guide|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-0-451-41810-4|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film "is more violent than the original, more spectacular, more cynical, more patently commercial and more attentive to detail", but noted that "for reasons having nothing to do with merit, the 1958 film earned a place in history. The remake, enterprising as it is, won't do the same".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE1D9113AF936A3575BC0A96E948260|title=Review/Film; 'The Blob,' Modernized|author=[[Janet Maslin]]|date=August 5, 1988|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chuck Bowen of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote that the film "improves on the original [[Cult film|cult classic]] with inventive, gracefully repulsive special effects and an agreeable post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] anti-authoritarian message".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/the-blob-1988|title=The Blob (1988) Blu-ray Review|author=Chuck Bowen|date=October 20, 2014|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HorrorNews.net gave the film a score of "4 1/2 out of 5", writing that "the twists that this film takes that differ from the original make it all the more terrifying and oddly enough... plausible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/53193/film-review-the-blob-1988/|title=Film Review: The Blob (1988)|website=HorrorNews.net|date=June 20, 2016|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV Guide]] gave the film 3/5 stars, calling it "a fine, multilayered effort from a director who understands the genre and appreciates its traditions".&lt;ref name="tvguiderev"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Blob - Movie Reviews and Movie Ratings |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-blob/review/127416/ |website=TV Guide.com |publisher=TV Guide |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fable of Oscar''' is a fable proposed by [[John L. Pollock]] in his book ''How to Build a Person'' ({{ISBN|9780262161138}}) to defend the idea of token physicalism, agent materialism, and strong AI. It ultimately illustrates what is needed for an [[Artificial Intelligence]] to be built and why humans are just like intelligent machines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/How_to_Build_a_Person.html?id=WIRkVRTM6bYC|title=How to Build a Person: A Prolegomenon|last=Pollock|first=John L.|date=1989-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262161138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

==Fable==
Once in a distant land there lived a race of Engineers. They have all their physical needs provided by the machines they have invented. One of the Engineers decide that he will create an "intelligent machine" that is much more ingenious than the more machines, in that it can actually sense, learn, and adapt to its environment as an intelligent animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oscar I===

The first version of the machine is called "Oscar I". It has pain sensors and "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]]" responses build within to help it survive hostile environment. In this stage Oscar I is much like the machines [[Hilary Putnam]] considers in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oscar II ===

In order for Oscar I to avoid damages in hostile environment, it must not only be able to respond to its pain sensors but also predict what is likely to happen based on its generalization of its pain sensor activations. Therefore, a "pain sensor sensor" was built to sense its pain sensors, thus giving it a rudimentary self-awareness. In this stage Oscar I is much like an amoeba as Oscar II like a worm. Amoebas respond to pain while worms learn to avoid it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oscar III===

The problem with Oscar II is that it has no conception if the environment is fooling him. For example, he can't distinguish if a machine-eating tiger and a mirror image of such tiger. To solve such problem,  "introspective sensors" were built into Oscar II and made him "Oscar III". Oscar III can now sense the operation of its own sensors and form generalization about its reliability, thus acquired a higher degree of self-awareness. In this stage Oscar II is much like a bird as Oscar III a kitten. Kittens quickly learn about mirror image and come to ignore them while birds go on attacking their own reflection until they become exhausted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Mind/Body Problem===

Consider a world populated by Oscarites. If the Oscarites are sufficiently intelligent, it can philosophizing the difference between their outward physical state and inward mental state. While we, from our perspective, describe the Oscarites as sensing the operation of their perceptual sensors, they describe it as they are "being self-aware and being conscious".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Conclusion===

In the end of the fable Pollock states that while the Engineers are fictional, Oscar is real and we are in fact the Oscarites.

'''Thomas Alleyne''' (c.1488–1558) was an English priest of the sixteenth century. He is remembered for founding schools.

Details of his early life are lacking, although he appears to have had roots in Staffordshire where he later endowed two schools. The [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] states that he was probably born in [[Sudbury, Derbyshire|Sudbury]] (on the border between Staffordshire and Derbyshire).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stephens, ‘Alleyne , Thomas (c.1488–1558)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2006; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/95060, accessed 21 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was possibly educated at Cambridge.
[[File:St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage, 2013.JPG|thumb|St Nicholas' Church]]
By 1526 Alleyne became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Stevenage]], Hertfordshire. He was buried in [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]], Stevenage, although no memorial survives there.

==Legacy==
In 1547 Thomas Alleyne received a legacy from his brother Ralph, who was interested in supporting charitable work. Ralph was a businessman who served as [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Sheriff of the City of London]].

Thomas Alleyne may have supported schools during his lifetime, but what is known for certain is that three schools were endowed under the terms of his will. They are:
*[[The Thomas Alleyne Academy]], [[Stevenage]], Hertfordshire, 
*[[Alleyne's Academy]], [[Stone, Staffordshire]]
*[[Thomas Alleyne's High School]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]].

Alleyne created statues for the schools and left property to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in order to support them.  They remained under the governorship of Trinity College until the twentieth century when they were drawn into the state system of education.

&lt;/ref&gt; present understanding in various [[Science|scientific]] fields allows for the prediction of some '''far-future events''', if only in the broadest outline. These fields include [[astrophysics]], which has revealed how [[planet]]s and [[star]]s form, interact, and die; [[particle physics]], which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; [[evolutionary biology]], which predicts how life will evolve over time; and [[plate tectonics]], which shows how continents shift over millennia. 

All projections of the [[future of the Earth]], [[Future of the Solar System|the Solar System]], and [[Future of an expanding universe|the universe]] must account for the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that [[entropy]], or a loss of the energy available to do work, must rise over time.&lt;ref name="Nave" /&gt; Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of [[hydrogen]] fuel and burn out. Close encounters between astronomical objects gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.&lt;ref name="five ages" /&gt;

Physicists expect that matter itself will eventually come under the influence of [[radioactive decay]], as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles.&lt;ref name="dying" /&gt; Current data suggest that the [[Flat universe| universe has a flat geometry]] (or very close to flat), and thus will not [[Big Crunch|collapse in on itself]] after a finite time,&lt;ref name="Komatsu" /&gt; and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of [[Boltzmann brain]]s.&lt;ref name="linde" /&gt;

The timelines displayed here cover events from [[List of millennia#Future| the beginning of the 11th millennium]]&lt;ref name=time group=note&gt;
The precise cutoff point is 0:00 on 1 January AD 10,001.
&lt;/ref&gt;
to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternative future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether [[Human extinction |humans will become extinct]], whether [[proton decay| protons decay]], and whether the earth survives when the sun expands to become a [[red giant]].

==Spacecraft and space exploration==

To date five spacecraft (''[[Voyager 1]]'', ''[[Voyager 2]]'', ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' and ''[[New Horizons]]'') are on trajectories which will take them out of the Solar System and into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]]. Barring an extremely unlikely collision with some object, the craft should persist indefinitely.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

Амосова АМН Украины|Kiev Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery]]. In 1978, he described a new [[disease]], the [[:fr:Syndrome de Skumin|Skumin syndrome]]. He introduced a method of [[psychotherapy]] and [[Self-help|self-improvement]] based on [[optimism|optimistic]] [[autosuggestion]] for psychological rehabilitation of [[Cardiac surgery|cardiosurgical]] [[patient]]s (1979).

From 1980 to 1990, he was professor of psychotherapy at the [[Kharkiv Medical Academy of Post-graduate Education#Notable people|Kharkiv Medical Academy of Post-graduate Education]].

In 1995, Skumin became the first [[editor-in-chief]] of the journal [[:cv:К здоровью через культуру (журнал)|''To Health via Culture'']]. He is known for inventing a popular [[Terminology|term]]  "Culture of Health" (1968).

Besides [[psychiatry]] and psychology, Skumin writes on [[Self care|healthy lifestyle]], [[yoga]], and [[philosophy]].

Skumin studied [[medicine]] at the [[Kharkiv National Medical University]]. The history of the higher medical school in [[Kharkiv]] is more than 200 years long and closely connected with the history of [[University of Kharkiv|Vasily Karazin Kharkiv National University]], because it sprang from its Medical Faculty. The University – one of the oldest University of the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]] – was founded in 1804, a decree about its foundation was signed by the [[Emperor of Russia]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], and the first Statutes of the University were approved at that time. In the Kharkiv University were laid high scientific standards. Its history is connected with the names of the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]] – [[Lev Landau#National Scientific Center Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology, Kharkiv|Lev Landau]], [[Simon Kuznets#Biography|Simon Kuznets]], [[Élie Metchnikoff#Biography|Élie Metchnikoff]] – and other distinguished scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univer.kharkov.ua/en/general/our_university/history |title=Kharkov National University (Official Site) |publisher=Univer.

Since a valve replacement is a [[heart]] surgical procedure, it requires placing the patient on [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. With a valve replacement surgery, there are some [[Mitral valve replacement#Risks|risks]].

[[File:Graphic of the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart beside a human heart.jpg|right|310px|thumb|Total Artificial Heart beside a human heart]]

An artificial heart valve is a device [[Implant (medicine)|implanted]] in the heart of a patient with valvular heart disease, [[congenital heart defect]], etc. When one or two of the four [[heart valve]]s malfunctions, the medical choice may be to replace the natural valve with an artificial valve. There are three major types of mechanical valves with many modifications on these designs. This requires [[Cardiac surgery|open heart surgery]]. The mechanical valves are made from metal and [[pyrolytic carbon]], and can last a lifetime. All MHV function in the human body creating a unique sound effects and vibration. Patients with mechanical valves must take blood-thinning medications to prevent [[thrombus|clot]]ting. The choice of which valve type to use depends upon the patient's age, medical condition, preferences with medication, and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sundt |first=Thoralf M. |title=Mitral Valve Repair |url=http://ctsurgerypatients.org/adult-heart-disease/mitral-valve-disease |publisher=The Society of Thoracic Surgeons |accessdate=2 January 2018 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gqKq5Z3O?url=http://ctsurgerypatients.org/adult-heart-disease/mitral-valve-disease |archivedate=17 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autogenic training is a [[relaxation technique]] developed by the psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]]. He emphasized parallels to techniques in [[yoga]] and [[meditation]]. It is a method for influencing one's [[autonomic nervous system]]. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]]. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stetter F, Kupper S |title=Autogenic training: a meta-analysis of clinicaloutcome studies |journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=45–98 |date=March 2002 |pmid=12001885 |doi=10.1023/A:1014576505223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of the [[:tt:Скуминча психотренинг|Skumin mind control method]] ({{lang-ru|Психотре́нинг по Ску́мин}}) involves the use of two standard postures: sitting meditation and lying down meditation.

A most significant life event in the first years of life is a disease, especially if it is of early onset, severe, life-threatening, with an uncertain prognosis, and with the necessity of frequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Psychological implications are a significant part of the illness, not a marginal component; they can affect prognosis and outcome.

In particular, Skumin studied the patients, aged from 6 to 17, suffering from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Most of them have revealed a negative psychological attitude to the dietotherapy they received. A system of special measures has been developed including three main elements: (1) psychotherapeutic mediation of dietotherapy before its administration and in the process of the therapy; (2) creation of the psychologic attitude to the diet adherence; (3) alteration of the patient's taste stereotype. Realization of such measures has been conducive to higher effectiveness of the dietotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skumin |first=VA |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/voprpitan.html |script-title=ru: Psikhologicheskie aspekty lechebnogo pitaniia deteĭ i podrostkov, stradaiushchikh bolezniami pishchevaritel'noĭ sistemy |trans-title=Psychological aspects of diet therapy of children and adolescents suffering from digestive system diseases |year=1987 |location=Moscow |language=Russian |oclc=116648174 |pmid=3439083 |journal=Voprosy Pitaniya |issue=6 |pages=26–9 |title=Psychological aspects of diet therapy of children and adolescents suffering from digestive system diseases |accessdate=4 January 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wDg5nL7Y?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/voprpitan.html |archivedate=4 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on studies into the mental sphere of gastroenterological [[patient]]s, he systematized borderline [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and [[personality disorders]] on the clinical and etiopathogenetic basis. He studied the psychosocial problems that may affect children or teenagers who have the chronic gastrointestinal disease. A system of measures aimed at early [[diagnosis]], correction, [[therapy]] and [[prophylaxis]] of borderline conditions and psychosocial readaptation of patients is scientifically based. The main result of his scientific activity was the discovery of the "[[syndrome]] of the neurotic phantom of somatic disease"&lt;ref name="VS91"/&gt; (a specific psychopathological complex of [[symptom]]s) and a "concept of the mental constituent of a chronic somatic disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last4=Skumin |first4=V.

Skumin completed research of theoretical and practical issues of culture of health, which he developed throughout his scientific and pedagogical activity. These methods, he has introduced in the training course for the students of the Academy: ''The Foundations of a Culture of Health''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1992 |volume=8 |journal=[[:lt:Gydytojų žinios|Gydytojų žinios]] |location=[[Vilnius]] |oclc= |pages= |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/articles/g892.html |last=Skumin |first=V.A. |title=Yoga, society and culture |trans-title=Yoga, visuomenė ir kultūra |accessdate=8 January 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wJTTCVuz?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/articles/g892.html |archivedate=8 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His scientific and pedagogical work Skumin combine with a social activity. In 1994, he was elected to the post of the President-founder of the [[Rerikhism#The World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH)|World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH)]] — International social movement "To Health via Culture" ({{lang-ru|Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру}}).

Professor Verhorubova and professor Lobanova from [[Tomsk State Pedagogical University]] argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture  – spiritual, mental, and physical –  determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii |last2=Lobanova |first2=N.

{{quote|Russian Professor Skumin insists on the fact that the culture of health should be considered as an integral part of the spiritual culture and the moral culture, culture of labour and culture of recreation, culture of personality and culture of relationships. According to the scientist, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts—the concept of ″culture″ and the concept of ″health″. This is their synthesis, which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science, that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum  environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life. Thus, Skumin argues that the culture of health is a separate science, that creates new content. The main challenge of culture of health is the development of spiritual, mental and physical capabilities of man.}}

The '''World Futures Studies Federation''' is a global non-governmental organization that was founded in 1973 to promote the development of [[futures studies]] as an academic discipline.&lt;ref name="WFSF"&gt;[http://www.wfsf.org/ World Futures Studies Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFSF history"&gt;[http://www.wfsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=60 WFSF history]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==  
The Federation was chartered at the 1973 meeting of the [[International Futures Research Conference]].

Past organization president Eleonora Barbieri Masini said in 2005: "The vision of the Federation is just as valid today as it was when the Federation started. It can still perform the role of a modest bridge between people who are concerned with building a humane world."&lt;ref&gt;Eleonora Barbieri Masini (2005) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-4F37M2X-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=06%2F01%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=4&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235805%232005%23999629994%23582103%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5805&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=11&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=a5632ef053472fb33390dff710dfc83c Reflections on World Futures Studies Federation], ''Futures'', 37 (5), pp.361-369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with UNESCO==
UNESCO financed the participation of nationals of developing countries in the events organized by the WFSF until the end of the 1990s. Subsequently, UNESCO supported the organization of Introductory Courses in Futures Studies in the Asia Pacific Region, e.g. Fiji Islands in 1993; the Philippines in 1994. This was followed by funding for Futures Studies courses held in Budapest in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100000440 UNESCO NGO Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=64 WFSF and UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The World Futures Studies Federation has partnerships with institutions like [[University of Hawaii]],{{cn|date=July 2016}} [[Turku School of Economics]]{{cn|date=July 2016}} and [[RMIT University]] Global Cities Research Institute, Melbourne{{cn|date=July 2016}} as well as other international groups like [[Club of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dator (2005), [http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/publications/futures-studies/WFSFAndI2005.pdf The WFSF and I], "Futures'', 37 (5), pp. 371-385&lt;/ref&gt;
