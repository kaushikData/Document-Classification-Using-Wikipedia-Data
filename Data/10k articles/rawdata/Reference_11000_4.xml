'''1-800-FREE-411''' is an [[United States|American]] service offering advertising-supported [[directory assistance]], operated by [[Marchex]].

==Service==
Callers dial 1-800 (888 or 866)-FREE411 [373-3411] from any phone in the [[United States]] to use the [[toll-free]] service. Sponsors cover part of the service cost by playing advertising messages during the call. Callers always hear an ad at the beginning of the call, and then another after they have made their request. Callers then identify the city and state for the desired information, and can then search either by name or by business type. Free directory assistance is also available from an application for the [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=23838322 Jingle Networks, Inc.] Bloomberg Businessweek. Retrieved 2011-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and from their website. The service, provided entirely by computer and with no human operators, uses a voice-recognition database to recognize names or places spoken by the user.

==Corporate overview==
The original parent corporation, Jingle Networks, was formed in 2005, and received its initial funding from [[First Round Capital]] of $400,000.&lt;ref name=Peak&gt;{{cite news

|author=Michael Arrington
|date=2005-10-03
|accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 2008 it had, according to [[TechCrunch]], "captured a six percent market share of directory assistance calls." At that time, Jingle Networks received 20 million calls per month.&lt;ref name=TC_21May08&gt;{{cite news

On October 23, 2006, Jingle Networks announced that it raised $30 million in fourth round financing from [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Hearst Corporation]]. This came after a $26 million round in April 2006, and a $5 million round in December 2005. Also on that date, Jingle Network's CEO volunteered on TechCrunch that his company was losing on average 5 cents for every call they processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/10/23/interview-with-jingle-ceo-and-venture-capitalist/# |title=TalkCrunch » Blog Archive » Interview With Jingle CEO and Venture Capitalist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127110309/http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/10/23/interview-with-jingle-ceo-and-venture-capitalist/# |archive-date=2007-01-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2008, TechCrunch repeated Jingle's press releases that they had reached per-call profitability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/25/jingle-networks-proves-their-free-business-model-works/ Jingle Networks Proves Their Free Business Model Works&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jingle Networks aims at attracting customers away from an existing fee-based market. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as "inspired by the business model of [[Google]]".&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news

From 2005 through the early 2010, Jingle Networks guessed they saved consumers $1 billion&lt;ref name=EON/&gt; based on an inflated rate of $2 a call for directory assistance.

In April 2011, Marchex bought Jingle Networks for $62.5M in combination of cash and stock. Marchex says Jingle Networks will generate more than $26 million in 2011 revenue, up more than 40 percent over 2010. Marchex said it expects call-driven revenue to make up 75 percent of the company's 2011 revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Description ==
The advertisement features a woman wearing red lipstick and looking at the reader while holding a Del Monte ketchup bottle with the appearance of being about to open it. The tagline directly below it is, "You mean a woman can open it?" with the word ''woman'' underlined. The first sentence of the article it accompanied stated, "Easily—without a knife blade, a bottle opener, or even a husband!"&lt;ref name=od&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-we-cant-afford-not-to-be-politically-correct |title=Why We Can't Afford Not To Be Politically Correct |work=The Odyssey |date=2016-10-17 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical review ==
The advertisement has been described as an example of targeted advertising towards women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/aridinger/postwwii-advertisements |title=Aprons in Advertising |publisher=Slideshare |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is viewed as a symbol of [[social stereotype]]s during the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Elizabeth | last =Muir  | title =Canadian Women in the Sky: 100 Years of Flight | publisher = Dundurn | edition =   | year = 2015 | isbn = 1459731883 | page = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is frequently cited as emblematic of the ''[[Mad Men]]'' era.&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;&lt;ref name=ind /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wicks |first=Heidi |url=http://theindependent.ca/tag/mad-men/ |title=Mad Men |work=The Independent.ca |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly interpretation states that it implies that a woman is dependent upon her husband to do things for her.&lt;ref name=od /&gt; In one such commentary, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' stated that the woman in the advertisement is "clearly stunned and possibly delighted" at being able to open the bottle easily.&lt;ref name=ny /&gt; In addition, the advertisement has been used as a symbol of retro advertising, with a book bearing the same title as the tagline being published in 2000 by [[Adams Media]] detailing retro advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ad Nauseum |title=You Mean a Woman Can Open It...? |publisher=Adams Media |year=2000 |isbn=1580623778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that it enforced the stereotype of a woman as an unintelligent housewife.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|first=Susie |last=Rushden |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/columnists/susie-rushton-turn-the-heating-off-ndash-and-feel-virtuous-2146961.html |title=Turn the heating off – and feel virtuous |work=The Independent |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2011 Bulgaria antiziganist protests''' started during the night of 23 to 24 September 2011 in the village [[Katunitsa]] and later spread to other locations all over the country, including [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]], [[Burgas]], [[Pleven]], [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Stara Zagora]] and others.

{{See also|Antiziganism in Bulgaria}}
The protests started in response to the [[vehicular homicide]] of 19 years old Angel Petrov in [[Katunitsa]].

Protests continued on 1 October in Sofia, with 2000 Bulgarians marching against the Romani and what they viewed to be the "impunity and the corruption" of the political elite in the country.&lt;ref name=BBC10-1&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgarian rally links Roma to organised crime|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15140291|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volen Siderov]], leader of the far-right [[National Union Attack|Ataka]] party and presidential candidate, spoke to a crowd at the Presidential Palace in Sofia, calling for the death penalty to be reinstated, as well as Romani ghettos to be dismantled.&lt;ref name="BBC10-1"/&gt;
Many of these organized protests were accompanied by ethnic clashes and racist violence against Romani. The protesters shouted racist slogans like "Gypsies into soap" and "Turks under the knife."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/world/europe/anti-roma-demonstrations-spread-across-bulgaria.html?_r=0 Anti-Roma Demonstrations Spread Across Bulgaria], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many protesters were arrested for public order offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2011/09/27/1163572_mvr_za_protestite_za_katunica_sred_nai-agresivnite/|title=МВР за протестите за Катуница: Сред най-агресивните бяха 12-13-годишни|website=Dnevnik.bg|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=1055699|title=Труд|website=Trud.bg|accessdate=2 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111208/http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=1055699|archive-date=24 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news media labelled the protests as anti-Romani [[Pogroms]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Political reaction==
According to the BBC, [[President of Bulgaria|President]] [[Georgy Parvanov]] called on the protesters for "an end to the language of hatred".&lt;ref name="BBC10-1"/&gt; Parvanov and [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Boyko Borisov]] called a meeting of the national security council to address the issue.

These protests came before the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2011|presidential elections]] on 23 October. Far-right [[Attack (political party)|Ataka]] party leader [[Volen Siderov]] tried to capitalise on the tensions and called for the death penalty to be reinstated and for Romani "ghettos" to be dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/social/113796|title=Bulgarian anti-Roma protests escalate|website=Euobserver.com|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name="dnevnik.bg"/&gt; and the [[OSCE]] &lt;ref name="trud.bg"/&gt; condemned the demonstrations and the violence.

==International reaction==
[[Reuters]] attributed the protests and civil disturbances to the lack of effective justice system in the country.&lt;ref name="medii"&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2011/09/28/1164822_razmiricite_v_i_sled_katunica_vliazoha_v_svetovnite/ Размириците в и след Катуница влязоха в световните медии], Dnevnik newspaper, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Russian media emphasized the ethnic nature of the societal polarizations, expressing the belief that the Roma are indirectly benefiting due to a positive discrimination on the part of law enforcement agents.&lt;ref name="Pravda.ru"&gt;[http://www.pravda.ru/world/europe/easteurope/26-09-2011/1092818-bulgaria-0/ Болгарию поджигает цыганский вопрос], Правда.ру, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Smuggler's Bible''''' is [[Joseph McElroy]]'s first novel.  David Brooke&amp;mdash;who talks of himself in a split-personality manner&amp;mdash;narrates a framing tale that consists of him "smuggling" his essence into eight autobiographical manuscripts, although their connection with Brooke is not always clear.  Brooke seems to deteriorate, while his fictions become more real.

In ordinary English, a "[[wikt:smuggler's bible|smuggler's bible]]" refers to a book with a cutout in the body of the pages, suitable for hiding small items when the covers are closed.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples [http://jeffpeachey.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/smugglers-bible/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel consists of a frame story (summarized here indented), intercut with eight chapters that are the eight manuscripts mentioned in the frame story.

&lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;''the principal parts of david brooke''&lt;/span&gt;

:The frame story is told from what seems to be a split-personality part of a consciousness, although it may simply be an extended metaphor for the mind of an author, keeping distinct his personal life and creative mental life:
{{quote|He doesn't know what I am, but he knows I'm in him and behind him. His name is David Brooke....[H]e senses that I&amp;mdash;''I''&amp;mdash;am his propulsion....I inhabit him.}}

:David is on a cruise ship heading to London.  He has eight manuscripts, his memories, and they need to be made into one.  An older Englishman approaches David, talks about smuggling, how it used to be a fine art, but now the current generation are mere amateurs.  He gives David his card.  David returns to the stateroom, and begins editing the first manuscript.  He then rereads the manuscript, at which point the frame story stops and the text becomes that of the first manuscript.

===The Shadow===

Forty-two-year-old Peter St. John runs an antiquarian bookstore in [[Brooklyn Heights]].  His father Hugh lives in London, his wife Sally and daughter Joan are staying in Maine for the summer.  His friend David Brooke, aged 28, living in his parents' house, sometimes hangs around the store.  He sometimes steals books, with St. John's knowledge.

Walter Roy, a boy, has been stalking St. John from a distance.  After a few times, St. John confronts Walt, and learns that, from a distance, Walt had thought St. John resembled Walt's father, William, who had been a 41-year-old stockbroker when he died the previous April.  St. John ends up wanting to be fatherly to Walt, and give him a gift of an atlas, but Walt rebels against the idea and the gift.

&lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;''the blue address book''&lt;/span&gt;

:The frame story resumes with David thinking about his earlier belief in solipsism from reading half an essay in the St. John store.  But a week later, thinking about his mother's blue address book, and how it contained so many names he did not know, he concluded that such a thing was beyond him.  Unable to find the rest of the essay, he continued to think about the issue, and this motivated him to write the eight manuscripts: "After ''The Shadow'' David had to project himself into a community."  David's thoughts expand to include Lamont Cranston, ''[[The Shadow]]'', with the power to cloud men's minds.

:While David's wife Ellen plays chess with the man interested in smuggling, David edits his second manuscript.

===A Cabinet of Coins===

This manuscript consists of first person accounts by Mary Clovis, James Judah Lafayette, Abby Love, and Alonzo Morganstern, all residents on the same floor of the Kodak Hotel, now a boarding house.  They share the floor with David Brooke, and one Luke Pennitt.  There is also an account from Terri, the maid.  Theodore Selbstein is their landlord.

From Mrs. Clovis we learn that Pennitt has a coin collection, is very secretive, and does not want maid service, that Morganstern is a Communist, that Pennitt and Morganstern constantly argue, that Brooke has gone from quiet to noisy under Morganstern's influence, and that Pennitt is behind in his rent.

Lafayette (originally Lamentoff) overhears Brooke talking with some girl.  She's interested in him, but he's worried about Pennitt and his coins.  She's also behind in her rent, and Brooke is willing to pay it.

Terri would like to marry one Franklin Benjamin, who, it turns out, knows Brooke and questions Terri about him.  Selbstein has her check Pennitt's room for anything interesting.  Eventually she finds an odd machine in his closet, with screw-rods and other things she can't figure out, but her description satisfies Selbstein's curiosity.

The girl with Brooke turns out to be Abby Love.  She describes in great detail Brooke's conversations with Pennitt on coins.  She has a big fight with Brooke, writes him an IOU for back rent, and leaves him for at least a day.

Morganstern lies to Brooke about being a former pro boxer.  He admits to having to move around a lot.  Selbstein tells him that Pennitt is being evicted for nonpayment and that Love has never missed a rent check.

That chapter ends with a section of pure dialogue, as Selbstein is evicting Pennitt.  It turns out that Pennitt's coin collection was manufactured by Pennitt using the odd machine in his closet.

&lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;''blind john jones and the ice-cream sculpture''&lt;/span&gt;

:After the narrator mocks David, David returns to his third manuscript, which we learn is about his sister Ann's baby sent home from England.

:The narrator talks on about John Jones, the blind man of the Heights who sometimes entertained young David with a ventriloquism act.

:David overhears the smuggler-man outside his stateroom asking a steward to leave a note for David.  David reviews the history of [[Eloy Mestrelle]] who introduced coining by mill and screw.  He gets the note, which is an invitation for further conversation about smuggling, offering to show David a "true collector's item."

===Cable===

David's mother Julia, 60, is reading a [[cablegram]] telling of the time of arrival that afternoon of her seven-week-old granddaughter Julie at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild]], giving time but not the flight, while her daughter Ann and son-in-law Dan stay in London sightseeing, headed to Israel.  Her husband, Halsey, 65, is in Chicago, and will be taking a train back to New York.  David himself, now 31, is in New Hampshire, having moved there eighteen months previously.

That night Julia gives a dinner, with guests Bobby Prynne, a friend of David, headed for a divorce and sweet on Julia in a way she finds creepy, friends Quincey and Sarah Fearon, and after they leave, her distant younger cousin Josie Wrenn shows up.

The next morning, Julia meets Halsey at Penn Station, much to his surprise.

&lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;''reflex therapy, or what bruder didn't say''&lt;/span&gt;

:The narrator David gives David a dream, where David is split into David A, who experiences the dream, and David B, who interprets the dream.  Halsey is also in the dream.  The main action is forced to occur eight times.  The last time is going poorly, so the narrator wakes David up.

:There follows an interview/session of David with Dr. Bruder from some unspecified time and place.

:Back on ship, David overhears the smuggler and the scientist talk outside his stateroom, mentioning him.  David gets back to working on manuscript four concerning the Amerchromes, pondering Dr. Bruder's advice.  David handles the seven-level screwdriver, to the narrator's objection, that David had stolen from Michael Amerchrome.  Upon hearing Ellen show up, David pockets the screwdriver.

===An American Hero, or the Last Days of Duke, Mary, and Me===

Michael Amerchrome narrates in first person about himself, his "famous historian" father Duke, 54, and his stepmother, Mary, 35, Duke's third wife.  Michael presumes the second wife was his mother, of whom he has no memories.  Duke's past includes an eclectic list of job titles, but Michael admits he knows nothing beyond the titles.  As an example, he mentions Duke's work acting in and directing a documentary, but which Duke does not let Michael see.  The family frequently moves.

Duke is currently in his second year as a professor at a young New Hampshire university.

==Reception==

{{quote|In this immensely interesting but bafflingly fragmented first novel, Joseph McElroy sets before the reader a truly impressive display of masterly craftsmanship and recondite virtuosity. ... This is a strange but compelling novel.|?|Kirkus Reviews}}

{{quote|One must ... pay high tribute to McElroy's daring, range and brilliant subtlety. [It] is a remarkable novel... To ignore it would be as shameful an act of blind self-deprivation as that which so many of us performed when ''[[The Recognitions]]'' and ''[[Under the Volcano]]'' were first published.|J. R. Frakes|The New York Times Book Review}}

{{quote|McElroy has every gift that can blandish us into being entertained: dialogue, characterization, topography, wit... [T]his steeplechase of a novel [takes] all the jumps with a style none of his contemporaries has equalled|[[Richard Howard]]|The New Leader}}

==Influences==

McElroy explicitly acknowledged the influence of [[William Gaddis]] ''[[The Recognitions]]'' in an interview,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom LeClair]] 1978 interview, in LeClair and McCaffery (eds.) ''Anything Can Happen'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; and also in his "Neural Neighborhoods" essay, where McElroy states he was already well into his own novel when he read the Gaddis novel.

One McElroy passage makes a rather direct allusion:
{{quote|I tried to go on with a one-thousand-page novel I was reading, ... "Giorgio examined his nails, not, as men do, fingers in against the palms, but rather in the manner of women, the whole long irregular oval of the back of the hand beautiful and banked."}}
which is closely similar to a passage in ''The Recognitions'':
{{quote|[Otto] thought to look at his fingernails. Not as a man does, the fingers turned in upon the palms, but like a lady, at the back of the extended hand so that she may admire the slim beauty of her fingers.}}

Professor Duke Amerchrome is an academic fraud, an addition to the catalog of quacks, counterfeiters, and art forgers in the Gaddis novel.

Moreover, Reverend Gwyon hides his liquor in a smuggler's bible (although Gaddis does not use that term).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5741">'''Al-Asadi v. Bush''' (Civil Action No. 05-cv-2197) is a writ of [[habeas corpus]] filed on behalf of [[Guantanamo detainee]] [[Mohammed Ahmed Ali Al Asadi]] before [[US District Court Judge]] [[Henry H. Kennedy]].  It was one of over 200 [[Habeas corpus petitions of Guantanamo Bay detainees|habeas corpus petitions]] filed on behalf of detainees held in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in Cuba. 

==Military Commissions Act==

The [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.&lt;ref name=McaLetter2006-10-16&gt;

==Boumediene v. Bush==

On June 12, 2008, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled, in [[Boumediene v. Bush]], that the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]] could not remove the right for [[Guantanamo captives]] to access the US Federal Court system.  And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.
The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of "enemy combatant".&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2008-10-24&gt;

{{wikisource|Misc. No. 08-442 (TFH) -- Doc 31: Statement regarding hearing of July 8, 2008}}

Al Asidi's petition was renewed, as a former captive seeking relief for his former detention.
On July 3, 2008, [[US District Court Judge]] [[Thomas F. Hogan]] issued an order regarding former Guantanamo captives, who might seek relief for their former detentions.&lt;ref name="Thomas F. Hogan"&gt;{{cite web

It contains thousands of ancient archaeological artefacts from the ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan and Cypriot civilizations. Its main attraction is the [[Pergamon Altar]] and Greek and Roman architectural elements from [[Priene]], [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]], [[Baalbek]] and [[Falerii]]. In addition, the collection includes a large number of ancient sculptures, vases, terracottas, bronzes, [[sarcophagi]], [[engraved gems]] and metalwork.

== History of the collection ==

=== Foundation ===
The collection's foundations were laid in the time of the [[Brandenburg]] [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] by ancient sculptures [[Looting|looted]] in 1656 from the [[Kazimierzowski Palace|''Villa Regia'' Palace]] in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=Sztuka Warszawy (The art of Warsaw)|year=1986 |editor=Mariusz Karpowicz  |page=121 |pages= |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher= PWN |location= |isbn=83-01-04060-2 |url=|accessdate=|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Król Władysław IV zgromadził w pałacu swój zbiór antycznych rzeźb, które później padły łupem elektora brandenburskiego Fryderyka Wilhelma Hohenzollerna.''&lt;br&gt;{{cite web  |author= |url=http://swiadectwo1.republika.pl/royal1.html |title= Apartamenty królewskie (Royal apartments) |work=Pałac Villa Regia |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obtained sculptures were purchased in [[Italy]] by Polish kings [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[Władysław IV Vasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author=Monika Kuhnke |url=http://www.zabytki.pl/sources/straty/wstep.html |title= Przyczynek do historii wojennych grabieży dzieł sztuki w Polsce |work=www.zabytki.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100108014253/http://www.zabytki.pl/sources/straty/wstep.html| archivedate= 8 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This core of the collection, originally housed at the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Berlin City Castle]], was enlarged through acquisitions, including the acquisition of the collection of [[Gerrit Reynst]] in 1671. Acquisitions continued in 1698 when [[Frederick I of Prussia|Friedrich III]] bought the important collection belonging to the Roman archaeologist [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]]. After a longer interval, in which [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] exchanged, among other things, 36 valuable statues for two dragoon regiments with [[Augustus II the Strong]], followed in 1742 by [[Frederick II of Prussia|Friedrich II]]'s purchase of the collection of cardinal [[Melchior de Polignac]], which included the well-known figure of the "girl playing a game of knucklebones". He acquired in 1747 the already famous bronze statue of the so-called "praying boy", which was set up on the terrace of the [[Schloss Sanssouci]] until 1786. the collection was significantly expanded in 1758 through the inheritance of the Markgräfin von Ansbach-Bayreuth's collection, which included the "[[Nile mosaic of Palestrina|Nile mosaic]]" from [[Praeneste]], and in 1764 through the purchase of [[Philipp von Stosch]]'s antique gem collection.

The majority of the antiquities were scattered among the royal castles in the 1770s, or shown in a specially built ancient temple in Potsdam where they were not accessible to the public. 1797 saw the first thoughts of public access, with the plan to erect a public museum in Berlin to show off the most important pieces in the royal collections, among other things. A commission under the direction of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was appointed to select the exhibits. At the same time as this new museum was coming into existence, further important purchases were made, for example in 1827 the collection of bronzes and vases belonging to the consul-general [[Jakob Salomon Bartholdy|Bartholdy]] and in 1828 the collection of 1348 antique vases belonging to the general Franz Freiherr von Koller.

=== The collection to 1939 ===
The collection found its first home in the [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s 1830 building (now the [[Altes Museum]]) in the [[Lustgarten]] next to the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]]. The collection was predominantly Greek and Roman in the beginning, though it also included some medieval and modern sculptures. In the course of the 19th century, many further purchases were made, including in 1831 the Dorow-Magnus collection of 442 vases. The vase collection was expanded significantly in the following years by the bequest of the archaeologist [[Eduard Gerhard]]'s collection and became one of the best in the world.

The building's central room was the Rotunda, one of the earliest examples of purpose-built [[museum architecture]], in which was exhibited the first display of sculptures, as chosen by von Humboldt's commission. Off it extended two halls, one of classical gods, the other of classical heroes, to which were joined two rooms with statues of Roman emperors, portraits, sarcophagi, cinerary urns and reliefs. Small objects were initially housed in the Antiquarium room.

The new museum's first director was the sculptor [[Christian Friedrich Tieck]], and its first archeological curator (from 1833 to 1855) [[Eduard Gerhard]]. Even at this stage - thanks to Gerhard - the focus was not merely on displaying works of art, but also on scientific research and development, then a novelty in museums. A sign of this scientific approach was the beginnings of a systematic catalogue (with drawings) of the museum's ancient artworks from Italy and Greece. This collection of drawings grew fast and its 2500 leaves are used by researchers even in the present day.

During his term of office, Gerhard did not restrict himself to acquiring 'star objects', but instead tried to look at the whole breadth of the collection and to expand it in a variety of areas. In order to produce a complete overview of ancient art-history, he also went against opposition to casts and encouraged their acquisition by the collection instead of expensive original statues. The cast collection - in existence since 1796 at Berlin's [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] - was connected to the museum in 1842. In the following decades, the collection expanded to become one of the largest of its type. The combination of originals and copies in time came to support the Museum's encouragement of research and scholarship.

The old museum-building soon became too small for the collection and a further building, the ''[[Neues Museum]]'' (New Museum), was built by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] between 1843 and 1855 to the north of the original building. In this new building, ideas of arranging the archeological collections into a full chronological and conceptual timeline began to become reality. In the lower floor of the museum the Egyptian collection (which had already existed for some years but not been accessible to the public) was put on show, whilst on the upper floor, the cast collection was set up according to designs by Stüler. The rooms' decor and wall paintings were designed specifically to fit the relevant subject or epoch. This new layout, however, did not last long, as in 1879 the vases collection was moved out of the Antiquarium into the new building.

Even though the vase collection had outgrown the storage capacity of the old building, the available space was still not enough, so in 1883 it was decided to separate off the post-ancient sculptures into their own collection, to be housed in the [[Bode Museum|Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] (now known as the Bode Museum, or the Skulpturensammlung und Museum für Byzantinische Kunst i.e. the Sculpture Collection and Museum for Byzantine Art) that was already in the planning stages. Yet the 1884 purchase of the collection of [[Peter Alexandrovich Saburov]]&lt;ref&gt;In French, "Sabouroff", hence "the Sabouroff Painter".&lt;/ref&gt; again caused an acute shortage of space.

To expand of the collection, the museum had since 1875 carried out its own excavations around the Mediterranean, starting with the ruins of Olympia. In 1878 [[Carl Humann]] and [[Alexander Conze]] began excavations in Pergamon, which brought the Museum its most famous object, the [[Pergamon Altar]]. Further excavations followed in Priene, Magnesia, Miletus and Baalbek, but these excavations entailed new problems.

The collection was enriched in the early 20th century by acquisitions as well as by excavations, such as that of smaller objects belonging to Friedrich L. von Gans in 1912, the glass collection purchased in 1913 from M. von Rath, the "Thronende Göttin" (Throne of the Gods) in 1916, the statue of a woman holding an apple in 1925, and a collection of mummy portraits from the Fayum in 1929.

For the presentation of all these pieces of ancient architecture, another new museum building was required. Between 1897 and 1899, the architect [[Fritz Wolff]] created the first [[Pergamon Museum]]. It was opened 1901 and in its light well was displayed the Pergamon altar and other architectural examples. Yet problems with the foundations soon led to its closure and demolition closed and dismantled. [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1907 planned a new building, begun in 1912, but [[World War I]] and the [[Wall Street Crash]] caused building work to come repeatedly to a standstill. In 1930, at the collection's centenary, a new museum (named the Pergamonmuseum from 1958) could be delivered finally at the public, designed by [[Alfred Messel]] and built by [[Ludwig Hoffmann (architect)|Ludwig Hoffmann]]. The three existing middle halls were reserved for ancient art.

The old left wing became the Deutsche Museum, to relieve severe space problems at the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum. The right wing was reserved for the Near East collection and the museum of Islamic art. The three middle halls - after large extensions were added - were able to present ancient architecture to its full height, with innovative use of natural light. There was no discussion as to the form of this presentation, leading to some embittered disputes that became known as the "Berliner Museumskrieg" ("Berlin museum war"). Through connections between the three archaeological museums, from 1930 until the museums' closure on the outbreak of war in 1939 visitors were able to undertake a tour through the early high cultures of ancient Egypt, the ancient Near East and the antique world for the next nine years.

=== The "Kriegsinferno" ===
In 1941, safeguarding the objects with [[sandbag]]s and other measures began. What could be moved was largely taken to the [[Flak tower|Flaktürme]] at the Berlin Zoo and at [[Friedrichshain]], and in the vaults of the Berlin Mint. With the bombing becoming worse, these places (especially the Flak-towers) seemed unsuitable, and on 10 March 1945 it was decided to move the artworks to mines west of Berlin. After about ten convoys had started to move the collections there, however, it became too dangerous to do so, and this was postponed to the first week of April. So a large part of the small art and the supply of the magazines of the antique collection was instead taken to the [[Grasleben]] mines and to [[Kaiserroda]] in [[Thuringia]]. In the course of the war, the Altes Museum and the Neue Museum were destroyed, and the Museumsneubau and some of the exhibits were damaged. In spite of the concern over their safety, the art treasures in the Flaktürmen were hardly damaged during the [[Battle of Berlin]].

The worst, however, came after the end of the battle, with the guards everywhere deserting their posts and leaving all the stores to be plundered by both Germans and Russians. In two fires in the Flakturm Friedrichshain in May 1945 a large part of the art treasures stored there was probably destroyed including several antiquities. Others were confiscated by the [[Red Army]] and taken back to [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]] as "spoils of war", and have still not been returned. How much was taken in this way is still unknown; 25 Greek vases that can be shown to belong to the Berlin collection were shown in 2005 at an exhibition entitled "Archaeology of the War" in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow. Further vases were discovered in the Muscovite  Historic Museum. Several vases, that were loaned in 1903 to the Provincial-Museum at [[Poznań]] (13 of the 19 vases are demonstrably from the Berlin collection), and several portrait busts that were loaned from 1908 to the Schloss there, were subsumed by Poland in 1945 into the [[National Museum, Poznań|Muzeum Narodowe]] in [[Poznań]], where they are still held today.

How great the losses were over the whole collection could first be investigated and documented after the reunification of the collection, with the first catalogue of losses appearing in 2005. This catalogue named five large bronze statues (including the "[[Calvatone]] Victory"), approximately 300 marble and stone statues, more than 40 reliefs, more than 20 stone architectural elements, approximately 30 stone vases, more than 1500 vases and vase-fragments (including pieces by the [[Amasis Painter]], [[Berlin Painter]], [[Brygos Painter]], [[Edinburgh Painter]], [[Exekias]], [[Geras Painter]] and [[Pan Painter]]), 100 pieces of gold jewellery and more than 150 engraved gems.

=== The collection divided ===

==== The collection on the [[Museum Island]] ====
In 1958 the [[USSR]] returned much of this war booty to the [[East Germany|GDR]], but with both the Altes and Neue Museum destroyed a new home was acutely needed for the collections on the Museums Island. The three middle halls of the Pergamon Museum once again housed architectural exhibits, and the central hall again housed the Pergamon Altar. In the right-hand Room was housed Roman architecture, and in the right Wing itself the Near East Museum on the first floor and the Islamic Art museum on the upper floor (as it had been before 1939). In the left hall was housed Greek architecture, with ancient sculptures (formerly in the Altes Museum) in the left wing, and for a short time ancient coins were displayed in the [[:de:Münzkabinett Berlin|Münzkabinett Berlin]]. On the upper floor were Roman portraits, [[Etruscan art]] and choice pieces from the collection of small-objects. There was no room, however, for the art of ancient Cyprus until the Altes Museum was rebuilt and these objects had to remain in store

A new entrance was formed in 1982, that led now directly into the middle hall and, from there, to the Pergamon Altar. In 1983-84 the ancient sculptures were redisplayed, this time in a chronological sequence, beginning with [[archaic period in Greece|archaic Greek art]], through classical originals, Hellenistic sculptures and Roman copies of classical originals, and ending with Roman art.

Kept out of the international art market, the collection was restricted to maintaining and presenting the existing collection on the [[Museum Island]]. Only in a few cases could the collection be enriched by new acquisitions, such as an outstanding Greek marble relief of two horsemen and seven precious vases from private owners.

==== The collection in [[Charlottenburg]] ====
Also in 1958 the objects that had been evacuated to Thuringia during the war (then moved by the Americans to [[Celle]] in [[West Germany]]) were returned to Berlin. Though a repatriation to the Museum Island was out of the question, other homes were found for the objects. In 1961 the antiquities (already on public display from 1960 in Stüler's barrack buildings at the Schloss at Charlottenburg) were placed in the charge of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. The objects displayed were the core of the collection of small artworks (including the well-known bronze statue of the "Cretan ram-carrier"), most of the former vase collection, the ancient gold jewellery collection (including the [[Hildesheim]] silver hoard), parts of the glass collection, the existing mummy portrait collections (with the addition of one of the few surviving ancient panel paintings, the [[Severus Tondo]]), and the collection of ancient helmets from [[Lipperheide]]. The display of antiquities, including the arrangement of the treasure chamber in the first floor of the Stüler building, was expanded in 1976. In 1987 the first floor became home to the vases from [[Magna Graecia]], upon which the arrangement of the antiquities collection was complete and extensive.

In contrast to its East Berlin counterpart, the collection had access to the international art market, and was able to make its first postwar acquisition in 1958, the "torso of a falling wounded man". Up until reunification, as well as the existing material on the museum island, more than 600 new works of art were acquired by purchases and donation. These included numerous ancient vases (among others, the [[Altamura Painter]], [[Berlin Painter]], [[Brygos Painter]], [[Chiusi Painter]], [[KY Painter]], [[Myson]], [[Pan Painter]], [[Paseas]], [[Pistoxenos Painter]], [[Smikros]] and the [[Triptolemos Painter]]), numerous marble busts (including a portrait bust of [[Cleopatra VII]]), sculptures (including a feminine idol of the [[Cycladic]] culture) and sarcophagus (among others, a large sarcophagus of a Roman general well known since the 16th century). Along with these single acquisitions, some larger complexes also came into the possession of the Museum. In 1976 an ancient coin from [[Heinrich Amersdorffer]]'s collection, gold jewellery from Tarentum in 1980, a vase collection from a grave in Tarentum in 1984 (including ones by the [[Armidale Painter]], the [[Dareios Painter]], the painter of Copenhagen 4223, the [[Loebbecke Painter]], the [[Lucera Painter]], the [[Underworld Painter]] and the [[Varrese Painter]]) and the contents of a late Roman grave in [[Cologne]] in 1986.

The '''Baltimore City Archives''' is the official municipal archive of the City of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The archive is located on Mathews Street in the Better [[Waverly, Baltimore]] neighborhood. The Baltimore City Archives "is the central depository for government records of permanent value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimorecityhistory.net/about-3/|title=About the Archives|publisher=Baltimore City Archives|accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the incorporating charter of Baltimore stipulated the care of records in 1796, the clerk of Baltimore’s Special Commissioners had been ordered to keep records of the town in a chest for safekeeping. The first Record Office of Baltimore was completed in 1839, built to house the growing number of municipal records needing safekeeping. In 1839, the city librarian’s office was created, and the librarians and assistants that followed worked to create order out of the multiplying records. Arguments of cronyism in the city librarian’s office resulted in the creation of the Bureau of Archives within the Department of Legislative Reference in 1927.

During the late 1930s, the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) assigned workers from the [[Historical Records Survey]] (HRS) to the Baltimore City Archives, the outcome being twelve hundred detailed worksheets and a completed index of the records of the Archives. Despite this work, the archives fell into disrepair until the 1970s, when a renewed interest in Baltimore’s history was the impetus for the creation of the position of City Archivist. After several years of work, which resulted in a guide to the holdings of the Archive in relation to the WPA-HRS index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivists.metapress.com/content/2512804653401xh3/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-11|last=Cox|first=Richard J.|author-link=Richard J.

==Current status==
The Baltimore City Archives has been receiving more support from city government, enabling it to move to a new location. The Archives came under the auspices of the Maryland State Archives in 2009 through a five-year agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/nhprc/newsletter/2011/march/|title=Policy Changes|work=NHPRC News|publisher=National Archives|date=March 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the State Archives receive additional storage space in exchange for preservation services.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/budget_docs/all/operating/d60a10_-_state_archives.pdf  Retrieved 2011/08/15. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701161831/http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/budget_docs/all/operating/d60a10_-_state_archives.pdf |date=July 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have received an NHPRC Grant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/nhprc/projects/states-territories/md.html|title=Maryland Grants|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work has since commenced to create more access to the holdings, including more detailed descriptions in their online guide&lt;ref&gt;http://guide.mdsa.net/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and the addition of [[Web 2.0]] tools such as [[Flickr]].

==Holdings==
The Archives holds collections from city offices such as the [[Mayor of Baltimore]], [[Baltimore City Council]], and the Department of Housing as well as collections of national historic interest such as the [[War of 1812]] papers. Recent acquisitions include the [[Provident Hospital (Baltimore)]] and the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]].

{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}

In [[computing]], a '''benchmark''' is the act of running a [[computer program]], a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative '''performance''' of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1145/5666.5673| issn = 0001-0782| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 218–221| last1 = Fleming| first1 = Philip J.| last2 = Wallace| first2 = John J.| title = How not to lie with statistics: the correct way to summarize benchmark results| journal = Communications of the ACM| accessdate = 2017-06-09| date = 1986-03-01| url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=5666.5673}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''benchmark'' is also commonly utilized for the purposes of elaborately designed benchmarking programs themselves.

Benchmarking is usually associated with assessing performance characteristics of computer hardware, for example, the floating point operation performance of a [[Central processing unit|CPU]], but there are circumstances when the technique is also applicable to software. Software benchmarks are, for example, run against [[compiler|compilers]] or [[database management system|database management systems (DBMS)]].

Benchmarks provide a method of comparing the performance of various subsystems across different chip/system architectures.

[[Test suite|Test suites]] are a type of system intended to assess the '''correctness''' of software.

== Purpose ==
As [[computer architecture]] advanced, it became more difficult to compare the performance of various computer systems simply by looking at their specifications. Therefore, tests were developed that allowed comparison of different architectures. For example, [[Pentium 4]] processors generally operated at a higher clock frequency than [[Athlon XP]] or [[PowerPC]] processors, which did not necessarily translate to more computational power; a processor with a slower clock frequency might perform as well as or even better than a processor operating at a higher frequency. See [[BogoMips]] and the [[megahertz myth]].

Benchmarks are designed to mimic a particular type of workload on a component or system. Synthetic benchmarks do this by specially created programs that impose the workload on the component. Application benchmarks run real-world programs on the system. While application benchmarks usually give a much better measure of real-world performance on a given system, synthetic benchmarks are useful for testing individual components, like a [[hard disk]] or networking device.

Benchmarks are particularly important in [[CPU design]], giving processor architects the ability to measure and make tradeoffs in [[microarchitecture|microarchitectural]] decisions. For example, if a benchmark extracts the key [[algorithms]] of an application, it will contain the performance-sensitive aspects of that application. Running this much smaller snippet on a cycle-accurate simulator can give clues on how to improve performance.

Prior to 2000, computer and microprocessor architects used [[SPEC]] to do this, although SPEC's Unix-based benchmarks were quite lengthy and thus unwieldy to use intact.

Computer manufacturers are known to configure their systems to give unrealistically high performance on benchmark tests that are not replicated in real usage. For instance, during the 1980s some compilers could detect a specific mathematical operation used in a well-known floating-point benchmark and replace the operation with a faster mathematically equivalent operation. However, such a transformation was rarely useful outside the benchmark until the mid-1990s, when [[RISC]] and [[VLIW]] architectures emphasized the importance of [[compiler]] technology as it related to performance. Benchmarks are now regularly used by [[compiler]] companies to improve not only their own benchmark scores, but real application performance.

CPUs that have many execution units — such as a [[superscalar]] CPU, a [[VLIW]] CPU, or a [[reconfigurable computing]] CPU — typically have slower clock rates than a sequential CPU with one or two execution units when built from transistors that are just as fast. Nevertheless, CPUs with many execution units often complete real-world and benchmark tasks in less time than the supposedly faster high-clock-rate CPU.

Given the large number of benchmarks available, a manufacturer can usually find at least one benchmark that shows its system will outperform another system; the other systems can be shown to excel with a different benchmark.

Manufacturers commonly report only those benchmarks (or aspects of benchmarks) that show their products in the best light. They also have been known to mis-represent the significance of benchmarks, again to show their products in the best possible light. Taken together, these practices are called ''bench-marketing.''

Ideally benchmarks should only substitute for real applications if the application is unavailable, or too difficult or costly to port to a specific processor or computer system. If performance is critical, the only benchmark that matters is the target environment's application suite.

== Challenges ==
Benchmarking is not easy and often involves several iterative rounds in order to arrive at predictable, useful conclusions. Interpretation of benchmarking data is also extraordinarily difficult. Here is a partial list of common challenges:

* Vendors tend to tune their products specifically for industry-standard benchmarks. Norton SysInfo (SI) is particularly easy to tune for, since it mainly biased toward the speed of multiple operations. Use extreme caution in interpreting such results.
* Some vendors have been accused of "cheating" at benchmarks — doing things that give much higher benchmark numbers, but make things worse on the actual likely workload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/111012/nvidias_benchmark_tactics_reassessed.html|title=NVidia's Benchmark Tactics Reassessed|first=Tom|last=Krazit|year=2003|work=IDG News|access-date=2009-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606032058/http://www.pcworld.com/article/111012/nvidias_benchmark_tactics_reassessed.html|archive-date=2011-06-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many benchmarks focus entirely on the speed of [[computer performance|computational performance]], neglecting other important features of a computer system, such as:
** Qualities of service, aside from raw performance. Examples of unmeasured qualities of service include security, availability, reliability, execution integrity, serviceability, scalability (especially the ability to quickly and nondisruptively add or reallocate capacity), etc. There are often real trade-offs between and among these qualities of service, and all are important in business computing. [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]] Benchmark specifications partially address these concerns by specifying [[ACID]] property tests, database scalability rules, and service level requirements.
** In general, benchmarks do not measure [[Total cost of ownership]]. Transaction Processing Performance Council Benchmark specifications partially address this concern by specifying that a price/performance metric must be reported in addition to a raw performance metric, using a simplified [[Total cost of ownership|TCO]] formula. However, the costs are necessarily only partial, and vendors have been known to price specifically (and only) for the benchmark, designing a highly specific "benchmark special" configuration with an artificially low price. Even a tiny deviation from the benchmark package results in a much higher price in real world experience.
** Facilities burden (space, power, and cooling). When more power is used, a portable system will have a shorter battery life and require recharging more often. A server that consumes more power and/or space may not be able to fit within existing data center resource constraints, including cooling limitations. There are real trade-offs as most semiconductors require more power to switch faster. See also [[performance per watt]].
** In some embedded systems, where memory is a significant cost, better [[code density]] can significantly reduce costs.
* Vendor benchmarks tend to ignore requirements for development, test, and [[disaster recovery]] computing capacity. Vendors only like to report what might be narrowly required for production capacity in order to make their initial acquisition price seem as low as possible.
* Benchmarks are having trouble adapting to widely distributed servers, particularly those with extra sensitivity to network topologies. The emergence of [[grid computing]], in particular, complicates benchmarking since some workloads are "grid friendly", while others are not.
* Users can have very different perceptions of performance than benchmarks may suggest. In particular, users appreciate predictability — servers that always meet or exceed [[service level agreement]]s. Benchmarks tend to emphasize mean scores (IT perspective), rather than maximum worst-case response times ([[real-time computing]] perspective), or low standard deviations (user perspective).
* Many server architectures degrade dramatically at high (near 100%) levels of usage — "fall off a cliff" — and benchmarks should (but often do not) take that factor into account. Vendors, in particular, tend to publish server benchmarks at continuous at about 80% usage — an unrealistic situation — and do not document what happens to the overall system when demand spikes beyond that level.
* Many benchmarks focus on one application, or even one application tier, to the exclusion of other applications. Most data centers are now implementing [[Hardware virtualization|virtualization]] extensively for a variety of reasons, and benchmarking is still catching up to that reality where multiple applications and application tiers are concurrently running on consolidated servers.
* There are few (if any) high quality benchmarks that help measure the performance of batch computing, especially high volume concurrent batch and online computing. [[Batch computing]] tends to be much more focused on the predictability of completing long-running tasks correctly before deadlines, such as end of month or end of fiscal year. Many important core business processes are batch-oriented and probably always will be, such as billing.
* Benchmarking institutions often disregard or do not follow basic scientific method. This includes, but is not limited to: small sample size, lack of variable control, and the limited repeatability of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donutey.com/hardwaretesting.php|title=Hardware Testing and Benchmarking Methodology|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-24|first=Kevin|last=Castor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031133/http://www.donutey.com/hardwaretesting.php|archivedate=2008-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bodleian-Douce Atlas''' is an early 15th-century  nautical [[atlas]] by an anonymous [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer, currently held (MS Douce 390) by the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]], UK.

The atlas was made by an anonymous [[Italy|Italian]] [[cartographer]] in the early 15th century.  No attribution to known cartographers or place of origin. Venice and Genoa have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;T. Campbell, (2011:[http://www.maphistory.info/PortolanAttributions.html#15early 15th early])&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bodleian-Douce Atlas is currently held (Ms. Douce 390) by the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[Oxford]], UK.

The Bodleian-Douce atlas is composed of six [[portolan chart]]s, with each chart covering two folios:  
* P.1 - Black Sea.
* P.2 - East Mediterranean
* P.3 - Adriatic Sea and Sicily
* P.4 - Central Mediterranean
* p.&amp;nbsp;5 - West Mediterranean and northwest Africa down to Mogador
* p.&amp;nbsp;6. - North Atlantic (including British isles)

'''Broad Ripple Park Carousel'''{{efn|Also known as '''White City Carousel''' and '''Children's Museum Carousel'''.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;}} is an antique [[carousel]] in [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. It was installed in 1917 at [[White City (Indianapolis)|an amusement park]] near the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the [[Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation]]. The animals were carved by the [[Dentzel Carousel Company]] some time before 1900 but were assembled by the [[William F. Mangels]] carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.

The Children's Museum of Indianapolis acquired its first two carved animals from the ride in 1965, and the last few wooden animals in 1973. The museum planned to sell some to finance the restoration of others until the director of the museum, Mildred Compton, was convinced by carousel enthusiasts that the museum should instead restore all the animals and recreate the working carousel. Restoration of the carved animals began in 1966 and was only finished with the restoration of the entire carousel in 1977. No space had been allocated for the display of such a large exhibit in the museum's planned new building, which meant some re-designing was necessary to allow its installation on the fifth floor. A 1919 [[Wurlitzer]] [[Fairground Organ|band organ]] model #146-B, a type manufactured only for carousels, was also installed. As restored, the carousel is {{convert|42|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide and has a total of 42 animals, including&amp;nbsp;– as well as the usual horses&amp;nbsp;– goats, giraffes, deer, a lion, and a tiger. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987.

==History==

===Background===
{{see also|White City (Indianapolis)}}

The Broad Ripple Park Carousel was installed in 1917 in an amusement park on the outskirts of Indianapolis, Indiana. The [[White City (Indianapolis)|White City Amusement Park]] had been established in 1906 in what is now [[Broad Ripple Village]], alongside the White River. In 1908 a fire caused damage throughout the park, and only the swimming pool remained unscathed.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia353&gt;Vanderstel and Zeigler "Broad Ripple Park" ''Encyclopedia of Indianapolis'' pp. 353–354&lt;/ref&gt; The park closed for three years until its purchase by the [[Union Traction Company]], which restored it and operated it for eleven years. The carousel was installed during the Union Traction Company's ownership.  The park was sold in May 1922 to the new Broad Ripple Amusement Park Association, and renamed Broad Ripple Park. In 1927 the park was sold again,&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia353/&gt; and changed hands once more in 1938.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; The Board of Parks Commission of Indianapolis bought the property on May&amp;nbsp;18, 1945, paying $131,500 (approximately ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|131500|1945|r=-2}} }} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for the {{convert|60|acre|0|adj=on|abbr=off}} tract, and turned the property into a general-use park, destroying all rides it could not sell.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia353/&gt;{{Inflation-fn|US}} The board's original plan was to sell the carousel and the narrow-gauge railway rides.&lt;ref name=Junk&gt;McCord "City to Junk Ripple Rides" ''Indianapolis Star''&lt;/ref&gt; Only the carousel remained in Indianapolis after it was unsold;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia353/&gt; the steam locomotive is now at the [[Indiana Transportation Museum]] at [[Noblesville, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=BRPark&gt;Indy Parks and Recreation "[http://www.indygov.org/eGov/City/DPR/Parks/List/Pages/BroadRipplePark.aspx Broad Ripple Park] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628181005/http://www.indygov.org/eGov/City/DPR/Parks/List/Pages/BroadRipplePark.aspx |date=June 28, 2011 }}" ''Indy Parks''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Installation===
The carousel was commissioned by William Hubbs,&lt;ref name=CMC&gt;Crandell "Children's Museum Carousel" ''Merry-Go-Roundup'' pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], sometime before 1900.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Mummy186&gt;Kriplen ''Keep an Eye on that Mummy'' p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|If the previous carousel has been correctly identified, it then went to Virginia and then to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] after leaving Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Mummy186/&gt;}}

Nothing is known of the history of the animals before their installation in the 1917 carousel assembly.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; During the 1960s newspaper reports stated that it was believed that the animals had arrived in Indianapolis in 1917, imported from Germany by two brothers named Mangels,&lt;ref name=Casler/&gt; but later research revealed the animals were manufactured by the Dentzel carousel company.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Also included in the installation were oil paintings on the canopy over the animals and mechanism.&lt;ref name=Casler/&gt;

Part of the installation appears to have involved the retrofitting of some animals to fit the Mangels mechanism. During this process some of the animals, which were carved in stationary or standing positions and thus not meant to be "jumpers" (animals that moved up and down), were modified to allow them to move.&lt;ref name=Manns33&gt;Manns, et al. ''Painted Ponies'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

===Park usage===
[[File:Childrensmuseumgirafferow.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A row of giraffes was always part of one of Dentzel's carousels, as they were his favorite animal.]]
Between 1917 and 1938 the carousel was located near the White City park pool, in an enclosed building with numerous large windows.  In 1938, after the park was purchased by William McCurry,&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; the ride was enclosed within an unwalled pavilion with a domed roof and moved to the area of the park set aside as a children's playground.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; The carousel was operated as a [[Concession (contract)|concession]], which one operator, William Hubbs,{{efn|It is not clear if this is the same man as the former owner of the park or not.}} held for almost 10&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Pursuit&gt;Vanderstel and Zeigler ''In Pursuit of Leisure Time'' pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

The park district does not appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Casler/&gt; The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Pursuit/&gt; Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The [[Indianapolis Art Center|Indianapolis Art League]] objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with [[List of Disney animated characters|Disney character]]s.&lt;ref name=Casler/&gt;

The domed pavilion housing the mechanism collapsed in 1956, destroying the mechanism and the sweeps that supported the animals.  The park district disposed of the destroyed mechanical parts and stored the animals.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; In 1961 the giraffes, along with other animals from the carousel, were used in a Christmas display at [[University Park (Indianapolis, Indiana)#University Park|University Park]] in Indianapolis. During this time, discussions began between the park district and the [[Indianapolis Zoological Society]] about the possibility of the Zoological Society acquiring the animals for use in its children's zoo section.&lt;ref name=Casler&gt;Casler "Children's Zoo May Get Carousel From the City" ''Indianapolis Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1962 newspaper reports stated that the animals were to be donated to the zoo, for installation in the main zoo; the zoo planned to purchase a smaller merry-go-round for the children's zoo.&lt;ref name=Gets&gt;Staff "Zoo to have City's Prized Carousel" ''Indianapolis Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The animals were apparently still being offered to the zoo in December 1963, as a newspaper story announced that the park district had just given the zoo authorization to use the carousel parts, and volunteers were being sought to restore the animals. The president of the Zoological Society described the animals as "bigger and more realistically colored, and more intricately detailed, sturdier, and they have more different kinds of animals than that aluminum junk they throw out today".&lt;ref name=Kingan&gt;Kingan "Zoo Wants to Reclaim Old Indianapolis Merry-Go-Round" ''Indianapolis Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by the museum===
[[File:Childrensmuseumindianpolisgoatsoncarousel.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of the heads of the row of goats]]
In 1965 The Children's Museum of Indianapolis,&lt;ref name=App/&gt; then located in a building at 30th and Meridian Streets,&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; acquired two horses from the carousel.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Mildred Compton, the museum director, had seen the carousel in Broad Ripple Park before 1952, and hoped to secure the surviving animals, but the park district was initially unwilling to part with more than two, as the district was using five or six animals in the annual Christmas displays at [[Monument Circle]]. During the first half of 1966, the two horses were refinished by a museum volunteer. Both were stripped of old paint, one was repainted, and the other was refinished with lemon oil to feature the carvings on the animal. Compton obtained real horse tails from an Indianapolis slaughterhouse to replace the lost originals. By September 1966 the two horses were ready for display in the museum's front entrance.&lt;ref name=Mummy187&gt;Kriplen ''Keep an Eye on that Mummy'' pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

The park district allowed the museum to use one of the surviving giraffes in a booth at a fall festival held at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=Mummy187/&gt;{{efn|During the festival, the large number of children around the giraffe caused the animal to fall over and its head broke off.&lt;ref name=Mummy187/&gt;}} The museum subsequently acquired most of the remaining animals in 1969, after a search through the storage building containing the animals.  The animals and parts of animals had to be searched for in corners and under boxes in the park district storage building.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt;{{efn|Originally, the animals were considered a loan from the park district, but after the new museum building was completed the park district officially donated them.&lt;ref name=Mummy189/&gt;}} Besides a large number of horses, 2&amp;nbsp;more giraffes, a lion, and a tiger were found. Photographs of the animals were sent to Frederic Fried, an expert in carousels, who confirmed that the animals were made in the United States, not Germany, probably before 1900. He also confirmed that they were carved by the Dentzel company.&lt;ref name=Mummy189&gt;Kriplen ''Keep an Eye on that Mummy'' pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum intended to keep a few of the animals and sell the others to finance its operations,&lt;ref name=App/&gt; but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National Carousel Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt;

While plans were under way to secure funding for the restoration of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.&lt;ref name=Mummy191&gt;Kriplen ''Keep an Eye on that Mummy'' pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
[[File:Childrensmuseumcarouselblackhorsehead.jpg|thumb|left|The head of one of the carousel's horses]]

The mechanical parts were assembled in the fifth-floor area in November 1975,&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; using a non-original Mangel-Illions mechanism. A Wurlitzer carousel organ, which had belonged to an amusement park in [[San Francisco]], was added. Before it was installed in the Children's Museum, the organ was refurbished and rebuilt&lt;ref name=App&gt;Charleton "{{NHLS url|id=87000839|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Broad Ripple Park ("White City") Carousel / Children's Museum Carousel}}"&lt;/ref&gt; by Carval Stoots of [[Plainfield, Indiana]], in 1976.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt;

An artist from Pennsylvania recreated the upper outside panels in the style of the carousels of the period around the time of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=App/&gt; The carvings on the panels were provided by Allen and Rita Orre of Ohio and the International Amusement Devices Company of Ohio; the mirrors were produced by an Indianapolis glass firm. The scenery panels were initially some discovered Dentzel company panels, and these were used in 1976 and 1977 while replica Mangels-Illions-style panels were built in the museum's shops.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt;

The animals were restored between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The Von Steins were experienced with other types of museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no attempt was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt;

===Changes since initial restoration===
The original engine propelling the carousel was a [[belt (mechanical)|belt-driven]] mechanism, but after the initial restoration it was exchanged for a [[Hydraulic drive system|fluid drive]] provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio,{{efn|The source used for this information spells the company name "Kissell", but the company itself uses "Kissel".&lt;ref name=Kissel&gt;Kissel Brothers Shows "[http://www.kisselbros.com/our-history/ About Us]"&lt;/ref&gt;}} who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. The animals are removed one at a time from the carousel for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt;

The carousel was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 1987,&lt;ref name=NHL&gt;Staff "[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1990&amp;ResourceType=Structure Broad Ripple Park Carousel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010180615/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1990&amp;ResourceType=Structure |date=2012-10-10 }}" ''National Historic Landmarks Program''&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Historic Landmarks Program assessed its condition as "satisfactory" in 2008.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt; The carousel is one of the largest displayed artifacts in the museum, and is available to be ridden by visitors.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;Children's Museum of Indianapolis "[https://web.archive.org/web/20131009024916/http://www.childrensmuseum.org/carousel Carousel Wishes and Dreams]"&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Carousel composition==
The carousel is one of the three oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels.{{efn|The other two are the [[Spencer Park Dentzel Carousel]] in [[Logansport, Indiana]] and the [[Highland Park Dentzel Carousel and Shelter Building|Highland Park Dentzel Carousel]] in [[Meridian, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=App/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt; Thirty-one of its 42&amp;nbsp;wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger.&lt;ref name=Census/&gt; The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels,&lt;ref name=Manns42&gt;Manns, et al. ''Painted Ponies'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes.&lt;ref name=Manns48&gt;Manns, et al. ''Painted Ponies'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The animals are arranged in three circles around the central mechanism,&lt;ref name=Census&gt;National Carousel Association "[http://nca-usa.org/census/census-CLA.html Census of Classic Wood Carousels: The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]"&lt;/ref&gt; alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18&amp;nbsp;jumping animals,&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;

The mechanism powering the ride is a {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, but it is uncertain whether this exactly matches the original Mangels-Illions mechanism.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; The whole assembly has a diameter of {{convert|42|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=CMC/&gt; The organ, a 1919 Wurlitzer carousel organ model #146-B, is of a type designed specifically for carousels.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;

The '''California Academy of Sciences''' is a research institute and  [[natural history museum]] in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], that is among the largest [[List of natural history museums|museums of natural history]] in the world, housing over 26 million specimens.&lt;ref name="AcademyAbout"/&gt; The Academy began in 1853 as a learned society and still carries out a large amount of original research.&lt;ref name="AcademyHistory"/&gt; It is California's oldest museum.

Completely rebuilt in 2008, the building covers {{convert|400000|ft2|m2|lk=on|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="AcademyAbout"/&gt;
The primary building in Golden Gate Park reopened on September 27, 2008.&lt;ref name=Wollan2008/&gt;

==Governance==
The California Academy of Sciences, California's oldest operating museum and research institution for the natural sciences, is governed by a forty-one member Board of Trustees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/leadership Board of Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt; who are nominated and chosen by the [[California Academy of Sciences Fellows]].  The Academy Fellows&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/pdf/fellows_fy2015.pdf The Academy Fellows]&lt;/ref&gt; are, in turn, "[n]ominated by their colleagues and appointed by the Board of Trustees...the Fellows remain members of the Fellowship for life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/scientists/academy-fellows Fellows of the California Academy of Sciences].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Board of Trustees are then responsible for appointing the executive management of the Academy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/leadership Academy Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn are responsible for overseeing the Academy's overall operation and the hiring of its other managers and employees.

===Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability (IBSS)===
Besides its world-renowned function as source of public science education through its museum, the California Academy of Sciences also operates the prestigious ''Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability'' (IBSS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/scientists Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; as its research arm, contributing some of the world's most important research in the fields of taxonomy, phylogenetics, and biodiversity studies.  Although one aspect of the IBSS is available for view by museum patrons at the science "project lab" exhibit, most of the research happens in laboratories and facilities "behind the scenes" and not observable by the public.  In fact, unbeknownst to most patrons, research and administrative facilities occupy nearly 50% of the Academy's physical structure.

==Public education==

Prior to being replaced, the old Academy building attracted approximately half a million visitors each year.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} As has been the case from the start, the main thrust of the exhibits is natural history. The main venues of the museum include the following:&lt;ref name="AcademyExhibits"/&gt;
*'''Kimball Natural History Museum''' - generally encompasses the entire museum outside the planetarium, rainforest, and aquarium, and comprises Africa Hall (the Academy's oldest running exhibit), the East Wing (which includes the Foulcault pendulum, also a carry-over exhibit from the older, pre-2008 renovation of the Academy), the West Wing (which currently houses several geophysical exhibits), the science "Project Lab" which features real, live scientists working on real, live research projects and who can be viewed doing their work from outside the lab by public visitors, as well as several smaller exhibits distributed throughout the remainder of the Academy building.
*'''Morrison Planetarium''' - features the world's largest completely digital [[planetarium]] dome measuring in at 27.5 metres (90&amp;nbsp;ft.) in diameter with a 23-metre (75-foot) diameter screen
*'''Rainforests of the World''' - [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|rainforest]] exhibit enclosed in a {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} glass dome
*'''Steinhart Aquarium''' - includes exhibits of coral reef, tidepool, and swamp habitats; as well as a colony of [[African penguin]]s

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2012}}

===Early years===
The ''California Academy of Natural Sciences'' was founded in 1853, only three years after California joined the United States, becoming the first society of its kind in the [[Western United States|Western US]]. Its stated aim was to undertake "a thorough systematic survey of every portion of the State and the collection of a cabinet of her rare and rich productions."{{citation needed|date=May 2013|reason=Unsourced quotation.}} It was renamed as the more inclusive ''California Academy of Sciences'' in 1868.

The Academy had a forward-thinking direction to the involvement of women in science, passing a resolution in its first year of existence that the members "highly approve of the aid of females in every department of natural science, and invite their cooperation."{{citation needed|date=May 2012|reason=Unsourced quotation.}} This policy led to several women being hired into professional positions as [[botany|botanists]], [[entomology|entomologists]], and other occupations during the 19th century, when opportunities for women in the sciences were limited, and often, those that existed were restricted to menial cataloging and calculation work.  In 1892, [[Alice Eastwood]], a [[botanist]], was hired by the Academy and worked there until she retired in 1949. She created the collection of rare plants, which was saved when the Academy was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34735963|title=Multicultural women of science: three centuries of contributions : with hands-on activities and exercises for the school year|last=Bernstein|first=Leonard|last2=Winkler|first2=Alan|last3=Zierdt-Warshaw|first3=Linda|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Peoples Pub. Group|isbn=1562567020|location=Maywood, NJ.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy's first official museum opened in 1874 at the corner of California and Dupont Streets (now Grant Avenue) in what is now [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], and drew up to 80,000 visitors a year.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} To accommodate its increasing popularity, the Academy moved to a new and larger building on Market Street in 1891, funded by the legacy of [[James Lick]], a 19th-century San Francisco real estate mogul, [[entrepreneur]], and [[philanthropist]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} 

However only fifteen years later, the Market Street facility fell victim to the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and three days of fire, which also wiped out all but a wheelbarrow full of the Academy's library and specimen collections.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the widespread destruction occurring in the aftermath of the quake, Academy curators and staffers only were able to retrieve a single cart of materials, including Academy minute books, membership records, and 2,000 [[type specimen]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2013|reason=Unsourced. Previous source here not reliable.}} The 1905-1906 scientific collecting expedition to the [[Galápagos Islands]] (the first of several sponsored by the academy to the archipelago) already was underway, and it returned seven months later, providing replacement collections for those lost.&lt;ref name=James2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Matthew J.|title=The boat, the bay, and the museum|url=https://www.sonoma.edu/geology/docs/JAMES_BoatBayMuseum.pdf|publisher=Routledge, London|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Gate Park site===
In 1916, the Academy moved to the North American Hall of Birds and Mammals in [[Golden Gate Park]], the first building on the site that was to become its permanent home.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013|reason=Source date, building name, reason for moving}} In 1923, the Steinhart Aquarium was added, followed in 1934 by the Simson African Hall.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013|reason=Source dates}}

During [[World War II]], the Academy contributed to the American war effort by using its workshop facilities to repair optical and navigational equipment for [[United States Navy]] ships; San Francisco was a major port for the [[Pacific War]] arena.

The post-war years saw a flurry of new construction on the site; the Science Hall was added in 1951, followed by the Morrison Planetarium in 1952. The Morrison Planetarium was the seventh major [[planetarium]] to open in the United States and featured a one-of-a-kind [[Planetarium projector|star projector]], built by Academy staff members (in part using the expertise gained doing the optical work for the US Navy during World War II).

The Academy Projector produced a remarkably natural-looking star field. It projected irregularly shaped stars, rather than the circular stars projected by many optical star projectors. The irregular shapes were created by placing variously sized grains of [[silicon carbide]] onto the glass star plates by hand, then [[Thin-film deposition|aluminizing]] the plates, and brushing away the silicon carbide grains.  

In 1959, the Malliard Library, Eastwood Hall of Botany, and Livermore Room all were added. Throughout the 1960s, universities concentrating on the new field of [[molecular biology]] divested themselves of their traditional specimen collections, entrusting them to the Academy and leading to a rapid growth of the Academy's holdings.

In 1969, another new building, Cowell Hall, was added to the site. In 1976, several new galleries were opened, and the following year, in 1977, the "fish roundabout" was constructed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Prior to the old building being torn down in 2005, there was a ''Life through Time'' gallery, housing a large display on [[evolution]] and [[paleontology]]. There was a Gem and Mineral Hall, a section on Earthquakes, and a [[Gary Larson]] exhibit.

==Earthquake damage and new building==

The Academy buildings were damaged significantly in the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]]. Subsequently, the Bird Hall building was closed to ensure public safety. The [[Earthquake engineering|inadequately engineered]] Steinhart Aquarium suffered dramatic seismic damage from the 1989 earthquake, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-the-california-academy-of-sciences.htm |title=What is the California Academy of Sciences? |publisher=Wisegeek.net |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As plans were made to repair the damage and make the [[building]]s seismically stable, it was realized that a considerable amount of work would be needed to bring the buildings [[Seismic retrofit|up to modern standards]]. This led to the idea of giving the Academy a complete overhaul, thus motivating the closing of the main site.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Construction began on the new $500 million building on September 12, 2005, while the exhibits were moved to 875 Howard Street for a temporary museum.&lt;ref name=ArchNewsNow&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bridge Between: California Academy of Sciences and Steinhart Aquarium Transition Facility by Melander Architects|url=http://www.archnewsnow.com/features/Feature245.htm|website=ArchNewsNow|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy reopened with a free day on September 27, 2008. For most of the day the line for admittance was over a mile (nearly two kilometers) long, and although over 15,000 people were admitted, several thousands more had to be turned away.&lt;ref name="SfGateOpening"/&gt;

==Environmental design of new building==
[[File:Piazza behind the Main Entrance of the California Academy of Sciences.jpg|thumb|The piazza behind the main entrance is flooded with natural light]]

The design [[architect]] for the museum replacement project was [[Renzo Piano]]. His design was awarded the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Award for Excellence for the Americas region in 2008,&lt;ref name="ULIaward"/&gt; as well as the [[Holcim Awards for Sustainable Construction|Holcim Award]] Silver for sustainable construction projects in the North America region in 2005.&lt;ref name="Globe2005"/&gt;  One critic praised the building as a "blazingly uncynical embrace of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values of truth and reason", and a "comforting reminder of the civilizing function of great art in a barbaric age".&lt;ref name=NYT2008/&gt;

The new building is at the forefront of [[environmentally friendly]] design, in keeping with the Academy's focus on ecological concerns and environmental sustainability. It received [[Leed Gold|Platinum]] certification under the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program.&lt;ref name="LEEDS"/&gt; As a result of its environmentally friendly design and other unique features, this project was featured on the [[Discovery Channel]] ''[[Extreme Engineering]]'' series in 2006&lt;ref name="DiscoveryEpisode"/&gt; and on the [[National Geographic Channel]] ''Man-Made'' series in July 2008.&lt;ref name="NGCepisode"/&gt;

The new building includes an array of environmentally friendly features.&lt;ref name="CaliMag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chino2008"/&gt;
*Produces 50 percent less waste water than previously
*Recycles rainwater for irrigation
*Uses 60,000 [[photovoltaic cell]]s
*Supports a [[green roof]] with an area of {{convert|2.5|acre|ha|lk=on|abbr=off}}
*Uses natural lighting in 90 percent of occupied spaces
*Was constructed of over {{convert|20000|cuyd|m3}} of recycled [[concrete]]
*Construction includes 11 million [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (5,000 t) of recycled [[steel]]
*Wall insulation made from [[scrap]]s of recycled [[denim]]

===Green roof===
The California Academy of Science green roof has several environmentally friendly features, as well as [[sustainable design]]. Renzo Piano was inspired by seven major hills of San Francisco, which typically refers to: [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], [[Nob Hill]], [[Russian Hill]], [[Rincon Hill]], [[Mount Sutro]], [[Twin Peaks]] and [[Mount Davidson (California)|Mount Davidson]]. The living green roof was planted with 1.7 million [[California native plants]]. The museum's central piazza lies beneath a massive glass ceiling in the roof, which opens to allow cool night air to flow into the building below; by using this kind of [[natural ventilation]] instead of air conditioning to regulate interior temperature, the building becomes more energy efficient. Renzo Piano and SWA Group won the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) Award in design in 2009.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''Courtauld Institute of Art''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɔər|t|əʊ|l|d|}}), commonly referred to as '''The Courtauld''', is a self-governing college of the [[University of London]] specialising in the study of the [[history of art]] and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]]. It is among the most prestigious institutions in the world for these disciplines and is widely known for the disproportionate number of directors of major museums drawn from its small body of alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaplin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Sociology and Visual Representation|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415073626|pages=53-56}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spect/&gt; 

The art collection of the Institute is known particularly for its [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings and is housed in the [[Courtauld Gallery]]. 

The Institute and the Gallery are both in [[Somerset House]], in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]].

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], the diplomat and collector [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Lord Lee of Fareham]], and the art historian Sir [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Robert Witt]]. 

Originally the Courtauld Institute was based in [[Home House]], a [[Robert Adam]]-designed townhouse in London's [[Portman Square]].  The Strand block of Somerset House, designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] from 1775–1780, has housed the Courtauld Institute since 1989. The Courtauld celebrated its 75th anniversary during the 2007–08 academic year.

==Academic profile==
The Courtauld Institute of Art is the major centre for the study of the history and conservation of art and architecture in the United Kingdom. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate teaching to around 400 students each year.&lt;ref name=court2/&gt; Degrees are awarded by the University of London.

The Courtauld was ranked first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in ''[[The Guardian]]'' 's 2011 University Guide and was confirmed in this rank for research quality in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref/&gt; [[The Independent]] has called it "probably the most prestigious specialist college for the study of the history of art in the world."&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

The Courtauld was ranked, again, first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in ''[[The Guardian]]''’s 2017 University Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2016/may/23/university-league-tables-2017#S345|title=University University league tables 2017 – the full rankings|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

According to the 2014 [[Research Excellence Framework]], the Courtauld hosts the highest proportion of the UK's world-leading and internationally excellent research out of all higher education institutions with 95% of research rated in the top two categories (4*/3*), 56% of which was rated in the 4* category, tied for highest in the UK with [[London Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/dec/18/university-research-excellence-framework-2014-full-rankings|title=University Research Excellence Framework 2014 – the full rankings|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate study===
The only undergraduate course offered by the Courtauld is a BA in the History of Art. This is a full-time course designed to introduce students to all aspects of the study of western art.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Postgraduate study===

Several taught courses are offered at postgraduate level: [[master's degrees]] in history of art, [[curator|curating]] the [[art museum]], the history of [[Buddhist art]], and the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of [[mural|wall painting]] are taught alongside diploma courses in the conservation of easel paintings and the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courtauld.ac.uk/study/postgraduate|title=Postgraduate Taught Courses|work= The Courtauld Institute of Art|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the history of art master's programme have to choose a specialisation ranging from antiquity to early modern to global contemporary artwork.

The Courtauld has two photographic libraries which started as the private collections of two benefactors: the Conway Library, covering [[architecture (built environment)|architecture]], architectural drawings, sculpture and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, named after the [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Lord Conway of Allington]] and the Witt Library, after [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Sir Robert Witt]], covering paintings, drawings and [[engraving]]s and containing over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists.&lt;ref name=court3/&gt; In 2009, it was decided that the Witt Library would not continue to add new material to the collection.&lt;ref name=artlyst/&gt; The book library is one of the UK's largest archives of art history books, periodicals and exhibition catalogues. There is a slide library which also covers films, and an IT suite.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

An online image collection provides access to more than 40,000 images, including paintings and drawings from the Courtauld Gallery, and over 35,000 photographs of architecture and sculpture from the Conway Library.&lt;ref name=artandarch/&gt; Two other websites and sell high resolution digital files to scholars, publishers and broadcasters, and photographic prints to a wide public audience.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=prints/&gt;

The Courtauld uses a [[virtual learning environment]] to deliver course material to its students.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt; Since 2004, the Courtauld has published an annual research journal, [[immediations]], edited by current members of the research student body. Each cover of the journal has been commissioned by a leading contemporary artist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The art collection of the Institute is housed in the Courtauld Gallery. The collection was begun by the founder of the Institute, [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], who presented an extensive collection of mainly [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings in 1932. It was enhanced by further gifts in the 1930s and a bequest in 1948, and has since received many significant donations and bequests. The Gallery contains some 530 paintings and over 26,000 drawings and prints.&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;

The Courtauld Gallery is open to the public. Since 1989 it has been housed in the Strand block of Somerset House, which was the first home of the [[Royal Academy]], founded in 1768. In April 2013 the Head of the Courtauld Gallery was [[Ernst Vegelin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1242">'''Elbow witches''' are old women with [[Bradawl|awls]] in their elbows in the [[Ojibwa]] story of [[Aayaase]] (also known as "Aayaash" or "Iyash"), "Filcher-of-Meat". Blinded by cooking smoke, the sisters killed each other in their attempts to kill him for their meal.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, William (1917-19). ''Ojibwa Texts'', vol. ii. Truman Michelson, ed. Leyden, New York: G. E. Stechert &amp; co., pp. 380-393&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Elbow Witch is [[Monster in My Pocket]] #63, one of only three monsters derived from Native American mythology, the others being [[Wendigo]] and (to an extent) [[Bigfoot]].  The character's awls look very much like [[tusk]]s.

An '''etymological dictionary''' discusses the [[etymology]] of the words listed. Often, large dictionaries, such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's]]'', will contain some etymological information, without aspiring to focus on etymology.

Etymological dictionaries are the product of research in [[historical linguistics]]. For a large number of words in any language, the etymology will be uncertain, disputed, or simply unknown. In such cases, depending on the space available, an etymological dictionary will present various suggestions and perhaps make a judgement on their likelihood, and provide references to a full discussion in specialist literature.

The tradition of compiling "derivations" of words is pre-modern, found for example in Indian (''[[nirukta]]''), Arabic (''[[Ishtiqaq (disambiguation)|al-ištiqāq]]''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;) and also in Western tradition (in works such as the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''). Etymological dictionaries in the modern sense, however, appear only in the late 18th century (with 17th-century predecessors such as [[Gerardus Vossius|Vossius]]' 1662 ''Etymologicum linguae Latinae'' or [[Stephen Skinner (lexicographer)|Stephen Skinner]]'s 1671 ''Etymologicon Linguae Anglicanae''), with the understanding of [[sound law]]s and [[language change]] and their production was an important task of the "golden age of [[philology]]" in the 19th century.

The '''Fernand Léger Museum''', {{lang-fr|'''Musée national Fernand Léger'''|italic=no}}, is a French national museum in [[Biot, Alpes-Maritimes]], in south-eastern France. It is dedicated to the work of the twentieth-century artist [[Fernand Léger]]. Although originally privately owned, it is now a state museum entitled to style itself [[Musée de France]].

==History==
In 1955, Fernand Léger bought a villa in Biot, called Mas Saint-Andre, and died soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.parisdigest.com/french_riviera/leger_museum_biot.htm|title= Leger Museum in Biot. Facts. Visits.|author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was built on the property after the death of the artist in 1955 by [[Nadia Léger]] and {{ill|Georges Bauquier|fr}}, to designs by the architect [[Andreï Svetchine]]; an earlier design by [[Paul Nelson (architect)|Paul Nelson]] had been rejected. Construction began in 1957, and the museum opened in 1960.{{r|self}} The gardens were designed by [[Henri Fish]] and contain sculptures based on Léger's work.{{r|self2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7234">The '''Frankfurter Opern- und Museumsorchester''' ''(Frankfurt Opera House and Museum's Orchestra)'' is the resident [[orchestra]] of the [[Frankfurt Opera]] in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], Hesse, Germany. Its somewhat peculiar name is derived from the series of "[[Museum]] Concerts", organized by the Frankfurter Museumsgesellschaft since 1808. The orchestra is ranked as an "A-list" ensemble under the German TVK regulations. Its music director and principal conductor is [[Sebastian Weigle]].

== History and repertory ==
With a history spanning more than 200 years, the Frankfurter Opern- und Museumsorchester is one of Germany's oldest symphonic ensembles. It was founded in the late 18th century as the orchestra of the [[Frankfurt Opera|Frankfurt Municipal Opera]]. In addition to playing in the opera house, the orchestra maintains a series of 10 subscription programs per season (each played twice, on Sundays 11 a.m. and Mondays 8 p.m. CET, respectively), performed at the [[Alte Oper]] Frankfurt - the former opera house that is now run as a concert hall.

From the very beginning, the orchestra attracted top-of-the-line conductors and musicians. Noted German composer-violinist [[Louis Spohr]] was the second principal conductor (1817-1819) of the Museumsorchester; his successors included such luminaries as [[Clemens Krauss]], [[William Steinberg]], [[Franz Konwitschny]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Christoph von Dohnányi]] and [[Michael Gielen]].

Other notable conductors and composers who led the orchestra have included, from the late 19th century, [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Arthur Nikisch]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Hermann Abendroth]], [[Bruno Walter]] and [[George Szell]]. The orchestra has played the [[Frankfurt Opera#Premieres|premieres of several operas]].

Richard Strauss' large-scale tone-poems ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' and ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' were both premiered by the Frankfurter Opern- und Museumsorchester.

Many leading soloists have appeared with the orchestra, beginning with [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Clara Schumann]] in the 19th century. From 1915 to 1923, distinguished composer-violist [[Paul Hindemith]] served as [[concertmaster]] of the Opern- and Museumsorchester. Its repertoire includes major operatic and symphonic works from [[Baroque]] to contemporary music.

In the 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 seasons, the Museumsorchester was voted one of the three top German opera orchestras in the country, selected by the leading operatic magazines in Germany. For the 2007/2008 season, the noted German periodical ''Die deutsche Bühne'' voted the Frankfurt Opera the best opera house in Germany. Finally, in 2009, the respected music-industry magazine ''[[Opernwelt]]'' voted the Opern- und Museumsorchester ''Orchestra of the Year'' among all the German opera- and theatre orchestras, an honour the orchestra shares with the [[Bayerisches Staatsorchester]]; in both 2010 and 2011 the orchestra was again named "Orchestra of the Year".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2037">The '''Gotha Program''' was the [[party platform]] adopted by the nascent [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) at its initial [[party congress]], held in the town of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] in 1875. The program called for [[universal suffrage]], [[freedom of association]], limits on the [[working day]], and for other laws protecting the [[worker's rights|rights and health of workers]].&lt;ref name="gotha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111gotha.html |title=The Gotha and Erfurt Programs: Excerpts from the Original Electronic Text at the web site of the Hanover Historical Texts Project |editor=Hanover Historical Texts Project |publisher=[[Hanover College]] |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gotha Program was explicitly [[socialism|socialist]]: "the socialist labor party of Germany endeavors by every lawful means to bring about a free state and a socialistic society, to effect the destruction of the [[iron law of wages]] by doing away with the system of [[wage labor]], to abolish exploitation of every kind, and to extinguish all social and political inequality".&lt;ref name="gotha" /&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] famously attacked the platform, which he had read in draft form, in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''.&lt;ref name="marx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm |last=Marx |first=Karl |title=Critique of the Gotha Program |publisher=[[marxists.org]] |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPD's platform would become more explicitly [[Marxist]] toward the end of the 19th century, as indicated in its [[Erfurt Program]] of 1891.

'''Gustave Adolph Sonnenberg''' (March 6, 1898 – September 9, 1944) was an [[American football]] player and [[professional wrestler]] of German descent and [[World Heavyweight Championship (Original)|World Heavyweight Champion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sonnenberg (disambiguation)|"Sonnenberg (German for "sunny hill")"]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a wrestler, he was [[National Wrestling Association]] world heavyweight champion. He played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1923 until 1930, for the [[Buffalo All-Americans]], [[Columbus Tigers]], [[Detroit Panthers]], and [[Providence Steam Roller]], where he was a member of the [[List of NFL champions|1928 NFL championship]] team.

==Football==
Born in Ewen, Michigan, Sonnenberg grew up on a farm in Green Garden, Michigan. He played football at Marquette High School from 1912 to 1915, playing on Marquette's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] championship team in 1915 when the team went 6–0, outscoring opponents 211 to 7.&lt;ref name=Oberthaler&gt;Oberthaler, Joan, "Gus Sonnenberg, Football Star, Champion of the World," Marquette Monthly, October 2000, [http://www.dayoopers.com/fame1.html Da Yoopers Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[Dartmouth College]] in 1916, dropping out after his first year, but returning for a second year in 1919 before transferring to the [[University of Detroit Mercy]], where he graduated.

In 1923, at age 25, Sonnenberg turned professional, playing in the NFL for the Buffalo All Americans (one game) and the Columbus Tigers. In 1924, he helped the [[Pottsville Maroons]] win the [[Anthracite League|Anthracite League Championship]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~ghostsofthegridiron/articles/09-An-321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He played two seasons for the Detroit Panthers (1925, 1926) and then joined the Providence Steam Roller in 1927 and played on the NFL championship team there in 1928.

==Professional wrestling==
While playing in Providence, Sonnenberg was trained in professional wrestling and made his mat debut on January 24, 1928, at the Arcadia Ballroom in Providence, defeating Ivan Ludlow.&lt;ref name=Luce&gt;Luce, Don, "Gus Sonnenberg," [http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/gus_sonnenberg.asp Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being just 5'7" and 200 pounds and having no background in wrestling, Sonnenberg quickly became a sensation in professional wrestling, changing the style of the sport with his signature move, the "flying tackle."&lt;ref name=Yohe&gt;Yohe, Steve, "A Study of Danno O’Mahoney," [http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/yohe-02.htm 1wrestlinglegends.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024150349/http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/yohe-02.htm |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a main event wrestler for Boston-based promoter [[Paul Bowser]] and unsuccessfully challenged world heavyweight champion [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]] on June 30, 1928 at Boston Arena.&lt;ref name=Luce /&gt;

After returning to the Steam Roller for their championship season, Sonnenberg again wrestled Lewis for the world title on January 4, 1929 and won the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Sonnenberg Captures World Championship|url=https://classicwrestlingarticles.wordpress.com/2013/07/26/gus-sonnenberg-captures-world-championship/|website=Classic Wrestling Articles|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnenberg held the title for nearly two years before losing it to [[Ed Don George]] on December 10, 1930 in [[Los Angeles]]. Sonnenberg and [[Jim Londos]] were the two largest draws in pro wrestling in 1929-1930.&lt;ref name=Yohe /&gt; In October 1929, Sonnenberg was attacked on the streets of Los Angeles by part-time wrestler Pete Ladjimi in an attempt to expose the reigning world champion as weak. Ladjimi was associated with Londos, Sonnenberg's rival.&lt;ref&gt;Hornbaker, Tim, "Paul Bowser Biography," [http://otherarena.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=55 The Other Arena]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonnenberg was again recognized as world champion in the Boston area in 1939, after defeating and unmasking The Shadow (Marvin Westenberg) to become the American Wrestling Association champion. He only held the title for 13 days before dropping it to [[Steve Casey|Steve "Crusher" Casey]] in Boston on March 29, 1939. He continued to wrestle until joining the Navy in 1942.

==Personal life==
In July 1932, Sonnenberg was involved in a fatal car accident in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] when the car he was driving hit the car of policeman Richard Morrissey, who was killed. Sonnenberg was charged with drunk driving and was acquitted in March 1933.

Days after his acquittal, Sonnenberg married actress [[Judith Allen]]. Four months later, in July 1933, Sonnenberg was reported to have suffered a heart attack in Los Angeles. Allen announced her intention to file for divorce while Sonnenberg was recovering in the hospital. She was said to have been seen on a date with [[Gary Cooper]].&lt;ref name=Luce /&gt; The divorce was finalized in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gus Sonnenberg and Actress Are Divorced|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6013693/the_winnipeg_tribune/|work=The Winnipeg Tribune|date=September 25, 1933|location=Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba|page=13|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 26, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later married to Mildred Micelli, who left him.&lt;ref name=Oberthaler /&gt;

In 1942, during [[World War II]], Sonnenberg joined the Navy. He was serving there when he died of [[leukemia]] at the Naval Hospital in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] on September 12, 1944 at age 46.

'''''Historia Argentina''''' (in English, ''History of Argentina'') in an [[encyclopedia]] of three volumes by [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], published in 1965 by TEA ([[Tipográfica Editora Argentina]]).

==Content==
The encyclopedia is devoted to the [[history of Argentina]].  The first chapters, however, talk about the [[Human evolution| origin of the human race]], the [[Models of migration to the New World|early migrations]] that populated America, the [[Pre-Columbian South America|Pre-Columbian populations]] in modern Argentina, and the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to América. 

''History of Argentina'' itself begins to be narrated from the discovery of the [[Río de la Plata]] by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]], and follows to the sanction of the [[Sáenz Peña Law]] and the first presidential mandate of [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]].

The [[International Accreditation Forum]] (IAF) [[Multilateral Recognition Arrangement]]s (MLA) consists of an agreement between accreditation bodies for mutual recognition of accreditations. Among the signatories of this agreement are [[RABQSA International]] and the [[International Register of Certificated Auditors]] (IRCA), the two main [[management system]] personnel [[certification]] bodies.

The objective of the IAF MLA is to ensure that the personnel certifications granted by signatories of the IAF MLA can be recognized by other signatories, increasing the worldwide employability of the certified professionals.

Mutual recognition is based on peer evaluations between signatories to ensure each other's personnel certifications are equivalent and that each certified professional can perform the required tasks.

==IAF MLA and ISO 17024==

There is currently{{When|date=November 2010}} a debate in the personnel certification world regarding the validity of peer evaluation. Some people{{Who|date=November 2010}} criticize the concept of peer evaluation because it implies that the larger personnel certification bodies can impose their standards on others. These people would prefer to see the personnel certification bodies be certified to [[ISO 17024]] with the national standard bodies. Thus, certification bodies would have a fixed set of standards (ISO 17024) to comply to and they'd be evaluated by independent bodies (the national standard bodies).

But many people{{Who|date=November 2010}} criticize the ISO 17024 approach for two reasons:

* The requirements of ISO 17024 are easy to achieve and do not guarantee the quality of the management system personnel certification.
* Being certified to a national standard body rather than by one entity (peers) means that all personnel certification bodies can have different criteria to comply to, thus reducing the mutual recognition advantage of having similar criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">'''"I Bet You They Won't Play This Song on the Radio"''' is a song performed by  [[Eric Idle]], an [[England|English]] comedian and member of [[Monty Python]]. It mocks radio [[censorship]] of words considered inappropriate (such as "damn," "shit," "arse," etc.).  Another similar song, also by Idle, is "[[FCC Song|The FCC Song]]", whose refrain "Fuck you very much" is directed at the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]].  "I Bet You They Won't Play This Song on the Radio" touches on the same subject, but includes bleepings and [[Comic sound|comic sound-effect noises]] (such as "Cha-ching" or "Yeeaagh!") in place of actual profanity.&lt;ref name="seattlepi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/355668_radiobeat20.html|title=On Radio: What Words Can You Say on Radio, TV? Broadcasters Hope Supreme Court Will Clarify Rules|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2009-04-29|last=Virgin|first=Bill|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song first appeared on ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=And Now for Something Completely Digital|last=Parker|first=Alan|author2=Mick O'Shea|page=157|year=2006|publisher=[[The Disinformation Company]]|isbn=1-932857-31-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G49bRxbeH1kC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22I+Bet+You+They+Won%27t+Play+This+Song+on+the+Radio%22#PPA157,M1|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later appeared on two compilation albums: disc two of ''[[The Final Rip Off]]'' and the E.P.

Ironically, the song has been known to have been played on the radio quite frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Monty Python – I Bet You They Won't Play this Song on the Radio|url=https://genius.com/Monty-python-i-bet-you-they-wont-play-this-song-on-the-radio-lyrics|language=en|accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">[[File:Neues Museum Berlin 2009.jpg|thumb|280px|Western facade of the ''Neues Museum'' with the projected site of the James Simon Gallery]]
The '''James Simon Gallery''' will be a new, centrally located visitor centre between the reconstructed [[Neues Museum]] and the ''Kupfergraben'' arm of the [[Spree]] river on [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]]. Designed by architect [[David Chipperfield]], the gallery is named after the maecenas [[Henri James Simon]] (1851–1932) who brought worldwide fame to the [[Berlin State Museums]] with his lavish donations.
[[File:Hermann Rückwardt - Eiserne Brücke (1916).jpg|thumb|left|Packhof, 1916]]
As the ensemble's sixth building, the gallery will have a prominent position at the site of the former ''Packhof'' designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], which was demolished in 1938, and will set a &lt;!--?:--&gt;concluding accent in the construction history of Museum Island. Chipperfield's first designs featured plain cubes with a hull of satin glass and steel, causing various protests which led to an extensive revision in 2007. The current drafts of the reception building consist of a stone basement, framed by a modern continuation of [[Friedrich August Stüler]]'s colonnades at the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]].

In the course of the reorganization of Museum Island according to the master plan originally designed by [[Giorgio Grassi]], the James Simon Gallery is mainly created for the growing numbers of visitors, which, when all the museums have been opened, are expected to reach four million visitors annually. Similar to the [[Louvre Pyramid]], it will receive the visitors for the island, offer them orientation and direct them to the exhibits featured on the main circuit. In addition, the James Simon Gallery will provide the infrastructure of an auditorium, a media centre, rooms for temporary exhibitions, a bookstore, shops, cafés and restaurants for all of Museum Island.

H. Osgood]] described the expedition's collection of mammalian skins and designated the Roosevelt brothers' section as the first, Stevens's as the second, and Coolidge's as the third. The first section consisted of the two Roosevelt brothers with the photographer C. Suydam Cutting&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_296615 Charles Suydam Cutting (1889–1972), Smithsonian Institution Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; and their Chinese interpreter.&lt;ref name=RooseveltsSection/&gt;

==Itinerary==
Stevens accompanied the Roosevelts up the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] to the Chinese-Burma border and then in January 1929 went north from [[Tengchong|Tengyueh]] with his own caravan. During all of February he collected specimens at the Lijiang bend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/yunnan/lijiang/shigu_drum.htm Lijiang Stone Drum and First Bend of Yangtze River, Yunnan]&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved north to collect in [[Sichuan]] and spent May in the [[Wuxi County|Wushi hills]]. After some further collecting he went down the [[Yangtze]] to [[Shanghai]], sending 2,400 specimens to the Field Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000332629 Stevens. Herbert (fl. 1925-1932), Herbarium, Natural History Museum (British Museum)]&lt;/ref&gt; After separating from Stevens's section of the expedition, the Roosevelt brothers with Suydam Cutting went rapidly north to collect specimens of the [[giant panda]]. The Roosevelts hunted large mammals that were especially rare. Their party proceeded through [[Burma]] to [[Bhamo]] and northward to [[Kangding|Tatsienlu]] thence to [[Muping District|Mouping]]. Then going southward through [http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-2699175&amp;fid=1052&amp;c=china Yachow], they crossed the [[Qingyi River (Sichuan)|Qingyi]] (Tung&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Little, Archibald John|year=1906|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqE7Q8SwHcwC&amp;pg=PA1|title=Across Yunnan &amp; Tonking}}&lt;/ref&gt;) River and continued their journey traveling slightly east of the [[Panlong River]] and reaching the railhead at [[Kunming|Yunnanfu]]. From there, Kermit Roosevelt returned to the United States upon an urgent request. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Suydam Cutting continued to the vicinity of Saigon to procure specimens of [[banteng]], [[seladang]], and [[water buffalo]].&lt;ref name=RooseveltsSection/&gt;

{{quotation|The third section of the expedition devoted itself to concentrated work in northern [[French Indochina|Indo-China]], mainly in the province of [[Tonkin]]. Under the leadership of Harold J. Coolidge, Jr., a party of four was organized in which Russell W. Hendee was the mammalogist, [[Josselyn Van Tyne]] ornithologist, and Ralph E. Wheeler physician and parasitologist. After a brief stop in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]], where collections were made near [[Quảng Trị|Quangtri]], this party proceeded to [[Haiphong]] and [[Hanoi]] and thence up the valley of the Rivière Noire. They passed on into Northern Laos and worked there from a base at [[Phongsali|Phong Saly]], finally descending the [[Mekong River]] with a short stop at [[Vientiane]] to [[Savannakhet|Savannaket]] and thence overland to [[Hue]].&lt;ref name=RooseveltsSection/&gt;}}

Hendee departed from Coolidge's party in Laos on 14 May 1929 and started down the Mekong to join Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Suydam Cutting in [[Saigon]] but shortly after his departure he suffered a severe attack of malarial fever. Taken to a hospital in Vientiane on June 3, Hendee died on June 6.&lt;ref name=RooseveltsSection/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bailey, Afred M.|authorlink=Alfred Marshall Bailey|title=Obituary.

==Discoveries and collections==
Coolidge's section of the expedition discovered a new mammalian species [[Roosevelt's muntjac]]&lt;ref name=RooseveltsSection/&gt; and a new avian species [[grey-faced tit-babbler|''Macronus kelleyi'']].&lt;ref name=HaiphongSection/&gt;

The expedition brought back several living specimens for the U.S. [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]]:

Coolidge, jr., and Ralph Wheeler, all of the Kelley-Roosevelt expedition, were presented a trio of white-faced gibbons, father, mother, and child, all magnificent specimens; a rare Bay Bamboo rat; a sun bear; a Himalayan bear; as well as several smaller specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report of the Director of the National Zoological Park for the Year Ended June 30, 1930|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXo2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA84-A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The expedition collected approximately 5000  bird skins.

The work in China was carried on by Theodore Roosevelt '08, and his brother, Kermit Roosevelt '12, and by Suydam Cutting '12. The Indo-China Expedition, led by H. J. Coolidge Jr. '27, included Dr. Ralph E. Wheeler '22, M.D. '26 and Dr. Josselyn Van Tyne '25. These six out of the eight members of the expedition were Harvard men. ... The birds were collected mostly by shooting and by use of ingenious native traps set in the forest at night. The skins were all prepared in the field and many of them transported over a thousand miles down rivers, along mountain trails, in the rainy season, before they could be shipped home. They arrived in perfect condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1930/1/22/harvard-men-discover-new-species-of/|date=22 January 1930|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|title=Harvard men discover new species of birds}} (Claims of discovery of new species have been challenged by [[molecular phylogenetics]].)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The expedition collected about 2,000 specimens of small mammals and 40 big mammals, including two giant panda skins (a first for Western museum collectors). The Roosevelt brothers shot and collected one panda and purchased a panda skin from a local hunter. The taxidermic panda specimens are on display in the Hall of Asian Mammals in the Field Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fieldmuseum.org/theodore-and-kermit-roosevelt Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt, The Field Museum]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recounting the expedition==
{{quotation|The lure of exploration through one of the few remaining corners of the world which Is little known, the Chinese-Tibetan frontier, brought 3,000 persons to the Field museum yesterday to hear Kermit Roosevelt.

Kelley-Roosevelt party abandoned their pack and ridIng animals and went on foot over mountain passes as high as 17,100 feet&lt;ref&gt;17100 feet ≈ 5212 meters.&lt;/ref&gt; in what they thought would be a futile effort to kill a giant panda. Mr. Roosevelt and his brother, Col. Theodore Roosevelt, finally shot one of the animals, which will be placed on exhibit in the museum here.

The '''Killian documents controversy''' (also referred to as '''Memogate''' or '''Rathergate''') involved six purported documents critical of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s service in the [[Texas Air National Guard]] in 1972–73. Four of these documents&lt;ref&gt;Two entitled "Memo to File," one "Memorandum," and one "Memorandum for Record," see here [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/bush_guard_memos.pdf] for [[pdf]] versions at the [[Washington Post]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; were presented as authentic in a ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' broadcast aired by [[CBS]] on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A18982-2004Sep13?language=printer|title=Expert Cited by CBS Says He Didn't Authenticate Papers.|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 14, 2004|author1=Dobbs, Michael  |author2=Howard Kurtz|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/Story?id=131423&amp;page=1|title=Document Analysts: CBS News Ignored Doubts.|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2008-03-14|date=September 14, 2004|author1=Ross, Brian  |author2=Howard Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS ousts 4 over Bush Guard story.|agency=Associated Press|date=January 10, 2005|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6807825/|accessdate=2008-03-14}}: "Boccardi and Thornburgh found that Mapes had said the documents were authenticated, when in fact she had found only one expert to vouch for only one signature in the memo."&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, several [[typewriter]] and [[typography]] experts concluded the documents were forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;Including Peter Tytell and Thomas Phinney, as well as a Joseph Newcomer, a man with 35 years of computer font technology experience.

Marcel Matley was one of the four document examiners originally retained by CBS to examine the Killian documents.&lt;/ref&gt; The purveyor of the documents, Lt. Col. [[Bill Burkett]], claims to have burned the originals after faxing copies to CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-cover-guard_x.htm |title=CBS backs off Guard story|author1=Dave Moniz |author2=Kevin Johnson |author3=Jim Drinkard |work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS News]] producer [[Mary Mapes]] obtained the copied documents from Burkett, a former officer in the [[Texas Army National Guard]], while pursuing a story about the George W. Bush military service controversy. The papers, purportedly made by Bush's commander, the late Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B. Killian, included criticisms of Bush's service in the Guard during the 1970s. In the ''60 Minutes'' segment, anchor [[Dan Rather]] stated: "We are told [the documents] were taken from Lieutenant Colonel Killian's personal files"&lt;ref&gt;TB report, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and incorrectly asserted that "the material" had been authenticated by experts retained by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;TB report, p. 137:  "This statement was without factual support ... It is without question, however, that Matley [the expert referenced] did not authenticate any of the documents in question."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Killian documents authenticity issues|authenticity of the documents]] was challenged within hours on [[Internet]] forums and [[blog]]s, with questions initially focused on alleged [[anachronism]]s in the documents' [[typography]].  Content soon spread to the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="memmot"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-guard-scoops-skepticism_x.htm|title=Scoops and skepticism: How the story unfolded.|work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-21|author=Memmot, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by ''[[USA Today]]'' and CBS raised questions about their validity and led to a public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, "if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question,"&lt;ref name="rather statement"&gt;{{cite news|title= Dan Rather Statement On Memos |work=CBS News|date=September 20, 2005|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/20/politics/main644546.shtml |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CBS News President [[Andrew Heyward]] said, "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret."&lt;ref name="rather statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS statement on panel"&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Names Memo Probe Panel|date=September 22, 2004 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/06/politics/main641481.shtml | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later, a CBS-appointed panel led by [[Dick Thornburgh]] and [[Louis Boccardi]] criticized both the initial CBS news segment and CBS' "strident defense" during the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Thornburgh-Boccardi report | url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/CBS_Report.pdf | accessdate=2005-12-21 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS fired producer Mary Mapes, several senior news executives were asked to resign, and CBS apologized to viewers. "The panel has not been able to conclude with absolute certainly whether the Killian documents are authentic," but concluded that the producers had failed to authenticate them, and cited "substantial questions regarding the authenticity of the Killian documents."

The story of the controversy was dramatized in the 2015 film ''[[Truth (2015 film)|Truth]]'', starring [[Robert Redford]] as Dan Rather and [[Cate Blanchett]] as Mary Mapes and directed by [[James Vanderbilt]]. It is based on Mapes' memoir ''Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power''. The film was, however, not approved by former CBS President and CEO [[Leslie Moonves]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} CBS refused to air advertisements for the film and a longtime CBS spokesman stated that "there are ... too many distortions, evasions and baseless conspiracy theories" [in the movie].&lt;ref name=HR&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cbs-bans-ads-dan-rather-832635|title=CBS Bans Ads for Dan Rather Movie 'Truth'|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burkett had received publicity in 2000, after making and then retracting a claim that he had been transferred to [[Panama]] for refusing "to falsify personnel records of [then-]Governor Bush",&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-burkett-side_x.htm|title=Texan has made allegations for years|author1=Moniz, Dave |author2=Drinkard, Jim |author3=Kevin Johnson |date=September 21, 2004|work=USA Today|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2004, when he claimed to have knowledge of "scrubbing" of Bush's [[Texas Air National Guard]] records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinejournal.com/bush/031903Burkett/031903burkett.html |title=What do you say? |author=Bill Burkett |date=March 19, 2003 |work=Online Journal |accessdate=2006-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210152055/http://onlinejournal.com/bush/031903Burkett/031903burkett.html |archivedate=February 10, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/13/doubts_raised_on_bush_accuser?mode=PF|author=Michael Rezendes|title=Doubts raised on Bush accuser|work=Boston Globe online|date=February 13, 2004|accessdate=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mapes was "by her own account [aware that] many in the press considered Burkett an 'anti-Bush zealot,' his credibility in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Boston Globe|date=December 11, 2005|title=Truth and Duty: a distorted lens|author=Robinson, Walter V.|accessdate=2008-03-13|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/12/11/truth_and_duty_a_distorted_lens/?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapes and Smith made contact with Burkett in late August, and on August 24 Burkett offered to meet with them to share the documents he possessed, and later told reporters from ''[[USA Today]]'' "that he had agreed to turn over the documents to CBS if the network would arrange a conversation with the [[John Kerry|Kerry]] campaign,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today|date=September 20, 2004|author1=Johnson, Kevin |author2=Moniz, Dave |author3=Jim Drinkard |title=CBS arranged for meeting with Lockhart|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-20-cbs-documents_x.htm|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim substantiated by emails between Smith and Mapes detailing Burkett's additional requests for help with negotiating a book deal, security, and financial compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;  During the last week of August, Mapes asked Josh Howard, her immediate superior at CBS, for permission to facilitate contact between Burkett and the Kerry campaign; Howard and Mapes subsequently disputed whether such permission had been given.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Two documents were provided by Burkett to Mapes on September 2 and four others on September 5, 2004. At that time, Burkett told Mapes that they were copies of originals that had been obtained from Killian's personal files via Chief [[Warrant Officer]] George Conn, another former member of the TexANG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-cover-guard_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-14|author1=Dave Moniz |author2=Kevin Johnson |author3=Jim Drinkard |title=CBS backs off Guard story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapes informed Rather of the progress of the story, which was being targeted to air on September 8 along with footage of an interview with [[Ben Barnes (politician)|Ben Barnes]], a former [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas]], who would publicly state for the first time his opinion that Bush had received preferential treatment to get into the National Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/08/60II/main641984.shtml|title=New Questions on Bush Guard Duty|work=CBS News|date=September 8, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mapes had also been in contact with the Kerry campaign several times between late August and September 6, when she spoke with senior Kerry advisor [[Joe Lockhart]] regarding the progressing story. Lockhart subsequently stated he was "wary" of contact with Mapes at this stage, because if the story were true, his involvement might undermine its credibility, and if it were false, "he did not want to be associated with it."&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;  Lockhart called Burkett on September 6 at the number provided by Mapes, and both men stated they discussed Burkett's view of Kerry's Presidential campaign strategy, not the existence of the documents or the related story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerry Aide Talked to Bush Guard Docs Figure|work=FoxNews.com|accessdate=2008-03-14|date=September 22, 2004|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132996,00.html|author=Carl Cameron|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content of the memos===
The documents claimed that Bush had disobeyed orders while in the Guard, and that undue influence had been exerted on Bush's behalf to improve his record.  The documents included the following:

#An order directing Bush to submit to a physical examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorandum, May 4, 1972|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/BushGuardmay4.pdf|accessdate=2006-03-17|format=PDF | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A note that Killian had grounded Bush from flying due to "failure to perform to [[USAF]]/TexANG standards," and for failure to submit to the physical examination as ordered. Killian also requested that a flight inquiry board be convened, as required by regulations, to examine the reasons for Bush's loss of flight status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorandum for Record, August 1, 1972|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/BushGuardaugust1.pdf|accessdate=2006-03-17|format=PDF | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A note of a telephone conversation with Bush in which Bush sought to be excused from "drill." The note records that Bush said he did not have the time to attend to his National Guard duties because he had a campaign to do (the Senate campaign of [[Winton M. Blount]] in Alabama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memo to File, May 19, 1972|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/BushGuardmay19.pdf|accessdate=2006-03-17|format=PDF | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A note (labeled "CYA" for "[[cover your ass]]") claiming that Killian was being pressured from above to give Bush better marks in his yearly evaluation than he had earned. The note attributed to Killian says that he was being asked to "sugarcoat" Bush's performance. "I'm having trouble running interference [for Bush] and doing my job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memo to File, August 18, 1973|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/BushGuardaugust18.pdf|accessdate=2006-03-17|format=PDF | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[USA Today]]'' also received copies of the four documents used by CBS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-09-bush-guard-memos_x.htm|title=Guard commander's memos criticize Bush.|accessdate=2008-03-17|author1=Moniz, Dave  |author2=Drinkard, Jim|work=USA Today|date=2004-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting this and publishing them the morning after the CBS segment, along with two additional memos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Bush documents obtained by USA TODAY|url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-09-09bushdocs.pdf |accessdate=2006-03-17|format=PDF | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burkett was assured by ''USA Today'' that they would keep the source confidential.&lt;ref name="usatoday_cbsbacksoff"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-cover-guard_x.htm|author1=Dave Moniz |author2=Kevin Johnson |author3=Jim Drinkard |title=CBS backs off Guard story|work=USA TODAY|date= September 21, 2004|accessdate=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBS investigations prior to airing the segment===
Mapes and her colleagues began interviewing people who might be able to corroborate the information in the documents, while also retaining four [[Questioned document examination|forensic document experts]], Marcel J. Matley, James J. Pierce, Emily Will, and Linda James, to determine the validity of the memos.

On September 5, CBS interviewed Killian's friend Robert Strong, who ran the Texas Air National Guard administrative office. Among other issues covered in his interview with Rather and Mapes, Strong was asked if he thought the documents were genuine. Strong stated, "they are compatible with the way business was done at the time. They are compatible with the man that I remember Jerry Killian being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/10/politics/main642729.shtml |title=Bush Guard Memos Questioned.|work=CBS News, Associated Press|date=September 10, 2004|accessdate=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong had first seen the documents twenty minutes earlier and also said he had no personal knowledge of their content;&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; he later claimed he had been told to assume the content of the documents was accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, CBS interviewed General Robert "Bobby" Hodges, a former officer at the Texas Air National Guard and Killian's immediate superior at the time. Hodges declined CBS' request for an on-camera interview, and Mapes read the documents to him over the telephone—or perhaps only portions of the documents; his recollection and Mapes's differed.&lt;ref name="Thornburgh-Boccardi Report, p. 103"&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi Report, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mapes, Hodges agreed with CBS's assessment that the documents were real, and CBS reported that Hodges stated that these were "the things that Killian had expressed to me at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9967-2004Sep9.html |title=Some Question Authenticity of Papers on Bush|author1=Michael Dobbs |author2=Mike Allen |work=Washington Post|date=September 9, 2004 |accessdate=2004-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to Hodges, when Mapes read portions of the memos to him he simply stated, "well if he wrote them, that's what he felt," and he claims he never confirmed the validity of the content of the documents. General Hodges later asserted to the investigatory panel that he told Mapes that Killian had never, to his knowledge, ordered anyone to take a physical and that he had never been pressured regarding Lieutenant Bush, as the documents alleged.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg 103&lt;/ref&gt; Hodges also claims that when CBS interviewed him, he thought the memos were handwritten, not typed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/politics/campaign/12guard.html?ex=1135227600&amp;en=70edb1f42aa3edfe&amp;ei=5070 |title=An Ex-Officer Now Believes Guard Memo Isn't Genuine|author1=Ralph Blumenthal |author2=Jim Rutenberg |work=New York Times|date=September 12, 2004 |accessdate=2005-12-20}} Registration required.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornburgh-Boccardi Report, p. 103"/&gt; and following the September 8 broadcast, when Hodges had seen the documents and heard of claims of forgery by Killian's wife and son, he was "convinced they were not authentic" and told Rather and Mapes on September 10.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response of the document examiners===

Prior to airing, all four of the examiners responded to Mapes' request for document analysis, though only two to Mapes directly:&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

*Emily Will noted discrepancies in the signatures on the memos, and had questions about the letterhead, the proportional spacing of the font, the [[superscript]]ed "th" and the improper formatting of the date. Will requested other documents to use for comparison.&lt;ref name=rushtoair&gt;{{cite news|title=In Rush to Air, CBS Quashed Memo Worries.|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31727-2004Sep18_2.html|accessdate=2008-03-17|author1=Howard Kurtz |author2=Michael Dobbs |author3=James V. Grimaldi |date=September 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Linda James was "unable to reach a conclusion about the signature" and noted that the superscripted "th" was not in common use at the time the memos were allegedly written; she later recalled telling CBS, "the two memos she looked at 'had problems.'"&lt;ref name=rushtoair/&gt;
*James Pierce concluded that both of the documents were written by the same person and that the signature matched Killian's from the official Bush records. Only one of the two documents provided to Pierce had a signature. James Pierce wrote, "the balance of the Jerry B. Killian signatures appearing on the photocopied questioned documents are consistent and in basic agreement," and stated that based on what he knew, "the documents in question are authentic."&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=GOP Slams CBS on Bush Memos|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/16/politics/main643838.shtml|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=September 15, 2004|work=CBS News|author=CBS/AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Pierce also told Mapes he could not be sure if the documents had been altered because he was reviewing copies, not original documents.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
*Marcel Matley's review was initially limited to Killian's signature on one of the Burkett documents, which he compared to signatures from the official Bush records. Matley "seemed fairly confident" that the signature was Killian's. On September 6, Matley was interviewed by Rather and Mapes and was provided with the other four documents obtained from CBS (he would prove to be the only reviewer to see these documents prior to the segment). Matley told Rather "he could not authenticate the documents due to the fact that they were poor quality copies."&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, Matley told Rather that with respect to the signatures, they were relying on "poor material" and that there were inconsistencies in the signatures, but also replied "Yes," when asked if it would be safe to say the documents were written by the person who signed them.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg 101&lt;/ref&gt;
*Both Emily Will and Linda James suggested to Mapes that CBS contact typewriter expert Peter Tytell. Associate producer Yvonne Miller left him a voicemail on September 7; he returned the call at 11 am on September 8 but was told they "did not need him anymore."&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp. 108–110&lt;/ref&gt;

==September 8 segment and initial reactions==
The segment, entitled ''"For the Record,"'' aired on ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' on September 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/1B.pdf |title=Transcript of CBS segment |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After introducing the documents, Rather said, in reference to Matley, "We consulted a handwriting analyst and document expert who believes the material is authentic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bal-to.cbs13sep13,1,3810194.story?coll=bal-features-headlines|work=The Baltimore Sun|author=David Folkenflik|date=September 13, 2004|title=Rather's doubters unmoved|accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The segment introduced Lieutenant Robert Strong's interview, describing him as a "friend of Killian" (without noting he had not worked in the same location and without mentioning he had left the TexANG prior to the dates on the memos). The segment used the sound bite of Strong saying the documents were compatible with how business was done but did not include a disclaimer that Strong was told to assume the documents were authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rather's narration about one of the memos, he referred to pressure being applied on Bush's behalf by General Buck Staudt, and described Staudt as "the man in charge of the Texas National Guard." Staudt had retired from the guard a year and a half prior to the dates of the memos.

Interview clips with [[Ben Barnes (politician)|Ben Barnes]], former Speaker of the Texas House, created the impression "that there was no question but that President Bush had received Barnes' help to get into the TexANG," because Barnes had made a telephone call on Bush's behalf, when Barnes himself had acknowledged that there was no proof his call was the reason, and that "sometimes a call to General Rose did not work." Barnes' disclaimer was not included in the segment.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet skepticism spreads===
Discussion quickly spread to various [[Blog|weblogs]] in the [[blogosphere]], principally [[Little Green Footballs]] and [[Power Line]].&lt;ref name=HK2004.0919&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Howard Kurtz]] |publisher=Washington Post |title=After Blogs Got Hits, CBS Got a Black Eye |date=2004-09-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34153-2004Sep19.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial analysis appeared in posts by "Buckhead," a [[username]] of Harry W. MacDougald, an [[Atlanta]] attorney who had worked for conservative groups such as the [[Federalist Society]] and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and who had helped draft the petition to the [[Arkansas]] Supreme Court for the [[disbarment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="LATimes_2015"&gt;{{cite news |author=Wallsten, Peter| title=GOP Activist Made Allegations on CBS Memos | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2004/sep/18/nation/na-buckhead18 | accessdate= July 11, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJC_Baxter_2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baxter |first1=Tom |title=Atlantan challenged CBS documents first |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/0904/19bushguard.html |website=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903213724/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/0904/19bushguard.html?UrAuth=aNcNUObNTUbTTUWUXUUUZTYU%2FWUbUbUZUbU%5EUcTYWVVZV |archivedate=September 3, 2005 |date=September 19, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDougald questioned the validity of the documents on the basis of their typography, writing that the memos were "in a proportionally spaced font, probably [[Palatino]] or [[Times New Roman]]," and alleging that this was an [[anachronism]]:  "I am saying these documents are forgeries, run through a copier for 15 generations to make them look old. This should be pursued aggressively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Seattle Times |date=September 18, 2004 |title=Buckhead, who said CBS memos were forged, is a GOP-linked attorney |author=Wallsten, Peter |accessdate=2008-03-17 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002039080_buckhead18.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809230831/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002039080_buckhead18.html |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the following day, questions about the authenticity of the documents were being publicized by the  ''[[Drudge Report]]'', which linked to the analysis at the Powerline blog in the mid-afternoon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blogs have their day.|author=Grossman, Lev|work=Time Magazine|date=December 19, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-18|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/2004/poyblogger.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the story was covered on the website of the magazine ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it a hoax?|author=Hayes, Stephen F.|work=The Weekly Standard|date=September 9, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-18|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/596astgo.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swift Boat flacks attack CBS|author=Boehlert, Eric|work=Salon.com|date=September 10, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-18|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/09/10/forgery/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broke into mass media outlets, including the [[Associated Press]] and the major television news networks. It also was receiving serious attention from conservative writers such as [[National Review Online]]'s [[Jim Geraghty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=About that Bush document. |author=Jim Geraghty |date=September 10, 2004| url=http://tks.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTFmODM3ZWI1MjY4NjQwNTdhMzg1MTE5NjJkNGMxMWY | accessdate=2008-03-18 | publisher=National Review Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the afternoon of September 9, [[Charles Foster Johnson]] of Little Green Footballs had posted his attempt to recreate one of the documents using [[Microsoft Word]] with the default settings.&lt;ref&gt;Wallsten, Peter.  "No disputing it, blogs are major players." ''LA Times'', September 12, 2004.  ""My Microsoft Word version, typed in 2004, is an exact match for the documents trumpeted by CBS News as 'authentic,' " Johnson wrote, posting images of his creation and the CBS document."&lt;/ref&gt;  The September 9 edition of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' made mention of the controversy, along with an article on the [[ABC News]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officer's Widow Questions Bush Guard Documents|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2004/story?id=123461&amp;page=1|accessdate=2008-03-19|date=September 10, 2004|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen days after this controversy had emerged the national newspaper ''USA Today'' published a timeline of events surrounding the CBS story.&lt;ref name="memmot"/&gt; Accordingly, on the September 9 morning after the "60 minutes" report, the broadcast was front-page news in the ''New York Times'' and ''Washington Post''. Additionally, the story was given two-thirds of a full page within ''USA Today'''s news section, which mentioned that it had also obtained copies of the documents. However, the authenticity of the memos was not part of the story carried by major news outlets on that day.&lt;ref name="memmot"/&gt;  Also on that day, CBS published the reaction of Killian's son, Gary, to the documents, reporting that Gary Killian questioned one of the memos but stated that others "appeared legitimate" and characterized the collection as "a mixture of truth and fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/10/politics/main642489.shtml|title=New Scrutiny Of Bush's Service | date=September 9, 2004| accessdate=2006-03-20|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with [[Fox News]], Gary Killian expressed doubts about the documents' authenticity on the basis of his father's positive view of Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132047,00.html|title=FOX Interviews Commander's Son|date=September 10, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-25|author=Rosen, James|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDougald, username "Buckhead," an Atlanta-based lawyer&lt;ref name="LATimes_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJC_Baxter_2004" /&gt; and Paul Boley, username "TankerKC", were awarded the ''Reed Irvine Award for New Media'' by the [[Accuracy in Media]] [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/aim-to-honor-people-in-pajamas/|title=AIM to Honor People in Pajamas |author=Roger Aronoff |date=4 November 2005 |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIM_2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim.org/annual-reed-irvine-awards/ |title=Annual Reed Irvine Awards |publisher=[[Accuracy in Media]] |quote=Jim Hoft, Proprietor of Gateway Pundit |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBS's response and widening media coverage===
At 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Thursday, September 9, CBS News released a statement saying the memos were "thoroughly investigated by independent experts, and we are convinced of their authenticity",&lt;ref name="somequestion"/&gt; and stating, "this report was not based solely on recovered documents, but rather on a preponderance of evidence, including documents that were provided by unimpeachable sources, ...".&lt;ref name="cbsstandsby"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/11/politics/main642787.shtml|accessdate=2008-03-18|date=September 10, 2004|title=CBS Stands By Bush-Guard Memos|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[WorldNetDaily]], CBS News spokesperson Kelli Edwards said, "CBS verified the authenticity of the documents by talking to individuals who had seen the documents at the time they were written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS News denies Bush docs forged.|accessdate=2008-03-18|url=http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=40376|work=WorldNetDaily|date=September 9, 2004|author=Moore, Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was replaced later that day with one that omitted this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/TheNote/TheNote_Sept1004.html|title=The Note|work=ABC News|date=September 10, 2004|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the media attention, a CBS memo said that the documents were "backed up not only by independent handwriting and forensic document experts but by sources familiar with their content" and insisted that no internal investigation would take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/10/politics/main642729.shtml|title=Bush Guard Memos Questioned|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=September 10, 2004|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the CBS Evening News of September 10, Rather defended the story and noted that its critics included "partisan political operatives."&lt;ref name="Report 1D"&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Evening News Transcript|date=September 10, 2004 | url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/1D.pdf | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the broadcast, Rather stated that Marcel Matley "analyzed the documents for CBS News. He believes they are real," and broadcast additional excerpts from Matley's September 6 interview showing Matley's agreement that the signatures appeared to be from the same source. Rather did not report that Matley had referred to them as "poor material", that he had only opined about the signatures or that he had specifically not authenticated the documents.
*Rather presented footage of the Strong interview, introducing it by stating Robert Strong "is standing by his judgment that the documents are real," despite Strong's lack of standing to authenticate them and his brief exposure to the documents.&lt;ref name="Report 1D" /&gt;
*Rather concluded by stating, "If any definitive evidence to the contrary of our story is found, we will report it. So far, there is none."&lt;ref name="Report 1D" /&gt;&lt;ref name="look back"&gt;{{cite news | title=A Look Back At The Controversy|date=January 11, 2005 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/10/national/main665817.shtml | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appearance on [[CNN]] that day, Rather asserted "I know that this story is true. I believe that the witnesses and the documents are authentic. We wouldn't have gone to air if they would not have been."

However, CBS' Josh Howard spoke at length by telephone with typewriter expert Peter Tytell and later told the panel that the discussion was "an 'unsettling event' that shook his belief in the authenticity of the documents." Producer Mapes dismissed Tytell's concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg 174&lt;/ref&gt;

A former vice president of CBS News, Jonathan Klein, dismissed the allegations of bloggers, suggesting that the "checks and balances" of a professional news organization were superior to those of individuals sitting at their home computers "in their pajamas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/640pgolk.asp?pg=2|title=What Blogs Have Wrought|accessdate=2008-03-20|author=Last, Jonathan|work=The Weekly Standard|date=September 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As media coverage widened and intensified, CBS at first attempted to produce additional evidence to support its claims. On September 11, a CBS News segment stated that document expert Phillip Bouffard thought the documents "could have been prepared on an IBM Selectric Composer typewriter, available at the time."&lt;ref name="Report 1E"&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Evening News Transcript |date=September 11, 2004| url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/1E.pdf | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Further scrutiny lessens doubts on Bush memos / Some skeptics now say IBM typewriter could have been used | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/11/MNGO68NEKR1.DTL | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first1=Francie | last1=Latour | first2=Michael | last2=Rezendes | date=September 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IBM Selectric Composer|Selectric Composer]] was introduced in 1966 for use by [[typesetting]] professionals to generate [[camera-ready]] copy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibmcomposer.org/SelComposer/description.htm IBMcomposer.org]&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[International Business Machines|IBM]] archives describing this specialized equipment, ''"To produce copy which can be reproduced with 'justified', or straight left-and right-hand margins, the operator types the copy once and the composer computes the number of spaces needed to justify the line. As the operator types the copy a second time, the spaces are added automatically."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_office2.html IBM.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Bouffard's comments were also cited by the ''Boston Globe'' in an article entitled "Authenticity backed on Bush documents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Authenticity backed on Bush documents |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2004/09/11/authenticity_backed_on_bush_documents/|accessdate=2007-03-25 | work=The Boston Globe | date=September 11, 2004 | first1=Francie | last1=Latour | first2=Michael | last2=Rezendes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Globe'' soon printed a retraction regarding the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For the Record |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/09/15/for_the_record/ |accessdate=2007-03-25 |publisher=The Boston Globe, September 15, 2004 |date=September 15, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619025429/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/09/15/for_the_record/ |archivedate=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS noted that although General Hodges was now stating he thought the documents were inauthentic, "we believed General Hodges the first time we spoke with him."  CBS reiterated: "we believe the documents to be genuine."&lt;ref name="Report 1E" /&gt;

By September 13, CBS's position had shifted slightly, as Rather acknowledged "some of these questions come from people who are not active political partisans," and stated that CBS "talked to handwriting and document analysts and other experts who strongly insist the documents ''could have been created'' in the '70s," (emphasis added).&lt;ref name="Report 1F"&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Evening News Transcript|date=September 13, 2004| url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/1F.pdf | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysts and experts cited by Rather did not include the original four consulted by CBS. Rather instead presented the views of Bill Glennon and Richard Katz. Glennon, a former typewriter repairman with no specific credentials in typesetting beyond that job, was found by CBS after posting several defenses of the memos on blogs including [[Daily Kos]] and [[Kevin Drum]]'s blog hosted at [[Washington Monthly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killian Memo Update|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004669.php#261559|author=Kevin Drum|date=September 10, 2004|work=Washington Monthly|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the actual broadcast, neither interviewee asserted that the memos were genuine.

As a result, some CBS critics began to accuse CBS of [[expert shopping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Weekly Standard|title=Dear Mr. Rather,|author=Emery, Noemie|date=September 21, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-24|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/660naguj.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''60 Minutes Wednesday'', one week later===
The original document examiners, however, continued to be part of the story. By September 15, Emily Will was publicly stating that she had told CBS that she had doubts about both the production of the memos and the handwriting prior to the segment. Linda James stated that the memos were of "very poor quality" and that she did not authenticate them,&lt;ref name="CNN1"&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS' experts say they didn't authenticate Bush memos|date=September 15, 2004 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/15/bush.guard.memos/index.html | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; telling ABC News, "I did not authenticate anything and I don't want it understood that I did."&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

In response, ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' released a statement suggesting that Will and James had "misrepresented" their role in the authentication of the documents and had played only a small part in the process.&lt;ref name="60min statement"&gt;{{cite news |title=CBS News affirms its intention to continue to report all aspects of the story | date=September 15, 2004 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/cbsstatement.pdf | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS News concurrently amended its previous claim that Matley had authenticated the documents, saying instead that he had only authenticated the signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Defends Bush Memos|date=September 15, 2004 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/15/politics/main643541.shtml | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News }}&lt;/ref&gt; On CNN, Matley stated he had only verified that the signatures were "from the same source," not that they were authentically Killian's: "When I saw the documents, I could not verify the documents were authentic or inauthentic. I could only verify that the signatures came from the same source," Matley said. "I could not authenticate the documents themselves. But at the same time, there was nothing to tell me that they were not authentic."&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;

On the evening of September 15, CBS aired a segment that featured an interview with Marian Carr Knox, a secretary at [[Ellington Air Force Base]] from 1956–1979, and who was Killian's assistant on the dates shown in the documents. Dan Rather prefaced the segment on the recorded interview by stating "She told us she believes what the documents actually say is, exactly, as we reported." In the aired interview, Knox expressed her belief that the documents reflected Killian's "sentiments" about Bush's service, and that this belief motivated her decision to reach out to CBS to provide the interview.&lt;ref name="60min statement" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-the-record-bush-documents-15-09-2004/ CBS Sept 15 2004 : Dan Rather Talks To Lt.

Killian's Ex-Secretary About Bush Memos]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a direct question from Rather about the authenticity of the memo on Bush's alleged insubordination, she stated that no such memo was ever written; she further emphasized that she would have known if such a memo existed, as she had sole responsibility to type Killian's memos in that time period. At this point, she also admitted she had no firsthand knowledge of Bush's time in the Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ex-staffer: Bush records are fake; Secretary to military officer says she never typed the memos|author1=Crowe, Robert  |author2=Mason, Julie|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 15, 2004|page=A7|url=http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Secretary-to-military-officer-says-Bush-records-1665422.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040915234617/http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/2796630|archivedate=September 15, 2004|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, controversially, Knox said later in the interview, "The information in here was correct, but it was picked up from the real ones."

The conservative-leaning ''Weekly Standard'' proceeded to predict the end of CBS's news division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/634lbcgo.asp|title=The fake but accurate media.|date=September 27, 2004|work=The Weekly Standard|accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taranto, James|title=All the News that's Fake but Accurate.|date=September 15, 2004|work=The Wall Street Journal Online|accessdate=2008-03-15|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110005624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Dan Rather first acknowledged there were problems in establishing the validity of the documents used in the report, stating: "If the documents are not what we were led to believe, I'd like to break that story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=September 16, 2004|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24633-2004Sep15.html|author=Kurtz, Howard|title=Rather Concedes Papers Are Suspect; CBS Anchor Urges Media to Focus On Bush Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS also hired a private investigator to look into the matter after the story aired and the controversy began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS News' Boss Hired Private Eye To Source Memos|work=The New York Observer|date=February 27, 2005|url=http://www.observer.com/node/50441| accessdate=2008-03-24|author=Hagan, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of the documents were first released to the public by the [[White House]]. Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]] stated that the memos had been provided to them by CBS in the days prior to the report and that, "We had every reason to believe that they were authentic at that time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040915-3.html |title=Scott McClellan briefing, September 15, 2004, at |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Washington Post'' reported that at least one of the documents obtained by CBS had a fax header indicating it had been faxed from a Kinko's copy center in Abilene, Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Guard Documents Traced to Tex. Kinko's |date=September 15, 2004|page=A06| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24635-2004Sep15.html | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=The Washington Post | first=Michael | last=Dobbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading some to trace the documents back to Burkett.

===CBS states that use of the documents was a mistake===

As a growing number of independent document examiners and competing news outlets reported their findings about the documents, CBS News stopped defending the documents and began to report on the problems with their story. On September 20 they reported that their source, Bill Burkett, "admits that he deliberately misled the CBS News producer working on the report, giving her a false account of the documents' origins to protect a promise of confidentiality to the actual source."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/20/politics/main644539.shtml|date=February 11, 2009&lt;!-- 7:51 PM--&gt;|author=Jarrett Murphy|title=CBS Statement On Bush Memos|accessdate=2011-07-27|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/20/politics/campaign/20CND-GUAR.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|date=September 20, 2004|author1=Rutenberg, Jim  |author2=Prendergast, Mark J.|title=CBS Asserts It Was Misled by Ex-Officer on Bush Documents|accessdate=2008-03-25|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the network did not state that the memos were forgeries, CBS News president [[Andrew Heyward]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret.&lt;ref name="rather statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS statement on panel" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dan Rather stated, "if I knew then what I know now — I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question."&lt;ref name="rather statement" /&gt;

In an interview with Rather, Burkett admitted that he misled CBS about the source of the documents, and then claimed that the documents came to him from someone he claimed was named "Lucy Ramirez", whom CBS was unable to contact or identify as an actual person. Burkett said he then made copies at the local [[FedEx Kinko's|Kinko's]] and burned the original documents.&lt;ref name="usatoday_cbsbacksoff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CBS Statement On Bush Memos|date=September 20, 2004| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/20/politics/main644539.shtml | accessdate=2006-03-20 | publisher=CBS News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations by CBS, CNN and the Washington Post failed to turn up any evidence relating to this supposed "Lucy Ramirez" being an actual person.:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A458-2005Jan11.html Howard Kurtz, "The Whacking of CBS"], Washington Post, Tuesday, January 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/122hkbzu.asp Jonathan V.

On September 21, CBS News addressed the contact with the Kerry campaign in its statement:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is obviously against CBS News standards and those of every other reputable news organization to be associated with any political agenda.&lt;ref name="look back" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The next day the network announced it was forming an independent review panel to perform an internal investigation.

==Review panel established==

===Findings===
On January 5, 2005, the ''Report of the Independent Review Panel on the September 8, 2004, ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' Segment "For the Record" Concerning President Bush's Air National Guard Service'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Thornburgh and Louis D. Boccardi, [http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/CBS_Report.pdf Report of the Independent Review Panel]. CBS News: January 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the panel was to examine the process by which the September 8 Segment was prepared and broadcast, to examine the circumstances surrounding the subsequent public statements and news reports by CBS News defending the segment, and to make any recommendations it deemed appropriate. Among the Panel's conclusions were the following:

:The most serious defects in the reporting and production of the September 8 Segment were:
:# The failure to obtain clear authentication of any of the Killian documents from any document examiner;
:# The false statement in the September 8 Segment that an expert had authenticated the Killian documents when all he had done was authenticate one signature from one document used in the Segment;
:# The failure of ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' management to scrutinize the publicly available, and at times controversial, background of the source of the documents, retired Texas Army National Guard Lieutenant Colonel Bill Burkett;
:# The failure to find and interview the individual who was understood at the outset to be Lieutenant Colonel Burkett's source of the Killian documents, and thus to establish the [[chain of custody]];
:# The failure to establish a basis for the statement in the Segment that the documents "were taken from Colonel Killian's personal files";
:# The failure to develop adequate corroboration to support the statements in the Killian documents and to carefully compare the Killian documents to official TexANG records, which would have identified, at a minimum, notable inconsistencies in content and format;
:# The failure to interview a range of former National Guardsmen who served with Lieutenant Colonel Killian and who had different perspectives about the documents;
:# The misleading impression conveyed in the Segment that Lieutenant Strong had authenticated the content of the documents when he did not have the personal knowledge to do so;
:# The failure to have a vetting process capable of dealing effectively with the production speed, significance and sensitivity of the Segment; and
:# The telephone call prior to the Segment's airing by the producer of the Segment to a senior campaign official of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry — a clear conflict of interest — that created the appearance of a political bias.

:Once questions were raised about the September 8 Segment, the reporting thereafter was mishandled and compounded the damage done. Among the more egregious shortcomings during the Aftermath were:
:# The strident defense of the September 8 Segment by CBS News without adequately probing whether any of the questions raised had merit;
:# Allowing many of the same individuals who produced and vetted the by-then controversial September 8 Segment to also produce the follow-up news reports defending the Segment;
:# The inaccurate press statements issued by CBS News after the broadcast of the Segment that the source of the documents was "unimpeachable" and that experts had vouched for their authenticity;
:# The misleading stories defending the Segment that aired on the CBS Evening News after September 8 despite strong and multiple indications of serious flaws;
:# The efforts by ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' to find additional document examiners who would vouch for the authenticity of the documents instead of identifying the best examiners available regardless of whether they would support this position; and
:# Preparing news stories that sought to support the Segment, instead of providing accurate and balanced coverage of a raging controversy.

===Panel's view of the documents===

The Panel did not undertake a thorough examination of the authenticity of the Killian documents, but consulted Peter Tytell, a New York City-based forensic document examiner and typewriter and typography expert. Tytell had been contacted by ''60 Minutes'' producers prior to the broadcast, and had informed associate producer Yvonne Miller and executive producer Josh Howard on September 10 that he believed the documents were forgeries. The Panel report stated, "The Panel met with Peter Tytell, and found his analysis sound in terms of why he thought the documents were not authentic ... The Panel reaches no conclusion as to whether Tytell was correct in all respects."&lt;ref name="Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg. 175"&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The controversy had long-reaching personal, political and legal consequences. In a 2010 issue of  ''[[TV Guide]]'', Rather's report was ranked #3 on a list of TV's ten biggest "blunders".&lt;ref&gt;Battaglio, Stephen. "The Blunder Years", ''[[TV Guide]]'', November 1, 2010, Pages 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBS personnel and programming changes===
CBS terminated Mary Mapes and demanded the resignations of ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' Executive Producer Josh Howard and Howard's top deputy, Senior Broadcast Producer Mary Murphy, as well as Senior Vice President Betsy West, who had been in charge of all prime time newscasts.

Dan Rather announced on November 23, 2004 that he would step down in early 2005 and on March 9, his 24th anniversary as anchor, he left the network. It is unclear whether or not Rather's retirement was directly caused by this incident, although many believe that he had to step down a year earlier than planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who killed Dan Rather? |date=March 9, 2005 |publisher=Salon.com |url=http://archive.salon.com/opinion/feature/2005/03/09/rather/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517145336/https://archive.salon.com/opinion/feature/2005/03/09/rather/index.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Les Moonves]], CEO of CBS, stated "Dan Rather has already apologized for the segment and taken responsibility for his part in the broadcast. He voluntarily moved to set a date to step down from the 'CBS Evening News' in March of 2005." He added, "We believe any further action would not be appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carter, Bill|title=Analysis: Post-Mortem of CBS's Flawed Broadcast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/media/11network.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=36f0636021244f73&amp;hp&amp;ex=1105506000&amp;partner=homepage|date=January 11, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS was originally planning to show a '60 Minutes' report critical of the Bush administration justification for going to war in Iraq. This segment was replaced with the Killian documents segment. CBS further postponed airing the Iraq segment until after the election due to the controversy over the Killian documents. "We now believe it would be inappropriate to air the report so close to the presidential election," CBS spokesman Kelli Edwards said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zernike | first = Kate | title = '60 Minutes' Delays Report Questioning Reasons for Iraq War | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2004-09-25 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/25/politics/campaign/25cbs.html?ex=1253851200&amp;en=5c69abd689bb79d5&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt | accessdate = 2007-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Killian documents controversy, the show was renamed ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' to differentiate it from the original ''[[60 Minutes]]'' Sunday edition, and reverted to its original title on July 8, 2005, when it was moved to the 8 p.m. Friday timeslot. It was cancelled in 2005 due to low ratings.

===Mapes's and Rather's view of the documents===
On November 9, 2005, Mary Mapes gave an interview to ABC News correspondent Brian Ross. Mapes stated that the documents have never been proved to be forgeries. Ross expressed the view that the responsibility is on the reporter to verify their authenticity. Mapes responded with, "I don't think that's the standard." This stands in contrast to the statement of the president of CBS News that proof of authenticity is "the only acceptable journalistic standard."  Also in November 2005, Mapes told readers of the ''Washington Post'', "I personally believe the documents are not false," and "I was fired for airing a story that could not definitively be proved false but made CBS's public relations department cringe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 11, 2005|work=The Washington Post|title="Final Days at "60 Minutes"|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/11/10/DI2005111001414.html?nav=nsc | first=Mary | last=Mapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2007, Mapes continued to defend the authenticity of the documents:  "the far right blogosphere bully boys ... screamed objections that ultimately proved to have no basis in fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Courage for Dan Rather | last = Mapes | first = Mary | publisher =The Huffington Post | date = 2007-09-20 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-mapes/courage-for-dan-rather_b_65257.html | accessdate = 2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2006, Rather defended the report in a radio interview, and rejected the [[CBS]] investigation's findings. In response, CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco told the [[Associated Press]], "CBS News stands by the report the independent panel issued on this matter and to this day, no one has been able to authenticate the documents in question."&lt;ref name="apnov2006"&gt;{{cite news | last = Baker| first = Mike| title = Rather defends discredited 60 Minutes segment in radio interview| agency = Associated Press| date = 2006-11-07| url = http://www.wistv.com/story/5648070/rather-defends-discredited-60-minutes-segment-in-radio-interview| accessdate = 2006-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Rather continued to stand by the story, and in subsequent interviews stated that he believed that the documents have never conclusively been proven to be forgeries — and that even if the documents are false, the underlying story is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Transcript of WPTF interview with Dan Rather | work=The News &amp; Observer|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/308/story/507427.html|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rather's lawsuit against CBS/Viacom ===
On September 19, 2007, Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and its former corporate parent, [[Viacom]], claiming they had made him a "[[scapegoat]]" over the controversy caused by the 2004 ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' report that featured the Killian documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20874051|accessdate=2008-03-24|date=September 20, 2007|agency=Associated Press|title=Rather files $70 million lawsuit against CBS Newsman alleges network made him 'scapegoat' for discredited story}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit names as defendants: CBS and its CEO, Leslie Moonves: Viacom, [[Sumner Redstone]], chairman of both Viacom and CBS Corporation; and [[Andrew Heyward]], the former president of CBS News.&lt;ref&gt;A PDF copy of the suit can be found on at [http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/0919_don_rather_wm_01.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the legal teams for Rather and CBS reached an agreement to produce for Rather's attorneys "virtually all of the materials" related to the case, including the findings of Erik T. Rigler's report to CBS about the documents and the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/cbs-agrees-hand-over-rigler-report-rathers-legal-team|work=The New York Observer|accessdate=2008-03-24|date=January 23, 2008|author=Gilette, Felix|title=CBS Agrees to Hand Over 'Rigler Report' to Rather's Legal Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2009, New York State Appeals Court dismissed Rather's lawsuit and stated that the lower court should have honored CBS's request to throw out the entire lawsuit instead of just throwing out parts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090929/tv_nm/us_rather_cbs_1 Appeals court dismisses Dan Rather's suit vs. CBS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002082508/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090929/tv_nm/us_rather_cbs_1 |date=October 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authentication issues==
{{Main|Killian documents authenticity issues}}

No generally recognized document experts have positively authenticated the memos. Since CBS used only faxed and photocopied duplicates, authentication to professional standards is impossible, regardless of the provenance of the originals.

Document experts have challenged the authenticity of the documents as photocopies of valid originals on a variety of grounds ranging from anachronisms of their typography, their quick reproducibility using modern technology, and to errors in their content and style.&lt;ref name=wapoexpert&gt;Kurtz, Howard [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21675-2004Sep14.html?nav=hcmodule Document Experts Say CBS Ignored Memo 'Red Flags'] ''Washington Post'.' Retrieved April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBS independent panel report did not specifically take up the question of whether the documents were forgeries, but retained a document expert, Peter Tytell, who concluded the documents used by CBS were produced using current word processing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Thornburg-Boccardi Report, Appendix 4 | url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/appendix_4.pdf | accessdate=2005-12-21 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tytell concluded ... that (i) the relevant portion of the Superscript Exemplar was produced on an Olympia manual typewriter, (ii) the Killian documents were not produced on an Olympia manual typewriter and (iii) the Killian documents were produced on a computer in Times New Roman typestyle [and that] the Killian documents were not produced on a typewriter in the early 1970s and therefore were not authentic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accusations of bias==
Some critics of CBS and Dan Rather argued that by proceeding with the story when the documents had not been authenticated, CBS was exhibiting [[liberal bias]] and attempting to influence the outcome of the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]]. Freelance journalist Michael Smith had emailed Mapes, asking, "What if there was a person who might have some information that could possibly change the momentum of an election but we needed to get an ASAP book deal to help get us the information?" Mapes replied, "that looks good, hypothetically
speaking of course."&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Thornburgh-Boccardi report found that Mapes' contact with Kerry adviser Joe Lockhart was "highly inappropriate", and that it "crossed the line as, at a minimum, it gave the appearance of a political bias and could have been perceived as a news organizations' assisting a campaign as opposed to reporting on a story;"&lt;ref name="Thornburgh-Boccardi report, pg. 175"/&gt; however, the Panel did not "find a basis to accuse those who investigated, produced, vetted or aired the Segment of having a political bias."&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi Report, pg. 211&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', when asked about the issue of political bias, review panel member Louis Boccardi said "bias is a hard thing to prove."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]], January 11, 2005; Page A01, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2148-2005Jan11.html washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
The panel concluded that the problems occurred "primarily because of a rush to air that overwhelmed the proper application of the CBS News Standards".&lt;ref&gt;Thornburgh-Boccardi Report, pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Democratic critics of Bush suggested that the memos were produced by the Bush campaign to discredit the media's reporting on Bush's National Guard service. The chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Terry McAuliffe]], suggested that the memos might have originated with long-time Bush strategist [[Karl Rove]]. McAuliffe told reporters on September 10, "I can tell you that nobody at the Democratic National Committee or groups associated with us were involved in any way with these documents," he said. "I'm just saying that I would ask Karl Rove the same question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= CBS; Guard memos are authentic; Dems rip Bush's service |author=Noelle Straub |work=The Boston Herald|date=September 11, 2004|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Who Is Buckhead? Kerry Assaulter Seemed Prepped|author=Robert Sam Anson|date=September 20, 2004|work=New York Observer|page=1}} via Lexis/Nexis&lt;/ref&gt; McAuliffe later pointed out that Rove and another Republican operative, [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.]], had "a known history of dirty tricks," and he asked whether [[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Ed Gillespie]] would rule out any involvement by GOP consultant [[Roger Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Case of the Phony Memos|author=Matthew Continetti|work=The Weekly Standard|date=October 4, 2004}} via Lexis/Nexis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerry camp rejects CBS link|author1=Stephen Dinan |author2=Bill Sammon |work=The Washington Times|date=September 22, 2004|page=A01|url=http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040922-122835-2135r.htm|accessdate=2006-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a community forum in [[Utica, New York]] in 2005, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove's objectives: "Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush's draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away."&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Brooks| first = Paul| title = Hinchey sees hand of Rove| newspaper = [[Times Herald-Record]]| date = February 22, 2005| url = http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2005/02/22/hinchey2.htm| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being criticized, Hinchey responded, "I didn't allege I had any facts. I said this is what I believe and take it for what it's worth."&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;

Rove and Stone have denied any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rove rejects charges he was CBS source|work=The Washington Times |date=September 22, 2004 | url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040922-101433-4296r.htm | accessdate=2005-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Parties lob accusations over suspect papers |work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2004| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-21-cbs-parties_x.htm | accessdate=2005-12-21 | first1=Martin | last1=Kasindorf | first2=Richard | last2=Benedetto}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2008 interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Stone said "It was nuts to think I had anything to do with those documents ...

The '''Museum Planning Area''' is a [[Planning Areas of Singapore|planning area]] located in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]] of the [[Central Region, Singapore|Central Region]] of [[Singapore]]. The area plays a "bridging role" between the [[Orchard Road|Orchard]] area and the [[Downtown Core]], which necessitates proper transport networks for vehicles, pedestrians and public transport. Due to the sheer size of green areas in the district, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] (URA) has designated it a 'green lung' in the Central Area. However, the Museum Planning Area is also home to cultural and commercial activities. Around 65% of the area is available for future development, making it a hotbed for new infrastructure and buildings.

Museum planning area is bounded by the planning areas of [[Newton, Singapore|Newton]] and [[Rochor]] to the north, the [[Downtown Core]] to the southeast, [[Singapore River]] to the south, [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] to the west and [[Orchard, Singapore|Orchard]] to the northwest.

==History==
{{see|History of Singapore}}
Ten [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monuments]] are located within the Museum Planning Area, namely the [[Armenian Church, Singapore|Armenian Church]], the [[Cathedral of the Good Shepherd]], [[Cathay Building]] (now [[The Cathay]]), the [[Central Fire Station, Singapore|Central Fire Station]], the [[House of Tan Yeok Nee]], the [[MacDonald House]], the [[Old Tao Nan School]] ([[Peranakan Museum]]), the [[National Museum of Singapore]], the [[Old Hill Street Police Station]] and the [[Singapore Art Museum]]/[[Former Saint Joseph's Institution]]. The area is home to significant events such as the [[Battle of Singapore]] and [[MacDonald House bombing]]. Other historical sites include:

*[[YMCA Building (Singapore)|YMCA Building]]
*[[National Theatre (Singapore)|National Theatre]]
*[[United Chinese Library]]

==Geography==
{{see|Geography of Singapore}}
The Museum Planning Area is bordered by [[Rochor]] to the northeast, the [[Downtown Core]] to the southeast, the [[Singapore River Planning Area|Singapore River Area]] to the southwest, [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] to the west and [[Newton, Singapore|Newton]] and [[Orchard Road|Orchard]] to the northwest. The area is roughly bounded by [[Hill Street, Singapore|Hill Street]], [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]], [[Clemenceau Avenue]] and [[Bras Basah Road]]. It is the smallest urban planning area, with an area of 83 hectares. 

Parks and [[Public space|open space]]s take up a third of the area of the Museum Planning Area, and include [[Fort Canning]], [[Istana Park]] and [[Bras Basah Park]], which can be used for [[recreation]]al purposes. Collectively, these places will form the so-called 'green lung' of the Central Area. [[Terrace (building)|Terraces]] have been proposed to allow for "a more prominent and convenient access" to the Fort Canning area.

==Institutions==
The Museum Planning Area is Singapore's "[[institution]]al hub", with 11% of land set aside for institutional use and reserve sites to be safeguarded for future institutions. The many museums in the area, which give the Museum District its name, include the [[National Museum of Singapore]], the [[Singapore Art Museum]], the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]], the [[National Archives of Singapore]] and the [[Singapore Philatelic Museum]].

The [[Art in Singapore|arts scene]] is vibrant in the area, with [[The Substation]], the [[Singapore Calligraphy Centre]], the [[YMS Arts Centre]] and the [[Singapore Dance Ensemble]] all located within its boundaries. Scattered throughout the area are [[place of worship|places of worship]] such as churches, mosques, [[Hindu temple]]s and synagogues. The [[Registry of Marriages]] and the sprawling [[Singapore Management University]] campus are also located in the area.

==Residential development==
Despite its prime location, [[Residential area|residential]] projects were only allocated 1% of the land area, and the Museum Planning Area was criticised for lacking residential zoning. Due to the lack of residents, there were fears that the area would become a "[[ghost town]]" at night. Furthermore, the concept of living within the Central Area had gained popularity, and up-market skyscraper [[condominium]]s could be built. The greenery of the Museum Planning Area could provide a peaceful environment for living. 

The URA replied that several plots of land had been sold for residential-commercial mixed use, and that more housing developments were to be planned and constructed. The URA emphasised the importance of the area as a transition between the central business district and shopping areas, as well as the green, pedestrian-friendly nature of the URA's plan for the area.

==Commercial development==
The Museum Planning Area is home to various shopping malls, including [[Park Mall (Singapore)|Park Mall]], [[Plaza Singapura]], [[The Cathay]], [[Singapore Shopping Centre]] and [[The Atrium @ Orchard]]. More vacant land will be set aside for commercial uses, especially around [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station]] and [[Bras Basah MRT Station]]. These will be properly integrated and connected with the respective stations.

Hotels in the area include [[Bayview Hotel Singapore]] and [[Hotel Rendezvous]]. Furthermore, a hotel development at the foot of Fort Canning Hill near the junction of [[Clemenceau Avenue]] and [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]] is in the planning stages, and is meant to be a retreat from urban living "amidst lush greenery". Other developments are planned on reserved sites near Fort Canning, but details have not been released.

==Transport==
[[Image:CC2BrasBasah.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Bras Basah MRT Station]] ]]
{{see|Transport in Singapore}}

The Museum Planning Area is served by four [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) Stations: [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station|Dhoby Ghaut]], [[Bras Basah MRT Station|Bras Basah]], [[Fort Canning MRT Station|Fort Canning]] and [[Bencoolen MRT Station|Bencoolen]] The [[North South MRT Line|North South Line]] and the [[North East MRT Line|North East Line]] can only be accessible from Dhoby Ghaut while the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] can be accessible from both and the [[Downtown MRT Line|Downtown Line]] can be accessible from Fort Canning and Bencoolen. The [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway's]] [[Chin Swee Tunnel]] also passes under the area. 

===Roads===
====Improvements====
Several changes to the road network in the area will be implemented, including the construction of [[Fort Canning Tunnel]] and the realignment of [[Stamford Road]] and [[Handy Road]]. The rationale for the improvements is increased traffic from [[Marina Centre]] and relieving the [[traffic congestion]] along [[Orchard Road]]. Furthermore, a new road network has been put in place to ensure smooth traffic flow after the full development of land around the MRT Stations.

====Major roads====
*[[Armenian Street, Singapore|Armenian Street]]
*[[Bras Basah Road]]
*[[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]]
*[[Clemenceau Avenue]]
*[[Fort Canning Tunnel]]
*[[Hill Street, Singapore|Hill Street]]
*[[Orchard Road]]
*[[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]]
*[[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley Road]]
*[[Stamford Road]]
*[[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]]

===Pedestrian linkages===
The [[Development Guide Plan]] for the Museum Planning Area envisages "a comprehensive pedestrian network linking developments, parks and open spaces". New [[Esplanade|promenade]]s and [[pedestrian malls]] are planned for the area to enhance and connect existing [[sidewalk]]s. A web of [[Tunnel|underpasses]] and covered walkways will link [[Orchard]], the [[Singapore River]], [[Raffles City]] and [[Marina Centre]].

[[File:Midland Goods sign.jpg|thumb]]
The '''National Conservation Centre''', formerly the '''Midland Railway Goods Warehouse''', is located in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England.  It stands in a block surrounded by Victoria Street, Crosshall Street, Whitechapel, and Peter Street.  After it closed as a warehouse it was converted into a conservation centre for [[National Museums Liverpool]] in the 1990s.  Initially its exhibition area was open to the public, but this closed in 2010.  The centre is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].

==History==

The warehouse was built as a depot for the storage of railway freight in 1872 for the [[Midland Railway]].  It was designed by the local architect [[Culshaw and Sumners#Henry Sumners|Henry Sumners]] of [[Culshaw and Sumners]].&lt;ref name=sharp&gt;{{Citation| last = Sharples| first = Joseph| author-link = | contribution = William Culshaw (1807–74) and Henry Sumners (1825–95): rebuilding Victorian Liverpool | editor-last = Webster | editor-first = Christopher | title = The Practice of Architecture: eight architects, 1830–1930 | series = Spire Studies in Architectural History | volume = 2 | page =  67| publisher = Spire Books | place = Reading | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-904965-35-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was extended along Peter Street in 1878 in a similar architectural style.&lt;ref name=pev&gt;{{Citation | last = Sharples | first = Joseph| author-link = | last2 = Pollard| first2 = Richard| author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2004| title = Liverpool| edition = | volume = | series = Pevsner Architectural Guides| publication-place = New Haven and London| place = | publisher = Yale University Press| pages = | page = 190| format = | id = | isbn = 0-300-10258-5| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1995 and 1996 it was converted by another local architect, Ken Martin, into the Conservation Centre for National Museums Liverpool.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{Citation | last = Pye| first = Ken| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2011| title = Discover Liverpool|  publication-place = Liverpool| publisher = Trinity Mirror Media| pages = | page = 89|  isbn = 978-1-906802-90-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its conservation work, the centre had an exhibition area open to the public to demonstrate the techniques of conservation, which attracted 60,000&amp;nbsp;visitors a year.  In September 2005 the centre closed for refurbishment, and re-opened in June 2006 as the National Conservation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:news-desk&amp;catid=1:news-desk&amp;Itemid=15| title = National Conservation Centre| accessdate = 13 September 2012| publisher = [[Institute of Conservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of government cuts in funding, the visitor centre closed in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mediacentre/displayrelease.aspx?id=917| | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017033104/http://liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mediacentre/displayrelease.aspx?id=917| archivedate = 17 October 2012 |title = Public access to Conservation Centre to close| accessdate = 29 August 2013 | publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but conservation work continues in the building.&lt;ref name=pye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = 10 December 2010| date = | year = | title = Liverpool conservation centre to close| edition = | volume = | series = |  publisher = [[BBC]]| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-11969862| accessdate =13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The centre is constructed in red brick on a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] stone [[plinth]], with stone dressings and bands, and some decoration in blue brick.  The exterior of the building is expressed as three or four storeys, and around the top of the building is a [[cornice]] with [[Glossary of architecture#modillion|modillions]].

A '''news leak''' is the unsanctioned release of [[confidential information]] to [[news media]]. It can also be the premature publication of information by a news outlet, of information that it has agreed not to release before a specified time, in violation of a [[news embargo]].&lt;ref&gt; Jones, David A. [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=Md2jCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22News+leak+is%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OJNd1C9B4d&amp;sig=y2XDbSuIkQ9QEwUGnkCXgzqNTy0&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWlq2Gz6fbAhWGhZAKHVZpA7YQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22News%20leak%20is%22&amp;f=false ''U.S. Media and Elections in Flux: Dynamics and Strategies'']. Routledge, 2016, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Arthur Nahl, Sutters's Mill.gif|thumb|[[Sutter's Mill]], 1851. First Discovery of Gold in California, January 19th, 1848.&lt;br&gt;James Marshall's discovery of gold in the South Fork of the American River at Sutter's mill on January 24, 1848, started the [[California Gold Rush|great rush of Argonauts to California]]. Marshall and Captain John Sutter tried their best to keep the discovery of gold quiet until the construction of Sutter's mill was completed, well knowing that the workmen would desert their jobs and turn to digging gold. The news leaked out, and the [[stampede]] began.]]

Leaks are often made by employees of an organization who happened to have access to interesting information but who are not officially authorized to disclose it to the press. They may believe that doing so is in the [[public interest]] due to the need for speedy publication, because it otherwise would not have been able to be made public, or simply as self-promotion, to elevate the leaker as a person of importance. Leaks can be intentional or unintentional. A leaker may be doing the journalist a personal favor (possibly in exchange for future cooperation), or simply wishes to disseminate secret information in order to affect the news. The latter type of leak is often made anonymously.

Sometimes partial information is released to the media [[source (journalism)|off the record]] in advance of a press release to "prepare" the press or the public for the official announcement. This may also be intended to allow journalists more time to prepare more extensive coverage, which can then be published immediately after the official release. This technique is designed to maximize the impact of the announcement. It might be considered an element of political '[[spin (propaganda)|spin]]', or [[news management]].

Some people who leak information to the media are seeking to manipulate coverage. Cloaking information in secrecy may make it seem more valuable to journalists, and anonymity reduces the ability of others to cross-check or discredit the information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people-press.org/2007/04/05/news-leaks-remain-divisive-but-libby-case-has-little-impact/ News Leaks Remain Divisive, But Libby Case has Little Impact]. Leaks Seen as Motivated More by Personal Than Political Reasons. [[Pew Research Center]], April 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leaks are made in the open; for example, politicians who (whether inadvertently or otherwise) disclose [[classified information|classified]] or confidential information while speaking to the press.

==Reasons==
There are many reasons why information might be leaked. Some of these include:
*[[Politician]]s and [[Wikt:policy maker|policy makers]]&lt;!--Does Wikipedia need an article "policy maker"?--&gt; may wish to judge the reaction of the public to their plans before committing (a [[trial balloon]]). Leaked information may be [[plausible deniability|plausibly denied]] without blame for proposed unpopular measures affecting their perpetrators.
*People with access to confidential information may find it to their advantage to make it public, without themselves appearing to be responsible for publishing the information. For example, information which will embarrass political opponents, or cause damage to national security, may be leaked.
*People privy to secret information about matters which they consider to be [[morally]] wrong or against the [[public interest]] — often referred to as "[[whistleblower]]s" — may leak the information.
*People may be enticed to expose secret information for other self-serving motives, such as financial gain.

==Notable==

===International===
*The [[Panama Papers]], confidential documents leaked on 3 April 2016 regarding [[offshore financial centre|
offshore tax havens]]

===United States===
*The [[Pentagon Papers]], a top-secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political-military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. Made public on the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1971
*A source known as [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], later identified as FBI Deputy Director [[Mark Felt]], leaked information related to the [[Watergate scandal]] to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reporter Bob Woodward.
*Columnist [[Robert Novak]] published a leak, outing CIA agent [[Valerie Plame]] in 2003.
*As reported in the [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]], the CIA deliberately planted false stories with the media to mislead the public, while claiming the stories were leaked.&lt;ref name="New York Times1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazzetti|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Mazzetti|date=December 9, 2014|title=Senate Torture Report Condemns C.I.A.

*The [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] of November 2010 in which the organisation [[WikiLeaks]] began releasing details of 251,287 US diplomatic cables provided to them by [[Chelsea Manning]].
*The [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|NSA leaks]] in June 2013, in which [[National Security Agency|NSA]] employee [[Edward Snowden]] leaked secret documents exposing the American [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and the British [[Tempora]], clandestine espionage programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Loch K.|last2=Aldrich|first2=Richard J.|last3=Moran|first3=Christopher|last4=Barrett|first4=David M.|last5=Hastedt|first5=Glenn|last6=Jervis|first6=Robert|last7=Krieger|first7=Wolfgang|last8=McDermott|first8=Rose|last9=Omand|first9=David|date=2014-08-08|title=AnINSSpecial Forum: Implications of the Snowden Leaks|journal=Intelligence and National Security|language=en|volume=29|issue=6|pages=793–810|doi=10.1080/02684527.2014.946242|issn=0268-4527|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/78351/8/WRAP_1073563-pais-300316-snowdenspecialforum.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
*[[Spies for Peace]], a group of anti-war activists associated with [[CND]] and the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] who publicized government preparations for rule after a nuclear war. In 1963 they broke into a secret government bunker where they photographed and copied documents. They published this information in a pamphlet, ''Danger! Official Secret RSG-6''. Four thousand copies were sent to the national press, politicians and peace movement activists.
*The [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|NSA leaks]] in June 2013, in which [[National Security Agency|NSA]] employee [[Edward Snowden]] leaked secret documents exposing the British [[Tempora]] and the American [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] clandestine espionage programs.

===Israel===
*[[Mordechai Vanunu]], an Israeli nuclear technician who revealed details of [[Israel's nuclear weapons program]] to the British press in 1986.
*[[Anat Kamm-Uri Blau affair|Anat Kamm]] leaked classified documents from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] in 2008, which suggested the Israeli military had been engaged in [[extrajudicial killing]]s.

===Spain===
*At the time of the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]], the takeover of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] by coup leaders failed mainly because the messages calling for a coup against the Spanish Republic were not sent in [[code (cryptography)|code]], as would have been the norm, from [[Ciudad Lineal]] to the senior officers commanding the ships. Navy [[wireless telegraphy|radiotelegrapher]] Benjamin Balboa took credit for the news leak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.republicanos.info/2009/11/17/la-flota-es-roja-papel-clave-del-radiotelegrafista-benjamin-balboa-en-julio-de-1936-de-daniel-sueiro/ La Flota Es Roja]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9016">In [[generative grammar]], '''non-configurational languages''' are languages characterized by a non-rigid [[phrase structure]], which allows syntactically discontinuous expressions, and a relatively free [[word order]].&lt;ref name="Golumbia"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golumbia | first1 = David | year = 2004 | title = The interpretation of nonconfigurationality | url = | journal = Language &amp; Communication | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi = 10.1016/S0271-5309(02)00058-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In configurational languages in contrast, the subject of a sentence is outside the finite [[Verb phrase|verb phrase (VP)]] (directly under [[Sentence (linguistics)|S]] below) but the object is inside it. Since there is no VP constituent in non-configurational languages, there is no structural difference between subject and object. The distinction (configurational vs. non-configurational) can exist in [[phrase structure grammar]]s only. In a [[dependency grammar|dependency-based grammar]], the distinction is meaningless because dependency-based structures do not acknowledge a [[finite verb|finite]] VP constituent.

==Development==
The concept of non-configurationality was developed by grammarians working within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[generative linguistics|generative]] framework. Some of these linguists observed that the Syntactic Universals proposed by Chomsky and which required a rigid [[phrase structure]] was challenged by the syntax of some of the world's languages that had a much less rigid syntax than that of the languages on which Chomsky had based his studies.&lt;ref name="Golumbia"/&gt; The concept was invented by [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]] who described the syntax of [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] as being non-configurational. However the first to publish a description of non-configurationality was Chomsky himself in his 1981 lectures on [[Government and Binding]], in which he referred to an unpublished paper by Hale.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N., 1981. Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Foris, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky made it a goal of the Government and Binding framework to accommodate languages such as Japanese and Warlpiri that apparently did not conform to his proposed language universal of [[Move α]]. Hale later published his own description of non-configurationality in Warlpiri.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, K., 1989. On nonconfigurational structures. In: Mara´ cz, L., Muysken, P. (Eds.), Configurationality: The Typology of Asymmetries. Foris, Dordrecht, pp. 293–300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale, K , 1983. Warlpiri and the grammar of non-configurational languages. Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory 1, 5–47&lt;/ref&gt; Katalin Kiss developed the concept of Discourse Configurationality to describe languages where constituent order is primarily determined by pragmatic factors.

==Distinction==
The following trees illustrate the distinction:

::[[Image:Illustration of configurational and non-configurational structure.jpg]]

The presence of the VP constituent in the configurational tree on the left allows one to define the syntactic relations (subject vs. object) in terms of the configuration. The subject is the argument that appears outside of the VP, but the object appears inside it. The flatter structure on the right, where there is no VP, forces/allows one to view aspects of syntax differently. More generally, Hale proposed that non-configurational languages have the following characteristics:

# free (or more accurately, pragmatically determined) [[word order]]
# extensive use of null [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] ([[pro-drop]] phenomena)
# [[syntax|syntactically]] discontinuous expressions

However, it is not clear that those properties all cluster together. Languages that have been described as non-configurational include [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]],&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Baker, Mark C.|authorlink=Mark Baker (linguist)|year=1996|title=The Polysynthesis Parameter|series=Oxford Studies in Comparative Syntax|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-509308-9|oclc=31045692}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]],&lt;ref&gt;Hale 1984, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; and [[O'odham language|O'odham]] (Papago).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Marcus. 2004. A Pre-group Grammar for a non-configurational language. URL http://www.bol.ucla.edu/ smithma/papers.html, UCLA ms., revised
3/12/2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy amongst phrase structure grammars==
The analysis of non-configurational languages has been controversial among [[phrase structure grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Hale 1984 and Marácz and Muysken 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, much work on these languages in [[Principles and Parameters]] has attempted to show that they are in fact configurational. On the other hand, it has been argued in [[Lexical Functional Grammar]] that these attempts are flawed, and that truly non-configurational languages exist.&lt;ref&gt;Austin and Bresnan 1996&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of syntactic theory, the existence of non-configurational languages bears on the question of whether [[grammatical relation|grammatical functions]] like [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]] are independent of structure. If they are not, no language can be truly non-configurational.

==Controversy with dependency grammars==
The distinction between configurational and non-configurational languages can exist for phrase structure grammars only. [[Dependency grammar]]s (DGs), since they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] VP constituent altogether, do not acknowledge the distinction. In other words, all languages are non-configurational for DGs, even English, which all phrase structure grammars take for granted as having a finite VP constituent. The point is illustrated with the following examples:

::No structure '''will have a finite VP constituent'''. &lt;small&gt;- Finite VP in bold&lt;/small&gt;
::No structure will '''have a finite VP constituent'''. &lt;small&gt;- Non-finite VP in bold&lt;/small&gt;

Phrase structure grammars almost unanimously assume that the finite VP in bold in the first sentence is a constituent. DGs, in contrast, do not see finite VPs as constituents. Both phrase structure grammars and DGs do, however, see [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] VPs as constituents. The dependency structure of the example sentence is as follows:

::[[File:Non-configurational tree.jpg|DG tree, no finite VP]]

Since the finite VP ''will have a finite VP constituent'' does not qualify as a subtree, it is not a constituent. What this means based upon the criterion of configurationality is that this dependency structure (like all dependency structures) is non-configurational. The distinction between configurational and non-configurational has hence disappeared entirely, all languages being non-configurational in the relevant sense. Note, however, that while the finite VP is not a constituent in the tree, the non-finite VP ''have a finite VP constituent'' is a constituent (because it qualifies as a subtree).

Dependency grammars point to the results of standard [[constituent (linguistics)|constituency tests]] as evidence that finite VP does not exist as a constituent&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne et al. 2011:323-324.&lt;/ref&gt; While these tests deliver clear evidence for the existence of a non-finite VP constituent in English (and other languages), they do not do the same for finite VP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2023">The '''Oxis Chinese Character Finder''' is an online tool (and method) for entering  [[Chinese character]]s.

A set of twenty-four abstract graphics is used to describe the printed form of Chinese characters. Each graphic is represented by a single ascii digit or letter, and the graphics themselves can be approximated with Chinese characters. The characters and their text equivalents are:

目1 日2  罒3 夕4 口5  乂6  牛7  十8  ノ9  八A  阝B  丶D  山E  一H  丨I  亅J  长K  乚L  弓S  厂T  冂U  ㄥV  人Y  フZ

These are combined according to a small set of rules that can be used implicitly or shown explicitly. The main rules are: 

* combine as a sequence, q; 
* combine as a superposition, p; 
* use as an influence, n.

White space is designated by an underscore or a hyphen, and brackets can be used to disambiguate certain combinations. A complete character is represented by a string of ascii text.

The oxis schema is used as an input system for Chinese characters by entering part or parts of a character (optionally as a mixture of oxis text, oxis graphics, and constituent Chinese characters) to invoke all the characters in a particular set that contain these graphics in this order. The set searched can be restricted in several specific ways, for example by entering an R to find [[Radical (Chinese character) |radicals]] only.  This is currently implemented for the [[List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese|first 2000 Chinese characters]] ([[Simplified Chinese characters |simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese characters |traditional]]) plus radicals in a website designed for users with slight to moderate familiarity with Chinese. It also lets users create their own searchable subsets.

[[File:PriestleyGrammar.png|right|upright|thumb|Title page from the first edition of [[Joseph Priestley|Joseph Priestley's]] ''Rudiments of English Grammar'' (1761)]]

'''''The Rudiments of English Grammar''''' (1761) was a popular [[English grammar]] textbook written by the 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]].

While a minister for a congregation in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], Priestley established a local school; it was his first successful educational venture. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of English and its [[Grammar#History|grammar]] before learning any other language, and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: ''The Rudiments of English Grammar'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''The Rudiments of English Grammar; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was very successful—it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the ''[[couplet]]'' with this rhyme:

::Beneath this stone my wife doth lie:
::She's now at rest, and so am I.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to dissociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led 20th century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rudiments'' influenced all of the major British grammarians of the late 18th century: [[Robert Lowth]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and even the American [[Noah Webster]]. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 83&amp;ndash;5; 99&amp;ndash;100; Jackson, 52; Gibbs, 16; Watts, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Treatise on Ammunition 1887 title page.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Title page of the 4th Edition, 1887&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''''Treatise on Ammunition''''', from 1926 retitled '''''Text Book of Ammunition''''', is a series of manuals detailing all [[British Empire]] military and naval service [[ammunition]] and associated equipment in use at the date of publication. It was published by the [[War Office]] at approximate 5 year intervals. As the [[gun]]s are listed for which the ammunition can be used, the Treatise also constitutes a list of guns in service at the publication date.

Its predecessor was ''Ammunition: A Descriptive Treatise on the Different Projectiles, Charges, Fuzes, Rockets, &amp;c., at Present in Use for Land and Sea Service, and on Other War Stores Manufactured in the Royal Laboratory'' of 1867.

The editions contain diagrams, measurements, storage and transportation instructions useful to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] involved in storage, transport and firing of ammunition. It is an important primary source of information for [[military historian]]s researching the types and capabilities of ammunition available to the British military at the time of various conflicts, and for collectors wishing to identify [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. However, the individual editions lack historical context, in that they omit dates and rationales for particular types and Marks of ammunition being added to or removed from the inventory.

The editions are notable for the many pages of colour [[lithograph]]s of [[British ordnance terms#Cartridge|cartridges]], [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] and [[Fuze (munitions)|fuzes]] by Harrison &amp; Sons and later by Malby &amp; Sons.

From the 1926 edition onwards it was renamed ''Text Book of Ammunition''.

The best known editions are the 10th, accurate as at August 1, 1914 and published in 1915 which constitutes a definitive description of the ammunition with which Britain began [[World War I]], and the 1936 edition which lists the ammunition with which Britain entered [[World War II]]. These and other editions are available as modern facsimile reprints.

A '''vetala''' ({{lang-sa|वेताल}} ''{{transl|sa|vetāla}}'') is a [[ghost]]-like being from [[Hindu mythology]]. The vetala are defined as [[spirit]]s inhabiting [[cadaver]]s and [[charnel ground]]s. These corpses may be used as vehicles for movement (as they no longer decay while so inhabited); but a vetala may also leave the body at will.Historians have established that vetala is based on an ancient character from the state of Bengal.&lt;ref name="Bane 2012"&gt;{{cite book

The '''WebMuseum''', formerly known as the '''WebLouvre''', was founded by [[Nicolas Pioch]]&lt;ref name="gmu"&gt;{{cite report | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/links/pdf/chapter1/1.6c.pdf | title=Nicolas Pioch | publisher=[[George Mason University]], USA | work=[http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/ Digital History] |author1=Cohen, Daniel J.  |author2=Rosenweig, Roy  |lastauthoramp=yes | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkP4B77sKLg |title=The Webmuseum by Nicolas Pioch, in 1996 | publisher=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France in 1994, while still a student. It is one of the earliest examples of a [[virtual museum]]. The site won the 1994 ''Best of the Web'' award&lt;ref name="gmu" /&gt; for the "Best Use of Multiple Media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/Awards0529.html |title=WWW94 — Awards  |publisher=[[European Organization for Nuclear Research|CERN]], Switzerland | year=1994 | accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the actual [[Louvre]] became aware of the original WebLouvre's existence, it was forced to change its name to the WebMuseum. However, many [[mirror website|mirror sites]] were established throughout the world (including [[website]]s located in [[Brazil]], Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Norway, [[Poland]], Russia, [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the United States), making it impossible to eradicate its existence. It still provides an excellent archival and educational resource of good quality art images and information, although it is no longer very actively updated.

Although this virtual museum is French in origin, it is available in English.
