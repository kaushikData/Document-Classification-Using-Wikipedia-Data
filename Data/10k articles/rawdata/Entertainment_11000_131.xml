'''''10:30 P.M. Summer''''' is a 1966 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Jules Dassin]] and starring Melina Mercouri and [[Romy Schneider]]. It is based on the novel ''[[Ten-Thirty on a Summer Night]]'' by [[Marguerite Duras]].

==Plot==
Maria and Paul, a couple in their forties, travel through Spain with a new friend, Claire ([[Romy Schneider]]), a younger woman. The couple's daughter is also part of the trip. On their way to [[Madrid]], they stop in a small town and are told by police that a local man who has killed his wife and her lover is on the loose in the area. There is a massive thunderstorm and the group has no choice but to stay in the town's only hotel, which is jammed beyond capacity with other travelers in the same situation. Maria, an out of control alcoholic who lives most of her life in a walking, booze-fueled dream state, seems to be subtly encouraging her husband Paul to have a sexual relationship with Claire as a way to reintroduce sexuality into their situation. While the thunderstorm is still raging, Maria secretly steps out of the crowded hotel onto a low balcony to down a bottle of booze and accidentally sees Paul and Claire kissing on a higher balcony. She is simultaneously excited and devastated.  While out in the rain Maria discovers the fugitive hiding on a nearby rooftop and decides to help him escape. She then hides the murderer, a young man, in an outcropping of rocks out in lonely stretch of highway in the desert.

She eventually tells Paul and Claire about the man, but when they go out to the desert they find that the fugitive has committed suicide with the same gun he'd killed his cheating wife with. Maria, Paul and Claire decide to keep quiet and simply travel on to Madrid as planned. While in Madrid, Maria tells Paul and Claire that she'd had hopes of adding the fugitive to the odd situation as a "fourth player" in the game, but that her true desire was to sleep with Paul once again. Maria drinks herself unconscious and scenes of Paul and Claire making love were shown while we hear Maria's voice saying how she'd been envisioning the pair making love ever since she'd first seen Claire naked. It is never made clear whether this sequence is a dream or something Maria actually observed while massively drunk. But the next day she tells Paul about it and it seems to excite him. They start to make love, but she can't. She tells him she doesn't love him anymore. He tells her he doesn't believe her. Later, the trio goes to a club to watch flamenco dancers. Maria, who seems to be having a good time, slips out during the performance and disappears into the city.  Paul and Claire search for her, but they cannot find her.

==Plot==
A [[sting operation]] to capture arms dealer Miles Jackson goes awry when the [[FBI]]'s inside man double crosses them. Miles rendezvouses with his girlfriend Erica Kessen, who has a getaway car. Officers Danny Fisher and Hank Carver are dispatched to help the FBI. They look at Jackson's record and see a surveillance video of him dancing with Kessen. An encounter with them at a traffic light leads to her death and Miles being taken away. Miles swears vengeance on Fisher.

One year later Fisher, now promoted to Detective due to his actions with Jackson, gets a phone call from Jackson, who has escaped from prison. Fisher runs outside the house looking for Jackson, and Fisher's car and house explode, throwing him to the ground. After Fisher recovers, Jackson says he is launching a game of revenge called "12 Rounds." The house, the car, and Phil, the plumber who came to fix a pipe were "Round 1." Molly Porter, Fisher’s girlfriend is kidnapped by Jackson for "Round 2." For "Round 3," Fisher and Carver must follow a series of clues to locate the cell phone that Jackson calls, and for "Round 4" Fisher has to get to New Orleans Savings and Loan where a fire has broken out and extract two security deposit boxes within 20 minutes.

Carver has a lead on the man who helped kidnap Molly Porter and volunteers to look into that while Fisher continues with the game. FBI Special Agents George Aiken and Ray Santiago work with them to get Porter back.

For "Round 5" one of the security boxes is a bomb and the other contains a clue to the next round. Fisher discovers and disposes of the bomb. The other box contains a hotel room key. The room is raided and found empty. For "Round 6," Fisher follows a series of clues to a bus where he finds Porter on board, wearing a bomb underneath her jacket. He is handcuffed to a bar and is given an envelope with a phone number as the clue to the next round. The Feds try to get Jackson but he escapes with Porter. When Fisher is freed, he tells the Feds about the bomb. Carver shows up and tells Fisher he has located Jackson's henchman, Anthony Deluso.

In "Round 7" Fisher has to find the correct cell phone number that disarms bombs placed in different locations. Jackson answers and tells him that his call disabled Streetcar 907's brakes. Fisher and Santiago slam their car into the transformer, shutting off electricity for the whole neighborhood. They run along the streetcar, clearing people out of the way until it can slow to a halt.

A mine planted by Jackson kills Carver and Deluso. Jackson says that Porter's bomb can only be disarmed by Fisher's fingerprint. He tells Fisher to pay a visit to Erica Kessen, so Fisher, Santiago, and Aiken start for the cemetery. Another detective, Chuck Jansen calls Fisher to tell him that the numbers in the envelope were rigged to the streetcar. Jackson had cameras monitoring the elevator shaft and set off the bomb five seconds early. Fisher realizes that Willie's death in the elevator episode was orchestrated by Jackson. Santiago does a check on Willie and finds he had a second job as a Homewood Security guard. They figure out that Jackson was leading them to take out the power because Homewood Security comes in to move the federally unprotected cash from the United States Mint in New Orleans. Jackson's grudge against Fisher was only a cover for his scheme to steal this money.

Aiken tells Santiago to lock down the Mint, while he and Fisher go after Porter. Fisher realizes that "Round 12" is a wild-goose chase, since Jackson needs Porter, a nurse, to help him escape. Jackson, dressed as a security guard, steals the cash. He uses Porter's ID card to get to a Medevac chopper on a hospital roof, transporting the money inside a body bag. Fisher and Aiken race to the hospital roof, where Aiken is wounded. Jackson activates the touch phone-bomb and throws the switch away. Porter and Fisher jump into a pool, while Jackson is left in the exploding helicopter.

The '''Theatermuseum''' is a federal museum of national theatre history. Since 1991 it is situated in the [[Palais Lobkowitz]] in [[Vienna]].

==History==
The museum has its origins in the theatre-related collections of the [[Austrian National Library]], dating back to the late 17th century. In 1922 the theatrical collections were set up as a separate organisation, under the directorship of Joseph Gregor (1888-1960), who with his spectacular exhibition from the library holdings in the same year succeeded in attracting the gift of the enormous private collection of theatre items belonging to [[Hugo Thimig]], director of the [[Burgtheater]]. In 1938, [[Stefan Zweig]] bequeathed his eminent collection of poets' and playwrights' autographs to the museum - before he had to flee the Nazis. The museum also holds one of the major bequests of Viennese Modernism: the bequest of writer [[Hermann Bahr]]. 

The purpose of the theatre-related collections was not limited to printed and archival items but to concentrate on the entire diversity of theatrical objects. The idea of a theatre museum was put forward in the 1930s but could not be realized until 1975, when the Austrian Theatre Museum was finally founded initially in the premises of Hanuschhof next to the [[Wiener Oper]]. Its prime function was to arrange exhibitions of the existing material in the [[Austrian National Library]]. The premises became, however, very soon too small, and at length the Austrian Government acquired and renovated the [[Palais Lobkowitz]], opening as '''Österreichisches Theatermuseum''' on 26 October 1991.

With the opening of the new museum the theater collections of the [[Austrian National Library]] were combined with the assets of the '''Theatermuseum''' and one of the largest and most important collections in the theatrical field was established, together with the appropriate facilities to present the portfolio in exquisite showrooms. In 2001 the '''Theatermuseum''' ceased to be part of the [[Austrian National Library]] and instead became part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]. As of September 1, 2014, the [[Wiener Staatsoper]]nmuseum, founded in 2005, was closed down and the assets were incorporated into the holdings of the '''Theatermuseum'''.

==Building==
The Theatermuseum houses a grand concert hall, the '''Eroica Hall''', called after [[Beethoven]]’s Third Symphony, dedicated to the composer's patron and owner of the palace, Franz Joseph Maximilian Prince Lobkowitz. Subsequently many of [[Beethoven]]’s compositions were performed at the [[Palais Lobkowitz]].

==Collections==
At the Theater Museum highlights of the magic of stage are caught forever. More than 1,000 stage models, 600 costumes and props from three centuries, more than 100,000 drawings and prints as well as more than 700,000 theater photos are among the holdings of the museum. A special room is devoted to the [[Jugendstil]] artist [[Richard Teschner]] (1879–1948), showing his elaborate stick puppets and his marvelous '''Figurenspiegel''' (concave mirror with light effects). In total the museum comprises more than 2,000,000 separate objects. 

The library contains about 100,000 books and periodicals, and unlike the rest of the collections is technically still the property of the National Library, on permanent loan to the Theatre Museum.

==Exhibitions==
2015: '''''Der Meister Tön' und Weisen ... Heinz Zednik - 50 Jahre Staatsoper''''' und '''''ExistenzFest. Hermann Nitsch und das Theater'''''

'''''Azada: Ancient Magic''''' is an [[Graphic adventure game|adventure]] and [[Puzzle game|puzzle]] [[casual game]] by French developer [[Big Fish Studios|Big Fish Studios Europe]], and distributed by [[Big Fish Games]]. The game is a sequel to ''[[Azada (video game)|Azada]]''. The studio previously developed ''Azada'' as well as ''[[Mystic Inn]]'' and ''[[Atlantis Sky Patrol]]''.

== Gameplay ==
''Azada: Ancient Magic'' consists of [[escape the room]] puzzles. Unlike the original ''Azada'', every puzzle is spread over multiple pages of a book. The player must flip back and forth, picking items up and locating active areas on every page, and must figure out where and how to use the various items in order to further the puzzles. The game also features over 20 different minigames. [[Minigames]] were separated from escape-the-room puzzles in ''Azada''; they are part of the escape the room puzzles in the sequel.&lt;ref name="gamezebo review"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamezebo.com/games/azada-ancient-magic/review| title = Azada: Ancient Magic review| author = [[Erin Bell (journalist)|Bell, Erin]]| publisher = [[Gamezebo]]| date = 2008-08-31| accessdate = 2008-09-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912220400/http://www.gamezebo.com/games/azada-ancient-magic/review| archivedate= 12 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Following the [[player-character]]'s successful release of Titus in ''[[Azada (video game)|Azada]]'', the hapless adventurer asks for help again. An ancient evil is about to break out from the library of Titus' Great-Uncle Argus.&lt;ref name="gamezebo review"/&gt; Argus was a scholar who had originally acquired the book of Azada as well as powerful magical items from all over the world. The ancient evil has brought the books from the library to life and is masquerading as one of the characters in the books. Titus needs your help to identify and defeat the evil. As you, the player, solve puzzles in the enchanted books, the story of how the ancient evil came into Argus' life is revealed.

== Development ==
''Azada: Ancient Magic'' is thematically similar to the first game in the franchise, ''[[Azada (video game)|Azada]]''. It features magic and books brought to life by a spell. The game features pre-rendered puzzles and characters, and an original soundtrack performed by the Deutsche Film Orchestra. Using a live orchestra is rare in casual games, other examples are  ''[[Hidden Expedition: Amazon]]'' and ''[[Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst]]''.

|genre=[[Drama]]

}}
'''''Barrymore''''' is a two-person play by [[William Luce]] which depicts [[John Barrymore]] a few months before his death in 1942 as he is rehearsing a revival of his 1920 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] triumph as ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.

[[Barrymore]]'s attempted revival of his ''Richard III'' never actually took place and was a device that was invented for the play, but it served as a dramatic framework for the actor to reminisce about various episodes in his life and about his career downslide due to alcoholism.&lt;ref name=curtain&gt;Sommer, Elyse.[http://www.curtainup.com/barrymor.html "A CurtainUp Review:'Barrymore'"] curtainup.com, accessed October 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  

Though classified as a one-person play, ''Barrymore'' actually makes frequent use of a second character, Frank the stage manager, who interacts with Barrymore over the theatre loudspeaker.

The play was originally produced at the [[Stratford Festival]] in 1996. The play was produced on Broadway at the [[Music Box Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;Luce, William.[https://books.google.com/books?id=CjGxWZ4Wqm8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Barrymore+%22William+Luce+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2MYojzhQwm&amp;sig=a4rQPEspn058eUA25W1jL5VYvko&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Barrymore, A Play''] ''Barrymore: a play'' (1998), Samuel French, Inc., {{ISBN|0-573-64240-0}}, accessed October 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; running from March 25, 1997 to November 2, 1997. Directed by [[Gene Saks]], [[Christopher Plummer]] played Barrymore, and won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]].&lt;ref name=curtain/&gt;  Plummer reprised his role in [[Eric Canuel]]'s 2011 [[Barrymore (film)|film adaptation of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: Barrymore|date=15 November 2012|publisher=''[[Film Journal International]]''|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/node/7439|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote "Mr. Luce's script has a lurching quality that isn't just a matter of its subject's alcoholic disjunctiveness. And even for a work about a man whose life was a long-running performance, the play is overstuffed with one-liners...impersonations (of everyone from W. C. Fields to John's regal siblings, Ethel and Lionel, marvelously rendered) and the sort of stories that show up in books with titles like ''Amusing Theatrical Anecdotes.'' Yet Mr. Plummer and Mr. Saks have turned this fragmented material into something as fluid, stinging and warming as the cocktail (a Manhattan?) Barrymore mixes for himself onstage. And the evening (starting with the frayed lushness in autumnal colors of Santo Loquasto's backstage set) takes on an affecting shimmer of twilight, even as Mr. Plummer's Barrymore delights you with his own delight in his silly, ribald jokes."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9505E1DA1E3BF935A15750C0A961958260 A Dazzler Of a Drunk, Full of Gab And Grief"] ''The New York Times'', March 26, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battlefront ''''' is a [[Wargame (video games)|computer wargame]] developed and published by [[Strategic Studies Group]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]] in 1986. 
The game is a turn-based strategy set in [[World War II]]. 

== Gameplay ==
''Battlefront'' is a [[corps]]-level simulation wargame. Upon starting the game, player chooses from one of four scenarios that depict battles of World War II. The scenarios are based on [[Battle of Crete]], [[Operation Winter Storm]], [[Battle of Saipan]], and [[Siege of Bastogne]].&lt;ref name=CVG&gt;{{cite journal|title=Battlefront review|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=January 1987|issue=63|pages=118-120|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-063/CVG063_Jan_1987#page/n117/mode/2up|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The game was designed, programmed and finished in 14 weeks. [[Roger Keating]] created a dedicated disc operating system for the game that allowed rapid access to the data stored on the disc with subsequent reloading of the game screen. Additionally, Keating wrote a novel pathfinding routine that helped to minimize memory usage.&lt;ref name="Chatteur"&gt;

== Reception ==
A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the game's historical accuracy and the possibility to create custom scenarios, but criticised the graphics. He stated that ''Battlefront'' "is a very good attempt, but it is not the perfect game that it might have been".&lt;ref name=CVG/&gt;

'''''Big Beach Sports''''' is a [[sports game]] for the [[Wii]] developed by [[HB Studios]] and produced by [[THQ]].
The game is a collection of six sports simulations, in which players compete on a beach resort location. The sports include: [[American football]], volleyball, soccer,  [[bocce]], [[cricket]] and [[disc golf]]. The games are not highly realistic simulations of the sports, but more orientated towards unrealistic physics, stylized beach scenarios, and a simplified rule set. It is most notable for being the third Wii game (the first being ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]'' and the second being ''[[Geometry Wars: Galaxies]]'') to feature connectivity to the [[Nintendo DS]].  Big Beach Sports also features the first [[cricket]] game on the Wii. It was released on 24 June 2008.

==DS to Wii Connectivity==
The DS application downloads a small application from the Wii, which allows the player to draw the created character's face (eyes, ears, nose, mouth and eyebrows) and upload it back from the [[Nintendo DS]] to the Wii.  The character will then appear that way in the game. This application does not require any DS game to be inserted into the Nintendo DS.

==Gameplay==
All of the games allow up to 4 players playing at the same time, or in the case of Bocce and Disc Golf, taking alternate turns. All the games use the Wii Remote only, no games require the use of the Nunchuck or any other peripheral.

After creating a character, the player can compete in tournaments against increasingly tougher opponents in any of the sports. Playing Quick Play games and Tournament games earns the character Skill Points. These are then used to calculate the difficulty of the CPU opponent for future Quick Play matches. Hence, after completing all tournaments for all the sports in Big Beach Sports, where each game has a preset difficulty, the player can then return to Quick Play and continue to max out Skill Points (999 points) for each of the six sports. In the case of most of the sports, however, the game becomes extremely challenging and the AI opponents are much tougher to beat after reaching 900 skill points.

==Reception==
''Big Beach Sports'' received a fairly poor reception from critics, with an average [[Metacritic]] score of just 44%.{{cn|date=September 2017}} IGN was scathing, deriding the game as a "true cash-in project that ignores some of the great control fundamentals laid down with Nintendo's game for an unintelligent waggle-and-win design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/900/900232p1.html |title=IGN |publisher=Uk.wii.ign.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

THQ CEO Brian Farrell referred to the game as "an unmitigated success" in the company's Q1 2009 earnings call&lt;ref&gt;http://i.bnet.com/pdf/225044-THQ_Inc._Q1_2009_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to it in his strategic plan at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallcapwatch.com/pressRelease.asp?ID=78947&lt;/ref&gt; It received a "Platinum" sales award from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] (ELSPA),&lt;ref name=platinumelspa&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515224703/http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3944 |url=http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3944 |title=ELSPA Sales Awards: Platinum |work=[[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] |archivedate=May 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=gamasutrasales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063107/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |title=ELSPA: ''Wii Fit'', ''Mario Kart'' Reach Diamond Status In UK | author=Caoili, Eric | date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archivedate=September 18, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Prophecy''''' was a 3D real-time space combat [[massively multiplayer online game]] by Reakktor Media GmbH, the creators of [[Neocron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackprophecy-game.com/ Black Prophecy Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reakktor Media started the [[beta test|open beta test]] phase of the game on February 2011,&lt;ref name="Publisher and beta test date"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.blackprophecy-game.com/showthread.php?t=1103 |title=Publisher announced for Black Prophecy |accessdate=5 March 2010 |work=black-prophecy.com |publisher=Reakktor Media GmbH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308144940/http://forum.blackprophecy-game.com/showthread.php?t=1103 |archivedate=8 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had teamed up with German distributor [[gamigo AG]] to publish the game.

''Black Prophecy'' was launched in Europe on 21 March 2011.&lt;ref name="Black Prophecy EU launch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=14&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=208&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=30&amp;cHash=23f7314723 |title=Black Prophecy EU launch |accessdate=12 April 2011 |work=blackprophecy-game.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US version was launched later. The game was not made available to Asian and Australian players, with the official Black Prophecy website preventing residents of these regions from downloading the client executable file and signing up for beta access. The game used the [[Freemium]] model, featuring a premium shop where players could buy various in-game items, such as weapons and armors.

On 29 August 2012 the game developers announced that the game will be "closing its doors" on 26 September 2012.&lt;ref name="GameClosureNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackprophecy.com/index.php?id=14&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=445&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=30&amp;cHash=576e090d2a |title=Closure|accessdate=31 August 2012|work=black-prophecy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOClimit|limit=3}}

==Background==
''Black Prophecy'''s setting and story have been developed by [[Science fiction|Sci-Fi]] author [[Michael Marrak]].&lt;ref name="BPAuthorMarrak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=27 |title=Story |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=black-prophecy.com |publisher=Reakktor Media GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was set in the 26th century, where mankind has expanded across the galaxy, yet only few of its colonies are controlled by humans. Two main factions dominate space: the cybernetically enhanced humans the '''Tyi''' and the biogenetically perfected humans the '''Genides'''. On their quest for territorial domination they enter the territory of an ancient alien race called the '''Restorers''', who exhibit a destructive behaviour to other civilizations.&lt;ref name="BPBackgroundStory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=26 |title=Playable Factions |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=black-prophecy.com |publisher=Reakktor Media GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player was asked to join one of these two dominant races of humans to uncover the mystery of the Restorers and grant the survival of the human species.

===Factions===
Two main factions dominated the game:

====The Tyi====
The Tyi (abbreviation for Tactical Yeomen Inhabitants, pronounced "tie") are a race of cybernetically enhanced superhumans, with great strength and endurance, both physically and mentally. They are resistant to radiation, have redundant circulatory systems as well as backup organs, speak all languages and are true multitaskers. They also gather and process data at a somewhat increased rate.&lt;ref name="BPFactionTyi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=44 |title=The Tyi |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=black-prophecy.com |publisher=Reakktor Media GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Genides====
The Genides are a race of genetically perfected humans, designed to be able to better resist the unusual and partially hostile environments in space and on the colony planets. They require very little sleep, heal wounds quickly and can communicate telepathically. In addition, most of them are resistant to disease and epidemics, think faster, can detect ultra- and infra-sounds and have a long life expectancy.&lt;ref name="BPFactionGenides"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=43 |title=The Genides |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=black-prophecy.com |publisher=Reakktor Media GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game was action-oriented, focusing on [[player versus player]] (PvP) and [[player versus environment]] (PvE) combat and missions. Up to ten players could form a team and participate in team missions, which typically had an increased difficulty and better rewards compared to the solo missions. There were no bonuses for [[player versus player|PvP]] combat other than the PvP mission rewards. The only death penalty was a stacking debuff to some of the ship's stats, which lasted for 5 minutes. After being destroyed, player ships left no wrecks and were instantly resurrected.
Players retained all the items that were in their ship's inventory before death.

Players gained levels by getting experience from completing various missions. Each new level added 3 or 5 points which players allocated to increase the stats of their choice. Each stat determined the maximum level of equipment a player could use. For example, a level 10 mechanical stat allowed the use of any mechanical weapons up to level 10. The points could also be allocated in tactics stat, which allowed players to perform various combat maneuvers, such as U-turn and speed boost. Common items could be bought from the [[Non-player character|NPC]] dealers, which were present on most stations, but more advanced items could only be looted from enemies or crafted by players.

The game had no way to automate the trading process between players, it had neither an auction nor a market - the only way to trade for the players was to agree to meet in a certain place and transfer items and currency manually through the trading window.

The crafting system was similar to the one used in Korean [[MMORPG]]s, since it was based on random numbers. First, a player had to obtain a blueprint and the resources required for crafting. Then the player docked at a space station, selected the crafting menu, placed the blueprint on the corresponding slot and then checked the end result, which was shown before the crafting process started. Then the player started the crafting process, which took an amount of time based on the end product level. While crafting, the player wasn't able to do anything else, and only one item could be crafted at a time. If all did go well, the player got their product after the crafting was finished. The process had a chance to fail, in which case no product was produced and all of the resources used in production were lost. There was also a chance for a perfect crafting, which produced an item with stats better than originally anticipated. Such items could be sold for a very high price to other players.

A notable aspect of the game was the modular ship design, where players were able to acquire different modules (cockpits, wings, engines) of different levels in order to customize their ships in many ways. Most of the modules could also be modified, increasing some of their stats.

The game also featured an award and medal system, similar to an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements system]], where players could earn medals and awards for performing specific tasks.

Player [[Clan (computer gaming)|clans]] were allowed to build their own stations and expand them through a module system to add different functionalities, similar to the NPC stations.

The game had three ship views available - two [[First-person (video games)|first-person views]] from inside the cockpit with cockpit frame and the interface visible in one case and only the interface visible in the other, and a [[Third-person (video games)#Third-person view games|third-person]] view of the ship.

==Development==
[[File:BlackProphecy(concept).jpg|right|thumb|Concept art of the game in its early stages of development.]]
Development on Black Prophecy started in late 2006&lt;ref name="BPDevelopmentStart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neocron.blogspot.com/2006/11/ask-ceo-answers-are-now-in.html |title=Ask the CEO, Answers are now in |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=Neocron 2 blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823025118/http://neocron.blogspot.com/2006/11/ask-ceo-answers-are-now-in.html |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a team of 50 people.&lt;ref name="BPDevelopmentTeam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/815/815449p1.html |title=GC 2007: Black Prophecy Preview |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=pc.ign.com |publisher=[[IGN|IGN Entertainment, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally planned to be released in 2009 by Reakktor's parent studio, 10tacle Studios, it was premiered during the 2007 [[Games Convention]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. The first website for the game was put online on 21 August 2007, just in time for the convention.&lt;ref name="BPFirstWebsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/10384 |title=Black Prophecy Website Unveiled |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=tentonhammer.com |publisher=Master Games International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] a new trailer was debuted and the registration for the closed beta was opened.&lt;ref name="BPE32008Debut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.massively.com/2008/07/20/e308-black-prophecy-debuts-with-trailer-closed-beta-registrati/ |title=E308: Black Prophecy debuts with trailer, closed beta registration |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=massively.com |publisher=[[Weblogs Inc|Weblogs, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After 10tacle's bankruptcy announcement on August 2008, Reakktor released a statement confirming their commitment to the development of the game.&lt;ref name="BP10tacleBankruptcy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/41108 |title=10Tacle Studios Goes Under But Reakktor Lives |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=tentonhammer.com |publisher=Master Games International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new website for the game was launched on 5 March 2009, and on 8 April 2009 the official forums were opened to the public.&lt;ref name="BPNewSite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=30 |title=News |accessdate=11 April 2009 |work=black-prophecy.com |publisher=Reakktor Media GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on 21 March 2011 in Europe.

== Termination ==
On 29 August 2012 it was officially announced that Black Prophecy will be discontinued on 26 September 2012 due to financial issues.&lt;ref name="BPfinite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackprophecy-game.com/index.php?id=14&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=445&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;backPid&amp;#93;=30&amp;cHash=576e090d2a |title=Black Prophecy will be closing its doors |accessdate=30 August 2012 |work= |publisher=GAMIGO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boardwalk and Baseball''' was a [[theme park]] built near [[Haines City, Florida]], on the east corner of the intersection of [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|US 27]] and [[Interstate 4]].&lt;ref name=suns/&gt; It replaced [[Circus World (theme park)|Circus World]] at the same location, and was owned by [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] Park Group (now Harcourt, a division of [[Reed Elsevier]]). It opened in April 1987, and closed January 17, 1990.

The park recycled many of Circus World's rides and exhibits. The petting zoos were removed, the rides and shows were rethemed, and [[Baseball City Stadium]] was built on the site. There were several exhibits that borrowed artifacts from the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. HBJ attracted the [[Kansas City Royals]] from [[Fort Myers, Florida]], to make Baseball City Stadium their new [[spring training]] home and the site of their [[Minor league baseball|Class A]] [[Florida State League]] affiliate, the [[Baseball City Royals]]. They also had a Rookie-level affiliate in the [[Gulf Coast League]], one of two lowest level minor leagues in the U.S. (along with the [[Arizona League]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/GCL_Royals|title=GCL Royals - BR Bullpen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[ESPN]] taped a [[quiz bowl]]-style [[game show]], ''Boardwalk and Baseball's Super Bowl of Sports Trivia'', on the site. It aired in 1988 and 1989 and featured single-elimination tournaments of three-person teams representing U.S. colleges and [[universities]]. [[Chris Berman]] was the host. [[Washington State University]] won the 1988 tournament.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://espn.go.com/page2/s/murphy/040202.html |title=The Super Bowl ... of Sports Trivia |last=Murphy |first=Brian |year=2002 |website=espn.com |series=Page 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the park was considered superior to its predecessor, it was predicted to fail by industry observers at the grand opening. Its relatively standard rides were considered no match as a [[Disney World]] competitor. Industry observers were proved correct, as the project was quickly falling into financial ruin within 18 months of its grand opening, at which point, [[employee]] layoffs and reduced hours were used to try to cut costs. To further limit expenses, the park closed before sunset for almost the entire year, rendering its antique style gas lighting (that cost over $1 million to install) useless.

==History==
[[Jim Monaghan]] sold [[Circus World (theme park)|Circus World]] for stock to [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] on  May  10, 1986. HBJ, which had just bought several parks including the [[SeaWorld]] parks and [[Cypress Gardens]], had a new idea for the area, and closed the park at opening time that day to rebuilding it into Boardwalk and Baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughan|first1=Vicki|title=Circus World Sold And Closed|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-05-14/business/8601290050_1_circus-world-high-flying-circus-circus-motif|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=Sun Sentinel|date=May 14, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company expected to have the park open in December 1986. With Circus World's poor reputation, Boardwalk and Baseball was expected by HBJ to restore the park's stature, and would have the expertise available through its purchase of other theme parks, Sea World and Cypress Gardens, the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vaughan |first1=Vicki |title=Making Circus World Property A Winner Observers: Hbj Skilled At Enlivening Properties |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-05-19/business/0220280269_1_circus-world-cypress-gardens-world-theme |accessdate=July 20, 2018 |work=Orlando Sentinel |publisher=tribune Publishing |date=May 19, 1986 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBJ spent $50 million transforming the park and adding the baseball stadium.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball theme park strikes out |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0cBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6163%2C5454410 |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |work=Gainesville Sun |agency=AP |publisher=New York Times Company |date=January 19, 1990 |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Minor league baseball|Class A]] [[Florida State League]] Royal affiliate was purchased by HBJ in early 1987 with the team to move here.&lt;ref name=krnp&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Jay |title=Ah, Ya Can`t Beat Fun At The Old Theme Park |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-26/travel/8702010657_1_amusement-park-faceball-card-studio-theme-park |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=Chicago Tribune |agency=Knight-Ridder Newspapers |publisher=tribunedigital |date=April 26, 1987 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and closure===

HBJ sold its theme park assets (which included SeaWorld and Cypress Gardens) to [[Busch Entertainment Corporation]] in September 1989 due to mounting debt, and they closed the park on January 17, 1990 a few hours early. The stadium would continue its operations, while the park and stadium were up for sale. The KC Royals had a spring training contract until 2002 and the Baseball City Royals would also continue regular play at the stadium. With 876 employees at closure, the park was one of Polk County's largest employers.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;  Most of it was demolished except for the stadium and a building that held an [[IMAX]] theatre (the very first one at Circus World). The Baseball City Royals (FSL) were sold following the 1992 season and moved to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], becoming the [[Daytona Cubs]], where they remain to this day. The Gulf Coast League Royals, who had moved at the same time to Ft. Myers, returned in 2000 for their final three years in Florida before being replaced by the Arizona League Royals. The Kansas City Royals moved their spring training home and entire Florida operations department to [[Surprise, Arizona]] in 2003. The stadium and theatre were demolished soon afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itchyfish.com/amusement-parks-of-yesteryear-boardwalk-and-baseball-in-haines-city-florida/|title=Amusement Parks of Yesteryear: Boardwalk and Baseball in Haines City, Florida|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After sitting idle for over a decade, the site was sold to developer [[Victor Posner]] in 2001. [[Posner Park]], a large retail complex with several [[Big-box store|big box stores]], opened on the site in 2008, eliminating the final traces of the long-gone park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouffard |first=Kevin |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070523/NEWS/705230475/1039 |title=Penney, Target to Anchor New Site |publisher=TheLedger.com |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52665">The ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series of [[fighting game]]s, created by [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]], has been the subject of various [[video game controversies|controversies]] since its creation in the 1990s. In particular, ''Mortal Kombat'' has often been criticised from a broad spectrum of politicians and other critics for its unrestrained use of graphic and bloody violence (both in the game's regular combat scenes and its [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]]—finishing moves which allow the player to kill or otherwise maim opponent characters). The violent nature of the series, one of the earliest of its kind, has led to the creation and continued presence of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] and other ratings boards for video games. Various ''Mortal Kombat'' games have been [[censorship|censored]] or banned in several countries, and the franchise was the subject of several court cases.

Every version had this feature, with the exception of the versions on Nintendos consoles due to content guidelines. ''Mortal Kombat'' became one of the key games leading to the 1993 US Senate hearings on videogame violence, which led to the creation of the [[ESRB]]. While Nintendo had proudly trumpeted its less violent ''Mortal Kombat'', the lure of the dollar was too much and ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' was released with blood on all formats."

}}

The ''Mortal Kombat'' series' violence, particularly its "[[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]]", was a source of major controversy during the early 1990s.{{#tag:ref|According to The Realm of Mortal Kombat editor-in-chief and site manager, Jeff Greeson, as cited by [[GameSpot]], "everything was over the top. From the pools of blood spewing from your character, to the outrageous gruesomeness of the game's fatalities. ''Mortal Kombat'' not only shocked anyone who had ever played the game, but those who simply walked by the game were mesmerized by its gore. ''Mortal Kombat'' was generally quiet in the arcades, at least as far as lawmakers were concerned. Once Acclaim received the rights to bring the game to the home console markets, they brought [it] into the spotlight of the general public. The media picked up on the fears that the public had of bringing such violent imagery into their homes through a device that children played with. ... When you pinpoint and highlight the game's violence and nothing else, it was hard to be a defender of the game during that time."&lt;ref name=gspot/&gt;|group="note"}} A [[moral panic]] over the series, fueled by outrage from the mass media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob Crossley, BBC |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27620071 |title=Mortal Kombat: Violent game that changed video games industry |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] hearing and helped to pave the way for the creation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) game rating system in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Doug Gross, CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/06/29/violent.video.games/index.html?_s=PM:TECH |title=The 10 biggest violent video-game controversies - CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qj.net/ps3/news/esrb-talks-mortal-kombat.html |title=ESRB Talk About of the Mortal Kombat Games Series|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p14_01.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414040202/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p14_01.html |archivedate=2010-04-14 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Years later, in 2010, [[Ed Boon]] revealed that he had actually sympathised with much of the outrage and admitted, "I wouldn't want my ten-year-old kid playing a game like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-11-19-mk-creator-agreed-with-gore-controversy|title=MK creator agreed with gore controversy|author=Fred Dutton|date=19 November 2010|work=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

===Congressional hearing and response===
{{main|1993 Congressional hearings on video games}}
During the U.S. Congressional hearing on video game violence, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] Senator [[Herb Kohl]], working with Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], attempted to illustrate why government regulation of video games was needed by showing clips from 1992's ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Night Trap]]'' (another game featuring [[Digitizing|digitized]] actors).&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Steve Kent, ''The Ultimate History of Video Games''.&lt;/ref&gt; Brought in as an expert, Professor [[Eugene F. Provenzo]] commented that such games "have almost TV-quality graphics [but] are overwhelmingly violent, [[sexism|sexist]] and [[racism|racist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Karen J. Cohen, States News Service, "Kohl still wants video games bill". ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', December 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nintendo]], which had a policy of screening games for content like blood, had refused to allow gore in ''Mortal Kombat's'' release for their home system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134205/mortal_kombat__a_book_excerpt_.php|title=Gamasutra - Mortal Kombat - A Book Excerpt from Replay: The History of Video Games|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, their rival, [[Sega]], released the game with their MA-13 rating, resulting in a great commercial success for them when millions of consumers chose their version over Nintendo's.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin C. Pyle, Scott Cunningham, ''Bad for You: Exposing the War on Fun!'', page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo's representatives attempted to use that fact to attack Sega during the hearings.{{#tag:ref|As narrated by Greeson, "in the hearing, a Nintendo representative attacked Sega for its release of violent games and said his own company had tried to mitigate the industry's worst excesses. In response, the Sega representative pulled out a prop - [[Super Scope|a bazooka-style gun accessory]] used by some Nintendo games - and asked if that was the appropriate means to teach nonviolence to children."&lt;ref name=gspot/&gt;|group="note"}} In response, Sega's Spanish division cancelled the release of their version of ''Mortal Kombat'' in Spain, fearing the game would stir up as much controversy there as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=International Outlook|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=53|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=December 1993|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieberman had been one of the first politicians to voice concerns over ''Mortal Kombat'' in 1993, and continued to be one of the most avid critics of violent video games. He later referenced the series and ''Doom'' in a 1996 statement, when he joined Kohl and the psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] in a campaign to inform Congress about the new wave of violent games such as ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Bond Potter, Renee Christine Romano, ''Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History that Talks Back'', page 209.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2000s, however, the controversy surrounding the series had wound down significantly. In 2006, [[Associated Press]] writer Lou Kesten wrote that Lieberman had remained "one of the video game industry's most persistent critic[s], but ''Mortal Kombat'' is no longer the flashpoint of the game violence debate. Its brand of ''mano-a-mano'' brawling is seen as kind of old-fashioned today, now that the likes of ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' are serving up the indiscrimate slaughter of innocent civilians."&lt;ref&gt;Lou Kesten, the Associated Press. "Blood and guts a video game standby." ''Park City Daily News'', October 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' commented in 2012 that "the reason the 1992 classic remains seminal is because it broke an implicit [[taboo]] about what was okay to put in a game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Narcisse |first=Evan |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/11/15/all-time-100-video-games/slide/mortal-kombat-1992/ |title=Mortal Kombat &amp;#124; All-TIME 100 Video Games &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Techland.time.com |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119233404/http://techland.time.com/2012/11/15/all-time-100-video-games/slide/mortal-kombat-1992/ |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game ratings and bans===
As with the first ''Mortal Kombat'' game, the extremely bloody content of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' became the subject of a great deal of controversy regarding violent video games. In 1994, ''Mortal Kombat II'' was added to the index of works deemed harmful to young people by Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] (Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien, or BPjM). The next year, all versions of the game, except for Game Boy's, were confiscated from the German market for violating §131 of the country's penal code, which prohibited showing gruesome violence against humans. (The ban ended in 2005, due to the ten-year limitation for confiscations.) The game's violence was censored in Japan. There, Nintendo insisted on changing the blood shown in the game from red to green, as well as making the screen turn black-and-white for all character-specific Fatality moves.&lt;ref&gt;''EGM2'' 5 (November 1994), page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerald Wurm |url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=3422 |title=Mortal Kombat II (Comparison: Japanese SNES Version - International Version) |publisher=Movie-Censorship.com |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, ''Mortal Kombat'' developer and publisher [[Midway Games]] was forced to tone down the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s finishing move to secure the ESRB T-rating for ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5068657/mk-vs-dc-the-jokers-fatality-gets-t-rated|title=MK vs. DC: The Joker's Fatality Gets T-Rated|work=Kotaku|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Swiss Social Democrat]] politician Evi Allemann campaigned to outlaw ''Mortal Kombat'', ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'', and video games displaying interactive "cruel acts of violence" in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2010/04/05/swiss-game-ban-may-feature-only-little-censorship|title=Swiss Game Ban May Feature Only a Little Censorship|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009202712/http://gamepolitics.com/2010/04/05/swiss-game-ban-may-feature-only-little-censorship|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
In 1998, the [[Florida House of Representatives]]' [[Barry Silver]] sponsored a bill to regulate video game violence, which he stated "[has] affected the moral fiber of our youth." The bill's initial proponents included Florida's Democratic [[Governor of Florida|Governor]], [[Lawton Chiles]] (who alleged that violent video games can become "an instruction manual for murder and mayhem"&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press, "Chiles looks to restrict violent video games". ''Boca Raton News'', April 3, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Florida State University]] Professor Murray Krantz, a specialist in child development. Eventually, the bill garnered support from more than 50 lawmakers and various groups ranging from the Florida [[Parent-Teacher Association]] to the [[Christian Coalition of America]]. After seeing a videotape of [[gameplay]] from one of the ''Mortal Kombat'' games, the House Governmental Rules and Regulation Committee passed the bill unanimously. An Associated Press reporter described the tape's content as follows: "After [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|a male warrior]] repeatedly pummels a female opponent, the game urges him to 'finish her'.

Opponents, such as the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]]'s founder and president, [[Doug Lowenstein]], regarded the bill as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]], violating the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment's]] [[freedom of speech]] provision. Video game magazine ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' called the bill "a serious threat to video games in Florida" and expressed concern that the measure "might lead to the removal of all public video games in the state and possibly start a national trend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/florida-house-panel-votes-to-regulate-video-game-violence|title=Florida House panel votes to regulate video-game violence - First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140902063833/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/florida-house-panel-votes-to-regulate-video-game-violence|archivedate=2 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Senate]] had set up an inquiry in response to the original ''Mortal Kombat,'' ''[[Time Killers]]'', and ''Night Trap'', and the surrounding media coverage; the Senate's inquiry led to the Commonwealth Classification Act, which came into force on March 1, 1995, and introduced the [[Australian Classification Board]]. Almost exactly 18 years later, the Board finally banned the 2011 ''Mortal Kombat'' game for its "explicit depictions of dismemberment, decapitation, disembowelment and other brutal forms of slaughter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/gaming/it-took-18-years-but-mortal-kombat-is-finally-banned/story-e6frfrt9-1226014699735 It took 18 years, but Mortal Kombat's finally banned], news.com.au, March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's publisher, [[Warner Bros.

In 2005, California passed a statewide ban on selling violent video games to minors, proposed and championed by former [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. However, the ban was eventually struck down by a 7-2 vote in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' in 2011. The Court ruled that "video games qualify for First Amendment protection," making the ban unconstitutional. The Justices' majority opinion declared: "Reading [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing ''Mortal Kombat''. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/supreme-court-cites-first-amendment-mortal-kombat-in-ruling-against-ca-video-game-ban/|title=Violent Video Games - Supreme Court Ruling - Free Speech - Mediaite|date=27 June 2011|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Elena Kagan]] was quoted as calling ''Mortal Kombat'' "an iconic game, which I am sure half of the clerks who work for us spent considerable amounts of time in their adolescence playing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/brent-bozell/article_65b58fee-ebb7-11df-840f-001cc4c03286.html|title=Justices should keep video game violence from kids|work=The Quad-City Times|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertisement censorship===
''Mortal Kombat''{{'}}s advertisements received criticism as well. In 1993, Senator Lieberman, referencing one of Sega's television commercials for the game, argued that the ad itself too promoted violence. The video, as described by ''[[Weekly Reader]]'', "shows a boy gaining the respect of his friends after winning ''Mortal Kombat''. At the end of the commercial, the boy angrily knocks over a tray of cookies given to him by friends now frightened by the boy's fighting ability. The boy roars, &lt;nowiki&gt;'I said I wanted chocolate chip!'&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16809718.html|title=Critics zap video games: senators urge government action to curb video-game violence.|date=January 3, 1994|publisher=[[Weekly Reader|Weekly Reader Corp.]]|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advertisements were subjected to censorship. The 2011 edition of ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition]]'' awarded the ''Mortal Kombat'' series the world record for the earliest video game poster to be censored: "On April 22, 2003, Britain's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) took the then unprecedented step of condemning the poster campaign promoting ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]''. They claimed that the poster - which showed a '[[hoodie]]' wiping his bloodstained hand on a businessman above the words 'It's in us all' – was 'irresponsible' and 'condoned violence'. The poster was unsurprisingly withdrawn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2011: Gamer's Edition|date=January 3, 2011|publisher=BradyGames|isbn=0744012619}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blood on the Carpet'', a TV commercial for 2005's ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'' created by London-based company Maverick Media, was also "slammed by the [ASA] as condoning and glorifying violence." The video, as described by ''[[The Register]]'', "features a boardroom scene in which a Mr Linn, the mysterious trouble-shooter at a sales meeting, instructs two men to fight. Punches lead to a pen being stabbed into an arm; then a water jug is smashed over an executive's head – before his heart is ripped from his chest. Mr Linn concludes proceedings by decapitating another executive with his hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mortal Kombat viral ad glorified violence, says ASA |date= December 22, 2005 |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/22/outlaw_mortal_asa/ |publisher= The Register |accessdate= September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the complaint, according to the ASA's report, was: "We told Midway not to repeat the approach and told them to consult CAP Copy Advice before producing future ads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Non-broadcast Adjudications |date= December 21, 2005 |url= http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?Adjudication_id=40698 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080326232845/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication%2BDetails.htm?Adjudication_id=40698 |archivedate= 2008-03-26 |accessdate= September 8, 2009 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies on video game violence===
*In 2000, psychologists [[Craig A. Anderson]] and Karen Dill conducted two related studies on the effects of media violence. The studies involved notably violent games, including ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''. They concluded that playing such games makes players, especially males, act more aggressively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/04/35863|title=Study: Joysticks Lead to Mayhem|work=WIRED|accessdate=7 October 2014|date=2000-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the studies' publication, a year-long "flurry of new scrutiny" was directed at ''Mortal Kombat'' by U.S. lawmakers and the media.&lt;ref&gt;"Violent video games are drawing fire from many lawmakers." ''The Southeast Missourian'', July 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2008 experiment by Richard J. Barlett, Christopher P. Harris, and Callie Bruey also examined how playing ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'' affected subjects' [[hostility]] and [[heart rate]]. They interpreted their findings as evidence that players exhibited "more [[Aggression|aggressive]] thoughts activated in [[semantic memory]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barlett|first1=Christopher P.|last2=Harris |first2=Richard J.|last3=Bruey|first3=Callie|year=2008 |title=The effect of the amount of blood in a violent video game on aggression, hostility, and arousal|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=44|issue=2|pages=539–546|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a 2010 experiment conducted by psychologists [[Brad Bushman]] and Bryan Gibson, using ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' and two other violent games (''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 5]]''), the authors concluded "that the aggression stimulating effects of a violent video game can persist long after the game has been turned off, if people ruminate about the violent content in the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2010/09/20/study-examines-effect-ruminating-over-violent-games|title=Study Examines Effect of Ruminating over Violent Games|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009204651/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2010/09/20/study-examines-effect-ruminating-over-violent-games|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The following year, Dr. Brock Bastian from the [[University of Queensland]]'s School of Psychology performed an experiment in which participants played ''Mortal Kombat'', fighting against each other and against [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]-controlled opponents. The study, published in the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]'', claimed to have "found evidence that playing violent video games leads players to see themselves, and their opponents, as lacking in core human qualities such as warmth, open-mindedness, and intelligence." Bastian concluded that "the findings of this study point to the potential long-term effects of violent video game play and suggest that repeated exposure to these [[Dehumanization|dehumanising]] experiences may result in chronic changes in self-perception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=23987 |title=UQ study confirms dangers of violent video games - UQ News Online - The University of Queensland |publisher=Uq.edu.au |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australasianscience.com.au/article/issue-january-and-february-2012/video-violence-lowers-self-esteem.html|title=Video Violence Lowers Self-Esteem - Australasian Science Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvpacific.com/index.php/news/read/university-of-queensland-study-believes-violent-games-reduce-humanity/087139|title=University of Queensland study believes violent games reduce humanity|work=MCV Pacific|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bruce D. Bartholow, a psychology professor at the [[University of Missouri]], said that there is a fear that this simulated violence can translate into real-life violence as "the extent that a player learns to make specific or violent responses in the context of the game, those same skills could transfer to similar scenarios outside the game, potentially increasing aggression in nongaming situations."&lt;ref name=hlntv&gt;Craig Johnson, [http://www.hlntv.com/article/2014/06/26/mortal-kombat-release-violence-controversy "'Mortal Kombat' is back, but this time (some) fans cringe"], HLN, July 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-life violence===
In the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999, United States President [[Bill Clinton]] stated that "video games like ''Mortal Kombat'', ''[[Killer Instinct (1994 video game)|Killer Instinct]]'', and ''Doom'', the very game played obsessively by [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|the two young men]] who ended so many lives in [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], make our children more active participants in simulated violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2010/02/08/internet-hub-offers-both-sides-game-violence-debate|title=Internet Hub Offers Both Sides of Game Violence Debate|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009202821/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2010/02/08/internet-hub-offers-both-sides-game-violence-debate|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[conservatism|conservative]] activist against sexual themes and violence in video games and other entertainment media, represented the families of three of the Columbine victims. Thompson unsuccessfully sued the producers of ''Doom'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' and ''Mortal Kombat'', stating he intended "to hurt" the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref&gt;John Shelton Lawrence, Robert Jewett, ''The Myth of the American Superhero'', page 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Thompson also sent a [[cease and desist]] letter to Midway Games, writing: "It has today come to my attention that the newly recently{{sic}} ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' contains an unauthorized commercial exploitation of my name, photograph, image, and likeness within the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jack Thompson vs. Mortal Kombat |date= 2006-10-27 |url= http://games.slashdot.org/story/06/10/27/1649254/jack-thompson-vs-mortal-kombat|publisher= Slashdot| accessdate= 2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/jack-thompson-orders-mk-quotcease-and-desistquot/|title=Jack Thompson Orders MK "Cease and Desist"|work=Edge Online|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway did not respond.

Some critics have alleged that the ''Mortal Kombat'' series influenced particular cases of real-life lethal violence other than the Columbine massacre:

*In 1999, Brazil banned ''Mortal Kombat'', ''[[Postal (video game)|Postal]]'', ''[[Carmageddon]]'', and four [[first-person shooter]] games for allegedly inspiring twenty-four-year-old medical student Mateus da Costa Meira's deadly shooting rampage in a cinema in [[São Paulo]], which was primarily blamed on ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''.&lt;ref name=gspot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/|title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy|work=GameSpot|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/brazil-bans-violent-video-games|title=Brazil Bans Violent Video Games|work=Animation World Network|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/93540/Brazil_Bans_Six_Games.php|title=Gamasutra - Brazil Bans Six Games|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007, twenty-year-old Patrick Morris used a shotgun to kill fifteen-year-old Diego Aguilar in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]], in what prosecutors alleged was a drug deal-related killing. However, Morris' defense attorney alleged that violent video games such as ''Mortal Kombat'' "may have blurred Morris' ability to distinguish reality and the consequences of his actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2007/02/28/video-games-made-me-do-it-defense-raised-in-oregon-murder-trial|title="Video Games Made Me Do It" Defense Raised in Oregon Murder Trial|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009202821/http://gamepolitics.com/2007/02/28/video-games-made-me-do-it-defense-raised-in-oregon-murder-trial|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist and racial perspectives===
Some critics have condemned the ''Mortal Kombat'' series as sexist and/or racist. [[Guy Aoki]], the president of the advocacy group Media Action Network for Asian Americans, rebuked ''Mortal Kombat II'' in 1994 for allegedly perpetuating existing [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|stereotypes of Asians]] as martial arts experts, with the game's portrayal of characters such as [[Kitana]], [[Kung Lao]], [[Liu Kang]], [[Mileena]], [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[Shang Tsung]] and [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]. Allyne Mills, publicist for the game's publisher [[Acclaim Entertainment]], answered: "This is a fantasy game, with all different characters. This is a martial arts game which comes from Asia. The game was not created to foster stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;May Lam, "Do Fighting Video Games Prolong Stereotypes of Asian Americans?" ''AsianWeek'', September 23, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jotdown.es/2012/11/polemica-en-juego-ii/|title=Polémica en juego (II)|work=Jot Down Cultural Magazine|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[critical theory|critical studies]] professor [[Marsha Kinder]] denounced ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' for allegedly allowing players to have what she termed "a [[misogyny|misogynist]] aspect to the combat." Kinder was quoted as saying that in ''Mortal Kombat II'', "some of the most violent possibilities are against women. Also, their fatality moves are highly eroticised.

''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', May 29, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 review of ''[[Mortal Kombat 9]]'', Maddy Myers of ''[[The Boston Phoenix]]'' wrote "''Mortal Kombat'' represents everything that's awful about video games. It's trashy, it's corny, it's gory, it's sexist, it's racist — and it's deceptively addictive. ... The entire game is an alienating reminder that if you're not a white, heterosexual male, it's not 'for' you. Or perhaps the intended message is, 'Violence is sexy'? Either way, I'm uncomfortable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Maddy | last=Myers | url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/recroom/120434-mortal-kombat-9/ | title=Review: Mortal Kombat 9 - Videogames | work=''[[The Boston Phoenix]] | date=2011-05-10 | accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 book titled ''From Barbie to Mortal Kombat'', written by media scholars [[Justine Cassell]] and [[Henry Jenkins]], the series was used to represent "the basic boy cyberworld of aggression, action and dead bodies." While reporting about the book, liberal journalist [[Ellen Goodman]] commented: "Much as we want little girls in the computer circle, it's hard to lament the fact that our daughters are not drawn to Kombat bootstraps."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Goodman, "Trouble in cyberspace: For girls, virtual world is more regressive than the real world". ''Daily News'', March 26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In another 1999 article, Goodman also mentioned the game negatively by writing that while "you're worrying about violence and gratitious sex" and "may want to get ''Mortal Kombat'' off your computer," the "folks on your right" are "worrying about [issues such as] keeping the sexes in their designated roles," when arguing that left-wingers should not join up with conservatives into a common "anti-entertainment, anti-[[Hollywood]] brigade and assume that we are all singing the same key."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Goodman, "Right wing can't stand Lilith, other women with uppity ideals". ''The Free Lance-Star'', June 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, U.S. Appeals Court Judge [[Richard Posner]] considered ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' to be "a feminist violent video game". Finding that [[Indianapolis]]' attempt to ban ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' violated the First Amendment, Judge Posner wrote "the game is feminist in depicting a woman as fully capable of holding her own in violent combat with heavily armed men. It thus has a message, even an 'ideology' just as books and movies do." Judge Posner further marveled that "the woman wins all the duels. She is as strong as the men, she is more skillful, more determined, and she does not flinch at the sight of blood."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13025078069235542866&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''American Amusement Machine Ass'n v.

===''Daniel Pesina v. Midway Manufacturing Co.''===
In 1996, actor [[Daniel Pesina]] (who had portrayed [[Johnny Cage]], Sub-Zero, Scorpion, [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]], [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]] and [[Noob Saibot]] in the first two games) sued Midway Games, [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics Games, Inc]], Acclaim Entertainment, Nintendo, and Sega. He alleged "that all defendants used his persona, name, and likeness without authorization in the home version of ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Mortal Kombat II'' and the related products." The case was tried in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] with Judge [[Elaine E. Bucklo]] presiding. The court concluded that "alleged use of martial artist's name, likeness or persona in a martial arts video game did not violate his common-law right of publicity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1996988948FSupp40_1975|title=PESINA v.

In 1997, ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Mortal Kombat II'' actors Philip Ahn (Shang Tsung), Elizabeth Malecki ([[Sonya Blade]]), and [[Katalin Zamiar]] (Kitana, Mileena, and [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]]) jointly sued Midway Games, Williams Electronics Games, Acclaim, Nintendo and Sega for using their likenesses in an unauthorized way.

===''Wilson v. Midway Games, Inc.''===
In 1997, thirteen-year-old Noah Wilson was killed by Yancy Salazar, also thirteen. Salazar stabbed Wilson in the chest with a kitchen knife and severed his [[aorta]], leaving Wilson to die after an hour of massive blood loss. The victim's mother, Andrea Wilson, alleged that her son was killed due to Salazar's strong interest in ''Mortal Kombat.'' She claimed that Salazar was so "obsessed" with the game that he thought he was actually the ''Mortal Kombat'' character [[Cyrax]], who she claimed used a Fatality in which he grabs the opponent in a headlock and stabs his opponent in the chest. In fact, this Fatality did not exist and was never performed by the character Cyrax. With Judge [[Janet Bond Arterton]] presiding, the case was tried in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]]. The Court ruled that "Wilson's complaint fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson v.

===Royalties lawsuits related to Time Warner's 2009 Acquisition of Midway assets===
In 2009, Lawrence Kasanoff, producer of the ''Mortal Kombat'' films, TV series, soundtracks, and live tour, and his company, [[Threshold Entertainment]], sued Midway in [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]]. Kasanoff sued over what he claimed were his [[intellectual property]] (IP) interests in the franchise. He was attempting to preserve his intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyrights to certain ''Mortal Kombat'' characters, and to retain the right to create derivative film and television projects based on the franchise. Kasanoff attempted to block a $33-million bid for ''Mortal Kombat'' assets by [[Time Warner]], whose [[New Line Cinema]] developed movies based on the franchise. Kasanoff's complaint stated: "The ''Mortal Kombat'' series, as it stands today, is far more a creation of Threshold and Kasanoff than of Midway. Midway's creative input was almost entirely limited to the videogames. On their own, the video games provided only minimal backstory and mythology, and only flat, 'stock' characters. ... Kasanoff and Threshold were responsible for virtually all of the creative input that went into turning the videogame concept into a multimedia enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/06/25/mortal-kombat-film-producer-sues-midway-over-ip-rights#.URKOtL92SrF |title=Mortal Kombat Film Producer Sues Midway Over IP Rights |publisher=GamePolitics |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Chalk |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/92711-Midway-Sued-Over-Mortal-Kombat-Rights |title=The Escapist : News : Midway Sued Over Mortal Kombat Rights |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other lawsuits related to millions of dollars of unpaid royalties were filed during the periods of 2000-2004 and 2005-2008. In 2011, [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] Judge Ronald M. Sohigian awarded Kasanoff only $14,981 and dismissed his other claims. He also ordered Threshold to pay Time Warner, Inc. $25,412 in legal fees after determining that Time Warner, Inc. was the "prevailing party." Kasanoff appealed the ruling and the denial of a jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/03/warner-bros-prevails-in-one-mortal-kombat-royalties-lawsuit-two-to-go.html|title=Warner Bros. prevails in one 'Mortal Kombat' royalties lawsuit, two to go|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/thr-esq/warner-bros-conquers-mortal-kombat-161233 |title=Warner Bros.

"'''Cupid Shuffle'''" is a song by [[Cupid (singer)|Cupid]] from his 2007 studio album ''[[Time for a Change (album)|Time for a Change]]''. It has spawned a popular [[line dance]] and has drawn comparisons to [[DJ Casper]]'s "[[Cha Cha Slide]]."

In the United States, the song peaked at #66 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #21 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, both in the August 18, 2007 issue.

The song was first featured in [[Acclaim Games|Acclaim]]'s online music video game ''[[Dance! Online]]''. A rap remix version featuring [[Unk]] and [[Fabo]] was released to rhythm radio in August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promoonly.com/view_issue.php?IssueID=2754|title=View Listing - Promo Only: Music &amp; Music Video|website=www.promoonly.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Hurley remix was released to underground club in October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promoonly.com/view_issue.php?IssueID=2908|title=View Listing - Promo Only: Music &amp; Music Video|website=www.promoonly.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Solitair]] remix released to rhythm club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promoonly.com/view_issue.php?IssueID=2877|title=View Listing - Promo Only: Music &amp; Music Video|website=www.promoonly.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well.

==Remixes==
Two official remixes, the main remix, the Rap Remix, features rappers [[DJ Unk]] and [[Fabo]] of [[D4L]]. The 2nd remix, the Latin Remix, features rappers [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] and [[Baby Bash]]. In August 2009, two EPs of club mixes for the song were released on iTunes.

==''The Voice''==
In 2012, Cupid chose the song for his audition to the [[The Voice (U.S. season 3)|third season]] of the American music competition show ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'', broadcast on [[NBC]]. Although he gave a different version of the hit, none of the four judges pressed their "I Want You" button and he was automatically eliminated from further competition in the show. But after turning their chairs, judge [[Cee Lo Green]] recognized Cupid and asked him to perform another song to prove that "he can sing".

==In popular culture==
*The song and dance are featured in a scene at the end of the film ''[[Jumping the Broom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cupid|title=My Life|year=2011|publisher=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In Week 5 of the 2008 [[NFL]] season, three [[Miami Dolphins]], including running back Ronnie Brown, used the "Cupid Shuffle" dance as a celebratory dance after scoring a touchdown against the [[San Diego Chargers]]. The three were later fined as the celebration was deemed premeditated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3635993 | title=No love here: Three Dolphins each fined $10k for end zone celebration | work=[[ESPN]] | agency=[[Associated Press]] | last=Graham | first=Tim | date=October 8, 2008 | accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*This song appears in ''[[Dance Central 3]]'' as the 2000s dance craze.
*This song is used as a dance craze of the contestants of [[Philippines|Philippine]] talent search "[[Protégé: The Battle For The Big Artista Break]]" in 2012.

'''Jason Pargin''' (born January 10, 1975), known by his pen name '''David Wong''', is an American humor writer.&lt;ref name=LCNAF/&gt; He is the executive editor of humor website [[Cracked.com]], a recurring guest in the Cracked Podcast and has written four novels, ''[[John Dies at the End]]'' (2007), ''[[This Book Is Full of Spiders]]'' (2012), ''Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits'' (2015), and ''[[What the Hell Did I Just Read]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/person/jason-pargin/|title=Jason Pargin on Earwolf|website=www.earwolf.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''John Dies at the End'' was adapted into a [[John Dies at the End (film)|film of the same name]] in 2012.

In 1999, Wong started his own humor site, ''Pointless Waste of Time'' (PWOT), which would eventually be absorbed into Cracked.com.&lt;ref name="sacredtriskele"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= November 7, 2010 |url = http://jodilee.sacredtriskele.net/?p=1198|title = Inter-review Sunday: David Wong &amp; JDatE| accessdate =May 12, 2012 | last=Lee| first= Jodi |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a copy editor at a law firm, he would spend his days copy editing insurance claims and nights posting humor articles on PWOT.  Every Halloween on the site he wrote a new chapter of an online story that he published as a [[webserial]].&lt;ref name="Mileur_DE_2012"/&gt; An estimated 70,000 people read the free online versions before they were removed in September 2008.  Wong used the feedback from people reading each episode of the webserial to tweak what would eventually become the book, ''[[John Dies at the End]]''.&lt;ref name="sacredtriskele"/&gt;

[[Demand Media]] hired Wong to be the head editor for their revamped online magazine, Cracked.com, although Demand was not aware of Wong's book deal.&lt;ref name="Mileur_DE_2012"/&gt;  As part of the deal, he merged PWOT into the Cracked forums. Wong has described a disconnection between the old ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' print magazine and the humor site Cracked.com due to multiple relaunches and almost entirely new staff.&lt;ref name="adhominem" /&gt; As a child, he read ''Cracked'' magazine's biggest competitor, [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="adhominem"&gt;{{cite web |date=2012|url = http://adhominem.weebly.com/01182011.html|title = The many dimensions of David Wong|publisher = Adhominem| accessdate =May 12, 2012 | last=Adhominem|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a popular article published at Cracked.com, Wong coined the neologism "monkeysphere" which introduces the concept of [[Dunbar's number]] in a humorous manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html |title=Inside the Monkeysphere |author=David Wong |accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong referred to Dunbar's number again in his novel, ''This Book Is Full of Spiders''.

When Pargin started PWOT, he took on the pseudonym of David Wong to keep his real and online lives separate. Since much of his writing involved situations similar to his real life, he did not want co-workers and his employers to think that his rants about fictional characters were inspired by real people. The origin of the name was a character from one of his first short stories. He writes

{{quote|"It's not a very interesting story, 'David Wong' was the villain in a story I had written way back in the day, so when I was signing up for my first online accounts in 1998 I started using it. Then when hate mail started coming in with a bunch of racist anti-Chinese insults, I realized I had either gone badly wrong or badly right."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.reddit.com/r/BestofCracked/comments/2q2rck/comment/cn2a2y8|title=Reddit AMA thread|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After his book and movie deal, his real name became common knowledge, but Wong accepted it, saying "It's not like I'm under the Witness Protection program or anything. I was just trying to keep things simple in my personal life."&lt;ref name="adhominem"/&gt;

==Published works==
His first novel ''[[John Dies at the End]]'' was at first rejected by publishers, and Wong considered taking it down until indie horror publisher Permuted Press agreed to publish the novel in 2007.&lt;ref name="Cracked.Version"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= September 25, 2011|url = http://www.cracked.com/article_19477_john-dies-at-end-teaser-trailer.html|title = John Dies at the End Teaser Trailer|publisher = [[Cracked.com|Cracked]]| accessdate =May 12, 2012 | last=Wong| first= David|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second edition by [[Thomas Dunne Books]] was published with additional material as a hardcover on September 29, 2009.&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= July 13, 2009|url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-55513-9|title = Fiction review|publisher = [[Publishers Weekly]]| accessdate =May 12, 2012 | last=Publishers Weekly|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|ref = harv|date = September 29, 2009|url = http://www.johndiesattheend.com/updates/?p=471|title = September 29, 2009|publisher = johndiesattheend.com|accessdate = May 12, 2012|last = Wong|first = David|quote = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120907184030/http://www.johndiesattheend.com/updates/?p=471|archivedate = September 7, 2012|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After enjoying some success, it came to the attention of [[Don Coscarelli]] who decided to adapt it as a film.&lt;ref name="Cracked.Version"/&gt; In 2007, Coscarelli optioned the film rights to ''[[John Dies at the End]]''.&lt;ref name="aintitcoolnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47146|title=Quint knows what Don Coscarelli's new movie is!

'''''Devil Doll''''' (1964) is a [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[horror film]] about an evil [[ventriloquist]], "The Great Vorelli", and his dummy Hugo, directed by [[Lindsay Shonteff]]. It stars [[William Sylvester]] and [[Yvonne Romain]].

==Plot==
Hypnotist/magician "The Great Vorelli" ([[Bryant Haliday]]) and his dummy Hugo perform before a packed audience in [[London]]. The audience observes tension between the ventriloquist and his dummy. American reporter Mark English ([[William Sylvester]]) becomes fascinated with Vorelli, and solicits his girlfriend Marianne Horn ([[Yvonne Romain]]) to go with him to another show. From the beginning, the film drops strong hints that Hugo is actually alive and mobile.

At the following show, Vorelli asks a member of his audience onto the stage. When no one volunteers, English encourages Marianne to go up. Vorelli succeeds in hypnotizing her and making her dance the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]] with an uncredited Ray Landor, "expert Twist dancer". Marianne is left partially hypnotized by Vorelli, who recognizes her as a wealthy heiress. English, wanting to do a story on Vorelli and his unique powers, gets Marianne to invite Vorelli to her aunt's charity ball. Vorelli has already decided to go to the ball, having read about it in the newspaper and seeing it as an opportunity to seduce Marianne.

The night of the ball, Vorelli stays at the mansion of Marianne's aunt, where he seduces her after using his power to subdue her will. In the meantime, Hugo miraculously appears in English's room and asks him for help. Hugo repeats "1948" and "Berlin" before disappearing. The next day, English begins an investigation into Vorelli's past. Meanwhile, Marianne falls into a semi-[[coma]] that the doctors cannot alleviate. In one lucid moment, she tells English that, "He keeps calling me" and, "Make him stop".

Through a colleague, English discovers that Vorelli had once been a disgraced medical doctor who dabbled in Eastern magic. The colleague traces Vorelli to [[Berlin]] and guides English to a former female assistant of Vorelli's who lives there. She tells English that another assistant, "Hugo", had worked for Vorelli in 1947, and would be hypnotized into a state where he could not feel pain as part of their act. The female assistant says that she would catch the two in strange conferences. One night, Vorelli killed Hugo on stage and simultaneously transferred his soul into the dummy. Vorelli was cleared in the death, and no one believed the female assistant's story.

Vorelli's current assistant, who is also his lover, becomes jealous of his relationship with Marianne. Vorelli either manipulates or taunts Hugo into murdering his lover/assistant when Vorelli is visiting with stage crew elsewhere. Vorelli then hires a new, younger assistant whom he also puts under his physical and sexual control. During English's trip to Berlin, Vorelli visits the still-hypnotized Marianne in her home and tells her to announce that she is going to marry him. Vorelli confides to Hugo that he plans to marry Marianne in [[Spain]] and transfer her spirit into a companion doll for Hugo before letting her body die.

Hugo escapes from his cage, smashes the face of the female doll intended for Marianne, and attacks Vorelli. Vorelli seemingly succeeds in wrestling the irate Hugo back into his cage just as English enters the room. "Vorelli" speaks in Hugo's voice and tells English that Hugo has now transferred his soul into Vorelli's body and vice versa. From Hugo's former body, Vorelli begs for help from English, who does not respond as the film ends.

==Mystery Science Theater 3000==

''Devil Doll'' was featured in an October 1997 episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The episode was released on DVD by [[Shout! Factory]] on 9 November 2010.

==Notable cast==
Bryant Haliday was one of the founders of the noted film distribution company [[Janus Films]]. He would later appear in ''[[The Projected Man]]'', another film featured on ''Mystery Science Theater 3000''. William Sylvester and Alan Gifford both later appeared in the critically acclaimed film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968).

==Aspects of production==
[[Frederick E. Smith (author)|Frederick E. Smith]] wrote the original story for ''[[London Mystery Magazine]]'' in 1951, earning £10 for it.  He said that one of the conditions of cashing his cheque was that he had surrendered any rights of resale of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Frederick E. ''Devil Doll'' DVD notes&lt;/ref&gt;

The script was originally written in 1957. The budget came from Gordon Films, Galaworld and the [[NFFC]].&lt;ref name="x cert"&gt;John Hamilton, ''The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70'' Hemlock Books 2013 p 136-142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidney J. Furie]] was originally scheduled to direct but was offered a more prestigious film, so he recommended his fellow Canadian [[Lindsay Shonteff]]. [[Richard Gordon (film producer)|Richard Gordon]] later said Furie advised Shonteff throughout the making of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Tom ''Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Movies: The Mutant Melding of Two Classic Interviews'' 1999 McFarland &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;  Shonteff had to re-edit the film to avoid an [[X rating]] from the [[British Board of Film Censors]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Gordon later said the cost of the film was £20,000 plus $20,000 for expenses and salaries of American personnel, including Gordon and Bryant Halliday, making an estimated total of $60–75,000.&lt;ref name="tom"&gt;Tom Weaver, ''The Horror Hits of Richard Gordon'', Bear Manor Media 2011 p 102-114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{organize section|date=June 2018}}

Ravi (Bimal Jayakody) urges his son, Awantha (Keshan Shashindra), to break a school cricket record. Ravi watches in the coaches box with Mr. Ekanayake. Samalka (Shanudrie Priyasad) is late for the match, which angers Awantha. While playing cricket, Anuhas (Raween Kanishka) sees Samalka and becomes intrigued. Their first major encounter is when Anuhas collides with Samalka on her bike. Awantha and his friends beat him up. Ravi teases Anuhas; angry, Anuhas goes home and asks his mother Udeni (Himali Sayurangi) how she met Ravi. She tells her story in the presence of her niece, Dewmi (Nayanathara Wickramarachchi).

Awantha is abusive towards Samalka, who in turn dislikes him. Her motorbike breaks down, and Anuhas (who works at his Uncle Ananda's garage) fixes it. Awantha confronts him for talking with Samalka, who becomes friends with Anuhas. Dewmi has fallen in love with Anuhas for some time, however, Anuhas only sees her as a sister. Ravi and Amisha want to help Awantha make the national team and marry the wealthy Samalka. Neither Samalka nor Awantha knows that Samalka has an inheritance of shares. Amisha visits Udeni's juice bar to insult Udeni and Anuhas, and Ananda regularly quarrels with Ravi.

At the boys' school, Anuhas is friends with "Mike" and "Chubby", a duo of comical characters who love free food, and Mike trying to be the "Ladies Man". Anuhas is in the same year level as Awantha, who taunts Anuhas. Awantha is supported by his friends Sheran and Danisha.

When Anuhas prevents Awantha's friend, Danisha, from being beaten by his girlfriend's brother; Danisha leaves Awantha and befriends Anuhas. Anuhas is beaten and hospitalised by the men Anuhas defended Danisha from. Samalka visits him and is seen by Udeni and Ananda. Anuhas learns the truth about Samalka from her diary: her father is dead, and her mother is in a mental institution, much to Samalka's annoyance.

Dewmi feels uneasy when Samalka and Anuhas are together, as she realises that Anuhas does not spend time with her as he used and devotes his time to Samalka. Ananda and his wife approve of the relationship between their son, Dhanuka, and the schoolgirl Malki. When Samalka's birthday comes around, Anuhas plans a surprise birthday party for Samalka and gives her a dress. Dewmi, worried and saddened that Anuhas has gone to host the birthday party, tries to bring him home by feigning an emergency, in order to separate Anuhas from Samalka. This results in Anuhas being angry with Dewmi, saddening her more.

Udeni is reluctant to allow Anuhas to play in the school cricket team, out of fear he will be mocked and his potential overlooked, but Ananda convinces her to send Anuhas to the school cricket team, demonstrating exceptional talent and Coach Ekanayake publicly acknowledges his potential. Seeing that Coach Ekanayake is starting to favour Anuhas, Ravi replaces the coach with a [[Cronyism|crony]], Lionel Sadun. He discriminates and condescends to the players, especially Anuhas, in an effort to make Anuhas hate cricket and leave the team.

While this is happening, Awantha and Sheran notice Dewmi leaving the tuition class one night and decide to jokingly catcall, but then Anuhas comes on his bike and picks Dewmi up. 
The girls and boys school partner up to put together a concert, featuring skits, songs and dances. This is one of the rare times that the boys and girls interact on school grounds. On the day, Udeni and Dewmi's family arrive to watch when there is a mix up of seating arrangements; which happen to be Ravi and Ameesha's seat. 
In the proceedings, Udeni has a flashback to a time when she sang "Lanwela Wassanaye" (the theme song) and Ravi snuck in to watch her.  Within the concert, Samalka and Dewmi are in a school singing contest, singing their respective songs "Supem Wee" and "Nidi Nena". Awantha bribes a judge to let Samalka win. When Samalka finds out, she gives her prize to Dewmi.

Awantha warms up to Dewmi. Awantha gets low grades, but Anuhas' are high. Dewmi begins to taunt Samalka. Anuhas does not make a team organised for a friendly match. A new girl, Lihini, attends the school. Awantha breaks Anuhas' bat. Samalka offers to help him buy a replacement, but he refuses. Amisha drives Udani's juice bar out of business, and Anuhas must go to work.

Awantha flirts with Dewmi, and Coach Ekanayake returns to school. Anuhas organises a car wash to help Samalka buy a motorbike.

Dewmi sees Awantha bleeding in a three-wheeler and brings him to the hospital. She tries to leave, but the police want to know what happened. Dewmi lies that he was in an auto accident, but he was in a gang fight. The police visit Dewmi's house, which angers her father.

During a school trip, Ekanayake arranges for the cricket team to play a one-day game with an Indian school team. The teachers discuss a new captain, since Awantha has broken Anuhas' bat, gloves and pads. Anuhas becomes the captain.

When it is time to leave for the match, the bus tires are vandalised. Samalka and Anuhas bring her mother to a neurologist.

Anuhas saves Ravi when he is beaten; after several days in hospital Ravi goes abroad, apologising to Udeni by mail for his mistakes and acknowledging her and Anuhas' love before he dies of a heart attack in Australia.

A school committee plans to helping with his funeral. Udeni wants Ananda to attend the funeral, but he is worried that Ameesha will send them away; Ameesha attempts to, outraged that Ravi has provided equally for Anuhas and Awantha. Awantha is courteous to them. Anuhas does not want to accept being Ravi's son, but Awantha persuades him to go. Awantha and Anhas are [[pallbearer]]s. Udeni tells Anuhas that Ravi loved him and Awantha equally. Awantha overhears, and as Anuhas takes Udeni home he grieves at the [[pyre]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

A '''flashback''' (sometimes called an '''analepsis''') is an interjected [[scene (fiction)|scene]] that takes the narrative back in time from the current point in the [[Plot (narrative)|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pavis, Shantz | year= 1998 | title = Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis | publisher = University of Toronto Press | page = 151 | isbn= 0802081630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened before the story's primary sequence of events to fill in crucial [[backstory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kenny | year = 2004 | title = Teaching Tv Production in a Digital World: Integrating Media Literacy | publisher = Libraries Unltd Incorporated | page = 163 | isbn= 1591581990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite direction, a [[flashforward]] (or prolepsis) reveals events that will occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward|title=flash-forward|author=|date=|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both flashback and flashforward are used to cohere a story, develop a character, or add structure to the narrative. In literature, '''internal analepsis''' is a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative; '''external analepsis''' is a flashback to a time before the narrative started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jung | year = 2010 | title = Narrating Violence in Post-9/11 Action Cinema: Terrorist Narratives, Cinematic Narration, and Referentiality | publisher = VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | page = 67 | isbn= 3531926020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, flashbacks depict the subjective experience of a character by showing a memory of a previous event and they are often used to "resolve an enigma".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are important in [[film noir]] and [[melodrama]] films. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; In movies and television, several camera techniques, editing approaches and special effects have evolved to alert the viewer that the action shown is a flashback or flashforward; for example, the edges of the picture may be deliberately blurred, photography may be jarring or choppy, or unusual coloration or sepia tone, or [[monochrome]] when most of the story is in full color, may be used. The scene may fade or dissolve, often with the camera focused on the face of the character and there is typically a voice-over by a narrator (who is often, but not always, the character who is experiencing the memory).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

===Literature===
An early example of analepsis is in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', where the main story is narrated through a [[frame story]] set at a later time. Another ancient example occurs in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the tale of Odysseus' wanderings is told in flashback by Odysseus to a listener. Another early use of this device in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale. The story begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder in a series of flashbacks leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are also employed in several other ''Arabian Nights'' tales such as "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The City of Brass]]".

Analepsis was used extensively by author [[Ford Madox Ford]], and by poet, author, historian and mythologist [[Robert Graves]]. The 1927 book ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks of events leading up to the disaster. Analepsis is also used in ''[[Night (novel)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]]. If flashbacks are extensive and in chronological order, one can say that these form the present of the story, while the rest of the story consists of flash forwards. If flashbacks are presented in non-chronological order, the time at which the story takes place can be ambiguous: An example of such an occurrence is in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' where the narrative jumps back and forth in time, so there is no actual present time line. ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' is a story about voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] to [[India]] and back. The narration starts when they were arriving [[Africa]] but it quickly flashes back to the beginning of the story which is when they were leaving [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Lusíadas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series employs a magical device called a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]], which changes the nature of flashbacks from a mere narrative device to an event directly experienced by the characters, which are thus able to provide commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|title=Pensieve Flashback - TV Tropes|author=|date=|website=tvtropes.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027011816/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The creator of the flashback technique in cinema was ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire d’un crime]]'' directed by [[Ferdinand Zecca]] in 1901. &lt;ref&gt;Turim, Maureen. ''Flashbacks in Film: Memory &amp; History By Maureen Turim''. p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks were first employed during the sound era in [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1931 film ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'', but were rare until about 1939 when, in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' as in [[Emily Brontë]]'s original novel, the housekeeper Ellen narrates the main story to overnight visitor Mr. Lockwood, who has witnessed Heathcliff's frantic pursuit of what is apparently a ghost. More famously, also in 1939, [[Marcel Carné]]'s movie ''[[Le Jour Se Lève]]'' is told almost entirely through flashback: the story starts with the murder of a man in a hotel. While the murderer, played by [[Jean Gabin]], is surrounded by the police, several flashbacks tell the story of why he killed the man at the beginning of the movie.

One of the most famous examples of a flashback is in the [[Orson Welles]]' film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941). The protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, dies at the beginning, uttering the word ''Rosebud''. The remainder of the film is framed by a reporter's interviewing Kane's friends and associates, in a futile effort to discover what the word meant to Kane. As the interviews proceed, pieces of Kane's life unfold in flashback, but Welles' use of such unconventional flashbacks was thought to have been influenced by [[William K. Howard]]'s ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Hitchcock used a flashback in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1956) to reveal the enigma that led to psychological disturbances for the female lead; as with Welles' film, he delayed the flashback until the end of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

Though usually used to clarify plot or backstory, flashbacks can also act as an [[unreliable narrator]]. [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' from 1950 notoriously featured a flashback that did not tell the truth but dramatized a lie from a witness. The multiple and contradictory staged reconstructions of a crime in [[Errol Morris]]'s 1988 documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' are presented as flashbacks based on divergent testimony. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1950 ''[[Rashomon]]'' does this in the most celebrated fictional use of contested multiple testimonies.

Sometimes a flashback is inserted into a film even though there was none in the original source from which the film was adapted. The 1956 film version of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' used a flashback device which somewhat takes the impact away from a very dramatic plot development later in the film. This was done because the plot of ''Carousel'' was then considered unusually strong for a film musical. In film version of ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' (1967), according to [[Alan Jay Lerner]], a flashback was added not to soften the blow of a later plot development but because the stage show had been criticized for shifting too abruptly in tone from near-comedy to tragedy.

In [[Billy Wilder]]'s [[film noir]] ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a flashback from the main character is used to provide a confession to his fraudulent and criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of both flashback and [[flashforward]] is the first scene of ''[[La Jetée]]'' (1962). As we learn a few minutes later, what we are seeing in that scene is a flashback to the past, since the present of the film's [[diegesis]] is a time directly following [[World War III]]. However, as we learn at the very end of the film, that scene also doubles as a prolepsis, since the dying man the boy is seeing is, in fact, himself. In other words, he is proleptically seeing his own death. We thus have an analepsis and prolepsis in the very same scene.

Occasionally, a story may contain a flashback within a flashback, with the earliest known example appearing in [[Jacques Feyder]]'s ''[[L'Atlantide (1921 film)|L'Atlantide]]''. ''[[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|Little Annie Rooney]]'' (1925) contains a flashback scene in a Chinese laundry, with a flashback within that flashback in the corner of the screen.  In [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), the main action of the film is told in flashback, with the scene of Liberty Valance's murder occurring as a flashback within that flashback. Other examples that contains flashbacks within flashbacks are the 1968 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] ''Lone Wolf Isazo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lone Stalker A.K.A. Lone Wolf Isazo|publisher=[[Japan Society (New York)|Japan Society]]|url=http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|accessdate=2011-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061943/http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|archivedate=1 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2004's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', where almost the entire film (set in 1870) is told as a flashback from 1919 (in [[black-and-white]]) and contains other flashbacks; for example, Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a freak show. An extremely convoluted story may contain flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, as in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', ''[[Passage to Marseille]]'', and ''[[The Locket]]''. This technique is a hallmark of [[Kannada]] movie director [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] whose futuristic flick ''[[Super (2010 Indian film)|Super]]'' (2010) is set in 2030 and contains multiple flashbacks ranging from 2010 to 2015 depicting a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian]] India.

[[Satyajit Ray]] experimented with flashbacks in ''[[Pratidwandi|The Adversary]]'' (Pratidwandi, 1972), pioneering the technique of [[Negative (photography)|photo-negative]] flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Light: Satyajit Ray From the Apu Trilogy to the Calcutta Trilogy|author=Nick Pinkerton|date=14 April 2009|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|accessdate=2009-07-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625154630/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|archivedate=25 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quentin Tarantino]] makes extensive use of the flashback and flashforward in many of his films.  In ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992), for example, scenes of the story present are intercut with various flashbacks to give each character's backstory and motivation additional context.  In ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), which uses a highly [[nonlinear storytelling|nonlinear]] narrative, traditional flashback is also used in the sequence titled "The Gold Watch".  Other films, such as his two-part ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (Part I 2003, Part II 2004), also feature a narrative that bounces between present time and flashbacks.

===Television===
The television series [[Quantico (TV series)]], ''[[Kung Fu (TV series) | Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]],'' and ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' use flashbacks in every episode. Flashbacks were also a predominant feature of the television shows ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.  Many detective shows routinely use flashback in the last act to reveal the culprit's plot, e.g. ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Banacek]],'' ''[[Columbo]].''

'''Four Horsemen Studios''' is a collectible figure design studio and manufacturer, specializing in creating sculptures of toys and action figures.  The company was founded in the late 1990s as a contractor to [[Mattel]], and have since grown to an independent studio creating their own line of figures as well as manufacturing third party designs under license.

==History==
The Four Horsemen of Four Horsemen studios are Jim Preziosi, Eric Treadway, H. Eric Mayse and Christopher Dahlberg.  The four partners met while employed as figure sculptors at [[McFarlane Toys]].  In September 1999, the four left McFarlane to found Four Horsemen Studios, where, in a partnership with Mattel, they created hundreds of figures for Mattel's [[Masters of the Universe]], ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', [[Harry Potter]], [[DC Universe Classics]] and ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' toy lines, among others.

In 2005,  Four Horsemen Studios began creating their own properties and designing and manufacturing the toys to support them. The studio has developed several in house properties including:  Seventh Kingdom,  Gothitropolis,  Magma Corps, and Symbiotech.

In early 2010, the Horsemen made the leap into licensed action figures. The studio signed a deal to produce figures based on the 1960s sci-fi toy line The Outer Space Men. A second license, 1980′s brand The Power Lords, has been purchased in 2013.

===Original lines===
====Seventh Kingdom====

The first original line to make it into production, Seventh Kingdom's Xetheus won the first Fantastic Exclusive competition in 2005.

====Magma CORPS====

Magma CORPS was the second original line to see actual product. A vinyl figure of Argus a leader within the Mercury City police force was created in 2006.

====Gothitropolis====

The third original line to actually be produced as figures, Gothitropolis includes Scarabus, the Time Keepers, and all the members of the Raven Flocks via two kickstarters.

====Symbiotech====

The fourth original line, Symbiotech has yet to see any actual production but has down quite well over the years in Fan Ex voting. The line was announced as the next to go into production but has since been put on hold while licensed lines take precedence.

Symbiotech designs that have been shown to the public suggest a humanoid and beast character in symbiosis with each other. Each design had two figures that could combine or interact.

====Mythic Legions====

Mythic Legions is a [[fantasy]] line of action figures from Four Horsemen Studios. "The action figure line consists of an endless variety of characters ranging from heroic knights and dwarves to evil orcs and skeleton soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mythiclegions.com/about/ About]." [http://mythiclegions.com Mythic Legions].

===Licensed Lines===
====The Outer Space Men====
Licensed from their original creator, [[Mel Birnkrant]] in 2010, The Outer Space Men take a new look at the 1968 action figure line by the Colorforms company. Using Mel's designs and a new joint technology created by Onell Designs called Glyos, Four Horsemen Toy Design Studios produced a new line of figures with interchangeable parts.

====Power Lords====
The Power Lords license was acquired in 2012 and the first figures went into production in 2013. Working again with the original designer of a classic toy line (this time with [[Wayne Barlowe|Wayne Douglas Barlowe]]) and the Glyos joint system from Onell Design, Four Horsemen Toy Design Studios added to both giving us new characters and the expanded Glyos joint system.

===Work For Mattel===
====DC Comics Lines====

Mattel has commissioned Four Horsemen Studios for most if not all the figures in the DC Comics lines including Man of Steel, Dark Knight Rises. DC Universe Classics, and Young Justice.

====Masters of the Universe====

Four Horsemen Studios were responsible for the figure sculpts of the 200x re-imaging of Mattel's [[Masters of the Universe]] toy line and helped bring about the Masters of the Universe Classic, an Adult Collectors figure line. They will continue to work for Mattel in the new 2015 Club 200X line.

====Thundercats====
4H Studios are currently sculpting all the figures for Mattel's Thundercats line, which is being sold exclusively on Mattel's direct-to-consumer site MattyCollector.com. The characters are in scale with Mattel's Masters of the Universe Classics figures.  Thundercats is licensed to Mattel by Warner Bros.

====Max Steel (Overseas Figures)====

Many of the Gigantor figures that were part of the Max Steel line in Europe and Latin America are sculpts by members of Four Horsemen Studios

===Work For Others===
====NECA====

[[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] Four Horsemen Studios were contracted to sculpt the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line in 2008.

====Toy Biz====

Several figures that were part of the [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] [[Marvel Comics]] lines from 2001-2005 were sculpted by Four Horsemen Studios

===The Fan Ex Project===

In 2005 Four Horsemen Studios created a whole new way to interact with their fan base and let those fans participate in the design process called the Fantastic Exclusive Project, quickly shortened by the fan base to be called the Fan Ex Project. They started by giving the fans several original line names and brief descriptions than let the fans choose which one would be made into actual figures. Once the line was chosen fans would then decide which figure, then scale, articulation, accessories, and even repaints. The final choices would be combined into a figure and sold by the studio.

====Fan Ex 2005====

The Seventh Kingdom line was the winner of the first vote in the newly created Fan Ex. The character the fans chose was Xetheus, the Champion of Mynothecea, a Minotaur from the Animal Kingdom. There were 7 variations of the figure produced in very limited numbers. There were about 250 of each figure with Xetheus himself getting around twice that.

====Fan Ex 2006====

For the second year of voting Seventh Kingdom again and this time Ramathorr, Captain of the Anitherian Guard. Also from the Animal Kingdom Ramathorr was an Elephant and there were a total of nine figures offered. 4 Elephants, 2 Mutants, 1 Rhino, 1 Hippo and 1 Boar. Unfortunately production issues left many of the original figures with breakage issues. Four Horsemen Studios paid for a second production run to make sure fans ended up with quality product.

====Fan Ex 2007====

In the third year a new line won the first round of voting. Gothitropolis took the stage and the big bad of the story line, Scarabus. 10 figures would be released in this year but production issues (rising costs at the Chinese factories) pushed the actual sales of these figures to 2010. In between Four Horsemen Studios offered The Time Keepers, also from Gothitropolis 2008 and Queens court, 11 ladies representing 5 of the seven Kingdoms.

The Fan Ex project moves its fulfillment to [[Kickstarter]]

'''Jeff Civillico''' (born in the early 1980s) is a [[juggler]], corporate entertainer, and comedian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegrablegroup.com/speaker_gg/jeff-civillico/ "Jeff Civillico Bio | The Grable Group"]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], he headlines the comedy show ''Comedy in Action'' at the Paris Las Vegas casino and was a guest performer at [[Nathan Burton]]'s magic show.

Born in [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], Civillico became enamored with juggling after seeing a street performer in Boston when he was 11 years old. In his freshman year of high school, he founded the Juggling Club at [[Saint Joseph's Preparatory School]], where he and other members would perform for free at nearby nursing homes and at a school for developmentally disabled children and young adults. In 1998 when he was 15, Civillico received a gold medal from the [[International Jugglers' Association]], where he had competed in the junior division. He matriculated to [[Georgetown University]], where he participated in the all-male [[a cappella]] group [[The Georgetown Chimes]], leading it in his senior year. He founded the Georgetown Performers' Union to allow fellow performing arts students to help each other. In 2005, he received a bachelor's degree in theology from the university.

Civillico moved to Las Vegas, [[Nevada]], in 2009 to perform in the show ''Amazed''. Although the show did not last, Civillico remained in Las Vegas and landed a performing engagement at Nathan Burton's magic show. After about a year being a guest on Burton's show, he started his own show, Comedy in Action, produced by Burton, at a 100-seat venue at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino]] in the luxury mall [[The Forum Shops at Caesars|The Forum Shops]] at [[Caesars Palace]]. Civillico later moved to [[The Linq|The LINQ]], previously The Quad, at a 700-seat venue. He most recently moved to Flamingo Las Vegas. Reviewers of Comedy in Action generally had positive impressions of his show, praising him for his seemingly boundless energy, his ability to engage the audience, his prowess with making comical off-the-cuff remarks, and his juggling talent.

==Personal life==
Jeff Civillico was born to Nicholas and Francine Civillico of [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], and was the youngest of their three sons.&lt;ref name="Mengers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joggler racing for special-needs kids |author=Mengers, Patti |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/125B40290E2185F0/0D7C12F5A8A2A86A |newspaper=[[Delaware County Daily Times]] |location=Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania |date=2009-01-03 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4F4X7fB?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc |archivedate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brothers are John and Gene.&lt;ref name="Reilly"&gt;{{cite news|title=Juggling Jeff |author=Reilly, Linda |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/11CB2FB9F3F4E740/0D7C12F5A8A2A86A |newspaper=[[Delaware County Daily Times]] |location=Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania |date=2000-03-14 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4F7e4EV?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc |archivedate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his pre-secondary education, Civillico attended Holy Child Academy in [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], graduating from it in 1997, and [[Saint Joseph's Preparatory School]] in [[Philadelphia]], graduating from it in 2001. As co-president of Holy Child Academy's student council in 1996 during the school's fundraising effort to assist those with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], he urged fellow students and student groups such as the band and the choir to spend time with afflicted individuals.&lt;ref name="Mengers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deveres"&gt;{{cite news|title=A reaching out to those with AIDS |author=Deveres, Leigh |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/11CA3323B02EC338/0D7C12F5A8A2A86A |newspaper=[[Delaware County Daily Times]] |location=Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania |date=1996-10-14 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4FACtGA?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc |archivedate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started learning to juggling three balls when he was seven years old.&lt;ref name="Reilly"/&gt;

When he was 11, he and his family visited his brother who was attending [[Harvard University]]. During the visit, he was entranced by a street performer, juggler Peter Panic, at [[Harvard Square]] and vowed to become an entertainer. Selected by Peter Panic as a volunteer, Civillico found himself facing a large group of people, a feeling he said was "one of those defining moments". His parents gave him the book ''Juggling for Complete Klutz'' from [[Klutz Press]], prompting him to begin honing his juggling skills. He joined the Philadelphia Juggling Club, which taught him some of the more challenging juggling tricks such as juggling five balls and [[passing (juggling)|passing]] clubs.&lt;ref name="Duinker"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeff Civillico, Juggling Headliner in Las Vegas |author=Duinker, Niels |url=http://ezine.juggle.org/2012/09/15/jeff-civillico-juggling-headliner-in-las-vegas-and-what-we-can-learn-from-him/ |work=eJuggle |publisher=[[International Jugglers' Association]] |date=2012-09-15 |accessdate=2012-10-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BDZ4cB2i?url=http://ezine.juggle.org/2012/09/15/jeff-civillico-juggling-headliner-in-las-vegas-and-what-we-can-learn-from-him/ |archivedate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2000 interview with the ''[[Delaware County Daily Times]]'', Civillico noted that many people his age were as skilled as he at juggling. He distinguished himself from the others by considering himself not to be a juggler but primarily an entertainer or a performer, someone with a sense of humor.&lt;ref name="Reilly"/&gt; As a 16-year-old in the 11th grade, his juggling act included a six-foot-tall [[unicycle]] and revolving plates.

At [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Civillico was deeply connected to the university's growing [[performing arts]] program.

Civillico is a member of the Tri-Junkies in Celebration, a [[triathlon]] association. Regarding his passion, he said that "juggling was the perfect combination of art and sport. It requires you to be in shape, but you can be creative. The air is your canvas."&lt;ref name="Ruiz"/&gt;

==Career==
In 2008, Civillico performed at [[Modesto, California|Modesto]]'s [[Gallo Center for the Arts]], in what journalist Lisa Millegan of ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' termed a "special brand of kinetic comedy with juggling, balancing and unicycling". Hollywood's [[The Magic Castle]] founder Milt Larsen said Civillico was one of the greatest jugglers he has encountered.&lt;ref name="Millegan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Poof! - It's Magic |author=Millegan, Lisa |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/123C0D18D921EDF0/0D7C12F5A8A2A86A |newspaper=[[The Modesto Bee]] |location=Modesto, California |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4Fd9cTR?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc |archivedate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Civillico traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada, to entertain people in the ephemeral show ''Amazed''. He remained in Las Vegas and landed a 12-minute specialty act at [[Nathan Burton]]'s magic show. Civillico told the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' in May 2012 that audience members found his performance so memorable that they asked Burton and Civillico whether Civillico had his own show. Based on this feedback, the two found a location for Civillico at the [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino]] located in the luxury mall [[The Forum Shops at Caesars|The Forum Shops]] at [[Caesars Palace]]. Relying primarily on advertising from Burton's show and having nearly no paid promotion, Civillico's show drew nearly capacity crowds for the 100-seat place. Civillico emphasized in a May 2012 interview with the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' that his show was not merely about juggling but "all about the connection with the audience and the fun, playful character".&lt;ref name="Weatherford2012-05-31"&gt;{{cite news|title=Juggling is nothing without interaction |author=Weatherford, Mike |url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/juggling-is-nothing-without-interaction-155892665.html |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4FtXCv0?url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/juggling-is-nothing-without-interaction-155892665.html |archivedate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''{{'}}s Mike Weatherford in a June 2012 review called Civillico's early act in the show "one of the most memorable bits".&lt;ref name="Weatherford2012-06-22"&gt;{{cite news|title='Comedy in Action' successfully blends juggling, laughter |author=Weatherford, Mike |url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/-comedy-in-action-successfully-blends-juggling-laughter-159985565.html |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4G1Yvuk?url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/-comedy-in-action-successfully-blends-juggling-laughter-159985565.html |archivedate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Civillico selects two male volunteers from the audience ("two strong beasts of men")&lt;ref name="Fontein"/&gt; to assist him to mount his unicycle.&lt;ref name="Weatherford2012-06-22"/&gt; Weatherford described the act as the "dudes (and it would only work with guys) become uncomfortably familiar with both the front and back of Civillico's crotch, before they all help each other mouth-catch marshmallows". Weatherford was awed at Civillico's "agility as well as the speed of ad-lib". After a marshmallow ricocheted off the stage, an audience member grabbed it and flung it into Civillico's jaws. Civillico said, "You just got his DVD", and gave the audience member the DVD present that was originally going to be given to the fumbling volunteer.&lt;ref name="Weatherford2012-06-22"/&gt;

In an August 2012 review in the weekly magazine ''Today in Las Vegas'', reviewer Christina M. Parmelee found that Civillico "feeds on the reluctant and uses that for his comedic fodder", converting the "most uptight audience member [into] a die-hard fan at the end". Parmelee noted that Civillico's "remarkable rapport" with the audience is essential to executing a successful show; he relies on participants from the audience to make the shows "personal and memorable". She concluded that "[e]njoying every minute as a headliner in Las Vegas, Civillico thrives on the chance to just be his ridiculous self."&lt;ref name="Parmelee"/&gt;

[[VEGAS.com]] reviewer Caroline Fontein said that Civillico's "self-deprecating humor makes him both relatable and amusing". She praised his juggling skills, writing that he juggles "glow-in-the-dark laser balls and pins" that morph into a variety of colors, generating the [[optical illusion]] that he has two pairs of hands. Fontein also commented that Civillico's "high side kick followed by an exaggerated wedgie pull" comprised some of his "odd signature moves", making him the "definition of zany" and generating an enjoyable spectacle.&lt;ref name="Fontein"/&gt; ''Today in Las Vegas'' reviewer Laura Damian wrote in February 2013 that he has "the energy of a hummingbird and the comedic timing of a veteran street performer" and "has a way of seamlessly integrating members of his audience into his show in a way that's original, charming and hilarious".&lt;ref name="Damian"&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Shows That Want YOU To Be The Star!: Jeff Civillico at The Quad |author=Damian, Laura |url=http://todayinlv.com/2013/02/digital-edition-10-shows-that-want-you-to-be-the-star/ |newspaper=Today in Las Vegas |date=February 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JDs2G5bf?url=http://todayinlv.com/2013/02/digital-edition-10-shows-that-want-you-to-be-the-star/ |archivedate=2013-08-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Comedy in Action was selected by ''[[USA Today]]'' as one of the "Best of Las Vegas Kid-Friendly Attractions".

In August 2012, Civillico used the tools of [[crowdsourcing]] and the Internet to persuade his fans to donate to his $10,900 "The People's Arch" project. Designed by [[Andy Walmsley]], the {{convert|20|ft|m}} high by {{convert|40|ft|m}} wide inflatable arch was intended as his show's centerpiece. In the opening act, the arch explodes out of a flight case and in 20 seconds swells to its entire breadth.&lt;ref name="Symes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crowdsourcing in Action |author=Symes, Natalie |url=http://whats-on.com/article/crowdsourcing-action |work=What's On |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-12-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cw8XB8Vs?url=http://whats-on.com/article/crowdsourcing-action |archivedate=2012-12-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Win-Win Entertainment===
Civillico founded the non-profit organization Win-Win Entertainment, which matches charity organizations in want of amusement with entertainers wanting to give their time.&lt;ref name="2011-2012 Dean's Lunch Seminars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parmelee"/&gt; Non-profit organizations find it difficult to have good entertainment at their fundraising events. They are stymied by the prohibitive cost of recruiting good entertainers. In addition, entertainers may be hesitant to perform for non-profit organizations. Inadequate equipment stemming from limited resources may prevent them from performing at their finest. Win-Win Entertainment addresses the problems by acquiring and setting up the stage, sound system, and other equipment necessary for the performer who in return performs for free.&lt;ref name="Lucht"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucht |first=Nichole |date=2013-11-18 |title=Strip headliners joining forces in the name of charity |url=http://blog.vegas.com/las-vegas-shows/strip-headliners-joining-forces-in-the-name-of-charity-39266/ |publisher=[[VEGAS.com]] |accessdate=2013-12-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6M2hMr6Vd?url=http://blog.vegas.com/las-vegas-shows/strip-headliners-joining-forces-in-the-name-of-charity-39266/ |archivedate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2013, Win-Win Entertainment had hosted 25 events for charities.&lt;ref name="Lucht"/&gt;

[[File:Rashomon poster.jpg|thumb|A theatrical poster for [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', which was voted the best foreign language film released in the United States in 1951, and received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Award]].]]
Japan has submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] since the inception of the award. The award is handed out annually by the United States [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to a [[feature length|feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was not created until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Awards]] to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards were not competitive, as there were no nominees but simply a winner every year that was voted on by the Board of Governors of the Academy.&lt;ref name="HistPg1"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards - Page 1 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html |accessdate=2008-06-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413201500/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html |archivedate=13 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Japanese films were recipients of Honorary Awards during this period. For the [[29th Academy Awards|1956 Academy Awards]], a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.&lt;ref name="HistPg2"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards - Page 2 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html |accessdate=2008-06-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406060609/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html |archivedate= 6 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, twelve Japanese films have been nominees for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and one film, ''[[Departures (2008 film)|Departures]]'', has won the award.&lt;ref name="UCLAList"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/eas/statistics/asian-oscar.htm |title=List of Asian films nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film |publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]] |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607164054/http://www.international.ucla.edu/eas/statistics/asian-oscar.htm |archivedate= 7 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VarietyWinners"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117856491.html?nav=history|title=Best Foreign Film|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=''Variety'' Staff|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Japanese directors to have multiple films be nominated for the award are [[Akira Kurosawa]] and [[Noboru Nakamura]]. Kurosawa received an Honorary Award prior to the inception of the formal award for his work on ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' and the actual Academy Award for ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' (submitted for the former [[Soviet Union]]), and had four other films submitted, with two of them accepted as nominees.&lt;ref name="CNNKurosawaPassing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9809/07/kurosawa/ |title=Film world mourns loss of 'giant' Akira Kurosawa |publisher=CNN |author=Kamimura, Marina |date=1998-09-07 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101184036/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9809/07/kurosawa/ |archivedate=1 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KurosawaAwards"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/98309/Akira-Kurosawa/awards|title=Akira Kurosawa - Awards|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Kurosawa's 1985 film [[Ran (film)|''Ran'']] was deliberately not nominated by the Japanese film industry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film due to the poor perception he had among Japanese filmmakers at the time.&lt;ref name="PBSQ&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/kurosawa/asktheexpert/answers.html|title=Great Performances .

==Submissions==
Every year, each country is invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to submit its best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Foreign  Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Before the award was created, the Board of Governors of the Academy voted on a film every year that was considered the best foreign language film released in the United States, and there were no submissions.&lt;ref name="HistPg1"/&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Japan for review by the Academy for the award since its inception.

All Japanese submissions were in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

Of all of them, only two of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] fighting games have been adapted for Western release. They are listed below by platform.

==[[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]==
[[Image:Super Battle.jpg|thumb|right|''Ranma ½: Super-Skill Wild Dance Chapter '']]
===''Ranma ½: Neighborhood Combat Chapter'' (''Ranma ½: Chōnai Gekitōhen'')===
The first fighting game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] by NCS Corp, Neighborhood Combat Chapter underwent [[Americanization]] by [[Irem]] to become ''Street Combat'', replacing all characters and background music with American-themed characters. An example is Ranma, who was replaced by a blonde man in bright blue armor called Steven. This is the only fighting game in which [[List of Ranma ½ characters#Cologne|Cologne]] appears.

===''Ranma ½: Hard Battle''===
{{main|Ranma ½: Hard Battle}}

===''Ranma ½: Hidden Treasure of the Red Cat Gang'' (''Ranma ½: Akaneko-dan teki Hihou'')===
An RPG that was released on October 22, 1993.

===''Ranma ½: Super-Skill Wild Dance Chapter'' (''Ranma ½: Chougi Rambuhen'')===
This game was intended to be released in the USA under the title "''Anything Goes Martial Arts''" as the sequel to ''Hard Battle'', but the company that owned the rights for it went out of business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ranma/ranma2.htm |title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Ranma 1/2 SFC Fighters |work=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=2010-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, so the American release got cancelled. This is the only game to feature [[List of Ranma ½ characters#Mariko Konjo|Mariko Konjo]] and [[List of Ranma ½ characters#Herb|Herb]].

===''Ranma ½: Rock-Scissors-Puzzle'' (''Ranma ½: Ougi Jaanken'')===
A puzzle game based on rock, paper, scissors. Hands are dropped showing the rock, paper, and scissor signs and are used to remove other hands that have the opposite sign. Its Japanese name is composed of ''ougi'' (meaning secret) and ''jaanken'', a play on the word ''janken'' (the Japanese name for the game of rock-paper-scissors) but using the [[Kanji|characters]] for evil, dark and fist. However, the [[furigana]] reading above the Japanese name is ''Guu•Choki•Pazuru'', which translates to Rock-Scissors-Puzzle.

On release, ''[[Famicom Tsūshin]]'' scored the game a 20 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: らんま1/2 奥義邪暗拳. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.345. Pg.30. 28 July 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Battle Renaissance.gif|right|thumb|''Ranma ½: Battle Renaissance'']]

This game features changing weather conditions that turn some characters to their cursed forms or vice versa when they get soaked in cold or hot water, affecting strategy. This is the only fighting game in which [[Ryu Kumon]] and [[List of Ranma ½ characters#Rouge|Rouge]] appear. After playing the game at the November 1996 PlayStation Expo, Stuart Levy and Ed Semrad of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented, "Hopefully somebody will pick up this excellent game here in the States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1=Stuart|last1=Levy|first2=Ed|last2=Semrad |title=PlayStation Expo '96-'97: Namco Steals the Show with Five New Arcade Conversions! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ranma ½: Character Q&amp;A!!'' (''Ranma ½: Kakugeki Mondou!!'')===
Using a top-down view similar to the first ''Ranma ½'' Game Boy game, this game primarily focuses on trivia from the ''Ranma ½'' anime. The player moves Ranma around town and encounters various characters who ask questions regarding the series.

==[[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]]==

===''Ranma ½''===
A side-scrolling fighting game similar to ''[[Final Fight]]'', where the player moves Ranma through various locations. Following the manga story line up to Ranma's second battle with Ryoga, the game also included animated cutscenes.

===''Ranma ½: The Captive Bride'' (''Ranma ½: Toraware no Hanayome'')===
Similar to ''White Orchid Serenade'', this game combines video novel elements with text based commands.

Similar to the first ''Ranma ½'' PC Engine game, this game follows the next major story arc of the ''Ranma ½'' manga.

==[[Personal computer|PC]]==

===''Ranma ½: Flying Dragon Legend'' (''Ranma ½: Hiryu Densetsu'')===
A [[point-and-click game|point-and-click]] adventure for the [[NEC PC-9800]] and [[MSX]] personal computers.

==[[Pachinko]]==

===''Fever Ranma ½: Hot Springs Athletic Chapter'' (''Fever Ranma ½: Onsen Asurechikku Hen'')===
Released in February 2011 in Japan, ''Fever Ranma ½'' features high-quality animations and sound effects with the newer anime style look from ''Nightmare!

==Others==
Two [[Nintendo DS]] games were released in 2009, titled ''Sunday x Magazine: Nettou Dream Nine'' and ''Sunday x Magazine: White Comic''. The first is a [[baseball]] game that commemorates the 50th anniversary of ''[[Weekly Shōnen Sunday]]'' and ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'', featuring characters from manga series that ran in the magazines. The second is an [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] that features over 300 characters from the magazines' series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4148">The '''London Contemporary Dance Theatre''' (LCDT) was a [[contemporary dance]] company, based at [[The Place]], founded by [[Robin Howard]] with [[Robert Cohan]] as its Artistic Director.

Founded in 1967, and strongly influenced by the ideas of American modern and postmodern dance artists [[Martha Graham]] and [[Merce Cunningham]], the company was probably the first contemporary dance company in the UK, and played a pioneering role in developing the art form in that country.

[[Choreographer]]s such as [[Siobhan Davies]], [[Christopher Bannerman]] and [[Micha Bergese]], worked alongside composers like [[Barrington Pheloung]] to create new works which were performed at the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] and toured the UK and internationally.

Well-known works created by the company include:
* ''Cell'' (1969)
* ''Troy Game'' (1974)
* ''Forest'' (1976)
* ''Nympheas'' (1976)
* ''Stabat Mater'' (1976)
* ''Sphinx'' (1977)
* ''Rainbow Bandit'' (1979)
* ''Run Like Thunder'' (1983)

LCDT won the 1975 [[Evening Standard Award]] for Outstanding Achievement In Ballet and [[Olivier Award]]s on three occasions: in 1978,&lt;ref name="Olivier-1978"/&gt; 1989–1990&lt;ref name="Olivier-1990"/&gt; and 1994.&lt;ref name="Olivier-1994"/&gt;

The company closed in 1994 when The Place refocused its work, creating the [[Richard Alston Dance Company]], and developing a bigger presenting programme for the [[Robin Howard Dance Theatre]].

[[London Contemporary Dance School]] was originally conceived to train dancers for the company, and awarded its first degree in practical dance in 1982. The School is still in operation as part of The Place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4145">The '''National Radio Television of Colombia''' (''Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia'') is [[Colombia]]'s [[state-owned]] [[public broadcasting|national broadcaster]], controlled by the [[Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications (Colombia)|Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications]].

It was created by the Decree 3525 issued on 28 October 2004, after dissolving [[Inravisión]] and the public television [[programadora|production company]] [[Audiovisuales]], during the administration of [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]]. RTVC includes four television channels, two radio networks and two online radio stations. Its headquarters are located at Calle 26 with Carrera 45 in Bogota.

==Services ==
RTVC owns four free-to-air television stations (one of which is managed by private businesses) and two radio networks.

===Television===
On free-to-air television, RTVC's channels are distributed either via analogue on the [[VHF]] band, or in digital terrestrial television in the [[UHF]] band.

====Señal Colombia====
It is the national, State-owned television channel, intended as an educational and cultural network. 

====Canal Institucional====
[[Canal Institucional]] airs programs created by national institutions, with an emphasis on citizen participation and coverage of legislative activities. It boasts a national coverage of 93.7%.

====Channel 1====
[[Channel 1 (Colombia)|Colombia's Channel 1]] is a State-owned, privately-run national network, the only Colombian commercial channel operated by RTVC (after [[Canal A]] was rebranded as Señal Institucional in late-2003). The channel's programming is mostly produced by private film companies known as ''[[programadora]]s'', federated since 2004 in time-sharing unions, though RTVC produces a quarter of Channel 1's airtime.

===Radio===

====National Radio of Colombia====
Founded in 1940 as Radiodifusora Nacional, the [[Señal Radio Colombia|National Radio of Colombia]] broadcasts news information from state and institutional agencies in addition to a Colombian cultural sphere called "Colombiología". Its slogan is based on Colombian culture and vision itself "''Colombiología al aire''". Operating on both the AM and FM bands, it covers the 32 departmental capitals, including Bogota and some medium-sized municipalities.

====Radiónica====
[[Radiónica]] (created in 1995 as "99-1 Young Frequency" and rebranded under its current name in 2005) shares with audiences the diversity of cultural expressions and urban music in Colombia and abroad, establishing a direct dialogue with the world, involving the concept of Colombia as part of the universal and the universal as a dynamic element of the country, under the vision and voice of different generations. The musical program "Radionics" offers a variety of styles and trends identified by contemporary expressions: rock, jazz, blues, soul, funk, pop, punk, ska, reggae, metal, industrial, hip hop, world music and electronica. Radiónica is available on the FM band in 8 cities.

'''Piano pedagogy''' is the study of the teaching of [[piano]] playing.  Whereas the professional field of [[music education]] pertains to the teaching of music in school classrooms or group settings, piano pedagogy focuses on the teaching of musical skills to individual piano students.  This is often done via private or semiprivate instructions, commonly referred to as '''piano lessons'''.  The practitioners of piano pedagogy are called '''piano pedagogues''', or simply, '''piano teachers'''.

== Professional training ==

The range of professionalism among teachers of piano is undoubtedly wide. "Competent instruction is not always assured by the number of years one has taken lessons", warned piano pedagogue and writer of numerous pedagogical books, [[James Bastien]].&lt;ref name="Bastien"&gt;Bastien, James (3rd Ed. 1988) ''How to Teach Piano Successfully''.  Neil A. Kjos Music Co:  San Diego, CA. {{ISBN|0-8497-6168-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The factors which affect the professional quality of a piano teacher include one's competence in musical performance, knowledge of musical genres, music history and theory, piano repertoire, experience in teaching, ability to adapt one's teaching method to students of different personalities and learning styles, education level, and so on.

=== Musicians without degrees in piano pedagogy ===

In the United States, piano lessons may be offered by teachers without higher education specifically focused in piano performance or piano pedagogy.  Some  teachers may hold degrees in another discipline in music, such as music education or another performance area (voice, orchestral instrument, etc.).  Other teachers, without higher education in music, may have studied piano playing independently or have been self-taught.

=== Undergraduate and graduate studies in piano pedagogy ===

The field of piano pedagogy may be studied through academic programs culminating in the attainment of a [[Bachelor of music|bachelor]], [[Master of music|master]], or [[Doctor of Musical Arts|doctoral]] degree at [[College or university school of music|music colleges or conservatories]].  The undergraduate level may require many years of prior piano studies and previous teaching experience as prerequisites for application.  At the graduate level, many schools require applicants to have some teaching experience and at least a [[bachelor of music]] or equivalent experience in piano performance and/or pedagogy.&lt;ref name=UM&gt;[http://www.music.umich.edu/departments/piano/programs.htm University of Michigan Piano Department:  Degree programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although virtually all piano pedagogy programs include a significant portion of performance requirement, the pedagogy major may be distinct from the performance major at some schools. Some members of the latter group may have the option to take courses in the [http://www.pianoonlinelearning.com/how-to-play-the-piano-easy/ teaching of piano], but not all do.&lt;ref name=WTKT /&gt;

=== Professional organizations in the United States ===

Many piano teachers hold memberships in professional organizations, to maintain their commitment to pedagogy and to network with peers and others in music.  These organizations often offer teachers' workshops, conferences, mentorship programs, publications on piano pedagogy, and opportunities for scholarships, competitions, and performances for the students of members. Some prominent organizations in the United States include:

* American Council of Piano Performers - ACPP
* Music Teachers National Association - MTNA
* National Federation of Music Clubs
* National Guild of Piano Teachers
* Piano Teachers Congress of New York

=== Professional Organizations in Canada ===

The main organization that offers certificates and testing curriculum in Canada is [[Royal Conservatory of Music]]. There are three levels in their certificate program; elementary, intermediate and advanced. Elementary pedagogy certificate enables teachers to teach beginners up to grade two piano, while intermediate certificate allows teachers to teach up to grade 6 piano. Advanced piano pedagogy is known as "ARCT" (Associate of Royal Conservatory of Toronto), which enables teachers to teach up to grade 10. There are also a number of theory and history examinations that accompany each certificate program which must be completed. There is also a Piano Teachers Federation based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

== Topics of study ==

Piano pedagogy involves the study and teaching of motor, intellectual, problem-solving, and artistic skills involved in playing the piano effectively.&lt;ref name=WTKT /&gt;  Citing the influence of [[Zoltán Kodály]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Dalcroze|Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], Russian-American piano pedagogue at [[Longy School of Music]], Dr. Faina Bryanskaya, advocates a holistic approach which integrates as many aspects of music-making as possible at once would result in the most effective piano teaching.&lt;ref name=TFMM /&gt;

=== Ear training ===
{{main|Ear training}}

Dr. Bryanskaya argues that the foremost task for piano teachers at the beginning of a student's study is the introduction of a habit of listening to quality performances of “descriptive and strikingly expressive music”, as a means for "sensitizing [the student] to the meaning of music".&lt;ref name=TFMM&gt;Bryanskaya, Faina (2nd Ed. 2007).  ''Teaching Fundamentals of Music Making:  A Holistic Integrated Approach, A Handbook for Piano and Music Teachers.''  Brighton, MA (USA).  LC 2003-552304. http://www.chipublib.org/search/details/cn/1902269&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhythm ===
{{main|Rhythm}}

Teaching rhythm is important for the student to be able to learn a piece accurately, and also to confidently perform a practiced piece. Developing an internal metronome plays a significant role when teaching rhythm. Teachers may encourage students to count out loud when practicing, or practice with a metronome to develop a steady internal beat.

=== Notation ===
{{main|List of musical symbols}}

Learning to read music is a critical skill for most pianists. There are generally three approaches to teaching students to read music, although combined approaches are increasingly common. The "[[Middle C Method]]", a "single note identification" method, was the most commonly taught method through the 20th century. It was introduced by [[W.S.B. Mathews]] in 1892 but popularized by Thompson's ''Modern Course for Piano'' (1936). "Middle C" teaches positions relative to the middle C; in other "single note identification" methods, other notes might be used. 

The "intervallic method", developed by [[Frances Clark]] with her ''Time to Begin'' (1955) curriculum, teaches recognition of patterns, and adds "landmark notes". 

The "multi-key method", developed by [[Robert Pace]] and published in 1954, teaches students all major and minor keys fairly quickly.

=== Technique ===

Good piano playing technique involves the simultaneous understanding in both the mind and the body of the relationships between the elements of music theory, recognition of musical patterns in notation and at the fingertips, the physical landscape of the entire range of the keyboard, finger dexterity and independence, and a wide range of touch and tone production for a variety of emotional expressions.  Skills in all of these areas are typically nurtured and developed for the sake of expressing oneself more effectively and naturally through the sound of the piano, so that the elements of technique will sound alive with musicality.&lt;ref name=TFMM /&gt;

=== Improvisation ===
{{main|Musical improvisation}}

Modern piano lessons tend to emphasize learning notation, and may neglect developing the creative spirit and sensitive ears which lead to expressive music-making. Studies point to the need for using multiple approaches in learning musical skills which engage both sides of the brain—the analytical and the intuitive—for students to master all aspects of playing.&lt;ref name=Chappell /&gt; Therefore, teaching improvisation skills may help students take ownership of the expressive quality of the music they make, and to keep music learning and practicing alive and interesting.&lt;ref name=Kampmeier&gt;Kampmeier, Valerie. "Intuitive Improvisation: A Guide for Beginners."  ''American Music Teacher.'' Dec/Jan 07-08.&lt;/ref&gt; One way to do so is to make up stories full of different emotions through improvising, in order to reinforce music theory concepts already introduced and to develop a wide range of touch and tone production.&lt;ref name= TFMM /&gt;  

Some mainstream piano methods, such as [https://pianoadventures.com/ Faber Piano Adventures], have started offering improvisation options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pianoadventures.com/browse/libraries/libraries-supplementary-works/libraries-supplementary-works-discover-improvisation/|title=Discover Beginning Improvisation, piano book|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in most methods, improvisation remains supplemental, with the core curriculum centering around notation, theory, and technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alfredsbasicpiano.com/pages/alfreds-basic-piano-course|title=Alfred's Basic Piano Course|website=Alfred's Basic Piano Library|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjos.com/sub_section.php?division=5&amp;series=13|title=Neil A.

=== Sight reading ===
{{main|Sight reading}}

Sight reading heavily depends on the students' ability to understand rhythm, and recognize musical patterns. Teaching sight reading can include teaching students to recognize intervals, scale passage patterns, note reading and the ability to internalize rhythm. The ability to have strong knowledge of different major and minor key signatures can also help students anticipate the accidentals they should expect when sight reading.

=== Memorization ===
{{main|Memorization}}

Memorization is useful to perform a piece confidently. It gives the student ability and freedom to experience the music for all of its intricacies as opposed to focusing on the technicalities of notes and rhythm. Memorization can come easily to some students, and harder for others. The most common memorization technique is [[muscle memory]]. However reliance on muscle memory alone can hinder students if they have not made the cognitive connection between every note they play, and leaves room for lots of memory slips. To have a strong foundation of memorization, students should be able to visualize everything that they play, and be able to start from any passage.

Effective memorization results from the "combination of visual, kinaesthetic, aural and analytical skills".&lt;ref name=Chappell&gt;Chappell, Sally. "Developing the complete pianist:  a study of the importance of a whole-brain approach to piano teaching." ''Piano Journal'', Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repertoire ===

Well-known keyboard works written with special attention for pedagogical purposes in mind include:&lt;ref name=TFMM /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braudo"&gt;Braudo, Isaiah.

== Venues offering instructions in piano playing ==

The teaching of piano playing most often take place in the form of weekly private lessons, in which a student and a teacher have one-on-one meetings.  Instructions may sometimes be offered semi-privately (one teacher meeting with a small group of two or more students) or in classes of larger groups, in other intervals of time.  Piano lessons are offered in a variety of different settings, including the following:&lt;ref name="WTKT"&gt;Ulszer, Marienne (1995). ''The Well-Tempered Keyboard Teacher.''  Schirmer Books.  {{ISBN|0-02-871780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pinball FX 2''''' (stylized as '''''Pinball FX2''''') is a [[pinball]] [[video game]] for [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[Windows XP|XP]] and higher)&lt;ref name="steam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/226980/?snr=1_7_15__13|publisher=Valve Software|title=Pinball FX2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the sequel to ''[[Pinball FX]]''. It was developed by [[Zen Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios (game studio)|Microsoft Studios]]. It was released on October 27, 2010 via the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service. The game includes several new features, such as local multiplayer and the ability to tweak table settings. Players can also import all of the tables from ''Pinball FX'' they had previously purchased. The Windows 8 version of ''Pinball FX 2'' was released on the [[Windows Store]] on October 27, 2012, two years after the original XBLA release.&lt;ref name="win8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/10/27/pinball-fx-2-ricochets-onto-windows-8/|title=Pinball FX 2 ricochets onto Windows 8|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=October 28, 2012|date=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was subsequently released for other Windows platforms via [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on May 10, 2013.&lt;ref name="steam"/&gt;  ''Pinball FX 2'' was announced for [[Windows Phone]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpcentral.com/pinball-fx-2-carcassonne-and-more-xbox-live-games-coming-windows-phone|title=Pinball FX2, Carcassonne, and more Xbox Live games coming to Windows Phone|date=22 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Pinballfx2 table.png|thumb|left|The ''Pasha'' table as it appears in the Xbox 360 version. ''Pinball FX 2'' is available with either time limited trials of all tables on Xbox platforms and Steam or full play with video advertisements for non-''Star Wars'' tables on the current Windows 8 version, with the ability to unlock full tables via [[downloadable content]].]]

''Pinball FX 2'' uses the same basic rules as a physical [[pinball]] machine, but in a virtual environment.  As with a traditional pinball machine, the player fires a steel ball onto the [[Pinball#Machine layout|playfield]] using a plunger.  Once the ball is in play the player controls the [[Pinball#Flippers|flippers]] and can [[Pinball#Nudging|nudge]] the machine to influence the path of the ball.&lt;ref name="the game"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pinball FX 2|developer=Zen Studios|publisher=Microsoft Studios|date=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the game's tables become more complex as the game advances, opening new paths and opportunities.&lt;ref name="the game" /&gt;

The game allows use of the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera to operate the flippers and to video chat with [[Xbox Live]] opponents.&lt;ref name="gamezone review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/pinball_fx_2_review/ |title=Pinball FX 2 review |first=B. |last=James |publisher=GameZone |accessdate=2010-11-30 |date=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features [[ladder tournament|leaderboards]] and online multiplayer for up to four players. Players can also participate in [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] multiplayer.&lt;ref name="gamezone review" /&gt;  Multiplayer games are won by being the first to achieve the set high score, which can be adjusted from 10 to 100 million points. Penalties can also be set for losing a ball with players losing anywhere from 5 to 25 percent of their score when a ball is lost.&lt;ref name="the game" /&gt;

Zen Studios [[Managing Director]] Zsolt Kigyossy detailed the reasons for focusing primarily on pinball games.  "We have guys in the studio who have spent countless hours and pockets full of money at arcades playing pinball."&lt;ref name="gamesworld interview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gamesworld.blox.pl/2011/02/Designing-in-unconventional-ways-an-interview.html |title=Designing in unconventional ways - an interview with ZEN Studios |accessdate=2011-02-03 |date=2011-02-03 |publisher=gamesworld.blox.pl |quote=We already know that new tables for Marvel Pinball will be available, such as the Captain America table.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kigyossy explained that the design process for the tables begins with a conceptual design on paper.  Basic 3D models and shapes are then created and implemented into a test environment.  The artists then add graphical details and animations.  Once gameplay and visual design is complete a final pass is made "properly lighting the table, so the tables becomes lifelike."&lt;ref name="gamesworld interview" /&gt;  Simultaneously other designers work on the LED display system, sound and gameplay mechanics.  The game then spends two to three months in testing before the table is considered ready for release.  The entire process takes approximately six months per table.&lt;ref name="gamesworld interview" /&gt;  Kigyossy further stated the team plans to "keep the tables coming, support our games long term, and give fans a great selection to choose from."&lt;ref name="gamesworld interview" /&gt;

The developers stated that they listened to fan responses from the first game and implemented those ideas into the sequel.  "We have been listening to our fans and building the pinball game that they envisioned," stated Kigyossy. "It took a little longer than expected, but we have designed a game that unifies the online community, and takes all the social features to the next level."&lt;ref name="announced" /&gt;  The game was made available free of charge and gives players the ability to try any table for a limited time.

''Pinball FX2 VR'', a version of the game that supports [[virtual reality]] headset the [[Oculus Rift]], is expected to be released on March 28, 2016. The VR-enabled version will initially include three tables (Mars, Secrets of the Deep, and Epic Quest), placing these tables in a virtual beach-side house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-10-pinball-fx2-vr-slated-for-oculus-rift-this-month | title = Pinball FX2 VR is coming to Oculus Rift this month | first = Jeffrey | last= Matulef | date = March 10, 2016 | accessdate = March 10, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]]'s Matthew Keast stated "You'll forget you're not playing an actual table."&lt;ref name="gamesradar review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/pinball-fx-2/review/pinball-fx-2-review/a-20101029132126468045/g-2010083112345887099 |title=Pinball FX 2 |first=Matthew |last=Keast |accessdate=2010-11-30 |date=2010-10-29 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nick Chester of Destructoid added "Zen [Studios] already has pinball on consoles nailed."&lt;ref name="destructoid review" /&gt;

Critics praised the game's ability to play updated versions of the tables previously available for ''Pinball FX''.

"It's unfortunate that not all of the tables are available to buy individually" stated Calvert, adding "you have to buy at least one of the four-packs before you have the option to play any of the singles."&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/pinballfx2/review.html |accessdate=2010-11-29 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=Pinball FX 2 Review |first=Justin |last=Calvert |date=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's updated multiplayer and other new features also received high marks.  TeamXbox's Richard Basset praised the addition of split-screen multiplayer, as did GameSpot's Justin Calvert.&lt;ref name="gamespot review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teamxbox review" /&gt;  Calvert also noted the addition of four player, turn-based local multiplayer was a welcome addition.&lt;ref name="gamespot review" /&gt;  Kristan Reed of Eurogamer noted the new ability to adjust settings on the tables, allowing for enthusiasts to tweak the game to their liking.  He also lauded the new social features, calling them the "real genius" of the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt;  Some reviewers mentioned that while the online multiplayer was impressive they had difficulty finding games to join.&lt;ref name="gamesradar review" /&gt;

'''Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College''' (originally located in [[Venice, Florida]], then relocated to [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]] and finally [[Sarasota, Florida]]) trained around 1,400 [[clown]]s in the "Ringling style" from its 1968 founding until its 1997 closure.

==History==

Clown College was the brainchild of [[Irvin Feld]], the owner of [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey]] Circus, and longtime Ringling clown and front man [[Bill Ballantine (illustrator)|Bill Ballantine]].  In 1968, Ringling had only a handful of clowns in their alleys, most of them over fifty years of age. It was clear that these performers wouldn't be able to go on forever. But there was a dearth of suitable replacements at that time. So Feld decided to create a school to train a new generation in this ancient art form.&lt;ref name=ht0&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handelman|first1=Jay|title=Ringling Bros. returning to Southwest Florida|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20120131/ARTICLE/120139915?p=2&amp;tc=pg|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=Herald-Tribune|date=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ppl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langdon|first1=Dolly|title=''Lord of the Rings' Irvin Feld Has Made a Fading Circus the Greatest Show on Earth Again|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076452,00.html|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=People|date=May 12, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feld also saw the potential [[public relations]] opportunity in having a place that could become the Mecca of clowning in America. In addition, he wanted to use the school as another way of keeping his show more attractive to audiences than his competition, and have a place where he could guarantee getting an endless supply of new talent. 

[[Circus World (theme park)|Circus World]] was planned in September 1972 to have the clown college's campus on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fiero|first1=Peter|title=Gulf Oil Subsidiary To Buy Circus World|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19740123&amp;id=hBpXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dPoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2719,6177973&amp;hl=en|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=Lakeland Ledger|publisher=New York Times Company|issue=Vol. 67, No. 99|date=January 23, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fiero|first1=Peter|title=Hurry, Hurry!|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Re8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xfoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6271%2C5745967|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=Lakeland Ledger|publisher=New York Times Company|issue=Vol. 67, No. 126|date=February 21, 1974 |pages=1A, 3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, after Feld's death, [[Kenneth Feld]], his son, took over production of Feld Entertainment and the Ringling shows. In 1993, the clown college was moved from the Venice Arena to Baraboo, Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=ht0 /&gt; He continued to operate the school through the 1997 session, and then closed Clown College because the needs of the show had changed.  The school was no longer profitable, nor necessary, as clowning had moved back into the mainstream of performing arts. Also, with nearly fifteen hundred graduates, many of whom were teaching others the lessons they had learned, and with a home videotape produced by Ringling and made at Clown College in 1986 titled "Be A Clown," which featured many of the techniques used in the school's training sessions, Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus officially discontinued their Clown College just shy of its 30th year. 

Two notable national events took place involving RBBB Clown College. The first occurred on February 17, 1988, when [[CBS]] Television broadcast the "Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College: 20th Anniversary" special. This hour long program was hosted by [[Dick Van Dyke]] and it featured a cadre of clown alumni, performing their favorite routines, as well as Mr. Van Dyke, in character as the school custodian "Burford," who was trying to pick up some of the "course material" on the sly. 

The second was on August 4, 1992, when Ringling created "Smiles Across America," an event done locally in cities and towns across the country to raise awareness of various issues and to help make people happier. Clown College graduates performed such civic duties as visiting hospitals and parks and appeared for photo ops and did "meet &amp; greet" with the media and the general public.

Van Dyke and long time [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] weatherman [[Willard Scott]], the first person to portray [[Ronald McDonald]] in a television advertisement, are both honorary graduates of the school.

After 25 years the college moved from Venice, Florida to Baraboo, Wisconsin, hometown of the [[Ringling Bros.]]  After three years in Baraboo the college moved to Sarasota where it was based for two years, closing after the graduation of the 1997 class.After three years in Baraboo, the clown college operated at the [[Sarasota Opera House]] in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] until 1998 before the program was suspended.&lt;ref name=ht0 /&gt;

==Operation==

Clown College was a unique institution for several reasons. First, the method to apply to the school was an extensive written personality profile that gave the directors an opportunity to have an understanding of the applicant's psychology, interests and previous experience. The circus also held in-person auditions at most stops along the route to drum up interest in the show and to get a range of people from all over the United States to apply.

Next, tuition was free (though students were responsible for their own room and board, as well as any other incidental expenses incurred), and a graduate from the school finished the term with a full "Agent Suit" or specific clown costume, including a wig and proper clown shoes and a complete make-up kit, as well as the training needed to be a good clown performer. 

Each yearly session was held in the fall. The number of students admitted to any year's session varied but it ranged from thirty to fifty, with the vast majority being men. The ratio of men to women in a Clown College class was roughly 8 to 1.

The Clown College session over the years ranged from approximately thirteen weeks down to ten and a half weeks before it was eventually scaled back to an eight-week course in its final years. Students would work together or "play off" each other 8{{frac|1|2}} hours a day, six days a week preparing material for the "Big Show" (Clown College served as a think tank to create new gags for the circus) and learning all of the basics of clowning. Typical classes included [[make-up]] application, [[costume design]], [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], [[stilt walking]], [[Mime artist|pantomime]] and other skills training. Films of classic performers like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[The Three Stooges]] were studied, as were the cartoon work of [[Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Bugs Bunny]].

The entire session was one long audition for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, as the instructors took note of which students had what they were looking for to fill the positions for the new season's show, which began several weeks after the Clown College session ended. Chosen graduates received a one year contract to travel with "The Greatest Show on Earth," which they were obliged to accept. (This was Ringling's only stipulation for all students who agreed to receive the school's free training, but was only added after several students declined job offers at the end of the session. The first person to do so, in 1974, was [[Bill Irwin]].) Grads not selected to tour were often given opportunities to perform in other capacities within the Feld Organization, sometimes were added to the show's [[clown alley]] at a later date, or became a member of any of a collection of other circuses that sought well-trained clowns for their shows.

==Clown style==
The particular "Ringling Style" of clowning taught at Clown College was rooted in the American type of clown performance, with an accent towards broad and [[slapstick]] type humor, as opposed to the European approach which was typically more subtle.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Because of the "three ring" configuration of the Ringling show, and the bigger arenas that were needed to present such an attraction, audiences were larger and many patrons sat in balconies or upper decks, far above the action. In order to reach the people in every area of these larger arenas, clowns on the Ringling show had to design their makeup to be seen at a distance, and use their props and clear physical movements to show the audience what was happening during a gag, no matter where in the house they were seated. The training given here was tailor-made for the Ringling show, but could be transferred to other circus styles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

'''''Risus sardonicus''''' or '''rictus grin''' is a highly characteristic, abnormal, sustained [[spasm]] of the [[facial muscles]] that appears to produce grinning.  Risus sardonicus may be caused by tetanus, strychnine poisoning or Wilson's disease.  

The name of the condition, which has its roots in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island of [[Sardinia]], derives from the appearance of raised eyebrows and an open "grin" – which can appear [[sardonic]] or malevolent to the lay observer – displayed by those experiencing these muscle spasms.

==Causes==
It is most often observed as a sign of [[tetanus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/tetanus/en/index.html|title=Tetanus|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be caused by poisoning with [[strychnine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7009NkJv70C&amp;pg=PA791|title=Comprehensive Reviews in Toxicology: For Emergency Clinicians|page=791|last1=Bryson|first1=Peter D.|ISBN=978-1560326120|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Wilson's disease]].

In 2009 scientists at the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] in Italy wrote that they had identified hemlock [[water dropwort]] (''Oenanthe crocata'') as the plant historically responsible for producing the sardonic grin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-aug-09 News Scan Briefs: Killer Smile], ''Scientific American'', August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Natural Products|year = 2009|volume = 72|issue = 5|pages = 962–965|title = Polyacetylenes from Sardinian ''Oenanthe fistulosa'': A Molecular Clue to ''risus sardonicus''|author1=G.

'''Rock–paper–scissors''' (also known as '''scissors–rock–paper''' or other variants) is a [[hand game]] usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered [[V sign]] (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. 
A [[Simultaneous game|simultaneous]], [[zero-sum game]], it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=Len |title=Rock, Paper, Scissors: Game Theory in Everyday Life |date=2008 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=9780786726936 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ba-bHdskMAC&amp;pg=PA92 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time. Other names for the game in the English-speaking world include '''roshambo''' and other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rpschamps.com/templates/j15_rps/images/propaganda/faq/game-basics/|title=Game Basics|accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/16/BA251812.DTL |title=Ready, set ...

Rock–paper–scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to [[coin flipping]], [[drawing straws]], or throwing [[dice]] in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly [[randomness|random]] selection methods, however, rock–paper–scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Len|title=Rock, paper, scissors: game theory in everyday life|year=2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780786726936|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27228416|title=How to win at rock-paper-scissors|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game play ==
{{Triple image|right|Rock-paper-scissors (rock).png|100|Rock-paper-scissors (paper).png|100|Rock-paper-scissors (scissors).png|100|Each of the three basic handsigns (from left to right: rock, paper, and scissors) beats one of the other two, and loses to the other.}}

The players usually count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"), each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. They then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use only three counts before throwing their gesture (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing".

== History ==

===Origins===

The first known mention of the game was in the book ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wuzazu|zh|3=五雜組}}''&lt;!-- ({{zh |t=五雜組 |s=五杂组 |first=t}}) --&gt; by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming-dynasty]] writer {{Interlanguage link multi|Xie Zhaozhi|zh|3=謝肇淛}} (&lt;!-- {{zh |t=謝肇淛 |s=谢肇淛 |first=t |links=no}}; --&gt;{{fl.}} {{ca.}} 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Michael E.|title=Introduction to the game industry|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-168743-1|page=535|author2=Sward, Jennifer }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, the game was called ''shoushiling''. [[Li Rihua]]'s &lt;!-- ({{zh |t=李日華 |s=李日华 |first=t |links=no}}) --&gt;book ''Note of Liuyanzhai'' &lt;!-- ({{zh |t=六硯齋筆記 |s=六砚斋笔记 |first=t |links=no}}) --&gt; also mentions this game, calling it ''shoushiling'' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|t]]. 手勢令; [[Simplified Chinese characters|s]]. 手势令), ''huozhitou'' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|t]]. 豁指頭; [[Simplified Chinese characters|s]]. 豁指头), or ''huoquan'' (豁拳).

[[File:Mushi-ken (虫拳), Japanese rock-paper-scissors variant, from the Kensarae sumai zue (1809).jpg|thumb|300px|Mushi-ken, the earliest Japanese [[sansukumi-ken]] game (1809). From left to right: slug (namekuji), frog (kawazu) and snake (hebi).]]
Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to ''[[sansukumi-ken]]'', meaning ''ken'' (fist) games where "the three who are afraid of one another" (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A).&lt;ref name=linh95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linhart|first=Sepp |title=Some Thoughts on the Ken Game in Japan: From the Viewpoint of Comparative Civilization Studies| journal=Senri Ethnological Studies| year=1995| volume=40| pages=101–124 | hdl=10502/750}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of game originated in China before being imported to Japan and subsequently also becoming popular among the Japanese.&lt;ref name=linh95/&gt;

The earliest Japanese ''sansukumi-ken'' game was known as ''mushi-ken'' (虫拳), which was imported directly from China.&lt;ref name=linh95/&gt;&lt;ref name=linha95-3940&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhart|first=Sepp|title=Ceremony and Ritual in Japan|year=1995|publisher=Routledge| location=London| isbn=9780415116633| chapter=Rituality in the ken game|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''mushi-ken'' the "frog" (represented by the thumb) is superseded by the "slug" (represented by the little finger), which, in turn is superseded by the "snake" (represented by the index finger), which is superseded by the "frog".&lt;ref name=linh95/&gt; Although this game was imported from China the Japanese version differs in the animals represented. In adopting the game, the original [[Chinese characters]] for the poisonous centipede (蜈蜙) were apparently confused with the characters for the slug (蛞蝓).&lt;ref name=linha95-3940/&gt; The most popular ''sansukumi-ken'' game in Japan was ''kitsune-ken'' ([[:ja:狐拳|狐拳]]). In the game, a supernatural fox called a [[kitsune]] (狐) defeats the village head, the village head (庄屋) defeats the hunter, and the hunter (猟師) defeats the fox. ''Kitsune-ken'', unlike ''mushi-ken'' or rock–paper–scissors, is played by making gestures with both hands.&lt;ref name=linha98-325326&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhart|first=Sepp|title=The Culture of Japan as Seen through Its Leisure|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press| location=New York| isbn=9780791437919| chapter=From Kendo to Jan-ken: The Deterioration of a Game from Exoticism to Ordinariness|pages=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the best-known ''sansukumi-ken'' is called {{nihongo|''jan-ken''|じゃんけん}},&lt;ref name=linha95-3940/&gt; which is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sosnoski|first=Daniel|title=Introduction to Japanese culture|year=2001| publisher=Tuttle| location=Rutland| isbn=9780804820561|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jan-ken'' uses the rock, paper, and scissors signs&lt;ref name=linh95 /&gt; and is the game that the modern version of rock–paper–scissors derives from directly.&lt;ref name=linha95-3940/&gt; Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper, and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th century, between the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period|Meiji]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhart|first=Sepp|title=Ken no bunkashi|year=1998|publisher=shoten Kadokawa|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-04-702103-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, rock–paper–scissors had spread beyond Asia, especially through increased Japanese contact with the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogawa|first=Dennis M.|title=Jan Ken Po: The World of Hawaii's Japanese Americans|year=1978|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its English-language name is therefore taken from a translation of the names of the three Japanese hand-gestures for rock, paper and scissors:&lt;ref name="長田須磨・須山名保子共編 1977.4"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere in Asia the open-palm gesture represents "cloth" rather than "paper".&lt;ref&gt;In Korea the name of the game, Kai Bai Bo, or Kawi Bawi Bo, translates as "scissors, rock, cloth". [http://my-seoul-searching.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/kai-bai-bo.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the scissors is also adopted from the Japanese style.&lt;ref name="長田須磨・須山名保子共編 1977.4"/&gt;

=== Spread beyond Asia ===
In Britain in 1924 it was described in a letter to ''The Times'' as a hand game, possibly of Mediterranean origin, called "zhot".&lt;ref&gt;After the Rome correspondent of a British paper described the traditional Italian hand-game of ''[[morra (game)|morra]]'', which has some similarities to rock–paper–scissors, a brief correspondence began on the subject. One contributor described a game he had seen played in Mediterranean ports, called 'zot' or 'zhot', which was clearly identical with the modern "Rock–paper–scissors": 'In this game the closed fist represents a stone, the open hand with fingers outstretched paper, and the closed fist with two fingers outstretched scissors...The players stand facing one another, and commence playing simultaneously by raising and lowering the right arm three times rapidly, coming to rest with the fist in any of the three above-mentioned positions. If you keep your fist closed and your opponent flings open his hand then you lose, as paper wraps up stones, and so on.' {{cite journal|title=The Times|date=1 March 1924|page=15}} Letter to the editor, from Paymaster Lieutenant G.L.P. Garwood, R.N.&lt;/ref&gt;
A reader then wrote in to say that the game "zhot" referred to was evidently Jan-ken-pon, which she had often seen played throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=6 March 1924|page=8}}: Letter to the editor, from Miss F.C.Pringle&lt;/ref&gt; Although at this date the game appears to have been new enough to British readers to need explaining, the appearance by 1927 of a popular thriller with the title ''Scissors Cut Paper'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard Fairlie]], ''Scissors Cuts Paper'', Hodder and Stoughton, (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Stone Blunts Scissors'' (1929), suggests it quickly became popular.

In 1927 ''La Vie au patronage'', a children's magazine in France, described it in detail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La Vie au patronage|date=January 1927|page=73}}: "Jeux actifs et mi-actifs pouvant être joués en classe."&lt;/ref&gt; referring to it as a "jeu japonais" ("Japanese game"). Its French name, "Chi-fou-mi", is based on the [[Old Japanese]] words for "one, two, three" ("hi, fu, mi").

A ''New York Times'' article of 1932 on the Tokyo rush hour describes the rules of the game for the benefit of American readers, suggesting it was not at that time widely known in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', May 22, 1932 - The ''New York Times Magazine'', article by Marion May Dilts: "COMMUTING WITH TOKYO'S SUBURBANITES; Their Morning Ritual Is Characteristically Japanese, but In Their Mode of Travel There Is Western Technique"&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 edition of the ''[[Compton's Encyclopedia|Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia]]'' described it as a common method of settling disputes between children in its article on Japan; the name was given as "John Kem Po" and the article pointedly asserted, "This is such a good way of deciding an argument that American boys and girls might like to practice it too."&lt;ref&gt;''Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia'', 1933, Volume 7, p. 194. F. E. Compton &amp; Company, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

In tournament play, some players employ tactics to confuse or trick the other player into making an illegal move, resulting in a loss. One such tactic is to shout the name of one move before throwing another, in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent. During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Journal-World"&gt;Steve Vockrodt, [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/apr/08/student_rivals_throw_down_rock_paper_scissors_tour/ "Student rivals throw down at rock, paper, scissors tournament"], ''[[Lawrence Journal-World]]'', 8 April 2007. Retrieved 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;Michael Y. Park, [https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188380,00.html "Rock, Paper, Scissors, the Sport"], ''[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]'', 20 March 2006. Retrieved 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "rock" move, in particular, is notable in that it is typically represented by a closed fist—often identical to the fist made by players during the initial countdown. If a player is attempting to beat their opponent based on quickly reading their hand gesture as the players are making their moves, it is possible to determine if the opponent is about to throw "rock" based on their lack of hand movement, as both "scissors" and "paper" require the player to reposition their hand. This can likewise be used to deceive an anticipating opponent by keeping one's fist closed until the last possible second, leading them to believe that you are about to throw "rock".

=== Algorithms ===
As a consequence of rock–paper–scissors programming contests, many strong algorithms have emerged.&lt;ref name="rpscontest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roshambo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roshambo2"/&gt; For example, Iocaine Powder, which won the First International RoShamBo Programming Competition in 1999,&lt;ref name="roshambo1"/&gt; uses a heuristically designed compilation of strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iocaine Powder Explained|url=http://www.ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html|author=Egnor, Dan|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=1999-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723203327/http://www.ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each strategy it employs, it also has six metastrategies which defeat second-guessing, triple-guessing, as well as second-guessing the opponent, and so on. The optimal strategy or metastrategy is chosen based on past performance. The main strategies it employs are history matching, frequency analysis, and random guessing. Its strongest strategy, history matching, searches for a sequence in the past that matches the last few moves in order to predict the next move of the algorithm.

=== Auction house selection ===
[[Image:Paul Cézanne 076.jpg|thumb|''Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan'' sold for $11,776,000 at Christie's.&lt;ref name="CityReview"&gt;[http://www.thecityreview.com/s05cimp1.html Art/Auctions logo, Impressionist &amp; Modern Art, Christie's, 7 pm, May 4, 2005, Sale 1514].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2005, when Takashi Hashiyama, CEO of Japanese television equipment manufacturer [[Maspro Denkoh]], decided to auction off the collection of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] paintings owned by his corporation, including works by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]], he contacted two leading auction houses, [[Christie's]] International and [[Sotheby's]] Holdings, seeking their proposals on how they would bring the collection to the market as well as how they would maximize the profits from the sale. Both firms made elaborate proposals, but neither was persuasive enough to earn Hashiyama's approval. Unwilling to split up the collection into separate auctions, Hashiyama asked the firms to decide between themselves who would hold the auction, which included Cézanne's ''Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan'', worth $12–16 million.

The houses were unable to reach a decision. Hashiyama told the two firms to play rock–paper–scissors to decide who would get the rights to the auction, explaining that "it probably looks strange to others, but I believe this is the best way to decide between two things which are equally good".

The auction houses had a weekend to come up with a choice of move. Christie's went to the 11-year-old twin daughters of the international director of Christie's Impressionist and Modern Art Department Nicholas Maclean, who suggested "scissors" because "Everybody expects you to choose 'rock'." Sotheby's said that they treated it as a [[game of chance]] and had no particular strategy for the game, but went with "paper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== Analogs in game design ==
In many games, it is common for a group of possible choices to interact in a rock–paper–scissors style, where each selection is strong against a particular choice, but weak against another. Such mechanics can make a game somewhat self-balancing, and prevent gameplay from being overwhelmed by a single [[dominant strategy]].&lt;ref name="egenfeldt-nielsen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding video games: the essential introduction|last=Egenfeldt-Nielsen|first=Simon|author2=Jonas Heide Smith|author3=Susana Pajares Tosca|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2008|isbn=0-415-97721-5|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many card-based video games in Japan use the rock–paper–scissors system as their core fighting system, with the winner of each round being able to carry out their designated attack. Sega [[Master System]]'s [[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]] has a level where the player has to win a rock-paper-scissors game to go ahead. Others use simple variants of rock–paper–scissors as subgames like ''[[Mario Party Advance]]'' and ''[[Paper Mario: Color Splash]]''.

In [[Pokémon]], there is a rock–paper–scissors element in the type effectiveness system. For example, a Grass-type Pokémon is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to Water, and Water is weak to Grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/26/pokemon-go-type-chart-strength-weakness-effectiveness-type-pokemon-battles-explained/|title=Pokemon Go type chart - type strength, weakness and effectiveness for Pokemon battles explained - VG247|date=26 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkup, Jr. demonstrated that these antibiotics, [[bacterioicin]]s, were active as ''Escherichia coli'' compete with each other in the intestines of mice, and that the rock-paper-scissors dynamics allowed for the continued competition among strains: antibiotic-producers defeat antibiotic-sensitives; antibiotic-resisters multiply and withstand and out-compete the antibiotic-producers, letting antibiotic-sensitives multiply and out-compete others; until antibiotic-producers multiply again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkup|first=Benjamin C.|author2=Riley, Margaret A. |title=Antibiotic-mediated antagonism leads to a bacterial game of rock–paper–scissors in vivo|journal=Nature|date=25 March 2004|volume=428|issue=6981|pages=412–414|doi=10.1038/nature02429|pmid=15042087|bibcode=2004Natur.428..412K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team Olimpik Championships 2012 ===
The international tournament was held in London 2012. UK Champions Team GB (Andrew Bladon, Jamie Burland, Tom Wilkinson and Stephen Preston) went in as overwhelming favorites, but after a "domestic incident" team captain and UK Team Champion Joe Kenny was forced to pull out, allowing Stephen Preston to take his place. Great Britain came a respectable third to achieve the Bronze Medal, while the crowd favorite Vatican City got the Silver and Lapland A took the prestigious Gold Medal. British team captain Tom Wilkinson commented "after a 4-0 whitewash of hot favorites Vatican City we thought we had it. A simple lapse of concentration lost it for us, but we are happy with our bronze medal. We'll come back from this and look to take the title back again next year. The support was immense, and we are thankful of everyone who came out to support us".&lt;ref&gt;

=== ''Jackpot En Poy'' of ''Eat Bulaga!'' ===
Jackpot En Poy is a game segment of the Philippines' longest running noontime show, [[Eat Bulaga!]]. The game is based on the classic children's game rock–paper–scissors where four players are paired to compete in the three-round segment. In the first round, the first pair plays against each other until one player wins three times. The next pair then plays against each other in the second round. The winners from the first two rounds then compete against each other to finally determine the ultimate winner. The winner of the game then moves on to the final round. In the final round, the player is presented with several Dabarkads, each holding different amounts of cash prize. The player will then pick three Dabarkads who he or she will play rock–paper–scissors against. The player plays against them one at a time. If the player wins against any of the Eat Bulaga! host, he or she will win the cash prize.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/tv/eat_bulaga/57015/eat-bulaga-judy-ann-santos-tinalo-ang-kapatid-sa-jackpot-en-poy/video/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/165186-ph-senators-eat-bulaga|title=WATCH: PH senators on 'Eat Bulaga'|work=Rappler|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2017/03/20/1682731/happily-resettled-back-home|title=Happily resettled back home|last=Lo|first=Ricky|work=philstar.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

Players have developed numerous cultural and personal variations on the game, from simply playing the same game with different objects, to expanding into more weapons and rules, to giving their own name to the game in their national language.

=== Adapted rules ===
In Korea, a two-player upgraded version exists by the name [[muk-jji-ppa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hancinema.net/play-muk-zzi-ppa-the-upgraded-rock-paper-scissors-30907.html|title=Play muk-zzi-ppa! The upgraded rock-paper-scissors|date=2011-06-25|publisher=[[Hancinema]]|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, a "[[strip-poker]]" variant of rock-paper-scissors is known as 野球拳 ([[Yakyuken]]). The loser of each round removes an article of clothing. The game is a minor part of porn culture in Japan and other Asian countries after the influence of TV variety shows and [[Soft On Demand]].

In the [[Philippines]], the game is called ''jak-en-poy'', from one of the Japanese names of the game, transliterated as ''jan-ken-pon''. In a longer version of the game, a four-line song is sung, with hand gestures displayed at the end of each (or the final) line: "Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Sino'ng matalo, / siya'ng unggoy!" ("Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Whoever loses is the monkey!") In the former case, the person with the most wins at the end of the song, wins the game. A shorter version of the game uses the chant "Bato-bato-pick" ("Rock-rock-pick [i.e. choose]") instead.

A multiple player variation can be played: Players stand in a circle and all throw at once. If rock, paper, and scissors are all thrown, it is a stalemate, and they rethrow. If only two throws are present, all players with the losing throw are eliminated. Play continues until only the winner remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official Rock paper Scissors Strategy Guide|last=Walker|first=Douglas and Graham|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2004|isbn=0-7432-6751-6|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Different weapons ===
In the Malaysian version of the game, "scissors" is replaced by "bird," represented with the finger tips of five fingers brought together to form a beak. The open palm represents water. Bird beats water (by drinking it); stone beats bird (by hitting it); and stone loses to water (because it sinks in it).

Singapore also has a related hand-game called "ji gu pa," where "ji" refers to the bird gesture, "gu" refers to the stone gesture, and "pa" refers to the water gesture. The game is played by two players using both hands. At the same time, they both say, ji gu pa!" At "pa!" they both show two open-palmed hands. One player then changes his hand gestures while calling his new combination out (e.g., "pa gu!"). At the same time, the other player changes his hand gestures as well. If one of his hand gestures is the same as the other one, that hand is "out" and he puts it behind his back; he is no longer able to play that hand for the rest of the round. The players take turns in this fashion, until one player loses by having both hands sent "out." "Ji gu pa" is most likely a transcription of the Japanese names for the different hand gestures in the original jan-ken game, "choki" (scissors), "guu" (rock) and "paa" (paper).

Using the same tripartite division, there is a full-body variation in lieu of the hand signs called "'''Bear, Hunter, Ninja'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fortheloveofplay.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/after-another-short-break-not-much-equipment-games-returns-bear-hunter-ninja/|title=After Another Short Break, "Not Much Equipment Games" returns – Bear, Hunter, Ninja! - Knucklebones|work=Knucklebones|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this iteration the participants stand back-to-back and at the count of three (or ro-sham-bo as is traditional) turn around facing each other using their arms evoking one of the totems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seanthorenson.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/ninja-hunter-bear/|title=Ninja, Hunter, Bear|work=Inklings|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223063418/http://seanthorenson.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/ninja-hunter-bear/|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players' choices break down as: Hunter shoots bear; Bear eats ninja; Ninja kills hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pigsdontfly.com/2008/04/bear-hunter-ninja.html|title=Pigs Don't Fly by Zac Martin - Digital Marketing &amp; Entrepreneurship: + Bear Hunter Ninja|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was popularized with a [[FedEx]] commercial&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhFbbq0zpHY FedEx Bear, Hunter, Ninja Commercial&lt;/ref&gt; where warehouse employees had too much free time on their hands.

=== Additional weapons ===
{{original research|section|date=January 2014}}
As long as the number of moves is an odd number and each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half, any combination of moves will function as a game. For example, 5-, 7-, 9-, 11-, 15-, 25-, and 101-weapon versions exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = RPSx | url = http://www.umop.com/rps.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding new gestures has the effect of reducing the odds of a tie, while increasing the complexity of the game. The probability of a tie in an odd-number-of-weapons game can be calculated based on the number of weapons n as 1/n, so the probability of a tie is 1/3 in standard rock-paper-scissors, but 1/5 in a version that offered five moves instead of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Rock Paper Scissors Graphs | url= http://www.kreativekorp.com/miscpages/rps/ | author= Rebecca G. Bettencourt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the French game "pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits" (stone, paper, scissors, [[water well|well]]) is unbalanced; both the stone and scissors fall in the well and lose to it, while paper covers both stone and well. This means two "weapons", well and paper, can defeat two moves, while the other two weapons each defeat only one of the other three choices. The rock has no advantage to well, so optimal strategy is to play each of the other objects (paper, scissors and well) one third of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Theory and Exercises|last=Umbhauer|first=Gisèle|isbn=978-1-3173-6299-9|page=340|publisher=Routledge|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular five-weapon expansion is "{{visible anchor|rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard}}", invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Original Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard Page | url = http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html | author = Sam Kass | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which adds "[[Spock]]" and "[[lizard]]" to the standard three choices. "Spock" is signified with the ''Star Trek'' [[Vulcan salute]], while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproven by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in ''[[The Times]]'' of London&lt;ref name="TimesSpockLizard"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article1080425.ece | title = ... and paper scissors | publisher = The Times Online | date = 11 June 2005 | accessdate = 2009-06-09 | location=London}}{{subscription required}}&lt;!-- For some reason the Times website 404s on this link when the referrer is Wikipedia. Type it in by hand and it works; comment not correct at the moment, but may return to be correct. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was later the subject of an [[List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep25|episode]] of the American [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' in 2008 (as rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lorre |first=Chuck |authorlink=Chuck Lorre |title= The Big Bang Theory Video&amp;nbsp;— Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock&amp;nbsp;— CBS.com

The majority of such proposed generalizations are isomorphic to a simple game of [[modular arithmetic]], where half the differences are wins for player one. For instance, rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard (note the different order of the last two moves) may be modeled as a game in which each player picks a number from one to five. Subtract the number chosen by player two from the number chosen by player one, and then take the remainder modulo 5 of the result. Player one is the victor if the difference is one or three, and player two is the victor if the difference is two or four. If the difference is zero, the game is a tie.

Alternatively, the rankings in rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard may be modeled by a comparison of the [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] of the two choices. If it is the same (two odd-numbered moves or two even-numbered ones) then the lower number wins, while if they are different (one odd and one even) the higher wins. Using this algorithm, additional moves can easily be added two at a time while keeping the game balanced:
# Declare a move N+1 (where N is the original total of moves) that beats all existing odd-numbered moves and loses to the others (for example, the rock (#1), scissors (#3), and lizard (#5) could fall into the German ''well'' (#6), while the paper (#2) covers it and Spock (#4) manipulates it).
# Declare another move N+2 with the reverse property (such as a ''plant'' (#7) that grows through the paper (#2), poisons Spock (#4), and grows through the well (#6), while being damaged by the rock (#1), scissors (#3), and lizard (#5)).

'''Sangita''' ([[Devanagari]]: {{script|Deva|संगीत}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|saṃgīta}}), also spelled '''Samgita''' or '''Sangeeta''', refers to "music and associated performance arts" in the Indian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruno Nettl|author2=Thomas Turino|author3=Isabel Wong et al|title=Excursions in World Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih5iCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-35030-9|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Guy Beck, the root "saṃ-" implies "combining, coming together, convergent wholesome blending, unison" in the context of musical arts.&lt;ref name=beck57&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L.

''Sangita'' is broadly categorized as consisting of three interrelated knowledges: ''gita'' (vocal music, song), ''[[vadya]]'' (instrumental music), and ''nrtya'' (dance, movement).&lt;ref name="Rowell2015p13"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Rowell|title=Music and Musical Thought in Early India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_UCgAAQBAJ |year=2015| publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-73034-9| page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunst2013p88"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaap Kunst|title=Hindu-Javanese Musical Instruments|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ytLoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|year= 2013|publisher= Springer Science|isbn=978-94-011-9185-2|pages=88 with footnote 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArnoldNettl2000p321"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alison Arnold|author2=Bruno Nettl|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA321|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas appear in the Vedic literature of Hinduism such as in the ''Aitareya Brahmana'', and in early post-Vedic era Sanskrit texts such as the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', ''[[Panchatantra]]'', ''Malvikagnimitra'' and ''Kathasaritsagara''.

The 13th-century ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'' text has been influential to North and South Indian music traditions, and is available in many languages. It states, according to Tarla Mehta, that "Sangita constitutes song, dance and musical instruments".&lt;ref name="Mehta1995p221"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tarla Mehta|title=Sanskrit Play Production in Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l7naMj1UxIkC&amp;pg=PA221 |year=1995|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1057-0|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion of experience and concept, states Mehta, established Sangita as an integral component of play production in the Indian tradition.&lt;ref name="Mehta1995p221"/&gt;

[[File:Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat (1941).webm|thumb|thumbtime=10|upright=1.5|''Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat'']]
"'''Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat'''" is a 1941 hit [[boogie-woogie]] popular song written by [[Don Raye]]. A bawdy, jazzy tune, the song describes a laundry woman from [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]] whose technique is so unusual that people come from all around just to watch her scrub. [[The Andrews Sisters]] and [[Will Bradley]] &amp; His Orchestra recorded the most successful pop versions of the song, but it is today best recognized as the centerpiece of an eponymous [[Walter Lantz Studio]] cartoon from 1941.

==Animated short==

===Production===
The short version, released on March 28, 1941 by [[Universal Pictures]] features no director credit ([[Woody Woodpecker]] creator [[Walter Lantz]] claims to have directed the cartoon himself), with a story by [[Ben Hardaway]], animation by [[Alex Lovy]] and [[Frank Tipper]], and voice work by [[Mel Blanc]]. The short uses [[blackface]] [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes]] of [[African Americans|African-American people]] and [[African-American culture|culture]], and of life in the rural [[Southern United States]].

The "Scrub Me Mama" short is today in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://publicdomainmovies.net/movie/scrub-me-mama-with-a-boogie-beat-1941 | title=SCRUB ME MAMA WITH A BOOGIE BEAT (1941) | accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clips from it are featured in [[Spike Lee]]'s 2000 satirical film about African-American stereotypes, ''[[Bamboozled]]''. The film's setting, Lazy Town, is not to be confused with the [[LazyTown|children's television program of the same name]].

===Plot===
The short opens to an orchestral rendition of [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[Old Folks at Home]]", immediately setting the scene in the rural [[Southern United States|South]] of [[blackface]] [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. The setting is Lazy Town, perhaps the laziest place on earth. Neither the town's residents (all stereotypes of African Americans) nor the animals can be bothered to leave their reclining positions to do anything at all. Their pastoral existence is interrupted by the arrival of a [[riverboat]], carrying a svelte, sophisticated, light-skinned woman from Harlem (who bears a resemblance to [[Lena Horne]]&lt;ref name="cbr-20171127"/&gt;), whose physical beauty inspires the entire populace of an all-African-American "Lazy Town" to spring into action.

The visiting urbanite admonishes one of the town's residents, "Listen, Mammy. That ain't no way to wash clothes! What you all need is rhythm!"  She then proceeds to sing "Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat", which the townsfolk slowly join her in performing. Thus begins a montage which is the short's centerpiece. The townsfolk are infected by the song's rhythm and proceed to go about playing instruments, and  dancing suggestively. By the time the young light-skinned lady from Harlem is due to re-board her riverboat and return home, she has succeeded in turning a dark-skinned Lazy Town into a lively community of swing musicians simply by singing. The cartoon concludes with the mammy washerwoman bending over, displaying the words "The End" across her rear end.

===Bans===
This cartoon has been withheld from distribution by Universal since 1949 due to its portrayal of African-Americans. The decision was made after a strong objection was raised by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] upon the short's reissue in 1948. The entire short was a shock to Lantz who prided himself on avoiding problems with the censors. He repeatedly stated that his cartoons were never meant to offend anyone. After the 1948 decision, Lantz made a major effort to make sure that offensive caricatures of any racial or ethnic group would never appear in his cartoons again. He also personally made sure that ''Scrub Me Mama'' would never be distributed on television, although it was seen in [[European countries]], such as [[Ireland]], [[France]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==
The short was re-released in 1948. On October 20, 1948, the NAACP wrote a letter to [[Universal Studios]]. It objected to the "vicious caricature of Negro life in the South". They found the short to depict Black people as lazy and only activated by swing music. They also objected to the images of scantily clad, dancing young women. They requested the end of distribution for the film and better judgment from Universal.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), pp. 51-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 1948, a representative of Universal wrote to the NAACP. He pointed out that none of the company's theaters had received complaints concerning the film. A few days later, on November 3, 1948, Madison Jones, Jr, who represented the NAACP, met with E.L. McEvoy, the Universal short sales distribution chief, at the New York City office of the studio. McEvoy defended the racist humor of the film. Jones responded that the NAACP was holding an education campaign against this type of humor.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;

McEvoy offered to let the NAACP contact the West Coast offices of the company, but he warned that in consequence for taking action, "[[nigger]]s" would be prevented from getting work in the industry. He also claimed the NAACP members were better educated than the average audience member, who would not object to seeing racist images. Jones responded that this was a reason to avoid the racist films, that the audience might think them to be based on fact.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;

McEvoy pointed out that caricatures of Negroes, [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jews]], Germans, and [[Stage Irish|Irish]] used to all be top entertainment. He emphasized that the office language at Universal also included the terms "[[Sheeny|sheenie]]" and "[[kike]]" (both used for Jews).&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt; He noted that the film had only been re-released since the Walter Lantz Studio had temporarily shut down (and stopped producing new content).&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;

On November 20, 1948, the ''[[Los Angeles Tribune]]'' published an article on the complaints of the NAACP. On February 3, 1949, Universal announced in a press release that the studio was withdrawing the film, following the protest. A memo dated February 19, 1949 revealed that the [[Jewish Labor Committee]] had co-operated with the NAACP in protesting the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;

The '''Shakespeare authorship question''' is the [[argument]] that someone other than [[William Shakespeare]] of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield the identity of the real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prescott|2010|p=273}}: {{"'}}Anti-Stratfordian' is the collective name for the belief that someone other than the man from Stratford wrote the plays commonly attributed to him."; {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the idea has attracted much public interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=2–3 (3–4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The UK and US editions of {{harvnb|Shapiro|2010}} differ significantly in pagination.

==Overview==
The arguments presented by anti-Stratfordians share several characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prescott|2010|p=273}}; {{Harvnb|Baldick|2008|pp=17–18}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|pp=68–70}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=2, 6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They attempt to disqualify William Shakespeare as the author and usually offer supporting arguments for a substitute candidate. They often postulate some type of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that protected the author's true identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=15 note}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which they say explains why no documentary evidence exists for their candidate and why the historical record supports Shakespeare's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2003|p=388}}; {{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=31}}: "Most observers, however, have been more impressed by the anti-Stratfordians' dogged immunity to documentary evidence"; {{Harvnb|Shipley|1943|p=38}}: "the challenger would still need to produce  evidence in favour of another author. There is no such evidence."; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=198}}: "...those who believe that other authors were responsible for the canon as a whole ... have been forced to invoke elaborate conspiracy theories."; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=6}}: "Paradoxically, the skeptics invariably substitute for the easily explained lack of evidence concerning William Shakespeare, the more troublesome picture of a vast conspiracy of silence about the 'real author', with a total lack of historical evidence for the existence of this 'real author' explained on the grounds of a secret pact"; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=255 (225)}}: "Some suppose that only Shakespeare and the real author were in the know. At the other extreme are those who believe that it was an open secret".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most anti-Stratfordians say that the Shakespeare canon exhibits such breadth of learning and intimate knowledge of the [[Elizabethan government|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[court (royal)|court]] and politics that no one but a highly educated nobleman or court insider could have written it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|2002|pp=104–5}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=390, 392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literary references, critical commentary and acting notices, the available data regarding [[Shakespeare's life]] consist of mundane personal details such as [[vital record]]s of his [[infant baptism|baptism]], marriage and death, tax records, lawsuits to recover debts, and real estate transactions. In addition, no document attests that he received an education. No personal letters or literary manuscripts certainly written by Shakespeare of Stratford survive. Despite the low survival rate for documents of this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Callaghan|2013|p=11}}: "It is a 'fact' that the survival rate for early modern documents is low and that Shakespeare lived in a world prior to the systematic, all-inclusive collection of data that provides the foundation of modern bureaucracy."&lt;/ref&gt; to sceptics, these gaps in the record suggest the profile of a person who differs markedly from the playwright and poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1943|pp=37–8}}; {{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|pp=48, 50}}; {{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=622}}: "Fuelled by scepticism that the plays could have been written by a working man from a provincial town with no record of university education, foreign travel, legal studies or court preferment, the controversialists proposed instead a sequence of mainly [[British nobility|aristocratic]] alternative authors whose philosophically or politically occult meanings, along with their own true identity, had to be hidden in codes, cryptograms and runic obscurity."&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent public figures, including [[Walt Whitman]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Henry James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]], have found the arguments against Shakespeare's authorship persuasive, and their endorsements are an important element in many anti-Stratfordian arguments.&lt;ref name="Nicholl 2010 3"/&gt;

At the core of the argument is the nature of acceptable evidence used to attribute works to their authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=149}}: "The Shakespeare authorship debate is a classic instance of a controversy that draws its very breath from a fundamental disagreement over the nature of admissible evidence."; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=165, 217–8}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=8, 48, 112–3, 235, 298 (8, 44, 100, 207, 264)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Stratfordians rely on what has been called a "rhetoric of accumulation",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|pp=6, 117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or what they designate as [[circumstantial evidence]]: similarities between the characters and events portrayed in the works and the biography of their preferred candidate; literary parallels with the known works of their candidate; and hidden codes and [[cryptography|cryptographic]] allusions in Shakespeare's own works or texts written by contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=405, 411, 437}}; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|pp=203–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, academic Shakespeareans and literary historians rely mainly on direct documentary evidence—in the form of [[title page]] attributions and government records such as the [[Stationers' Register]] and the [[Master of the Revels|Accounts of the Revels Office]]—and contemporary testimony from poets, historians, and those players and playwrights who worked with him, as well as modern [[stylometry|stylometric studies]]. Scholars say all these converge to confirm William Shakespeare's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=253–95 (223–59)}}; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are the same as those used to credit works to other authors and are accepted as the standard [[scholarly method|methodology]] for authorship attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=163–4}}; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=xii–xiii, 10}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case against Shakespeare's authorship==
Little is known of Shakespeare's personal life, and some anti-Stratfordians take this as circumstantial evidence against his authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crinkley|1985|p=517}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the lack of biographical information has sometimes been taken as an indication of an organised attempt by government officials to expunge all traces of Shakespeare from the historical record and to conceal the true author's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=47}}: "...on the mysterious disappearance of the accounts of the highest immediate authority over theatre in Shakespeare's age, the [[Lord Chamberlain]]s of the Household. Ogburn imagines that these records, like those of the Stratford grammar school, might have been deliberately eradicated 'because they would have showed how little consequential a figure Shakspere cut in the company.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a lack of attendance records for Stratford's grammar school is taken as suggesting that they may have been destroyed to hide proof that Shakespeare did not attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=32}}: "Ogburn gives voice to his suspicion that the school records disappeared because they would have revealed William's name did not appear among those who attended it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare's background===
[[File:William Shakespeares birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon 26l2007.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A two-story house with wattle and daub walls, a timber frame, and a steeply pitched roof|John Shakespeare's house in Stratford-upon-Avon is believed to be Shakespeare's birthplace.]]
Shakespeare was born, brought up, and buried in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where he maintained a household throughout the duration of his career in London. A [[market town]] of around 1,500 residents about {{convert|100|mi}} north-west of London, Stratford was a centre for the slaughter, marketing, and distribution of sheep, as well as for hide tanning and wool trading. Anti-Stratfordians often portray the town as a cultural backwater lacking the environment necessary to nurture a genius, and depict Shakespeare as ignorant and illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=6}}; {{Harvnb|Wells|2003|p=28}}; {{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=625}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=116–7 (103)}}; {{Harvnb|Bevington|2005|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's father, [[John Shakespeare]], was a glover (glove-maker) and town official. He married [[Mary Shakespeare|Mary Arden]], one of the [[Arden family|Ardens]] of [[Warwickshire]], a family of the local [[gentry]]. Both signed their names with a mark, and no other examples of their writing are extant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2001|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often used as an indication that Shakespeare was brought up in an illiterate household. There is also no evidence that Shakespeare's two daughters were literate, save for two signatures by [[Susanna Hall|Susanna]] that appear to be "drawn" instead of written with a practised hand. His other daughter, [[Judith Quiney|Judith]], signed a legal document with a mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Stratfordians consider Shakespeare's background incompatible with that attributable to the author of the Shakespeare canon, which exhibits an intimacy with court politics and culture, foreign countries, and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] sports such as [[hunting]], [[falconry]], [[real tennis|tennis]], and [[bowls|lawn-bowling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=213–7, 262}}; {{Harvnb|Crinkley|1985|p=517}}: "It is characteristic of anti-Stratfordian books that they make a list of what Shakespeare must have been—a [[courtier]], a lawyer, a traveler in Italy, a [[classicism|classicist]], a falconer, whatever. Then a candidate is selected who fits the list. Not surprisingly, different lists find different candidates."&lt;/ref&gt; Some find that the works show little sympathy for upwardly mobile types such as John Shakespeare and his son, and that the author portrays individual commoners comically, as objects of ridicule. Commoners in groups are said to be depicted typically as dangerous mobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of documentary proof of Shakespeare's education is often a part of anti-Stratfordian arguments. The free [[King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon|King's New School]] in Stratford, established 1553, was about {{convert|0.5|mi|1}} from Shakespeare's boyhood home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1944|p=464}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grammar school#Early grammar schools|Grammar school]]s varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar, the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in [[Latin]] grammar, the [[classics]], and [[rhetoric]] at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1944|pp=164–84}}; {{Harvnb|Cressy|1975|pp=28–9}}; {{Harvnb|Thompson|1958|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Quennell|1963|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The headmaster, [[Thomas Jenkins (headmaster)|Thomas Jenkins]], and the instructors were [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honan|2000|pp=49–51}}; {{Harvnb|Halliday|1962|pp=41–9}}; {{Harvnb|Rowse|1963|pp=36–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No student registers of the period survive, so no documentation exists for the attendance of Shakespeare or any other pupil, nor did anyone who taught or attended the school ever record that they were his teacher or classmate. This lack of documentation is taken by many anti-Stratfordians as evidence that Shakespeare had little or no education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Stratfordians also question how Shakespeare, with no record of the education and cultured background displayed in the works bearing his name, could have acquired the extensive vocabulary found in the plays and poems. The author's vocabulary is calculated to be between 17,500 and 29,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevalainen|1999|p=336}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The low figure is that of Manfred Scheler. The upper figure, from Marvin Spevack, is true only if all word forms (''cat'' and ''cats'' counted as two different words, for example), compound words, emendations, variants, proper names, foreign words, [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words, and deliberate [[malapropism]]s are included.}} No letters or signed manuscripts written by Shakespeare survive. The appearance of Shakespeare's six surviving authenticated&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1981|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; signatures, which they characterise as "an illiterate scrawl", is interpreted as indicating that he was illiterate or barely literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=164}}: "...most anti-Stratfordians claim that he was not even literate. They present his six surviving signatures as proof."&lt;/ref&gt; All are written in [[secretary hand]], a style of handwriting common to the era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|Kennedy-Skipton|1966|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in play writing,&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo, Grace, "Early modern handwriting", in Michael Hattaway, ed., ''A New Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture'', vol. 1 (2010:177-83).&lt;/ref&gt; and three of them utilize [[breviograph]]s to abbreviate the surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|Kennedy-Skipton|1966|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name as a pseudonym===
{{See also|Spelling of Shakespeare's name}}
[[File:Sonnets1609titlepage.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Book cover with Shakespeare's name spelled Shake hyphen speare|Shakespeare's name was hyphenated on the cover of the 1609 quarto edition of the Sonnets.]]
In his surviving signatures William Shakespeare did not spell his name as it appears on most Shakespeare title pages. His surname was spelled inconsistently in both literary and non-literary documents, with the most variation observed in those that were written by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is taken as evidence that he was not the same person who wrote the works, and that the name was used as a [[pseudonym]] for the true author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrell|1940|p=6}}: "The main contention of these anti-Stratfordians is that 'William Shakespeare' was a pen-name, like '[[Molière]],' '[[George Eliot]],' and '[[Mark Twain]],' which in this case cloaked the creative activities of a master scholar in high circles".&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's surname was hyphenated as "Shake-speare" or "Shak-spear" on the title pages of 15 of the 48 individual [[quarto]] (or ''Q'') editions of Shakespeare's plays (16 were published with the author unnamed) and in two of the five editions of poetry, published before the [[First Folio]]. Of those 15 title pages with Shakespeare's name hyphenated, 13 are on the title pages of just three plays, ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' ([[Early texts of Shakespeare's works|Q2]] 1598, Q3 1598, Q4 1608, and Q5 1615), ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (Q2 1598, Q3 1602, Q4 1605, Q5 1612, and Q6 1622), and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (Q2 1599, Q3 1604, Q4 1608, and Q5 1613).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hyphen is also present in one [[cast member|cast list]] and in six literary [[allusion]]s published between 1594 and 1623. This hyphen use is construed to indicate a pseudonym by most anti-Stratfordians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=255 (225)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that fictional descriptive names (such as "Master Shoe-tie" and "Sir Luckless Woo-all") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as "Tom Tell-truth" were also sometimes hyphenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=59–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons proposed for the use of "Shakespeare" as a pseudonym vary, usually depending upon the social status of the candidate. Aristocrats such as Derby and Oxford supposedly used pseudonyms because of a prevailing "[[stigma of print]]", a social convention that putatively restricted their literary works to private and courtly audiences—as opposed to commercial endeavours—at the risk of social disgrace if violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saunders|1951|pp=139–64}}; {{Harvnb|May|1980|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|May|2007|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of commoners, the reason was to avoid prosecution by the authorities: Bacon to avoid the consequences of advocating a more [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican form of government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=621}}: "The plays have to be pseudonymous because they are too dangerous, in a climate of [[Master of the Revels|censorship]] and monarchical control, to be published openly."&lt;/ref&gt; and Marlowe to avoid imprisonment or worse after faking his death and fleeing the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=393, 446}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of documentary evidence===
[[File:Poet-ape1616.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Extract from a book|Ben Jonson's "[[s:On Poet-Ape|On Poet-Ape]]" from his 1616 collected works is taken by some anti-Stratfordians to refer to Shakespeare.]]
Anti-Stratfordians say that nothing in the documentary record explicitly identifies Shakespeare as a writer;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the evidence instead supports a career as a businessman and real-estate investor; that any prominence he might have had in the London theatrical world (aside from his role as a front for the true author) was because of his money-lending, trading in theatrical properties, acting, and being a shareholder. They also believe that any evidence of a literary career was falsified as part of the effort to shield the true author's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=116–7 (103–4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the alternative authorship theories reject the surface meanings of Elizabethan and Jacobean references to Shakespeare as a playwright and instead look for ambiguities and codes. They identify him with such characters as the literary thief Poet-Ape in [[Ben Jonson]]'s poem of the same name and the foolish poetry-lover Gullio in the university play [[Parnassus plays|''The Return from Parnassus'']] (performed c. 1601). Such characters are taken as broad hints indicating that the London theatrical world knew Shakespeare was a front for an anonymous author. Similarly, praises of "Shakespeare" the writer, such as those found in the [[First Folio]], are explained as references to the real author's pen-name, not the man from Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=21, 170–1, 217}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumstances of Shakespeare's death===
Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 in Stratford, leaving a signed will to direct the disposal of his large estate. The language of the will is mundane and unpoetic and makes no mention of personal papers, books, poems, or the 18 plays that remained unpublished at the time of his death. Its only theatrical reference—monetary gifts to fellow actors to buy [[mourning ring]]s—was [[interlineation|interlined]] after the will had been written, casting suspicion on the authenticity of the bequests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=146–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monument images 1656 1904 1748.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Effigy of Shakespeare with right hand holding a quill pen and left hand resting on paper on a tasselled cushion, compared with a drawing of the effigy which shows both hands empty and resting on a stuffed sack or pillow|The effigy of Shakespeare's Stratford monument as it was portrayed in 1656, as it appears today, and as it was portrayed in 1748 before the restoration]]
Any public mourning of Shakespeare's death went unrecorded, and no eulogies or poems memorialising his death were published until seven years later as part of the [[book design|front matter]] in the First Folio of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|pp=166, 266–7}}, cites James Lardner, "Onward and Upward with the Arts: the Authorship Question", ''The New Yorker'', 11 April 1988, p. 103: "No obituaries marked his death in 1616, no public mourning. No note whatsoever was taken of the passing of the man who, if the attribution is correct, would have been the greatest playwright and poet in the history of the English language."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxfordian theory|Oxfordians]] think that the phrase "our ever-living Poet" (an epithet that commonly eulogised a deceased poet as having attained immortal literary fame), included in the dedication to [[Shakespeare's sonnets]] that were published in 1609, was a signal that the true poet had died by then. Oxford had died in 1604, five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=63}}; {{Harvnb|Price|2001|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare's funerary monument]] in Stratford consists of a demi-figure effigy of him with pen in hand and an attached plaque praising his abilities as a writer. The earliest printed image of the figure, in [[William Dugdale|Sir William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), differs greatly from its present appearance. Some authorship theorists argue that the figure originally portrayed a man clutching a sack of grain or wool that was later altered to help conceal the identity of the true author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|p=157}}; {{Harvnb|Matus|1991|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to put to rest such speculation, in 1924 [[Marion Spielmann|M. H. Spielmann]] published a painting of the monument that had been executed before the 1748 restoration, which showed it very similar to its present-day appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spielmann|1924|pp=23–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the image failed to achieve its intended effect, and in 2005 Oxfordian [[Richard Kennedy (author)|Richard Kennedy]] proposed that the monument was originally built to honour John Shakespeare, William's father, who by tradition was a "considerable dealer in wool".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vickers|2006|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case for Shakespeare's authorship==
Nearly all academic Shakespeareans believe that the author referred to as "Shakespeare" was the same William Shakespeare who was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 and who died there in 1616. He became an actor and shareholder in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (later the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]), the [[playing company]] that owned the [[Globe Theatre]], the [[Blackfriars Theatre]], and exclusive rights to produce Shakespeare's plays from 1594 to 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare was also allowed the use of the [[honorific]] "[[gentleman]]" after 1596 when his father was granted a [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref name="montague123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=123–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare scholars see no reason to suspect that the name was a pseudonym or that the actor was a front for the author: contemporary records identify Shakespeare as the writer, other playwrights such as [[Ben Jonson]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] came from similar backgrounds, and no contemporary is known to have expressed doubts about Shakespeare's authorship. While information about some aspects of Shakespeare's life is sketchy, this is true of many other playwrights of the time. Of some, next to nothing is known. Others, such as Jonson, Marlowe, and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], are more fully documented because of their education, close connections with the court, or brushes with the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|pp=265–6}}; {{Harvnb|Lang|2008|pp=29–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary scholars employ the same [[historical method|methodology]] to attribute works to the poet and playwright William Shakespeare as they use for other writers of the period: the historical record and [[stylometry|stylistic studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=163–4}}; {{Harvnb|Murphy|1964|p=4}}: "For the evidence that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon (1564–1616) wrote the works attributed to him is not only abundant but conclusive. It is of the kind, as [[E. K. Chambers|Sir Edmund Chambers]] puts it, 'which is ordinarily accepted as determining the authorship of early literature.{{'"}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=149}}: "Even the most partisan anti-Stratfordian or Oxfordian agrees that documentary evidence taken on its face value supports the case for William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon ... as author of the poems and plays"; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=xii–xiii, 10}},&lt;/ref&gt; and they say the argument that there is no evidence of Shakespeare's authorship is a form of fallacious logic known as ''[[argument from silence|argumentum ex silentio]]'', or argument from silence, since it takes the absence of evidence to be evidence of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1943|pp=37–8}},&lt;/ref&gt; They criticise the methods used to identify alternative candidates as unreliable and unscholarly, arguing that their subjectivity explains why at least as many as 80 candidates&lt;ref name="gross39"/&gt; have been proposed as the "true" author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|1953|p=165}}: "...in my opinion it is the basic unsoundness of method in this and other works of similar subject matter that explains how sincere and intelligent men arrive at such wild conclusions"; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=200}}; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=14}}; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the idea that Shakespeare revealed himself autobiographically in his work as a cultural [[anachronism]]: it has been a common authorial practice since the 19th century, but was not during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=305 (270)}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|pp=36–7}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, beginning at least with [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]] and [[John Keats|Keats]], critics frequently noted that the essence of Shakespeare's genius consisted in his ability to have his characters speak and act according to their given dramatic natures, rendering the determination of Shakespeare's authorial identity from his works that much more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1963|pp=259–60}}; {{Harvnb|Morita|1980|pp=22–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical evidence===
[[File:Lucrece 1616.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Title page of the narrative poem The Rape of Lucrece with Mr. prefixing Shakespeare's name|Shakespeare's honorific "Master" was represented as "Mr." on the title page of ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' (O5, 1616).]]
The historical record is unequivocal in assigning the authorship of the Shakespeare canon to a William Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1965|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the name appearing on the title pages of poems and plays, this name was given as that of a well-known writer at least 23 times during the lifetime of William Shakespeare of Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|1964|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several contemporaries corroborate the identity of the playwright as an actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=3–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and explicit contemporary documentary evidence attests that the Stratford citizen was also an actor under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1965|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598, [[Francis Meres]] named Shakespeare as a playwright and poet in his ''[[Palladis Tamia]]'', referring to him as one of the authors by whom the "English tongue is mightily enriched".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=93–4}}; {{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He names twelve plays written by Shakespeare, including four which were never published in quarto: ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', ''[[Love's Labour's Won]]'', and ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'', as well as ascribing to Shakespeare some of the plays that were published anonymously before 1598—''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''. He refers to Shakespeare's "sug[a]red Sonnets among his private friends" 11 years before the publication of the [[Shakespeare's sonnets|Sonnets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=85}}; {{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=93–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shakespear ye Player coatofarms.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Drawing of a coat of arms with a falcon and a spear|Shakespeare's father was granted a coat of arms in 1596, which in 1602 was unsuccessfully contested by [[Ralph Brooke]], who identified Shakespeare as a "player" (actor) in his complaint.]]
In the rigid [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|social structure]] of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare was entitled to use the honorific "gentleman" after his father was granted a coat of arms in 1596. This honorific was conventionally designated by the title [[Gentleman#William Harrison|"Master"]] or its abbreviations "Mr." or "M." prefixed to the name.&lt;ref name="montague123" /&gt; The title was included in many contemporary references to Shakespeare, including official and literary records, and identifies William Shakespeare of Stratford as the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=71, 75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from Shakespeare's lifetime include two official [[Stationers' Register|stationers' entries]]. One is dated 23 August 1600 and entered by [[Andrew Wise]] and [[William Aspley]]:

{{quote|Entred for their copies vnder the handes of the wardens. Twoo bookes. the one called: [[Much Ado About Nothing|Muche a Doo about nothinge]].

The other is dated 26 November 1607 and entered by [[Nathaniel Butter]] and John Busby:

This latter appeared on the title page of ''[[King Lear]]'' Q1 (1608) as "M. VVilliam Shake-speare, ''HIS'' True Chronicle History of the life and death of King ''Lear'', and his ''three Daughters''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's social status is also specifically referred to by his contemporaries in Epigram 159 by [[John Davies of Hereford]] in his ''The Scourge of Folly'' (1611): "To our English [[Terence]], Mr. Will. Shake-speare";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Epigram 92 by [[Thomas Freeman (poet)|Thomas Freeman]] in his ''Runne and A Great Caste'' (1614): "To Master W: Shakespeare";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|p=98}}; {{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in historian [[John Stow]]'s list of "Our moderne, and present excellent Poets" in his ''Annales'', printed posthumously in an edition by Edmund Howes (1615), which reads: "M. Willi. Shake-speare gentleman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Shakespeare's death, Ben Jonson explicitly identified William Shakespeare, gentleman, as the author in the title of his eulogy, [[s:To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us|"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us"]], published in the First Folio (1623).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=77–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets identified Shakespeare the gentleman as the author in the titles of their eulogies, also published in the First Folio: [[s:Upon the Lines and Life of the Famous Scenic Poet, Master William Shakespeare|"Upon the Lines and Life of the Famous Scenic Poet, Master William Shakespeare"]] by [[Hugh Holland]] and [[s:To the Memory of the Deceased Author, Master W. Shakespeare|"To the Memory of the Deceased Author, Master W. Shakespeare"]] by [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=155}}: "Throughout the First Folio, the author is called 'Mr.' or 'Maister,' a title exactly appropriate to the social rank of William Shakespeare."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary legal recognition===
Both explicit testimony by his contemporaries and strong circumstantial evidence of personal relationships with those who interacted with him as an actor and playwright support Shakespeare's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|Loughnane|2017|pp=417–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camden on Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Extract from a book praising several poets including Shakespeare|William Camden defended Shakespeare's right to bear [[Law of heraldic arms|heraldic arms]] about the same time he listed him as one of the great poets of his time.]] The historian and antiquary [[George Buck|Sir George Buc]] served as Deputy Master of the Revels from 1603 and as [[Master of the Revels]] from 1610 to 1622. His duties were to supervise and censor plays for the public theatres, arrange court performances of plays and, after 1606, to license plays for publication. Buc noted on the title page of ''George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield'' (1599), an anonymous play, that he had consulted Shakespeare on its authorship. Buc was meticulous in his efforts to attribute books and plays to the correct author,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eccles|1933|pp=459–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1607 he personally licensed ''King Lear'' for publication as written by "Master William Shakespeare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=254–5 (224–5)}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|1998|pp=79–82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1602, [[Ralph Brooke]], the [[York Herald]], accused Sir [[William Dethick]], the [[Garter King of Arms]], of elevating 23 unworthy persons to the [[gentry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=231}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was Shakespeare's father, who had applied for arms 34 years earlier but had to wait for the success of his son before they were granted in 1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|pp=227–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooke included a sketch of the Shakespeare arms, captioned "Shakespear ye Player by Garter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|pp=231–2}}; {{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The grants, including John Shakespeare's, were defended by Dethick and [[Clarenceux King of Arms]] [[William Camden]], the foremost antiquary of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Remaines Concerning Britaine''—published in 1605, but finished two years previously and before the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]] died in 1604—Camden names Shakespeare as one of the "most pregnant witts of these ages our times, whom succeeding ages may justly admire".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pendleton|1994|p=29}}: "...since he had, as Clarenceux King, responded less than three years earlier to Brooke's attack on the grant of arms to the father of 'Shakespeare ye Player' ... Camden thus was aware that the last name on his list was that of William Shakespeare of Stratford. The Camden reference, therefore, is exactly what the Oxfordians insist does not exist: an identification by a knowledgeable and universally respected contemporary that 'the Stratford man' was a writer of sufficient distinction to be ranked with (if after) [[Philip Sidney|Sidney]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[Samuel Daniel|Daniel]], [[Philemon Holland|Holland]], [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], [[Thomas Campion|Campion]], [[Michael Drayton|Drayton]], [[George Chapman|Chapman]], and [[John Marston (poet)|Marston]]. And the identification even fulfils the eccentric Oxfordian ground-rule that it be earlier than 1616."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by fellow actors, playwrights and writers===
[[File:Passionate Pilgrim title page comparison.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Two versions of a title page of an anthology of poems, one showing Shakespeare as the author, while a later, corrected version shows no author|The two versions of the title page of ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' (3rd ed., 1612)]]
Actors [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]] knew and worked with Shakespeare for more than 20 years. In the 1623 First Folio, they wrote that they had published the Folio "onely to keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, &amp; Fellow aliue, as was our &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/span&gt;, by humble offer of his playes". The playwright and poet Ben Jonson knew Shakespeare from at least 1598, when the Lord Chamberlain's Men performed Jonson's play ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' at the [[Curtain Theatre]] with Shakespeare as a cast member. The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden|William Drummond]] recorded Jonson's often contentious comments about his contemporaries: Jonson criticised Shakespeare as lacking "arte" and for mistakenly giving [[Bohemia]] a coast in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=17–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641, four years after Jonson's death, private notes written during his later life were published. In a comment intended for posterity (''Timber or Discoveries''), he criticises Shakespeare's casual approach to playwriting, but praises Shakespeare as a person: "I loved the man, and do honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any. He was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature; had an excellent fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=272–3 (239–40)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Ben Jonson, other playwrights wrote about Shakespeare, including some who sold plays to Shakespeare's company. Two of the three [[Parnassus plays]] produced at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], near the beginning of the 17th century mention Shakespeare as an actor, poet, and playwright who lacked a university education. In ''The First Part of the Return from Parnassus'', two separate characters refer to Shakespeare as "Sweet Mr. Shakespeare", and in ''The Second Part of the Return from Parnassus'' (1606), the anonymous playwright has the actor [[William Kempe|Kempe]] say to the actor [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]], "Few of the university men pen plays well&amp;nbsp;... Why here's our fellow ''Shakespeare'' puts them all down."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=7, 8, 11, 32}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=268–9 (236–7)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An edition of ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'', expanded with an additional nine poems written by the prominent English actor, playwright, and author [[Thomas Heywood]], was published by [[William Jaggard]] in 1612 with Shakespeare's name on the title page. Heywood protested this piracy in his ''Apology for Actors'' (1612), adding that the author was "much offended with M. Jaggard (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name." That Heywood stated with certainty that the author was unaware of the deception, and that Jaggard removed Shakespeare's name from unsold copies even though Heywood did not explicitly name him, indicates that Shakespeare was the offended author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=191}}; {{Harvnb|Montague|1963|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, in his poem "Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels" (1634), Heywood affectionately notes the nicknames his fellow playwrights had been known by. Of Shakespeare, he writes:
::Our modern poets to that pass are driven,
::Those names are curtailed which they first had given;
::And, as we wished to have their memories drowned,
::We scarcely can afford them half their sound. ...
::Mellifluous ''Shake-speare'', whose enchanting quill
::Commanded mirth or passion, was but ''Will''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=271 (238)}}; {{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|pp=218–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Playwright [[John Webster]], in his dedication to ''[[The White Devil]]'' (1612), wrote, "And lastly (without wrong last to be named), the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake-Speare, M. Decker, &amp; M. Heywood, wishing what I write might be read in their light", here using the abbreviation "M." to denote "Master", a form of address properly used of William Shakespeare of Stratford, who was titled a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=270 (238)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a verse letter to Ben Jonson dated to about 1608, [[Francis Beaumont]] alludes to several playwrights, including Shakespeare, about whom he wrote,
::... Here I would let slip
::(If I had any in me) scholarship,
::And from all learning keep these lines as clear
::as Shakespeare's best are, which our heirs shall hear
::Preachers apt to their auditors to show
::how far sometimes a mortal man may go
::by the dim light of Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=271 (238–9)}}; {{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|p=224}}; {{Harvnb|Nicholl|2008|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare's death—the historical perspective===
[[File:Shakespeare monument plaque.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Commemorative plaque|The inscription on Shakespeare's monument]]
The [[Shakespeare's funerary monument|monument to Shakespeare]], erected in Stratford before 1623, bears a plaque with an inscription identifying Shakespeare as a writer. The first two Latin lines translate to "In judgment a Pylian, in genius a Socrates, in art a Maro, the earth covers him, the people mourn him, Olympus possesses him", referring to [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], [[Socrates]], [[Virgil]], and [[Twelve Olympians|Mount Olympus]]. The monument was not only referred to in the First Folio, but other early 17th-century records identify it as being a memorial to Shakespeare and transcribe the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (3)}}; {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir William Dugdale also included the inscription in his ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), but the engraving was done from a sketch made in 1634 and, like other portrayals of monuments in his work, is not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|1997|pp=168, 173}}: "While Hollar conveyed the general impressions suggested by Dugdale's sketch, few of the details were transmitted with accuracy. Indeed, Dugdale's sketch gave Hollar few details to work with ... As with other sketches in his collection, Dugdale made no attempt to draw a facial likeness, but appears to have sketched one of his standard faces to depict a man with facial hair. Consequently, Hollar invented the facial features for Shakespeare. The conclusion is obvious: in the absence of an accurate and detailed model, Hollar freely improvised his image of Shakespeare's monument. That improvisation is what disqualifies the engraving's value as authoritative evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's will, executed on 25 March 1616, bequeaths "to my fellows John Hemynge [[Richard Burbage]] and Henry Cundell 26 [[shilling (English coin)|shilling]] 8 [[penny (English coin)|pence]] apiece to buy them [mourning] rings". Numerous public records, including the royal patent of 19 May 1603 that [[charter]]ed the King's Men, establish that Phillips, Heminges, Burbage, and Condell were fellow actors in the King's Men with William Shakespeare; two of them later edited his collected plays. Anti-Stratfordians have cast suspicion on these bequests, which were [[interlineation|interlined]], and claim that they were added later as part of a conspiracy. However, the will was proved in the [[Prerogative Court]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ([[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]]) in London on 22 June 1616, and the original was copied into the court register with the bequests intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]] was the first poet to mention in print the deaths of Shakespeare and [[Francis Beaumont]] in his 1620 book of poems ''The Praise of Hemp-seed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both had died four years earlier, less than two months apart. Ben Jonson wrote a short poem "To the Reader" commending the First Folio engraving of Shakespeare by [[Martin Droeshout|Droeshout]] as a good likeness. Included in the prefatory [[commendatory verse]]s was Jonson's lengthy eulogy "To the memory of my beloved, the Author Mr. William Shakespeare: and what he hath left us" in which he identifies Shakespeare as a playwright, a poet, and an actor, and writes:

::Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were
::To see thee in our waters yet appear,
::And make those flights upon the banks of Thames,
::That so did take Eliza, and our James!

Here Jonson links the author to Stratford's river, the Avon, and confirms his appearances at the courts of Elizabeth I and James I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|pp=121, 220}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] wrote the elegy "To the Memory of the Deceased Author Master W. Shakespeare" that was published in the Folio, in which he refers to "thy Stratford Moniment". Brought up four miles from Stratford-upon-Avon in the 1590s, Digges was the stepson of Shakespeare's friend, Thomas Russell, whom Shakespeare in his will designated as overseer to the executors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Basse]] wrote an elegy entitled "On Mr. Wm. Shakespeare" sometime between 1616 and 1623, in which he suggests that Shakespeare should have been buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] next to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], Beaumont, and Spenser. This poem circulated very widely in manuscript and survives today in more than two dozen contemporary copies; several of these have a fuller, variant title "On Mr. William Shakespeare, he died in April 1616", which unambiguously specifies that the reference is to Shakespeare of Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|2002|pp=111–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence for Shakespeare's authorship from his works===

[[File:Shakespeare's grammar school.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of the Stratford grammar school, showing the interior of a classroom with student desks and benches|The [[King Edward VI School Stratford-upon-Avon|King Edward VI Grammar School]] at Stratford-upon-Avon]]

There is no record that any contemporary of Shakespeare referred to him as a learned writer or scholar. Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont both refer to his lack of classical learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=64, 171}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a university-trained playwright wrote the plays, it is hard to explain the many [[classical antiquity|classical]] blunders in Shakespeare. Not only does he mistake the [[scansion]] of many classical names, in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' he has Greeks and Trojans citing [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] a thousand years before their births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lang|2008|pp=36–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Willinsky suggests that most of Shakespeare's classical allusions were drawn from [[Thomas Cooper (bishop)|Thomas Cooper]]'s ''Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae'' (1565), since a number of errors in that work are replicated in several of Shakespeare's plays,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willinsky|1994|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a copy of this book had been bequeathed to Stratford Grammar School by John Bretchgirdle for "the common use of scholars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Velz|2000|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics such as [[Samuel Johnson]] remarked that Shakespeare's genius lay not in his erudition, but in his "vigilance of observation and accuracy of distinction which books and precepts cannot confer; from this almost all original and native excellence proceeds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1969|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the omnivorous reading imputed to Shakespeare by critics in later years is exaggerated, and he may well have absorbed much learning from conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=81}}:"As has often been pointed out, if Shakespeare had read all the books claimed to have influenced him, he would never have had time to write a word of his own. He probably picked up many of his ideas from conversation. If he needed legal knowledge it was easier to extract this from Inns-of-Court drinkers in the Devil Tavern than to search volumes of precedents."&lt;/ref&gt; And contrary to previous claims—both scholarly and popular—about his vocabulary and word coinage, the evidence of vocabulary size and word-use frequency places Shakespeare with his contemporaries, rather than apart from them. Computerized comparisons with other playwrights demonstrate that his vocabulary is indeed large, but only because the canon of his surviving plays is larger than those of his contemporaries and because of the broad range of his characters, settings, and themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|2011|pp=58–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's plays differ from those of the [[University Wits]] in that they avoid ostentatious displays of the writer's mastery of Latin or of [[Poetics (Aristotle)|classical principles of drama]], with the exceptions of co-authored plays such as the ''Henry VI'' series and ''Titus Andronicus''. Instead, his classical allusions rely on the Elizabethan grammar school curriculum. The curriculum began with [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily]]'s Latin grammar ''Rudimenta Grammatices'' and progressed to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Livy]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Plautus]], [[Terence]], and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], all of whom are quoted and echoed in the Shakespearean canon. Almost uniquely among his peers, Shakespeare's plays are full of phrases from grammar school texts and [[pedagogy]], together with caricatures of schoolmasters. Lily's ''Grammar'' is referred to in a number of plays, including ''Titus Andronicus'' (4.10), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1.1), ''Love's Labour's Lost'' (5.1), ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (2.3), and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (4.1). Shakespeare alluded not only to grammar school but also to the petty school that children attended at age 5 to 7 to learn to read, a prerequisite for grammar school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=62–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Two Noble Kinsmen by John Fletcher William Shakespeare 1634.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Title page of a play showing the co-authors John Fletcher and William Shakespeare|Title page of the 1634 quarto of ''The Two Noble Kinsmen'' by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and Shakespeare]]
Beginning in 1987, [[Ward Elliott]], who was sympathetic to the Oxfordian theory, and Robert J. Valenza supervised a continuing stylometric study that used computer programs to compare Shakespeare's stylistic habits to the works of 37 authors who had been proposed as the true author. The study, known as the Claremont Shakespeare Clinic, was last held in the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Shakespeare Clinic|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tests determined that Shakespeare's work shows consistent, countable, profile-fitting patterns, suggesting that he was a single individual, not a committee, and that he used fewer relative clauses and more hyphens, [[Iambic pentameter#Rhythmic variation|feminine endings]], and [[enjambment|run-on lines]] than most of the writers with whom he was compared. The result determined that none of the other tested claimants' work could have been written by Shakespeare, nor could Shakespeare have been written by them, eliminating all of the claimants whose known works have survived—including Oxford, Bacon, and Marlowe—as the true authors of the Shakespeare canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Elliott|Valenza|2004|p=331}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's style evolved over time in keeping with changes in literary trends. His late plays, such as ''The Winter's Tale'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', and [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], are written in a style similar to that of other Jacobean playwrights and radically different from that of his Elizabethan-era plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=288 (253)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after the King's Men began using the Blackfriars Theatre for performances in 1609, Shakespeare's plays were written to accommodate a smaller stage with more music, dancing, and more evenly divided acts to allow for trimming the candles used for stage lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=283–6 (249–51)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Keith Simonton, who researches the factors involved in musical and literary creativity, especially Shakespeare's, concludes "beyond a shadow of a doubt" that the consensus play chronology is roughly the correct order, and that Shakespeare's works exhibit gradual stylistic development consistent with that of other artistic geniuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simonton|2004|p=203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Simonton's study, published in 2004, examined the correlation between the thematic content of Shakespeare's plays and the political context in which they would have been written. When backdated two years, the [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|mainstream chronologies]] yield substantial correlations between the two, whereas the [[Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship#Dates of composition|alternative chronologies proposed by Oxfordians]] display no relationship regardless of the time lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simonton|2004|p=210}}: "If the Earl of Oxford wrote these plays, then he not only displayed minimal stylistic development over the course of his career (Elliot &amp; Valenza, 2000), but he also wrote in monastic isolation from the key events of his day."&lt;/ref&gt; Simonton, who declared his Oxfordian sympathies in the article and had expected the results to support Oxford's authorship, concluded that "that expectation was proven wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simonton|2004|p=210, note 4}}: "For the record, I find the traditional attribution to William Shakespeare of Stratford highly improbable ... I really would like Edward de Vere to be the author of the plays and poems ... Thus, I had hoped that the current study might strengthen the case on behalf of the Oxfordian attribution. I think that expectation was proven wrong."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare co-authored half of his last 10 plays, collaborating closely with other playwrights. Oxfordians claim that those plays were finished by others after the death of Oxford. However, textual evidence from the late plays indicates that Shakespeare's collaborators were not always aware of what Shakespeare had done in a previous scene, and that they were following a rough outline rather than working from an unfinished script left by a long-dead playwright. For example, in ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' (1612–1613), written with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], Shakespeare has two characters meet and leaves them on stage at the end of one scene, yet Fletcher has them act as if they were meeting for the first time in the following scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=293–4 (258–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bardolatry and early doubt===
{{See also|Shakespeare's reputation}}
Despite adulatory tributes attached to his works, Shakespeare was not considered the world's greatest writer in the century and a half following his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=30 (29)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation was that of a good playwright and poet among many others of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=30–3 (29–32)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s plays dominated popular taste after the theatres reopened in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration Era]] in 1660, with Ben Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays vying for second place. After the actor [[David Garrick]] mounted the [[Shakespeare Jubilee|Shakespeare Stratford Jubilee]] in 1769, Shakespeare led the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelpearl|1990|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding a handful of minor 18th-century [[satirical]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] references,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedman|Friedman|1957|pp=1–4}} quoted in {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=56}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there was no suggestion in this period that anyone else might have written the works.&lt;ref name="Bate 1998 73"/&gt; The authorship question emerged only after Shakespeare had come to be regarded as the English [[national poet]] and a unique genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=99–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 19th century, adulation was in full swing, with Shakespeare singled out as a transcendent genius, a phenomenon for which [[George Bernard Shaw]] coined the term "[[bardolatry]]" in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2003|p=329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the century his genius was noted as much for its intellectual as for its imaginative strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since what was known about his life seemed to reveal Shakespeare as an untutored rustic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; uneasiness began to emerge over the dissonance between Shakespeare's reputation and his biography.&lt;ref name="shapiro87" /&gt; Although still convinced that Shakespeare was the author of the works, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] expressed this disjunction in a lecture in 1846 by allowing that he could not reconcile Shakespeare's verse with the image of a jovial actor and theatre manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=19}}: "The Egyptian verdict of the Shakspeare Societies comes to mind; that he was a jovial actor and manager. I can not marry this fact to his verse."&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[historical criticism]], which challenged the authorial unity of [[Homer]]'s [[Homeric Question|epics]] and the historicity of the [[Bible]], also fuelled emerging puzzlement over Shakespeare's authorship, which in one critic's view was "an accident waiting to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Strauss]]'s investigation of [[Quest for the historical Jesus|the biography of Jesus]], which shocked the public with its scepticism of the historical accuracy of the Gospels, influenced the secular debate about Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=83–9 (73–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Samuel Mosheim Schmucker]] endeavoured to rebut Strauss's doubts about the [[Christ myth theory|historicity of Christ]] by applying the same techniques satirically to the records of Shakespeare's life in his ''Historic Doubts Respecting Shakespeare, Illustrating Infidel Objections Against the Bible''. Schmucker, who never doubted that Shakespeare was Shakespeare, unwittingly anticipated and rehearsed many of the later arguments for alternative authorship candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2010|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=86–9 (76–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open dissent and the first alternative candidate===
[[File:Delia-Bacon (1811-1859).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Seated woman in shawl and bonnet.|Delia Bacon was the first writer to formulate a comprehensive theory that Shakespeare was not the writer of the works attributed to him.]]
Shakespeare's authorship was first openly questioned in the pages of [[Joseph C. Hart]]'s ''[[The Romance of Yachting]]'' (1848). Hart argued that the plays contained evidence that many different authors had worked on them. Four years later Dr. Robert W. Jameson anonymously published "Who Wrote Shakespeare?" in the ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'', expressing similar views. In 1856 [[Delia Bacon]]'s unsigned article "William Shakspeare and His Plays; An Enquiry Concerning Them" appeared in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=21–3, 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1845, Delia Bacon had theorised that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were actually written by a group under the leadership of Sir Francis Bacon, with [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] as the main writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose purpose was to inculcate an advanced political and philosophical system for which they themselves could not publicly assume responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=97–8, 106–9 (87, 95–7)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon was the first single alternative author proposed in print, by William Henry Smith, in a pamphlet published in September 1856 (''Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakspeare's Plays? A Letter to Lord Ellesmere'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=119–20 (105–6)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Delia Bacon published a book outlining her theory: ''The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, Judge Nathaniel Holmes of Kentucky published the 600-page ''The Authorship of Shakespeare'' supporting Smith's theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea began to spread widely. By 1884 the question had produced more than 250 books, and Smith asserted that the war against the Shakespeare hegemony had almost been won by the [[Baconian theory|Baconians]] after a 30-year battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=404}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the Francis Bacon Society was founded in England to promote the theory. The society still survives and publishes a journal, ''Baconiana'', to further its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These arguments against Shakespeare's authorship were answered by academics. In 1857 the English critic [[George Henry Townsend]] published ''William Shakespeare Not an Impostor'', criticising what he called the slovenly scholarship, false premises, specious parallel passages, and erroneous conclusions of the earliest proponents of alternative authorship candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for proof===
[[File:Cipher wheel.jpg|thumb|alt=A long strip of canvas is stretched between two wheels; pages of text are pasted to the canvas.|[[Orville Ward Owen]] constructed a "cipher wheel" that he used to search for hidden [[ciphers]] he believed [[Francis Bacon]] had left in [[Shakespeare's works]].]]
In 1853, with the help of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Delia Bacon travelled to England to search for evidence to support her theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of performing archival research, she sought to unearth buried manuscripts, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade a caretaker to open Bacon's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=113–4 (100–1)}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed she had deciphered instructions in Bacon's letters to look beneath Shakespeare's Stratford gravestone for papers that would prove the works were Bacon's, but after spending several nights in the [[chancel]] trying to summon the requisite courage, she left without prising up the stone slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=391–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciphers became important to the Baconian theory, as they would later to the advocacy of other authorship candidates, with books such as [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]]'s ''The Great Cryptogram'' (1888) promoting the approach. Dr. [[Orville Ward Owen]] constructed a "cipher wheel", a 1,000-foot strip of canvas on which he had pasted the works of Shakespeare and other writers and mounted on two parallel wheels so he could quickly collate pages with key words as he turned them for decryption.&lt;ref name="wadsworth57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=57}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=412}}; {{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|pp=154–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his multi-volume ''Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Story'' (1893), he claimed to have discovered Bacon's autobiography embedded in Shakespeare's plays, including the revelation that Bacon was the secret son of Queen Elizabeth, thus providing more motivation to conceal his authorship from the public.&lt;ref name="wadsworth57" /&gt;

[[File:Shakespeare trial 1916.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A page from a 1916 newspaper with headline "Aha! Sherlock is outdone!"|A feature in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on the 1916 trial of Shakespeare's authorship. From left: George Fabyan; Judge Tuthill; Shakespeare and Bacon; [[William Nicholas Selig|William Selig]].]]
Perhaps because of Francis Bacon's legal background, both mock and real jury trials figured in attempts to prove claims for Bacon, and later for Oxford. The first mock trial was conducted over 15 months in 1892–93, and the results of the debate were published in the Boston monthly ''The Arena''. Ignatius Donnelly was one of the [[plaintiff]]s, while [[Frederick James Furnivall|F. J. Furnivall]] formed part of the defence. The 25-member jury, which included [[Henry George]], [[Edmund Gosse]], and [[Henry Irving]], came down heavily in favour of William Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=55–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, Judge Richard Tuthill presided over a real trial in Chicago. A film producer brought an action against a Baconian advocate, [[George Fabyan]]. He argued that Fabyan's advocacy of Bacon threatened the profits expected from a forthcoming film about Shakespeare. The judge determined that ciphers identified by Fabyan's analysts proved that Francis Bacon was the author of the Shakespeare canon, awarding Fabyan $5,000 in damages. In the ensuing uproar, Tuthill rescinded his decision, and another judge, Frederick A. Smith, dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=199}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=74–5}}; {{Harvnb|Niederkorn|2004|pp=82–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Owen claimed he had decoded instructions revealing that a box containing proof of Bacon's authorship had been buried in the [[River Wye]] near [[Chepstow Castle]] on the [[Duke of Beaufort]]'s property. His dredging machinery failed to retrieve any concealed manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=144–5 (127)}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=63–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year his former assistant, [[Elizabeth Wells Gallup]], financed by George Fabyan, likewise travelled to England. She believed she had decoded a message, by means of a [[Bacon's cipher|biliteral cipher]], revealing that Bacon's secret manuscripts were hidden behind panels in [[Canonbury|Canonbury Tower]] in [[Islington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=144 (127)}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; None were found. Two years later, the American humorist [[Mark Twain]] publicly revealed his long-held anti-Stratfordian belief in ''[[Is Shakespeare Dead?]]'' (1909), favouring Bacon as the true author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=149–58 (130–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s [[Walter Conrad Arensberg]] became convinced that Bacon had willed the key to his cipher to the [[Rosicrucians]]. He thought this society was still active, and that its members communicated with each under the aegis of the Church of England. On the basis of cryptograms he detected in the sixpenny tickets of admission to Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, he deduced that both Bacon and his mother were secretly buried, together with the original manuscripts of Shakespeare's plays, in the Lichfield [[Chapter house]] in [[Staffordshire]]. He unsuccessfully petitioned the [[Dean of Lichfield]] to allow him both to photograph and excavate the obscure grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=80–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=422–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Bauer was convinced that Bacon's manuscripts had been imported into [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1653, and could be found in the Bruton Vault at [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. She gained permission in the late 1930s to excavate, but authorities quickly withdrew her permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=88–9}}; {{Harvnb|Garber|1997|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Roderick Eagle was allowed to open the tomb of [[Edmund Spenser]] to search for proof that Bacon was Shakespeare, but found only some old bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other candidates emerge===
By the end of the 19th century other candidates had begun to receive attention. In 1895 [[Wilbur G. Zeigler]], an attorney, published the novel ''It Was Marlowe: A Story of the Secret of Three Centuries'', whose premise was that Christopher Marlowe did not die in 1593, but rather survived to write Shakespeare's plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=446}}; {{Harvnb|Zeigler|1895|pp=v–xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] who, in the February 1902 issue of ''[[Current Literature]]'', wrote an article based upon his stylometric work titled "Did Marlowe write Shakespeare?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Bleibtreu]], a German literary critic, advanced the nomination of [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland]], in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=106–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland's candidacy enjoyed a brief flowering, supported by a number of other authors over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|1966|pp=730–731}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Stratfordians unaffiliated to any specific authorship candidate also began to appear. [[George Greenwood]], a British barrister, sought to disqualify William Shakespeare from the authorship in ''The Shakespeare Problem Restated'' (1908), but did not support any alternative authors, thereby encouraging the search for candidates other than Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1908}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=99–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John M. Robertson]] published ''The Baconian Heresy: A Confutation'' in 1913, refuting the contention that Shakespeare had expert legal knowledge by showing that legalisms pervaded Elizabethan and Jacobean literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robertson|1913}}; {{Harvnb|Vickers|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, on the three-hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's death, [[Henry Watterson]], the long-time editor of ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'', wrote a widely syndicated front-page feature story supporting the Marlovian theory and, like Zeigler, created a fictional account of how it might have happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wall|1956|pp=293–294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the First World War, Professor [[Abel Lefranc]], an authority on French and English literature, argued the case for William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, as the author based on biographical evidence he had gleaned from the plays and poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=101–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shakespeare Identified cover.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Cover of a book with title and author.|J. Thomas Looney's ''Shakespeare Identified'' (1920) made Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the top authorship claimant.]]
With the appearance of [[J. Thomas Looney]]'s ''Shakespeare Identified'' (1920),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Looney|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, quickly ascended as the most popular alternative author.&lt;ref name="may222"&gt;{{Harvnb|May|2004|p=222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Looney and Greenwood founded the [[Shakespeare Fellowship]], an international organisation to promote discussion and debate on the authorship question, which later changed its mission to propagate the Oxfordian theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=218 (192)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 Archie Webster published "Was Marlowe the Man?" in ''The National Review'', like Zeigler, Mendenhall and Watterson proposing that Marlowe wrote the works of Shakespeare, and arguing in particular that the Sonnets were an autobiographical account of his survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Webster|1923|pp=81–6}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 [[Allardyce Nicoll]] announced the discovery of a manuscript that appeared to establish [[James Wilmot]] as the earliest proponent of Bacon's authorship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicoll|1932|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but recent investigations have identified the manuscript as a forgery probably designed to revive Baconian theory in the face of Oxford's ascendancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=11–4, 319–20 (11–3, 284)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another authorship candidate emerged in 1943 when writer [[Alden Brooks]], in his ''Will Shakspere and the Dyer's hand'', argued for Sir [[Edward Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1943}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Six years earlier Brooks had dismissed Shakespeare as the playwright by proposing that his role in the deception was to act as an Elizabethan "play broker", [[broker]]ing the plays and poems on behalf of his various principals, the real authors. This view, of Shakespeare as a commercial go-between, was later adapted by Oxfordians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=135, 139–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War, Oxfordism and anti-Stratfordism declined in popularity and visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=228–9 (200–1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Copious archival research had failed to confirm Oxford or anyone else as the true author, and publishers lost interest in books advancing the same theories based on alleged circumstantial evidence. To bridge the evidentiary gap, both Oxfordians and Baconians began to argue that hidden clues and allusions in the Shakespeare canon had been placed there by their candidate for the benefit of future researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=220–1 (194)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To revive interest in Oxford, in 1952 Dorothy and [[Charlton Greenwood Ogburn|Charlton Ogburn Sr.]] published the 1,300-page ''This Star of England'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ogburn|Ogburn|1952}}.&lt;/ref&gt; now regarded as a classic Oxfordian text.&lt;ref name="wadsworth127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that the "fair youth" of the sonnets was [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], the offspring of a love affair between Oxford and the Queen, and that the "Shakespeare" plays were written by Oxford to memorialise the passion of that affair. This became known as the "[[Prince Tudor theory]]", which postulates that the Queen's illicit offspring and his father's authorship of the Shakespeare canon were covered up as an Elizabethan state secret. The Ogburns found many parallels between Oxford's life and the works, particularly in ''[[Hamlet]]'', which they characterised as "straight biography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A brief upsurge of enthusiasm ensued, resulting in the establishment of the Shakespeare Oxford Society in the US in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=228 (201)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Broadway press agent [[Calvin Hoffman]] revived the Marlovian theory with the publication of ''The Murder of the Man Who Was "Shakespeare"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he went to England to search for documentary evidence about Marlowe that he thought might be buried in his literary patron [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Sir Thomas Walsingham]]'s tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing was found.

A series of critical academic books and articles held in check any appreciable growth of anti-Stratfordism, as academics attacked its methodology as unscholarly and the conclusions as ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=229 (202)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Cryptography|cryptologists]] [[William F. Friedman|William]] and [[Elizebeth Friedman]] won the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] Literary Prize in 1955 for a study of the arguments that the works of Shakespeare contain hidden ciphers. The study disproved all claims that the works contain ciphers, and was condensed and published as ''The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined'' (1957). Soon after, four major works were issued surveying the history of the anti-Stratfordian phenomenon from a mainstream perspective: ''The Poacher from Stratford'' (1958), by [[Frank W. Wadsworth|Frank Wadsworth]], ''Shakespeare and His Betters'' (1958), by Reginald Churchill, ''The Shakespeare Claimants'' (1962), by H. N. Gibson, and ''Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy'' (1962), by George L. McMichael and Edgar M. Glenn. In 1959 the ''[[ABA Journal|American Bar Association Journal]]'' published a series of articles and letters on the authorship controversy, later anthologised as ''Shakespeare Cross-Examination'' (1961). In 1968 the newsletter of The Shakespeare Oxford Society reported that "the missionary or evangelical spirit of most of our members seems to be at a low ebb, dormant, or non-existent".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=228–9 (201)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, membership in the society stood at 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=230 (202)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in the mainstream media===

The freelance writer [[Charlton Ogburn|Charlton Ogburn Jr.]], elected president of The Shakespeare Oxford Society in 1976, promptly began a campaign to bypass the academic establishment; he believed it to be an "entrenched authority" that aimed to "outlaw and silence dissent in a supposedly free society". He proposed fighting for public recognition by portraying Oxford as a candidate on equal footing with Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=230–3 (202–5)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Ogburn published his 900-page ''The Mysterious William Shakespeare: the Myth and the Reality'', and by framing the issue as one of fairness in the atmosphere of conspiracy that permeated America after [[Watergate]], he used the media to circumnavigate [[academia]] and appeal directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=232–3 (204–5)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ogburn's efforts secured Oxford the place as the most popular alternative candidate. He also kick-started the modern revival of the Oxfordian movement by adopting a policy of seeking publicity through moot court trials, media debates, television, and other outlets. These methods were later extended to the Internet, including [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=47}}; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=48, 72, 124}}; {{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=620}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=430–40}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=229–49 (202–19)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minerva Britanna Peacham device.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Title page of a book with a drawing of a hand writing a motto; a curtain hides the body of the writer.|A device from [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]]'s ''Minerva Britanna'' (1612) has been used by Baconians and Oxfordians alike as coded evidence for concealed authorship of the Shakespeare canon.&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;[[#{{harvid|Ross}}|Ross (''Oxfordian Myths'')]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ogburn believed that academics were best challenged by recourse to law, and on 25 September 1987 three [[judge|justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] convened a one-day [[moot court]] at the [[United Methodist Church|Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church]], to hear the Oxfordian case. The trial was structured so that literary experts would not be represented, but the burden of proof was on the Oxfordians. The justices determined that the case was based on a conspiracy theory, and that the reasons given for this conspiracy were both incoherent and unpersuasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=242–3 (212–3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ogburn took the verdict as a "clear defeat", Oxfordian columnist [[Joseph Sobran]] thought the trial had effectively dismissed any other Shakespeare authorship contender from the public mind and provided legitimacy for Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=234–6 (206–8)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A retrial was organised the next year in the United Kingdom to potentially reverse the decision. Presided over by three [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]], the court was held in the [[Inner Temple]] in London on 26 November 1988. On this occasion Shakespearean scholars argued their case, and the outcome confirmed the American verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=236–7 (208–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the rising visibility of the authorship question, media coverage of the controversy increased, with many outlets focusing on the [[Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship|Oxfordian]] theory. In 1989 the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] television show [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|''Frontline'']] broadcast "The Shakespeare Mystery", exposing the interpretation of Oxford-as-Shakespeare to more than 3.5 million viewers in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=238 (209)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1992 by a three-hour ''Frontline'' teleconference, "Uncovering Shakespeare: an Update", moderated by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=238 (209–10)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' published a debate between Tom Bethell, presenting the case for Oxford,&lt;ref name="Bethell1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irvin Leigh Matus]], presenting the case for Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar print debate took place in 1999 in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' under the title "The Ghost of Shakespeare". Beginning in the 1990s Oxfordians and other anti-Stratfordians increasingly turned to the Internet to promulgate their theories, including creating several articles on Wikipedia about the candidates and the arguments, to such an extent that a survey of the field in 2010 judged that its presence on Wikipedia "puts to shame anything that ever appeared in standard resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=246–8 (216–8)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2007 the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition issued an [[internet petition]], the [[Declaration of Reasonable Doubt|"Declaration of Reasonable Doubt About the Identity of William Shakespeare"]], coinciding with [[Brunel University]]'s announcement of a one-year Master of Arts programme in Shakespeare authorship studies (since suspended). The coalition intended to enlist broad public support so that by 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, the academic Shakespeare establishment would be forced to acknowledge that legitimate grounds for doubting Shakespeare's authorship exist, a goal that was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=248–9 (218–9)}}; {{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|pp=171–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,200 signatures were collected by the end of 2007, and as of 23 April 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death and the self-imposed deadline, the document had been signed by 3,348 people, including 573 self-described current and former academics. On 22 April 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a survey of 265 American Shakespeare professors on the Shakespeare authorship question. To the question of whether there is good reason to question Shakespeare's authorship, 6 per cent answered "yes", and 11 percent "possibly". When asked their opinion of the topic, 61 per cent chose "A theory without convincing evidence" and 32 per cent chose "A waste of time and classroom distraction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niederkorn|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[James S. Shapiro]] surveyed the authorship question in ''Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?'' Approaching the subject sociologically, Shapiro found its origins to be grounded in a vein of traditional scholarship going back to [[Edmond Malone]], and criticised academia for ignoring the topic, which was, he argued, tantamount to surrendering the field to anti-Stratfordians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=4, 42 (5, 39)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro links the revival of the Oxfordian movement to the cultural changes that followed the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate conspiracy scandal]] that increased the willingness of the public to believe in governmental conspiracies and cover-ups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=231–32, 239–41 (203–4, 210–2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Sawyer suggests that the increased presence of anti-Stratfordian ideas in popular culture can be attributed to the proliferation of [[9/11 conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] since the [[9/11]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sawyer|2013|pp=28–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, ''[[Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]],'' a feature film based on the [[Prince Tudor theory|"Prince Tudor"]] variant of the Oxfordian theory, written by [[John Orloff]] and directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. De Vere is portrayed as a literary [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who becomes the lover of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], with whom he sires Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, only to discover that he himself may be the Queen's son by an earlier lover. He eventually sees his suppressed plays performed through the front man, William Shakespeare, who is portrayed as an opportunistic actor and the movie's comic foil. Oxford agrees to Elizabeth's demand that he remain anonymous as part of a bargain for saving their son from execution as a traitor for supporting the [[Essex Rebellion]] against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Syme|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months before the release of the film, the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]] launched a campaign attacking anti-Stratfordian arguments by means of a web site, ''60 Minutes With Shakespeare: Who Was William Shakespeare?'', containing short audio contributions recorded by actors, scholars and other celebrities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was quickly followed by a rebuttal from the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|pp=233, 278.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Paul Edmondson and [[Stanley Wells]] have written a short e-book, ''Shakespeare Bites Back'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmondson|Wells|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited a longer book of essays by prominent academic Shakespeareans, ''Shakespeare Beyond Doubt'' (2013), in which Edmondson says that they had "decided to lead the Shakespeare Authorship Campaign because we thought more questions would be asked by our visitors and students because of ''Anonymous'', because we saw, and continue to see, something very wrong with the way doubts about Shakespeare's authorship are being given academic credibility by the Universities of Concordia and Brunel, and because we felt that merely ignoring the anti-Shakespearians was inappropriate at a time when their popular voice was likely to be gaining more ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|p=229.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative candidates==
{{Main|List of Shakespeare authorship candidates}}

While more than 80 historical figures have been nominated at one time or another as the true author of the Shakespearean canon,&lt;ref name="gross39" /&gt; only a few of these claimants have attracted significant attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sole candidates, various "group" theories have also achieved a notable level of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=18–9, 72–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group theories===
Various group theories of Shakespearean authorship were proposed as early as the mid-19th century. The first published book focused entirely on the authorship debate, ''The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded'', by Delia Bacon, appeared in 1857. It proposed the first "group theory", attributing the works to "a little clique of disappointed and defeated politicians" led by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] which included Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and perhaps [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]], and [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=107 (95)}}; {{harvnb|Holderness|2013|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group theory was also described in [[Gilbert Slater]]'s ''The Seven Shakespeares'' (1931), in which he theorised that the works were written by seven different authors: Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Raleigh, [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Mary Sidney|Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke]], and [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffman|1960|pp=vii–ix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, Edward de Vere, Francis Bacon, Roger Manners, William Herbert and Mary Sidney were suggested as members of a group referred to as "The Oxford Syndicate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=72–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Marlowe, [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] and [[Thomas Nashe]] have also been proposed as participants. Some variants of the group theory also include William Shakespeare of Stratford as the group's manager, broker and/or front man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=18–9, 25, 27, 90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sir Francis Bacon===
{{Main|Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship}}&lt;!---This is a SUMMARY: detailed additions should be placed in the article on 'Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship'---&gt;
[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with side view of a bearded man wearing a tall hat; the face looks out of the picture.|[[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626)]]
The leading candidate of the 19th century was one of the great intellectual figures of Jacobean England, [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]], a lawyer, philosopher, essayist and scientist. Bacon's candidacy relies upon historical and literary conjectures, as well as alleged cryptographical revelations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=23–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon was proposed as sole author by William Henry Smith in 1856 and as a co-author by Delia Bacon in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|pp=34–5, 70–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith compared passages such as Bacon's "Poetry is nothing else but feigned history" with Shakespeare's "The truest poetry is the most feigning" (''[[As You Like It]]'', 3.3.19–20), and Bacon's "He wished him not to shut the gate of your Majesty's mercy" with Shakespeare's "The gates of mercy shall be all shut up" (''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', 3.3.10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=119–20 (105–6)}}; {{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Delia Bacon argued that there were hidden political meanings in the plays and parallels between those ideas and Bacon's known works. She proposed him as the leader of a group of disaffected philosopher-politicians who tried to promote republican ideas to counter the despotism of the Tudor-Stuart monarchies through the medium of the public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=387, 389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Bacon supporters found similarities between a great number of specific phrases and aphorisms from the plays and those written by Bacon in his [[waste book]], the ''Promus''. In 1883 Mrs. Henry Pott edited Bacon's ''Promus'' and found 4,400 parallels of thought or expression between Shakespeare and Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=41}}; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=151–71}}; {{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter addressed to [[John Davies of Hereford|John Davies]], Bacon closes "so desireing you to bee good to concealed poets", which according to his supporters is self-referential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=57–63}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Baconians argue that while Bacon outlined both a scientific and moral philosophy in ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]'' (1605), only the first part was published under his name during his lifetime. They say that his moral philosophy, including a revolutionary politico-philosophic system of government, was concealed in the Shakespeare plays because of its threat to the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baconians suggest that the great number of legal allusions in the Shakespeare canon demonstrate the author's expertise in the law. Bacon became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1596 and was appointed [[Law Officers of the Crown#England and Wales|Attorney General]] in 1613. Bacon also paid for and helped write speeches for a number of entertainments, including [[masque]]s and [[dumbshow]]s, although he is not known to have authored a play. His only attributed verse consists of seven [[metrical psalter]]s, following [[Metrical psalter#Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter|Sternhold and Hopkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=176 note}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Bacon was knowledgeable about ciphers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bacon|2002|pp=318, 693}}.&lt;/ref&gt; early Baconians suspected that he left his signature encrypted in the Shakespeare canon. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many Baconians claimed to have discovered ciphers throughout the works supporting Bacon as the true author. In 1881, C. F. Ashwood Windle claimed she had found carefully worked-out jingles in each play that identified Bacon as the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=42–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked a cipher craze, and probative cryptograms were identified in the works by Ignatius Donnelly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=53–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Orville Ward Owen, [[Elizabeth Wells Gallup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=62–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Isaac Hull Platt. Platt argued that the Latin word ''[[honorificabilitudinitatibus]]'', found in ''Love's Labour's Lost'', can be read as an anagram, yielding ''Hi ludi F. Baconis nati tuiti orbi'' ("These plays, the offspring of F. Bacon, are preserved for the world.").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruthven|2001|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford===
{{Main|Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship}}&lt;!---This is a SUMMARY: detailed additions should be placed in the article on 'Oxfordian theory'---&gt;
[[File:Edward-de-Vere-1575.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with front view of a man wearing a hat with feather.|[[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] (1550–1604)]]
Since the early 1920s, the leading alternative authorship candidate has been [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] and [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] of England. Oxford followed his grandfather and father in sponsoring companies of actors, and he had patronised a company of musicians and one of tumblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2003|pp=13, 248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford was an important courtier poet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1991|pp=53–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; praised as such and as a playwright by [[George Puttenham]] and Francis Meres, who included him in a list of the "best for comedy amongst us". Examples of his poetry but none of his theatrical works survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2003|pp=386–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford was noted for his literary and theatrical patronage. Between 1564 and 1599, 33 works were dedicated to him, including works by [[Arthur Golding]], [[John Lyly]], [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] and [[Anthony Munday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1980|pp=8–}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1583 he bought the sublease of the [[Blackfriars Theatre#First Theatre|first Blackfriars Theatre]] and gave it to the poet-playwright Lyly, who operated it for a season under Oxford's patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1964|pp=151, 155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxfordians believe certain literary allusions indicate that Oxford was one of the most prominent "suppressed" [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] and/or [[pseudonym]]ous writers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Al, and Judy Woodruff. The Shakespeare Mystery. PBS, Frontline, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They also note Oxford's connections to the London theatre and the contemporary playwrights of Shakespeare's day, his family connections including the patrons of Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], his relationships with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and Shakespeare's patron, the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], his knowledge of Court life, his private tutors and education, and his wide-ranging travels through the locations of Shakespeare's plays in France and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|pp=46, 47, 50, 53, 56, 58, 75, 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case for Oxford's authorship is also based on perceived similarities between Oxford's biography and events in Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and longer poems; perceived parallels of language, idiom, and thought between Oxford's letters and the Shakespearean canon; and the discovery of numerous marked passages in Oxford's Bible that appear in some form in Shakespeare's plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to lay out a comprehensive case for Oxford's authorship was J. Thomas Looney, an English schoolteacher who identified personality characteristics in Shakespeare's works—especially ''Hamlet''—that painted the author as an eccentric aristocratic poet, a drama and sporting enthusiast with a classical education who had travelled extensively to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=431–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He discerned close affinities between the poetry of Oxford and that of Shakespeare in the use of motifs and subjects, phrasing, and rhetorical devices, which led him to identify Oxford as the author.&lt;ref name="may222" /&gt; After his ''Shakespeare Identified'' was published in 1920, Oxford replaced Bacon as the most popular alternative candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=121}}; {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=159}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=239 (210)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford's purported use of the "Shakespeare" pen name is attributed to the [[stigma of print]], a convention that aristocratic authors could not take credit for writing plays for the public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another motivation given is the politically explosive "[[Prince Tudor theory]]" that the youthful Oxford was Queen Elizabeth's lover; according to this theory, Oxford dedicated ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'', ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', and the ''Sonnets'' to their son, England's rightful [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Prince]], Henry Wriothesley, who was brought up as the 3rd Earl of Southampton.&lt;ref name="wadsworth127" /&gt;

Oxfordians say that the dedication to the sonnets published in 1609 implies that the author was dead prior to their publication and that 1604 (the year of Oxford's death) was the year regular publication of "newly corrected" and "augmented" Shakespeare plays stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they date most of the plays earlier than the standard chronology and say that the plays which show evidence of revision and collaboration were left unfinished by Oxford and completed by other playwrights after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=433–4}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=294 (258)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christopher Marlowe===
{{Main|Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship}}
[[File:Marlowe-Portrait-1585.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with front view of a man with long hair, moustache, and arms folded, a putative portrait of Christopher Marlowe (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge).|[[Christopher Marlowe]] (1564–1593)]]

The poet and dramatist [[Christopher Marlowe]] was born into the same social class as Shakespeare—his father was a cobbler, Shakespeare's a glove-maker. Marlowe was the older by two months, and spent six and a half years at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. He pioneered the use of [[blank verse]] in Elizabethan drama, and his works are widely accepted as having greatly influenced those of Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Logan|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his seven plays, all but one or two were first performed before 1593.

The Marlovian theory argues that Marlowe's documented death on 30 May 1593 was faked. [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]] and others are supposed to have arranged the faked death, the main purpose of which was to allow Marlowe to escape trial and almost certain execution on charges of subversive [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=445–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory then argues that Shakespeare was chosen as the front behind whom Marlowe would continue writing his highly successful plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are founded on inferences derived from the circumstances of his apparent death, stylistic similarities between the works of Marlowe and Shakespeare, and hidden meanings found in the works and associated texts.

Marlovians note that, despite Marlowe and Shakespeare being almost exactly the same age, the first work linked to the name William Shakespeare—''Venus and Adonis''—was on sale, with his name signed to the dedication, 13 days after Marlowe's reported death,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; having been registered with the Stationers' Company on 18 April 1593 with no named author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|2000|p=xii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lists of verbal correspondences between the two canons have also been compiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=446–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlowe's candidacy was initially suggested by T. W. White, in 1892, as a member of a group of authors.&lt;ref name="Churchill 1958 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was first proposed as the sole author of Shakespeare's "stronger plays" in 1895 by [[Wilbur G. Zeigler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=446}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His candidacy was revived by Calvin Hoffman in 1955 and, according to Shapiro, a recent surge in interest in the Marlowe case "may be a sign that the dominance of the Oxfordian camp may not extend much longer than the Baconian one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=247 (217)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby===
{{Main|Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship}}
[[File:6thEarlOfDerby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with front view of a man wearing a hat with feather.|[[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]] (1561–1642)]]
[[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]], was first proposed as a candidate in 1891 by James Greenstreet and later supported by Abel Lefranc and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenstreet discovered that a Jesuit spy, George Fenner, reported in 1599 that Derby "is busye in penning commodyes for the common players".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=91–2}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=215 (189)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Derby was recorded as financing one of London's two children's drama companies, [[Children of Paul's|Paul's Boys]]; he also had his own company, Derby's Men, which played multiple times at court in 1600 and 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|pp=106, 164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Derby was born three years before Shakespeare and died in 1642, so his lifespan fits the consensus dating of the works. His initials were W. S., and he was known to sign himself "Will", which qualified him to write the punning "Will" sonnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=215 (190)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Derby travelled in continental Europe in 1582, visiting France and possibly [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. ''Love's Labour's Lost'' is set in Navarre and the play may be based on events that happened there between 1578 and 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lefranc|1918–19|pp=2, 87–199}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1969|p=128}}; {{Harvnb|Londré|1997|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Derby married [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth de Vere]], whose maternal grandfather was [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thought by some critics to be the basis of the character of Polonius in ''Hamlet''. Derby was associated with [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery and later 4th Earl of Pembroke, the "Incomparable Pair" to whom William Shakespeare's First Folio is dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Derby released his estates to his son [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James]] around 1628–29, he named Pembroke and Montgomery as trustees. Derby's older brother, [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], formed a group of players, the [[Lord Strange's Men]], some of whose members eventually joined the King's Men, one of the companies most associated with Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spy Smasher''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in comics published by [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] and [[DC Comics]]. The first is a [[superhero]] that was formerly owned and published by [[Fawcett Comics]]. The second is a female anti-terrorism government agent often featured as an antagonist of the vigilante team [[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Alan Armstrong===
Similar to [[Batman]] and the [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)]], Spy Smasher (secretly the "wealthy Virginia sportsman"&lt;ref&gt;"Spy Smasher" #1, Summer 1941,
 page 6&lt;/ref&gt; '''Alan Armstrong''') is a master detective, equipped with a number of gadgets and a specialized vehicle, the "Gyrosub", which was a combination of an [[airplane]], an [[automobile]], and a [[submarine]]. Created by [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] and [[C. C. Beck]], Spy Smasher was introduced in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 (February 1940). Alongside [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Spy Smasher became one of the magazine's most popular characters. In Whiz Comics #16-18, he was briefly an opponent of Captain Marvel, as a [[Nazi]] Scientist and old enemy of his, the Mask, used a device to brainwash him, but finally Captain Marvel was able to restore his mind. 

His name was changed to '''Crime Smasher''' after [[World War II]] ended, and the first issue of ''Crime Smasher'' was published in 1948. In 1953, Fawcett ceased publication of all superhero comics, after settling a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|lawsuit]] against DC Comics over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] being an [[copyright infringement|infringement on the copyright]] of [[Superman]], agreeing to cease publishing Captain Marvel.

After DC Comics obtained the rights to the Fawcett characters in 1972, Spy Smasher began appearing irregularly in DC Comics, presented as one of the heroes of [[Earth-S]] prior to ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. He first appeared in '''Crisis in Eternity''', as a member of the [[Squadron of Justice]] when [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] had captured [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] and the Elders, and teamed up with other villains to wipe out life on all three Earths, and defeated [[Ibac]] on [[Earth-Two]] as he attacked [[Atlantis]] by tricking him into saying ''''I bac'''k down from no-one,' defeating him as saying his name causes him to turn into a normal man and vice versa. The character was used prominently in the 1990s series ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', in which aged Alan Armstrong often recounts his adventures as Spy Smasher. ''Power of Shazam!'' #24 was dedicated to Armstrong's recounting of a [[Cold War]]-era mission he undertook with an [[archaeologist]] named C.C. Batson to Batson's children, Billy (alter-ego of Captain Marvel) and Mary (alter-ego of [[Mary Marvel]]).

While Alan was still Spy Smasher in that story, a crossover between ''Power of Shazam'' and ''[[Starman (DC Comics)|Starman]]'' in 1997 included [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]] running over the history of the Fawcett City heroes, and mentioning that he thought Spy Smasher became Crime Smasher after the war but was unsure. 

[[AC Comics]] has published reprints of some Golden Age Spy Smasher stories that have lapsed into the [[public domain]]. The character also made a cameo appearance in the inaugural issue of Image Comics' Next Issue Project.

===Powers and abilities===
Spy Smasher is an intelligent scientist and inventor, a master detective and a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. He also possessed a number of gadgets and a specialized vehicle.

===Katarina Armstrong===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spysmasher-katarina.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The new Spy Smasher, Katarina Armstrong. From ''Birds of Prey'' #100. Art by [[Nicola Scott]].]] --&gt;

A new Spy Smasher, government agent '''Katarina Armstrong''', created by [[Gail Simone]], first appears in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]'' #100 (January 2007). She is a high-ranking anti-terrorism agent who is affiliated with several [[United States|American]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], and [[United Nations]] agencies (see table). Her relation to Alan Armstrong has not been revealed, though her secret identity and costume seem clearly inspired by him. She is depicted in her first appearances as having a domineering demeanor, and is not hesitant to kill or order deaths in order to complete a mission. Having forced Oracle to work for her, she plans to take over the Birds of Prey organization and usurp Oracle's position. Issue #103 indicates that Katarina and [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] were friends in [[college]]. At some point prior to Katarina's debut, they became rivals.  That issue shows a flashback of both women competing in a race, with Katarina beating Barbara by cheating but immediately confessing to the judges after she had won.

Katarina accompanies the Birds on a mission in Russia, and in a conflict with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], Katarina finds her equal marksman in [[Deadshot]]. Katarina assumes leadership of the Birds from Oracle and fires [[Lady Blackhawk]] for dissent.&lt;ref&gt;"Birds Of Prey" #107 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Back at Oracle's base, she is challenged to a fight by Oracle, who then manages to give Katarina a proper beating.  She is humiliated when she faces the united front of every single one of Barbara's living former agents. Spy Smasher leaves disgraced after being threatened by [[Black Canary]], but before doing so also gives Oracle information on [[Misfit (DC Comics)|Misfit]]'s  background.

It was later mentioned in ''Checkmate'' #16 by [[Sasha Bordeaux]] that [[Mademoiselle Marie|Josephine Tautin]] had "drop-kicked her down a deep, dark hole.  Something she quite enjoyed doing, incidentally." ''Checkmate'' #18 has Sasha personally apologising to Barbara for Katarina's actions.

In the aftermath of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Katarina is seen being held prisoner by the [[Global Peace Agency]]. The GPA agents apparently erase all of her memories by "resetting" her brain, telling [[Cameron Chase]] that Katarina can hear their conversations but can no longer process what the sounds mean. Her current fate is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Escape'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; though it is implied that she was returned to normal, as with many other characters in the story, after [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]] and Chase use the [[cosmic treadmill]].

During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', an unknown villain begins targeting the members of the Birds of Prey. Oracle initially muses that it could be Katarina's doing, as she has the means and motive to harm the Birds, but it is eventually revealed to be the work of [[Twelve_Brothers_in_Silk#White_Canary|the White Canary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #1&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spy Smasher is eventually revealed to be alive and well when she recruits [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and his new team of mercenaries (consisting of himself,  [[Jeannette (comics)|Jeannette]], [[Lady Vic]], [[King Shark]], Dwarfstar and [[Giganta]]) to invade and claim [[Skartaris]] in the name of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characterization====
Creator Gail Simone said on Katarina, "I felt the DCU needed a [[Jack Bauer]]. In these early issues, she looks like a pointed allegory to the abuse of powers by the government, but she doesn’t see it that way, and she’s a lot more complex than that. It’d be a cheat to simply make her evil and completely hate-able, I think. She’s got some levels. And she knows Babs’ weaknesses. I like her. She’s very very dark... Even above [Barbara and Katarina's] competitive natures, there is a perfectly valid and honest ideological difference of opinion there. Babs believes what she’s doing is necessary, Katarina believes what Babs is doing is treason. They actually like each other, but like brothers fighting on opposite sides of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the distance between them is so vast and clearly drawn that they can’t even hope to reconcile. They were friends; their ideals make them bitter enemies."&lt;ref name="bopsimone"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title ='''Newsarama''': The Simone Files I: Birds of Prey| url =http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98825| accessdate =2007-08-27| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071014175327/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98825| archivedate =2007-10-14| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Powers and abilities====
Spy Smasher is an expert markswoman and a skilled hand to hand combatant on a similar level to Deadshot. She claims to be of higher political authority than anyone in the [[United States]], even the [[President of the United States|President]], but is later outranked in an issue of ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' by [[Sasha Bordeaux]]. Although she explicitly states that her job is to kill people, specifically terrorists and those who aim to harm the United States, she has yet to be directly depicted as taking a life.

==In other media==

===Television===
Spy Smasher made a brief appearance in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Patriot Act" voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]] who remained uncredited. He is seen in a flashback sequence where he prevented the creation of [[Captain Nazi]] and confiscating the unstable serum that would be used later in the episode.

===Film===
In 1942, Spy Smasher was adapted into a popular 12-part [[Serial (film)|film serial]] directed by [[William Witney]] for [[Republic Pictures]]. ''[[Spy Smasher (serial)|Spy Smasher]]'' featured actor [[Kane Richmond]] in a dual role, as both the title character (an American freelance agent in [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied [[France]] who was originally believed to have been killed in a plane crash) and his identical twin brother, and [[Marguerite Chapman]] as the brother's imperiled fiancée, Eve Corby. Edited down to 100 minutes in 1966 the serial was re-released for [[television]] under the title ''Spy Smasher Returns''.

===Video game===
Spy Smasher will appear in the [[video game]] [[DC Universe Online]].

'''TV Maria''' is a national [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] television channel broadcasting from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. Owned by '''TV Maria Foundation Philippines''' (a non-profit, non-stock organization under the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila]]), it airs 24 hours a day and is currently available on major and provincial cable operators, and via online livestreaming.

Most of the station's programmes are both in-house productions and packaged shows from [[Jesuit Communications Foundation]], [[Bo Sanchez|Kerygma Foundation]], [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], [[Society of St. Paul]], and other Catholic groups.

==History==
The Roman Catholic Church recognizes the importance of keeping up with the times to reach out to a greater number of people. And TV Maria is its means to cater to a Filipino audience who are hungry for God's Word through television as well as through various alternatives such as the internet and the cellphone.

TV Maria Foundation Philippines, Inc. – or simply known as TV Maria – is a non-profit, non-stock religious organization of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines through the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila. Its work mainly involves evangelizing the Catholic faith through television and internet broadcasting, plus other forms of modern communication. It promotes not only the importance of communication and information in building a nation but also the importance of interweaving these with Catholic Filipino values.

TV Maria began test broadcasting on January 1, 2006 and began regular transmission on December 8, 2007, the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://katoliko.org/2007/12/16/tv-maria-officially-launched-on-dec-8/ TV MARIA OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ON DEC. 8]. Katoliko.org. Retrieved Dec. 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2013, during a press conference for the upcoming Philippine Conference on New Evangelization, [[Archbishop of Manila]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle|Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle]] announced that TV Maria finally granted its free-to-air television franchise from the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/nation/36323-catholic-channel-free-tv Catholic channel may air on free TV]. [[Rappler]]. Retrieved August 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting 2015, TV Maria began to broadcast its Misa Nazareno mass from historic [[Quiapo Church]] live via video streaming, as well as certain Papal Masses via EWTN. Since Holy Week 2016, TV Maria also started live broadcasts of Holy Week activities in the Manila Cathedral using widescreen format.

'''''The Eleven Little Roosters''''' is an American spy [[comedy]] [[web series]] created by Josh Flanagan and co-directed and co-written by Blaine Gibson and Flanagan. It stars [[Zach Anner]], [[Burnie Burns]], [[Barbara Dunkelman]], [[Gavin Free]], [[Ashley Jenkins]], [[Geoff Ramsey]] and [[Gus Sorola]]. It is the successor to the 2014 series ''[[Ten Little Roosters]]'', acting as an spy thriller that pits international assassins against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Anson|title=RTX 2015: A recap of entertainment news from the convention|url=http://www.loadthegame.com/2015/08/09/rtx-2015-a-recap-of-entertainment-news-from-the-convention/|website=www.loadthegame.com|publisher=Load The Game|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on [[Rooster Teeth]]'s website on January 16, 2017.

==Format==
After the success of ''Ten Little Roosters'', creator Josh Flanagan wanted to "fully deliver" on the concept by expanding the cast, scope, and storyline and adding new levels of interaction, describing it as, "''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' of Rooster Teeth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatchett|first1=Keisha|title=Rooster Teeth’s Spy Parody The Eleven Little Roosters Is One Giant Scavenger Hunt|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-eleven-little-roosters-premiere/|website=www.themarysue.com|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode, characters are killed, and viewers who predict plot points by "synthesizing" clues such as hidden QR codes, in-dialogue hints, and audio cues win prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutelle|first1=Sam|title=Here’s The Trailer For Rooster Teeth’s Interactive Murder-Mystery ‘The Eleven Little Roosters,’ Premiering January 16th (Exclusive)|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2017/01/13/rooster-teeth-the-eleven-little-roosters-trailer/|website=Tube Filter|publisher=www.tubefilter.com|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It feature cameos and 360 video segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brouwer|first1=Bree|title=Rooster Teeth Plans More ‘Million Dollars, But…’, ‘Little Roosters’ From RTX|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2016/07/04/rooster-teeth-million-dollars-but-little-roosters/|website=www.tubefilter.com|publisher=Tube Filter|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary = At a base in Croatia, Agent Moose of the Canadian Assassins League (CAL) successfully infiltrates and seemingly kills Captain Gruber. However, to her surprise, she finds out that she killed Jack the Red of the Norwegian Viking Coalition (NVC). Meanwhile at Mi6, Gavin the 3rd convinces his handler, Annersby, to let him operate as a field agent again despite failed test results. An emergency meeting is held at the Rooster Corps, where The Big Cock announces the death of Jack the Red, and that Moose was given false orders to go to Croatia, meaning that there is a mole among them. The assassins can continue their missions and operations as normal, but must also be aware and find the mole as soon as possible. Additionally, Moose is disavowed and Agent Knuckle is brought in to represent Canada in her stead. After the meeting, Moose is approached by the Colonel, who offers her a second chance and encourages her to get to the bottom of this case. He then recommends her to get in contact with Ryan Haywood, the sole survivor of [[Ten Little Roosters|the Austin, Texas dinner party massacre]], who now works as a consultant for the Rooster Corps.

 |ShortSummary = Marquee Marquis of the French Association of Professionals (FAP) prepares to assassinate a man, but hesitates to do so. At a park in Paris, Moose finds Marquis, and he confesses to her that he doesn't kill men, only women and children. The reason why is because some years ago, his father was seemingly killed by a young girl. Knuckle arrives and decides to take Marquis' assignment instead. In London, Gavin spends time with the members of the Asesino Mexicano Espia (AME), consisting of Madam Mariel (who Gavin slept with), La Luna Loco, and So'rolla (who "stepped in"), before they leave to celebrate the latter's quinceañera. At the Rooster Corps HQ, Burnardo Burnadicci of the Italian Defense Division (IDD) and Agent Gibson of the CIA get into a brief argument, while Christoph Weiss of the Swedish Security Service (SSS) tells an arriving Marquis that a new assignment came for him, but doesn't know who sent it, leading them to be suspiscious that it might be another fake file from the mole. Marquis takes the assignment nonetheless. In Australia, Boomerang Geoff and The Griffon of Whatever Australia Has (WAH) decide to wait it out for the mole in their safehouse. Marquis' assignment is to kill "three mermaids", but the mermaids turn out to be Mariel, La Luna, and So'rolla who were celebrating their quinceañera. Marquis screams in agony for the deaths of the two men, while a hooded figure observes the scene and leaves.

 |ShortSummary = In Russia, Comrade Hadam of the KGB meets with [[Vladimir Putin]] about the saboteur, and Putin advises Hadam to prepare for the "National Game". Meanwhile, Moose meets with Marquis eating at a restaurant, where she finds a clue on how to know if the files are fake. She also finds a message from Ryan which prompts her to leave. In London, Annersby gives Gavin some new gadgets: a communicator in the form of a pistol, a cyanide container (which resembles the Tower of Pimps), and a shrink ray (which is bugged as it actually enlarges things). In Germany, the Sex Von Shaukel Boyz (SSB), consisting of Brüce, Wilhelm, Lars, and Koko, are about to prepare for a concert, but the band members find rumors that Koko has been in a relationship with [[Yoko Ono]], which causes in-fighting and tension among them. Elsewhere, Burnadicci laments about being "too old", but resolves to become a new man and heads out. Back in France, Marquis finds the girl who supposedly killed his father, and confronts her. However, it is revealed that the girl is actually Burnadicci's daughter, Margaret, and that he was the one who killed Marquis' father years ago. Burnadicci then executes Marquis for threatening his daughter and leaves.

 |ShortSummary = In Canada, Hadam meets with Moose and informs her that he will be participating in Russia's "national game". He invites Moose (who fears for his life because the game is to the death) to watch because he believes that the mole will be present, and hopes that she will flush them out. It is then revealed that Hadam was originally Canadian (named Gordan at the time), and he and Moose were in a relationship at one point before he switched his citizenship to Russian. At the CIA headquarters in Virginia, Gibson is jealous of Jinx's sex appeal, and the two get into an argument before Jinx storms off. Back in London, Gavin is visited by Hadam, who knocks him out with sleeping gas. Gavin later wakes up trapped on a stage with Hadam, as he announces that the "national game" has started. It is revealed that the Russia's national game is a real-life version of ''[[Tetris]]''. As the game progresses, Moose notices a suspicious hooded figure in the audience, who runs away. She goes to warn Hadam about the mole, but both he and Gavin are trapped by the constantly stacking ''Tetris'' blocks. Gavin then uses the new gadgets he obtained from Annersby to win the game, but Hadam gets crushed by the onslaught of ''Tetris'' blocks, killing him and leaving Moose distraught. After the game, Moose gets a message from Ryan, with him saying that the Germans (more specifically the SSB) will be the next to strike, but who their target is remains a mystery.

 |ShortSummary = Back in Berlin, the members of SSB find out that Koko is planning his own solo career. This divides the band members, and they go their own separate ways. At the Rooster Corps HQ, Moose (accompanied by Knuckle) reports to the Big Cock about Ryan's message, and he sends out the message to the remaining Rooster Corps members. At this time, Wilhelm visits Burnadicci in Italy, Lars visits Gavin in London, Brüce visits Gibson in Virginia, and Koko visits Geoff and Griffon in Australia. They each receive the Big Cock's message, but they misinterpret it (except for Griffon, who decoded the message right away). Moose and Knuckle investigate at the SSB's base, where they find a file saying that the Germans are not the moles, but were brainwashed, set to be activated when someone says certain trigger words. Back in Italy, Burnadicci converses with Wilhelm, inadvertently saying the trigger words which causes Wilhelm to attack and kill Burnadicci. The remaining members of the SSB arrive and stop Wilhelm, and they all reconcile and plan a reunion tour. Moose then arrives too late, and reports to the Big Cock of Burnadicci's death. With the loss of many of their top agents, the Big Cock decides it's time to get himself personally involved in the investigation.

 |ShortSummary = At the Rooster Corps, Ryan informs Moose and the Big Cock that three of their agents are not who they say they are. One of the agents is Geoff, who in actuality is just [[Geoff Ramsey]], a former [[Rooster Teeth]] employee who went "off the grid" to work for Rooster Corps following the [[Ten Little Roosters|deaths of his fellow employees from the dinner massacre]]. His partner, The Griffon, is also revealed to be his wife, [[Griffon Ramsey]], who went off to kill the Boyz for murdering Burnadicci. Moose then finds the third of the false agents, Weiss, who is actually Chris Demarais. Chris himself believed he died in the dinner massacre years ago, but miraculously survived with no memory of what happened before. Chris accepts his new identity as Christoph Weiss, while channeling his inner [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'']] obsession and agrees to help Moose stop Griffon from killing the Boyz. In London, Gibson storms into Gavin's room, where he finds Jinx has been sleeping with him (as well as Knuckle), and is angry at the fact that Gavin doesn't want to "bang him". Gibson leaves, vowing revenge for rejection. Meanwhile, the Boyz are rehearsing on top of a narrow catwalk high above the ground. Griffon arrives and prepares to kill them, but is stopped by Weiss, who cuts off part of the catwalk separating him and Griffon. Griffon shoots Weiss, who falls off the catwalk and dies landing face first into the ground (obviously parodying Gandalf's death). Griffon attempts to shoot the Boyz once again, but they escape.

 |ShortSummary = The Boyz celebrate their reunion tour, despite Moose's warnings that the mole is still out there. At Rooster Corps HQ, while finding a depressed Gibson, Jinx notices the Big Cock packing his things. He tells her that the Corps has been compromised, but Jinx says that the mole could still get their hands on the superweapon (which has been hinted at in the previous episodes). The Big Cock shares that the superweapon is The Hammer of Cock, a remote-controlled satellite orbiting Earth that can destroy anything. Jinx suggests destroying it so that the mole can't get their hands on it. Jinx and Gibson arrive at the superweapon's control center, where Jinx sets up a time bomb while Gibson looks for the core controlling the superweapon. To their surprise, the core is not there, and Knuckle appears before them. Knuckle explains that she was ordered to move the core and wait for the mole to appear. Both agencies mistake each other as the mole, and get into a fight. Due to them being distracted while fighting, the bomb goes off, killing all three of them. Back at Rooster Corps, the Big Cock hands control of the corps over to the Colonel. However, the Colonel betrays and kills the Big Cock, revealing him to be in league with the mole the whole time.

 |ShortSummary = The finale starts off with Griffon returning to Geoff after her failed attempt to kill the Boyz.  The Aussie duo notices a bomb planted underneath them.  Geoff states that he let various assassins into their hideout and before he reveals who planted the bomb, Geoff and Griffon are killed in the explosion.  Meanwhile, Annersby is approached by Gavin where it's revealed that Operator Mikey isn't real and is just Gavin's split personality who ends up making him "Mavin."  Moose finds out that Annersby is fine and makes her way to stop the Colonel and Mavin from killing the Boyz and using The Hammer of Cock.  Back at the Rooster Corps Headquarters, Mavin prepares to fire The Hammer Of Cock at the Boyz, but the Boyz arrive to confront him.  It's revealed that the masked DJ who was with the Boyz is Ryan in disguise who protected the Boyz and informed them of Mavin's betrayal.  As Moose, Ryan, and the Boyz prepare to fight Mavin and the Colonel, Mavin reveals how he sabotaged the other assassins.  Mavin sent Jack The Red to Croatia, gave the ASE the mermaid cutouts while giving Marquis the mission to kill "three mermaids", gave Margaret the red ball in order to cause a conflict between Burnaddici and Marquis, and brainwashed Wilhelm to kill Burnaddici while the remaining groups would become paranoid and kill each other.  Throughout the final battle, Mavin easily defeats Ryan and the Boyz by consistently switching between his Gavin and Mikey personalities while Moose kills the Colonel by slicing his throat with her razor-sharp hat.  Mavin launches the laser at the Boyz, but Lars pushes his band mates away and sacrifices himself.  Since the Boyz are used to laser shows during their concerts, Koko, Bruce, and Wilhelm dodge the lasers with their dancing and proceed to kill Mavin by exploding his head with synchronized singing.  Ryan then asks on what will happen to Rooster Corps since 10 organizations have been killed, to which Moose responds that Rooster Corps will be rebuilt.  One year later, the Rooster Corps are replaced with the Ministry of Moose, along with new members including Agent Kojima ([[Hideo Kojima]]). |LineColor = 8F9A94

{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
'''Vice''' is a [[stock character]] of the [[medieval]] [[morality play]]s. While the main character of these plays was representative of every human being (and usually named Mankind, Everyman, or some other generalizing of humanity at large), the other characters were representatives of (and usually named after) personified virtues or vices who sought to win control of man's soul.  While the virtues in a morality play can be seen as messengers of God, the vices were viewed as messengers of the Devil.

Over time, the morality plays began to include many lesser vices on stage and one chief vice figure, a tempter above all the others, who was called simply the Vice.  Originally, the Vice was a serious role, but over time his part became largely comical.  Scholar F.P. Wilson notes, “Whatever else the Vice may be, he is always the chief comic character”; this comic portrayal is explained thus: "In theory there is no reason why vice should not be put upon the stage with the same seriousness and sobriety as virtue: in practice, however, dramatists, and many a preacher, knew that men and women will not listen for long to unrelieved gravity”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=F.P|title=The English Drama: 1485-1585|date=1969|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XYdMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Declaration of Popish Impostures'' from 1603, [[Samuel Harsnet|Bishop Harsnet]] wrote that "It was a pretty part in the old church plays, when the nimble Vice would skip up nimbly like a Jacke-an-apes into the Devil's necke, and ride the devil a course, and belabour him with his wooden dagger, till he made him roar, whereat the people would laugh to see the Devil so Vice-haunted.”

==Characteristics==
The Vice can be an [[allegory|allegoric]] representation of one of the [[Vice|Seven Vices]] or a more general portrayal of [[evil]] as the [[temptation|tempter]] of [[human|man]]. Vice often takes the audience into complicity by revealing its evil plans, often through soliloquies or monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rycroft|first1=Eleanor|title=The Vice and The Fool|url=http://stagingthehenriciancourt.brookes.ac.uk/research/the_vice_and_the_fool.html|website=Staging the Henrician Court|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its enacting is frequently [[comedy|comic]] or [[Absurdity|absurd]].

==Origins==
The word "vice" is derived from [[Latin]] ''vitium'' "defect, offence, blemish, perfection", in both physical and verbal senses.  The character of the Vice developed from that of the domestic fool or jester some tincture in the later plays supplied from the mischief-making servants in Plautus and Terence.

Other ancestors of the vice are the devils and the vices in earlier moralities, from the comic characters in the folk play—the ancestors of the Morris fool, the fool of the Mummer's play, the clown of the Swordplay; from the medieval sermon, not merely from its 'characters' of the seven deadly sins and their representatives in contemporary life but from its jests and satirical bent; from the plotting servants of Terence and Plautus; from the creative zest of the actors speaking more than was set down for them.

==Later developments==
The Vice character developed into the [[villain]] in [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]]. ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' in [[Shakespeare]]'s drama of the same name links himself with the Vice when he declares:

:"Thus like the formal Vice, Iniquity, / I moralize two meanings in one word" ''(III.i.82–83)''

Other examples of the Vice in Renaissance theatre include [[Iago]] (who plays up the more villainous aspects of the Vice) from ''Othello'' and Sir John Falstaff (who plays up the more comic aspects of the vice) from ''Henry IV, Parts [[Henry IV, Part 1|1]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|2]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.

[[File:Aldwych Theatre 1.jpg|thumb|[[Aldwych Theatre]] ]]
'''William George Robert Sprague ''' (1863 &amp;ndash; 4 December 1933&lt;ref&gt;[http://sprague-database.org/genealogy/maint.php The Sprague Project]. Accessed 2 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;) was a theatre architect.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Australia]] in 1863 the son of actress [[Dolores Drummond]] who returned with acclaim to London in 1874.

Sprague was an [[articled clerk]] for [[Frank Matcham]] for four years, then in 1880 was an [[articled clerk]] for [[Walter Emden]] for three years. He was in a partnership with [[Bertie Crewe]] until 1895. He went on to design a large number of theatres and [[music hall]]s, almost all of them in London. At the height of his career he showed a productivity worthy of mentor [[Frank Matcham]], producing six theatres in [[Metropolitan Borough of Westminster|Westminster]] in less than four years. Unlike Matcham and Emden, Sprague studied architectural forms and conventions and used his knowledge in his designs, saying of himself that he "liked the Italian Renaissance" as a style for his frontages, but would take liberties when needed ''"to get the best effects"'' In 1902, the theatre newspaper ''The Era'' was describing him as ''"Britain’s youngest theatrical designer, with more London houses to his credit than any other man in the same profession."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/corporation/lma_learning/theatrelands/text.asp?ID=333 LMA Learning Zone &gt; Theatrelands &gt; Architects &gt; W.G.R. Sprague 1863-1933&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, William Morton, owner and manager of the [[Greenwich Theatre]], commissioned Sprague to produced plans for a 3000-seat theatre to replace his existing theatre on a new site on London Street, but this was never followed through.&lt;ref&gt;'Mr. W. Morton's Benefit', ''The Era'', 22 January 1898 p. 17 &lt;/ref&gt;

Sprague died in [[Maidenhead]] in 1933.

==Legacy==
None of his music halls has survived, but several of his theatres still stand.

It was determined from the outset that the new theatre should hold a place amongst the best in the kingdom, and Mr W. G. R. Sprague was commissioned. He recommended that the handsome Grecian style exterior of the old Victoria Theatre might be preserved. He therefore designed the newer, bigger Lyceum Theatre to be created within the walls of the old Victoria Theatre. This was a unique undertaking and sets it apart from Sprague's other theatres. The Lyceum Theatre was demolished in 1967 to make way for the building of a new Cinema by ABC which cost £250,000
