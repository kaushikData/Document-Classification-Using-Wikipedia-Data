'''Abraham Dob Bär Lebensohn''' (Traditional Jewish Lithuanian pronunciation: '''Avrohom Dov Beyr Leybenzon''') (born in [[Vilnius]], [[Russian Empire]] c. 1789/1794; died there November 19, 1878) was a [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] Hebraist, poet, and grammarian.

==Life==
Like all Jewish boys of that time in [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Lithuania]] he was educated as a [[Talmud]]ist, but became interested in Hebrew grammar and punctuation when, at the age of eleven, he was instructed in reading in public the weekly portions of the [[Torah|Law]]. He was married, according to the custom of those times, as soon as he had celebrated his ''[[bar mitzvah]]'' / ''Bar Mistvo'' ; and he spent the following eight years with his wife's parents in [[Michališki|Michailishki]]&lt;!--[[be-tarask:Міхалішкі]]--&gt;, in the government of Vilna. This gave him the surname "Michailishker," by which he was popularly known; and it also accounts for the last letter in his pen-name "Adam" (formed from the initials of Abraham Dob Michailishker), while the family name "Lebensohn," which he adopted, is a literal translation of "ben Ḥayyim." / "Beyn Cayim" . He afterward lived about four years in [[Ashmyany|Oshmiany]], in the government of Vilna, where he attempted to establish himself as a merchant. He was now an accomplished [[rabbinic]] scholar; but he devoted most of his leisure time to the study of Hebrew poetical and grammatical works. On returning to his native city, where he remained for the rest of his life, he engaged in teaching, a profession which he followed until his old age, except for about fifteen years in which he was engaged in the business of a broker.

== As poet ==
His first poetical work to be published was the ''Shir Ḥabibim'' / ''Shir Chovivim'' (Vilnius, 1822), in honor of the marriage of Count [[Tyszkiewicz]], one of the most powerful noblemen of Lithuania. It was followed by ''Ebel Kabed'' / ''Eyvel Koveyd'' (ib. 1825), an elegy on the death of R. [[Saul Katzenellenbogen]]; this established the author's reputation as a Hebrew poet. The publication of the first volume of his poetry, entitled ''Shire Sefat Ḳodesh''  / ''Shirey Sfas Kodesh'' (Leipzig, 1842; 2d ed. [[Vilnius]], 1863), marks the beginning of a new epoch in [[Neo-Hebrew]] literature in [[Lithuania]]. It is the first poetical work of the rejuvenated literature that can be favorably compared with the works of that nature which were produced in western European countries. It was received with unbounded enthusiasm. Thousands of young men in sympathy with the [[Haskalah]] movement, of which Lebensohn became the leading exponent in [[Lithuania]], learned to recite the songs of ''Shire Sefat Ḳodesh'' / ''Shirey Sfas Kodesh'' by heart; and the fame of the author spread to all centers of Hebrew learning.

When Sir [[Moses Montefiore]] visited [[Vilnius]] in 1846, Lebensohn prepared for his perusal an article on the condition of the Jews in Russia and the means by which it was to be improved. This interesting document, embodying the views held by the ''[[Maskilim]]'' of that period, summarized the evils from which the Jews suffered and boldly stated that they were themselves to blame for their troubles. Lack of education and of skill in handicrafts, too early marriages, the ignorance of the rabbis and teachers, and extravagance were described as the four ''abot neziḳin''  / ''Ayveys Nezikin'' or chief faults; and relief was proposed, as was customary in those times, through governmental intervention (see I. M. Dick, ''Ha-Oraḥ,'' and Lebensohn, ''Yeter Shire Adam''  / ''Yeser Shirey Oydom'' pp.&amp;nbsp;67 et seq.).

== As commentator ==
In 1848, Lebensohn was made one of the principal teachers in the newly established rabbinical school of Vilna, a position which he creditably filled for nearly twenty years, until he was forced by age and impaired eyesight to relinquish it. He was succeeded by his son-in-law [[Joshua Steinberg]]. Also in 1848, he began, conjointly with the bibliographer [[Benjacob]] / ''Yitschok Beyn-Yaynkov'', the publication of a new edition of the [[Bible]], with a German translation, himself adding valuable glosses to the ''bi'ur'' / ''Biyuyr'' (''Miḳra'e Ḳodesh,'' / ''Mikroyey Kodesh'',  Vilna, 1848–53). Some of his commentaries on the Bible were later printed separately as a supplement to that edition (''Bi'urim Ḥadashim,'' / ''Biyuyrim Chadoshim'', ib. 1858). A second volume of ''Shire Sefat Ḳodesh'' / ''Shirey Sfas Kodesh'' appeared in Vilna in 1856 (2d ed., ib. 1869); and in 1869 was published ''Yeter Shire Adam'' / ''Yeser Shirey Oydom'' the third volume of the same work, containing also poems written by his son [[Micah Joseph Lebensohn]] / ''Micho Yeyseyf Leybenzon'' . The most important of his later works are the allegorical drama ''Emet we-Emunah'' / ''Eymes VeYeymuno'' (ib. 1867; 2d ed., ib. 1870), which has for its theme the harmonization of science and religion; and ''Yitron le-Adam''  / ''Yisreyn LeYoydom'' (ib. 1874), a commentary on [[Ben-Ze'eb]]'s (Traditional Jewish Lithuanian pronunciation:''Beyn-Zyeyv'') well-known Hebrew grammar, ''Talmud Leshon 'Ibri'' / ''Talmud Lesheyn Iyvri'' with which it has been often reprinted. A new edition of the three volumes of ''Shire Sefat Ḳodesh'' / ''Shirey Sfas Kodesh'' appeared in Vilna in 1895.

Lebensohn was the author of several other, unimportant, works and of numerous articles in the periodicals. He exercised almost as much influence by his powerful personality as by his literary efforts, and was recognized in his later years as the pioneer of ''haskalah'' in northwestern Russia. The ''Maskilim'' of Vilna considered themselves as his pupils, while the fanatics saw in him the embodiment of all the objectionable features of the progressivist movement.

He had two sons, Micah Joseph Lebensohn, cited above, and [[Aryeh Löb Lebensohn]] (Traditional Lithuanian Jewish pronunciation: ''Ayryey Leyb Leybenzon''), who was a prominent businessman in Vilna.

'''Antecedents''' are the life history and previous [[Conviction (law)|convictions]] of a [[defendant]] in a [[criminal]] case. They are colloquially known as "previous convictions" (or simply "previous") in the [[United Kingdom]] and "prior convictions" (or simply "priors") in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]].

When a defendant is being [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] for a [[crime]], the court will be told antecedents. This information is usually considered by the judge/magistrate in deciding the sentence the defendant will receive. If a defendant pleads "[[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]]", previous convictions are not usually made known to the jury during the trial, to prevent prejudice against the defendant, but it is argued  {{by whom?|date=May 2018}} if the defendant has previous convictions for similar types of offense, this should be part of the evidence given at the trial.

'''Asyndeton''' (from the {{lang-el|ἀσύνδετον}}, "unconnected", sometimes called '''asyndetism''') is a literary scheme in which one or several [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] are deliberately omitted from a series of related clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''[[veni, vidi, vici]]'' and its English translation "I came, I saw, I conquered". Its use can have the effect of speeding up the rhythm of a passage and making a single idea more memorable. Asyndeton may be contrasted with [[syndeton]] ([[syndetic coordination]]) and [[polysyndeton]], which describe the use of one or multiple coordinating conjunctions, respectively.

More generally, in [[grammar]], an '''asyndetic coordination''' is a type of [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] in which no coordinating conjunction is present between the conjuncts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/conjunct/asynd.htm|title=Asyndetic Coordination @ The Internet Grammar of English|last=|first=|date=18 April 2018|website=UCL|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214085921/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/conjunct/asynd.htm|archive-date=2004-12-14|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Quickly, resolutely, he strode into the bank.''

No coordinator is present here, but the conjoins are still coordinated.

It does not involve omission, but is grouped with its opposite.

== Examples ==

=== Omission of conjunction "and" ===
&lt;!-- More examples are needed which contains omission of other conjunctions than "and", in my opinion.--&gt;
[[Aristotle]] wrote in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' that this device was more effective in spoken oratory than in written prose:

*"Thus strings of unconnected words, and constant repetitions of words and phrases, are very properly condemned in written speeches: but not in spoken speeches — speakers use them freely, for they have a dramatic effect. In this repetition there must be variety of tone, paving the way, as it were, to dramatic effect; e.g., 'This is the villain among you who deceived you, who cheated you, '''who meant to betray you completely''''". Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', Book III, Chapter 12 (trans. W. Rhys Roberts).

Several notable examples can be found in American political speeches:
Aristotle also believed that asyndeton can be used effectively in endings of works, and he himself employs the device in the final passage of the ''Rhetoric'':

*"For the conclusion, the disconnected style of language is appropriate, and will mark the difference between the oration and the peroration. 'I have done. You have heard me. The facts are before you. '''I ask for your judgement''''". Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', Book III, Chapter 19 (trans. W. Rhys Roberts).
*"...and that government of the people, by the people, '''for the people''' shall not perish from the earth". [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Gettysburg Address]]&lt;!-- Which conjunction has been omitted here?--&gt;
*"...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, '''oppose any foe''' to assure the survival and the success of liberty." [[John F. Kennedy]] ''Inaugural Address'', 20 January 1961.

Another frequently used example is [[Winston Churchill]]'s address, "[[We shall fight on the beaches]]":

*"We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, '''we shall fight in the hills'''; we shall never surrender. . ."

=== Omission of conjunction "or" ===
An asyndeton of "or" before a [[polysyndeton]] of "and":

* "A parson or what looked like one was laboring over the crest of the hill and coming toward them with one hand raised in blessing, '''greeting, fending flies'''. He was dressed in a dusty frockcoat and carried a walking stick and he wore a pair of octagonal glasses on the one pane of which the late sun shone while a watery eye peered from the naked wire aperture of the other." ([[Cormac McCarthy]], ''[[Outer Dark]]'', 1968)

'''''Avis de réception''''' (English: Advice or acknowledgment of receipt) is a postal service returning to the sender a form or card signed by the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/20130513/refreshercourse.aspx ''Challenge of acknowledgment of receipt stamps is use on cover''] by Janet Klug, linns.com, 13 May 2013. Retrieved 6 October 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6KAty6Ipi Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described in the ''Convention for exchange of postal parcels of the International Postal Union'', reprinted in [https://archive.org/details/cu31924030132470 ''Parcel post in foreign countries''] Washington: [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], 1912, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidence that the letter was received, and these forms (or cards) are frequently seen with legal endorsements. It had existed under various names in some postal entities as early as the late 18th century, and was adopted by the GPU [[General Postal Union]] in 1875, and again by its successor, the UPU [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1879.

Equivalent terms include ''Aviso de Recibo'', acknowledgment of receipt (Canada), advice of receipt, advice of delivery (UK and much of the Commonwealth), return receipt requested/required/wanted/demanded (US), ''Rückschein'' (Germany), ''ricevuta di ritorno'' (Italy), ''zwrotne potwierdzenie odbioru'' (Poland), ''Aviso de Recepcion'' (Salvador 1897 stamps),&lt;ref name=hodd&gt;Patrick, Douglas &amp; Mary. ''The Hodder Stamp Dictionary''. London: [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]], 1973, p. 16. {{ISBN|0340171839}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. The term ''accusé de réception'' is sometimes seen, although it is inaccurate. The standard abbreviations are AR and AD.

==Collecting==
While obscure in some countries (such as Canada, Great Britain, and Australia), AR has always been very popular in others, including India, France and its [[DOM-TOM|territories]], and especially the United States. There is a great deal of [[postal history]] material associated with the AR service: [[postmarks]], AR forms &amp; cards, AR covers, AR covering envelopes for returning AR forms (in use until the early to middle 1920s), rates, and practices. The service is still offered by many national post offices and [[postal stationery]] continues to be issued in connection with it.&lt;ref&gt;"Registration Stamps, but not as we Know Them!

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Biliary sludge may cause complications such as [[biliary colic]], [[acute cholecystitis]], [[acute cholangitis]], and [[acute pancreatitis]].&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of biliary sludge formation is likely related to gallbladder dysmotility.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt; It is presumed that because the gallbladder is unable to effectively empty, the biliary sludge can start to accumulate.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt;

==Cause==
Biliary sludge has been associated with [[pregnancy]], rapid weight loss, [[total parenteral nutrition]], drugs such as [[ceftriaxone]] and [[octreotide]], solid [[organ transplantation]], and gastric surgery.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt; In many of these conditions, it is thought that the impairment in the contractility of the gallbladder leads to the formation of the sludge.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Gallbladder hepatization.jpg|thumb|Gallbladder hepatization, which is biliary sludge filling the entire gallbladder, giving it an [[echogenicity]] similar to the [[liver]] (seen at left). The patient had a stone in the [[cystic duct]].]]
Biliary sludge is typically diagnosed by [[CT scan]] or [[transabdominal ultrasonography]].&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt; [[Endoscopic ultrasound|Endoscopic ultrasonography]] is another more [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] option. However, the [[gold standard]] is considered to be direct microscopy of aspirated gallbladder bile.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt; This method is much more sensitive, although it is less practical.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt;

==Treatment==
For patients without symptoms, no treatment is recommended. If patients become symptomatic and/or develop complications, [[cholecystectomy]] is indicated.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt; For those who are poor surgical candidates, [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] sphincterotomy may be performed to reduce the risk of developing [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt;
==Prognosis==
The clinical course of biliary sludge can do one of three things: (1) it can resolve completely, (2) wax and wane, or (3) progress to [[gallstone]]s.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MerckManuals"/&gt; If the biliary sludge has a cause (e.g. pregnancy), it oftentimes is resolved when the underlying cause is removed.&lt;ref name="MerckManuals"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of biliary sludge is low in the general population.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt; It has been reported that the prevalence ranges from 0-0.20% in men and 0.18-0.27% in women.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt; However, in patients with certain conditions, the prevalence may be higher.&lt;ref name="Pazzi"/&gt;

'''Binji''' is a [[Bantu language]] of eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Maho (2009) states that it is close to [[Songe language|Songe]], which is otherwise isolated within the [[Luban languages]] established by Ahmed (1995).&lt;ref name=Nurse&gt;Nurse &amp; Phillipson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature it has been confused with [[Mbagani language|Mbagani]], which goes by the same name. For instance, Guthrie assigned code L.22 "Binji" to what Maho labels Mbagani; in Maho, true Binji is L.231. The two languages are separated by 200&amp;nbsp;km.

[[The Village Voice]], August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Bishop has been interested in languages since childhood. After having studied French, Spanish and Latin (he later supported the ''Latinitas Viva'' or Living Latin movement), he came into contact with constructed auxiliary languages such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Volapük]]. He started a long correspondence with [[Arie de Jong]], the reformer of the Volapük language, and with the previous cifals Johann Schmidt and F. J. Krüger. He learned Volapük, and became a subscriber and contributor to the ''Volapükagased: Zänagased pro Volapükanef'' (Volapük Journal: Central Journal for Volapükists), where he published several of his translations. In 1979, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the creation of Volapük, Brian Bishop wrote to a number of newspapers and radio stations to mention the fact, which led to some attention being given to it. Encouraged by the ensuing interest, he created the Zänabür Volapüka (Volapük Central Office), where he collected many Volapük memorabilia (mostly from F. J. Krüger's collection). In 1981, he became vice-Cifal (via an edict by Cifal Krüger dated October 13, 1981), and two years later he became Cifal (via an edict by Cifal Krüger dated January 1, 1984).

Currently, Brian Bishop is involved in the reorganization of the Kadäm Volapüka (Academy of Volapük) and of the Volapük Movement, for which he has published new statutes. Its first official activities started in 2007. He is also a participant in the Volapük discussion group, which unites most living Volapükists.

The '''''Case of Proclamations''''' [1610] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1610/J22.html EWHC KB J22] was a court decision during the reign of [[King James VI and I]] (1603-1625) which defined some limitations on the [[Royal Prerogative]] at that time. Principally, it established that the Monarch could make laws only through Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;A Bradley and K Ewing, Constitutional and Administrative Law London (1997) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment began to set out the principle in [[English law]] (later developed by future [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments]] and other members of the judiciary in subsequent cases, for example ''[[Dr. Bonham's Case]]'') that when a case involving an alleged exercise of prerogative power came before the courts, the courts could determine:

* whether the proclaimed prerogative existed in law and how far it extended;
* whether it had been limited by statute, and if so, in what way; and
* whether there was any requirement that [[The Crown]] pay compensation after the exercise of the prerogative.

== Abstract ==
Tudor monarchs believed that they had the power to regulate, through the issue of royal [[proclamations]], without the consent of Parliament. However, the monarch's absolute power to "make" the law was beginning to be challenged by the English judiciary and was raising concern in Parliament itself. The issue of the King's power to make law came before the judges in 1610 when James I and Parliament were struggling over the issue of [[impositions]]. Parliament was opposing the King's power to impose further duties on imports over and above what had already been sanctioned by Parliament. James however hoped to use proclamations to raise further money outside of Parliament. 

On 20 September 1610, Sir [[Edward Coke]], then [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], was called before the [[Privy Council of England]] alongside Lord Chief Justice [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Thomas Fleming]], Lord Chief Baron [[Lawrence Tanfield]], and Baron [[James Altham]] and asked to give a legal opinion as to whether the King, by proclamation, might prohibit new buildings in [[London]], or the making of starch or wheat, these having been referred to the King by the House of Commons as grievances and against law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/911#lf0462-01_head_131 Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard] (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003). Vol. 1. 3/31/2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke asked for time to consider with other judges, since the questions were "of great importance, and they concerned the answer of the king to the Commons".&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Philip Hamburger, ''Law and Judicial Duty'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Coke and his fellow judges ruled that the power of the King to create new offences was outlawed and that the King could not by proclamation prohibit new buildings in and around London; i.e., the Royal Prerogative could not be extended into areas not previously sanctioned by law:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the King cannot change any part of the common law, nor create any offence, by his proclamation, which was not an offence before, without parliament.&lt;ref name="bailii.org"&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1610/J22.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In giving his judgment, Chief Justice Coke set out the principle that the King had no power to declare new offences by proclamation:

{{quote|The King has no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him.&lt;ref name="bailii.org"/&gt;}}

Consequently, the King had no power by which to arbitrarily, through royal proclamations, prohibit the erection of new buildings in London, nor the making of wheat starch without the consent of Parliament, because this power had not previously been granted by Parliament to the King by the making of statute law. James however did not concede this point and attempted to place all of his proclamations on a constitutional footing, having them published in a book as if they were statutes. He went to argue that proclamations were necessary to "apply speedy, proper, and convenient remedies ... in matters so variable and irregular in their nature, as are not provided for by Law, nor can fitly fall under the certain rule of a law".&lt;ref&gt;James I, ''A Book of Proclamations'' and quoted by Philip Hamburger, ''Law and Judicial Duty'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
=== 17th century ===
In future English history, the issue of proclamations would form part of the many grievances and issues in dispute between both James I and Charles I and their Parliaments before the English Civil War. MPs would go on to cite Coke's judgment in the ''[[Case of Impositions]]'' to support their arguments against the arbitrary use of royal power in the years up to 1641. Whilst disputed, the case is seen by some historians and jurists as influential in the development of the concept of [[judicial review]] in [[English common law]]. However, the issue about the extent of the royal prerogative was not properly resolved until the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] "established that the powers of the Crown were subject to law, and there were no powers of the Crown which could not be taken away or controlled by statute".&lt;ref&gt;A Bradley and K Ewing, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' London (1997) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exiting the European Union ===
{{Further| R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union}}
Over 400 years on, the Case of Proclamations continues to affect the constitutional law of the UK. It was cited by a [[Divisional Court]] of the High Court in its landmark [[judicial review]] decision, ''Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union'',&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union'' (3 November 2016) [2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin)&lt;/ref&gt; concerning whether the UK government had the power, under the Crown's [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom#Foreign affairs|foreign affairs prerogative]], to serve a notice triggering [[Brexit]] following the "leave" vote in the 2016 [[EU Referendum]].  The Divisional Court cited two principles from the Case of Proclamations: 
* that "the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm"; and 
* that "the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him".  
The Divisional Court unanimously rejected the government's argument in robust terms (which were subsequently upheld by a majority of the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]). The court concluded that the government did not have the right to rely on [[royal prerogative]] to serve a notice pursuant to Article 50 of the [[Treaty on European Union]], triggering the formal process for the UK to leave the EU. The court added that, because Brexit would directly affect substantive legal rights under UK domestic law, only Parliament could decide whether to serve such a notice.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court, Article 50 "Brexit" Appeal.[https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/article-50-brexit-appeal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SC Transcript, 8 December 2016, p.204.[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant bearing, decreasing range''' (CBDR) is a term in [[navigation]] which means that some object, usually another [[ship]] viewed from the deck or bridge of one's own ship, is getting closer but maintaining the same relative [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]].  If this continues, the objects will collide.&lt;ref name="Peppe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peppe |first1=Kevin (Commander, US Navy) |title=Constant Bearing, Decreasing Range|journal=US Naval Institute Proceedings |date=December 1996 |volume=122 |issue=12/1 |page=126 |url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1996-12/constant-bearing-decreasing-range}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Logan |first1=Doug|title=Collision Course with a Crossing Boat?

==Risk==
Sailors, especially deck hands and those who [[Watchstanding|stand watch]] on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], are trained to watch for this situation and make it known when they detect it happening.  The reasoning is subtle: non-sailors who are used to driving automobiles normally are able to detect the possible risk of a collision with implicit reference to the background (e.g., the street, the scenery, the landscape, etc.)  At sea, when vessels are borne in water, the sea surface removes this vital visual clue.  Unaware individuals tend to gauge the risk of two vessels colliding based on which direction each vessel is heading.  In other words, a novice will think that two vessels which appear to be heading apart from each other cannot collide.  This is false, as when a faster vessel is overtaking a slower one, they can in fact have a collision even though the vessels are on substantially different headings.

On a river, CBDR is less useful, as it is likely that both the observed and the observing vessel will follow curving courses along the waterway, whether or not they are on a collision course. In such situations safe navigation depends on upstream and downstream traffic keeping to separate sectors of the navigable channel.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Gregory L. (Captain)|title=For river pilots, tri-sectoring most effective way to determine collision risk|journal=Professional Mariner|date=February 2017|issue=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual clues==

When a non-moving background (typically the shore line) is present, CBDR situations can be recognized by the fact that some part of the moving target vessel is not visually moving against the background. On the other hand, if the target vessel visually moves forward against the background, with relative bearing decreasing, then the target vessel will pass in front of the observing vessel and there is no risk of collision, provided both vessels maintain constant speed and course.  Similarly, if the target vessel visually moves backwards against the background, with relative bearing increasing, the target vessel will pass behind the observing vessel. However, this method of recognizing non-CBDR conditions is only true for relatively small observing vessels. With larger vessels, only an observer positioned near the bow can reliably make the first conclusion, whereas the second conclusion can only be left to an observer positioned near the stern.

==Relative bearing==
Another source of confusion arises from the distinction between ''[[relative bearing]]'' and ''[[absolute bearing]]''.  One might think that another vessel which seems to be progressing from, perhaps, dead ahead to apparent movement down one's [[starboard]] side cannot result in a collision.  This is not quite true.  Because a vessel afloat can change its true heading (relative to north) without obvious detection (unless there are landmarks in sight) two vessels may collide even if one presents a substantially changing relative bearing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">"'''Cow demons and snake spirits'''" (牛鬼蛇神) is a Chinese term coined by the [[Tang dynasty]] poet [[Du Mu]] (803–852) when he wrote the preface of a poetry collection by [[Li He]] (791–817). Du Mu used this term to praise the fantastical elements in Li He's poetry.

In the early 1960s, [[Mao Zedong]] (who was a huge admirer of Li He) frequently used this term in speeches to refer to reactionary elements and "class enemies". In 1966, after [[Chen Boda]] (the leader of the [[Cultural Revolution Group]]) took over the newspaper and official government organ ''[[People's Daily]]'', an editorial titled "Sweep Away All Cow Demons and Snake Spirits" (横扫一切牛鬼蛇神) appeared on June 1, 1966, which called for a nationwide struggle against these elements. "Cow demons and snake spirits" became one of the most popular terms during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), a term used to denounce and dehumanize any "enemy", real or perceived. The exact definition of the term (like most things in the Cultural Revolution) was unclear and subject to arbitrary interpretation, but the major enemies of the Cultural Revolution were:

*[[Five Black Categories]] - Landlords, rightists, rich farmers, counter revolutionaries, and "bad elements"
*[[Capitalist roader]]s
*[[Stinking Old Ninth]]s (intellectuals)
*''[[Hanjian]]'' (traitors)

Illegal prisons during the Cultural Revolution were called "'''cowsheds'''" (牛棚), and exiles [[down to the Countryside Movement|to the countryside]] were sometimes called "down to cowsheds" (下牛棚).

[[File:Simon Mignolet - Gerrard testimonial 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Simon Mignolet]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]] goalkeeper.]] 
In many team [[sport]]s which involve scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]], the '''goalkeeper''' (termed '''goaltender,''' '''netminder''', '''goalie''' or '''keeper''' in some sports) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by intercepting shots at goal. Such positions exist in [[hurling]], [[shinty]], [[association football]], [[Gaelic football]], [[international rules football]], [[team handball|handball]], [[field hockey]], [[bandy]], [[rink bandy]], [[rinkball]], [[floorball]], [[roller hockey]], [[ice hockey]], [[ringette]],  [[water polo]], [[lacrosse]], [[camogie]], and other sports.

Usually special rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper, being an obvious target for dangerous or even violent actions.  In certain sports like ice hockey and lacrosse, goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g. a puck). In some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players; in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player, but may also handle it in a restricted area. In other sports goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field where they may be; in the [[NHL]], for example, goalkeepers may not play the puck in [[Ice hockey rink#Goaltender trapezoid|the restricted areas behind the net]] or take the puck across the [[Ice hockey rink#Lines|red line]]. Goalkeepers  are usually the tallest players on the field.

==Examples==

===Association football===
{{Main|Goalkeeper (association football)}}
[[File:Soccer Youth Goal Keeper.jpg|thumb|Youth-football goalkeeper]]
In [[association football|football]], each team's goalkeeper defends his/her team's goal and has special privileges within the game. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. 
The goalkeeper is the only player in the side who may use his or her hands and arms to catch, throw and save the ball, but only within his/her own [[penalty area]]. Goalkeepers are required to wear a distinctive color jersey, separate from the referee's jersey color and either team's regular jersey color, so the referee can easily identify them. There are no other specific requirements, but goalkeepers are usually allowed to wear additional protective gear such as padded clothing. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves to protect their hands and enhance their grip of the ball.  Like every player on the pitch, they are required to wear shin guards.

The goalkeeper is allowed to catch the ball, and is also allowed to punch or deflect the ball away from the goal. The goalkeeper generally has a significant advantage on a ball high in the air, as 
he or she can raise their arms and play the ball before an attacker can attempt a header. When the keeper picks up the ball, they are allowed to kick it or throw it, or to place it on the ground and play it with his feet. The official [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] stipulate that once the goalkeeper has picked up the ball, he or she must redistribute it within six seconds; however, referees often use their discretion as long as the goalkeeper is not obviously attempting to waste time. Once the keeper establishes possession of the ball, opposing players are not allowed to attempt to play the ball and must give the goalkeeper room to attempt a kick.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} If a ball is in the air and both the goalkeeper and a field player of the opposing team are challenging for the ball, advantage usually goes to the goalkeeper because he or she is not able to protect themselves.

Though the goalkeeper is generally allowed to use their hands in the penalty box area, they are not allowed to use their hands on balls that have been intentionally kicked to them by a teammate (it does not actually have to go backwards).  In such situations, the goalkeeper may play the ball with their feet, but cannot pick the ball up. The rule applies only to a ball which is actually kicked. A ball which is headed or otherwise not kicked may be picked up by the goalkeeper without penalty.  An infringement of this rule results in an indirect kick to the opposing team. The referee has some discretion in making this call.  For example, a ball which is merely deflected by a teammate may still be picked up by the goalkeeper.  The "back-pass" rule has been followed in international football and in most professional and amateur leagues since the early 1990s, but leagues for younger players may choose not to enforce the rule.  The back pass rule is listed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game.

As the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as the organizer of the team when it is defending, such as on a free kick or a corner kick. This means the goalkeeper needs to be loud, with a voice that can project over the defensive area of the pitch.  In turn, the players on their team need to be able to listen and respond to directions called to them.

===Field hockey===
[[Image:M060519 vit vipers-dragons 0071.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A field hockey goalkeeper]]
In [[field hockey]], the goalkeeper generally wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, face and neck guards, chest and leg padding, arm or elbow protectors, special gloves (the left glove is designed purely to block the ball, the right glove also has this function but in addition is designed to permit the goalkeeper to hold and use his or her stick), lower leg guards (known as pads) and shoe covers (known as kickers). The gloves, pads and kickers are almost always made of special high density foam material that both protects the goalkeeper and has excellent rebound qualities.  He or she is also equipped with a stick; either one designed for goalies or one as used for normal play.  Specialist goalkeeper sticks must conform to the same dimensional limitations as field players' sticks but are designed for optimal use with one hand and for blocking rather than hitting the ball.  From 2007 teams may elect to play with 11 field players, and no-one has the privileges of a goalkeeper.  If a goalkeeper is used, they fall into one of two categories: a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, unless they are nominated to take a penalty stroke against the opposing goalkeeper, wear a different colored shirt and at least foot and leg guards (arm and upper-body protection is optional); or they may opt to wear only a helmet. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to play or deflect the ball, although they can't obstruct its play (for example by lying on top of it), and they can only do so within the goal circle (or "D").  Outside the D they are subject to the same rules as field players and may only use their stick to play the ball.  Goalkeepers who are wearing a helmet are not permitted to pass their team's 23 m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes. However a goalkeeper who has elected to wear only a helmet is permitted to remove it and provided it is not left on the field of play, they may take part in the game in any part of the pitch, and retain their goalkeeping privileges, even if they do not have time to replace the helmet before making a save.  It is compulsory to wear a helmet when defending a penalty stroke or [[penalty corner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-177698-194916-110316-0-file,00.pdf|title=Rules of Hockey 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008|author=[[Hockey Rules Board]]|publisher=[[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH)|format=pdf|pages=Rules: Rule 4, Players' clothing and equipment, paras 4.3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4.4, page 15; Rule 10, Conduct of play : goalkeepers, all paras, page 24|nopp=yes|year=2007|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |title=2008 FIH Outdoor Umpires Briefing |work=FIH website |format=pdf |author=FIH Umpiring Committee |publisher=FIH |pages=11Ã¢â‚¬â€œ13 |date=January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202000007/http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floorball===
In [[floorball]], the goalkeeper defends his team's goal and has special privileges within the game. He is the only player who may use his hands to play the ball. Goalkeepers do not have sticks, and they move in the goal crease on their knees, attempting to save the shots on goal. When the goalkeeper has possession of the ball, he has 3 seconds to throw it back into the game. He may not control the ball outside of his crease, except when kicking it. Goalkeepers are an essential part of starting plays, as they can throw the ball for a quick offensive chance. When throwing, the ball has to touch the goalkeeper's own side first before crossing the center line. Goalkeepers are also important in organizing their team's games, as they see the whole field better. Any contact against the goalkeeper (slashing, interference etc.) will result in a free shot or a 2-minute penalty. Like in [[ice hockey]], the goalkeeper may be substituted for an extra attacker, if a delayed penalty occurs, or if his team needs a goal to tie the game in the final moments of the game. Goalkeepers may score goals, although this is not the case in some leagues. In floorball games, more goals are often scored than in, for example, ice hockey, because of the extremely quick tempo of the game and fast shots.

The only mandatory equipment for goalkeepers are masks, goalie-shirts, goalie-pants and shoes. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves. They may also optionally wear other protective equipment, such as knee pads, elbow-guards, shin-guards, jocks and torso armor. In some junior/independent leagues, many goalkeepers don't even wear goalie-shirts, but hooded tops.

===Gaelic football===
In [[Gaelic football]], the goalie's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team's goal. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalie is the only player who may handle the ball on the ground, and only inside the small rectangle.

===Gridiron football===
The term "goal-tend" was used in early descriptions of [[American football positions]] to describe the defensive position farthest back from the [[line of scrimmage]]. Eventually the term became obsolete and was replaced by the term ''defensive [[fullback (gridiron football)|fullback]]'', then to its modern term ''[[free safety]]'' (or ''[[return specialist|punt returner]]'' in kicking situations). Unlike in soccer or Gaelic football, the goal-tend/safety does not physically protect the goalposts, as they are elevated above the ground and mostly out of the reach of any player. Also unlike other codes of football, goal-tends have no special ball-handling privileges.

One situation in which a goalkeeper-like responsibility can arise is in [[Canadian football]], where a [[single (football)|single point]] is awarded for a kicked ball that is not returned out of the [[end zone]]. While standard practice is for defending teams to concede the single point, situations often arise where conceding that point could jeopardize a lead. A goal-tend can thus be employed to recover the ball and either return it out of the end zone or, generally if it is in the closing seconds of a game, [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]] the ball back into play or [[out of bounds]] to ensure the point is not conceded.

===Hurling===
In [[hurling]], the goalkeeper's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team's goal. He also takes "puckouts" after a score or wide ball. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalkeeper has one special rule pertaining to him, opposing players may not directly physically challenge him while he is in possession of the ball in the small parallelogram, although they may harass him, while if he leaves the small parallelogram he is subject to the same rules as all other players. He wears a different color [[jersey]], e.g., if a team has blue jerseys with white font, the goalkeeper will wear a white jersey of the same design with blue font. Most goalkeepers use a special [[Hurley (stick)|hurley]] with a wider ''bas'' (flat face) to aid shot-stopping.

===Bandy===
[[File:Kirill Chvalko.jpg|thumb|[[Kirill Khvalko]] of [[Dynamo Moscow Bandy Club|Dynamo Moscow]] attempting a save]]
In [[bandy]], the goalkeeper defends his team's goal and has special privileges within the game, which is regulated in section 6 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the [[Federation of International Bandy]]&lt;ref name="bandy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf |title=Bandy Playing Rules |publisher=Federation of International Bandy |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. He is allowed to hold the ball for six seconds before he has to release it. He may drop it to a defender or chuck it directly into attack.

If the ball passes the goal line, it is followed by different actions: 
* If the ball is last touched by a defender, the reaction is an [[own goal]] if the ball goes between the goalposts. 
* If it passes outside the goalposts, the reaction is a [[Bandy#Ball in and out of play|corner stroke]]. 
* If last touched by an attacker's stick, and passes between the posts, the reaction is a goal, or 
* a disallowed goal (offside or an infringement from the attacking team). 
* If the ball passes from an attacker over the goal line outside the goalposts, the goalkeeper may retrieve a new ball from a cage hanging on the goal's either side, and put the new ball in play with no signal from the referees.

The goalkeeper is the only player who may use his or her hands to play the ball (although only within the [[penalty area]]). According to Rule 6.1 the goalkeeper is required to wear a jersey with a different color from either team's jersey color to avoid confusion for the referee. Goalkeepers wear padded gloves to aid in catching the ball, large shinpads, a padded sweater, and a helmet with a face mask.&lt;ref name=bandy/&gt;

He is the only player in the team who can pass the ball to a teammate by aid of his skates. The team might have a reserve goalkeeper, and the two may switch at any time during the game, without the need to notify the referee. There is no time-out in bandy, but an exception is sometimes made when the goalkeeper is hurt, especially if they don't have a designated reserve keeper.

As the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as an organizer of the team when it is defending, especially for free strokes against them.

===Ice hockey===
{{Main|Goaltender}}
Known as the "goaltender" in [[ice hockey]], the player defends their team's goal net by stopping [[shot (hockey)|shots]] of the [[Puck (sports)|puck]] from entering the net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the ''goal crease'' (often referred to simply as '' the crease'' or ''the net''). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any one time.

===International rules football===
In [[International rules football]], a hybrid game between [[Australian rules football]] (which does not have a goalkeeper) and [[Gaelic football]], the goalkeeper's main task is to prevent a goal from being scored. A goal occurs when the ball comes off any part of an attacking player and passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 6 points.

===Field lacrosse===
{{Main|Goaltender (field lacrosse)}}

In men's [[field lacrosse]], the designated goalkeeper is allowed to have a stick from 40inches to 72inches long and the head of a goalkeeper's crosse may measure up to 12inches wide. This is significantly larger than field players' heads to assist in blocking shots. Once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in his crosse (stick), he may only remain in possession of the ball inside the protective crease for four seconds (the length may depend on the level of play). Before the four seconds is up, the goalkeeper must either pass the ball or leave the crease. After leaving, he may not re-enter the crease with possession of the ball.

While inside the crease (nine feet in radius), offensive players may not make contact with the goalie or his stick. Doing so is declared "goalie interference" and is penalized by a free clear to the half field line. (There is a significant difference between NCAA/MLL rules and international rules regarding a pass while the goalkeeper is inside the crease: under NCAA/MLL rules, contact with a goalie's stick while in the act of passing, even after the ball is released, is prohibited and considered interference. Under international rules, protection ends when possession ends. Therefore, contact with a goalie's stick after the ball is released, is legal.) In addition, a goalie is allowed to make contact with the ball with his hand, although he is not allowed to control it or pick it up.

In [[women's lacrosse]],  once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in her crosse, she may remain in possession of the ball inside the crease for ten seconds. The interference rule is similar to men's lacrosse; unlike in the men's game, a woman goalkeeper is allowed to control or even pick up the ball in her hand.

In both men's and women's lacrosse, goalkeepers are required to wear a helmet and 4-point chinstrap, a throat protector, gloves, and a chest protector. Use of a protective cup is, for obvious reasons, required in the men's game; thigh pads and shinguards are also being required for women goalkeepers as of 2007. Although they are permitted to, few goalkeepers elect to wear optional protective equipment, including elbow and shoulder pads, thigh pads and shin guards, and long sweat pants.

===Box lacrosse===
{{Main|Goaltender (box lacrosse)}}

Since the creation of indoor or [[box lacrosse]] in the 1930s, a unique form of lacrosse goaltender was formed for the different dynamics of lacrosse on an ice-less ice hockey pad.

===Water polo===
{{Main|Goalkeeper (water polo)}}
[[File:Water Polo Eggbeater.jpg|thumb|Goalie eggbeatering (also known as froggy-kicking) (also known as water-jumping) up to block a shot.]]
Goalkeepers in [[water polo]] are granted some special privileges when inside the five meter area:

* The ability to touch the ball with two hands.
* The ability to stand (that is, if he can. Most Water polo pools are at least two meters deep)
* The ability to punch the ball with a clenched fist

However, they have one limitation that field players do not have: they may not cross the half-distance line.

Rule change in 2006:

The four and seven meter lines were merged to a five-meter line. A goalie may now under revised rules:
* Go beyond the 5m line according to the field rules (one hand) and not pass the half line.
* Use two hands

New cap rules:
* A goalie cap must now be in quarters alternating red/dark for home and red/white for away
* The goalie must be number 1, 13, or 15
* For females: a red swim cap must be worn under the goalie cap, a team's dark swim cap is no longer acceptable as it is hard to distinguish a goalie from field players if official cap is off.

These revisions are according to the NFHS 2006-2007 swimming/diving and water polo rulebook. USWP and NCAA rules may vary slightly.

The water polo goalkeeper is the least protected goalkeeper with no gloves or body protection.

=== Handball===
{{main|Handball goalkeeper}}
In [[handball]], the [[Handball goalkeeper|goalkeeper]] is the only player in the team who is allowed to stay in the 6-meter zone throughout the whole competition. A goalkeeper is allowed to save the ball with all parts of his body, including two hands, trunks, two legs and so on, only within the defending 6-meter zone.

Whenever the ball is left on the ground within the 6-meter zone, the goalkeeper owns the possession of the ball; while whenever the ball is in the air above the 6-meter zone, the opponent can still jump in to grasp the ball without stepping in the 6-meter zone.

A goalkeeper can participate in offense by long-passing the ball to a teammate in the opposing half court for a fast-break score.

Common handball goalkeeper clothing:
*Long-sleeve jersey
*Long trousers
*Any body protection (such as base layer or protective cup)

=== Netball ===
{{main|Rules of netball#Positions}}

In [[netball]], the Goal Keeper (denoted GK) must stay within the defensive third of the court.  A goal keeper is one of four positions allowed within the shooting circle (along with the Goal Defence, Goal Attack and Goal Shooter).  The Goal Keeper often matches up against the opposing side's Goal Shooter.

==Goalkeepers on coins and postage stamps==
[[File:2004 Austria 5 Euro 100 Years Football back.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2004 coinage|100 Years of Football Coin]]]]
Goalkeepers have been used on some collectors' coins and medals such as the [[Austria]]n 5 euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2004 coinage|100 years of football coin]] that was minted on 12 May 2004. The coin depicts a successful shot by a footballer, shown in the background, with the ball just passing the goalkeeper (still in the air) into the goal.

{{Translation sidebar}}

In [[computing]], '''internationalization and localization''' are means of adapting [[computer software]] to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target locale.&lt;ref name="SFW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Software Without Frontiers: A multi-platform, multi-cultural, multi-nation approach|isbn=9780471969747|editors=Patrick A.V. Hall, Martyn A. Ould|others=With contributions and leadership by Ray Hudson, Costas Spyropoulos, Timo Honkela et al.|publisher=Wiley|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding [[Locale (computer software)|locale]]-specific components. Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once, or as an integral part of ongoing development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bert Esselink|url=http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Localization|series=Guide to Localization|publisher=Multilingual Computing and Technology|year=2003|quote=In a nutshell, localization revolves around combining language and technology to produce a product that can cross cultural and language barriers. No more, no less.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907235057/http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the [[numeronym]]s '''''i18n''''' (where ''18'' stands for the number of letters between the first ''i'' and the last ''n'' in the word ''internationalization'', a usage coined at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the 1970s or 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/2001/12/Glossary#I18N | title=Glossary of W3C Jargon | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] | accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html | title=Origin of the Abbreviation I18n }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''L10n'' for ''localization'', due to the length of the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n | title=Localization vs. Internationalization| publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies, like [[IBM]] and [[Sun Microsystems]], use the term "globalization", ''g11n'', for the combination of internationalization and localization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/|title=IBM  Globalization|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "[[glocalization]]" (a [[portmanteau]] of ''globalization'' and ''localization'').

[[Microsoft]] defines internationalization as a combination of world-readiness and localization. World-readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures (globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format (localizability, abbreviated to ''L12y'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688110.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688112.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[HP-UX]] created a system called "National Language Support" or "Native Language Support" (NLS) to produce localizable software.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Globalisationchart.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The internationalization and localization process&lt;br&gt;(based on a chart from the [[Localization Industry Standards Association|LISA]] website)]]

According to ''Software without frontiers'', the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are "data encoding, data and documentation, software construction, hardware device support, user interaction"; while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are "user interaction, algorithm design and data formats, software services, documentation".&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

Translation is typically the most time-consuming component of [[language localization]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; This may involve:
* For film, video, and audio, translation of spoken words or music lyrics, often using either [[Dub localization|dubbing]] or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]
* Text translation for printed materials, digital media (possibly including error messages and documentation)
* Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Different translation length and differences in character sizes (e.g. between [[Latin alphabet]] letters and [[Chinese characters]]) can cause layouts that work well in one language to work poorly in others&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Consideration of differences in [[dialect]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Writing conventions like:
** Formatting of numbers (especially [[decimal separator]] and [[digit grouping]])
** [[Date and time representation by country|Date and time format]], possibly including use of different calendars

=== Standard locale data ===

[[Computer software]] can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, because computer programs can generate content dynamically.  These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation. Many of these differences are so regular that a conversion between languages can be easily automated. The [[Common Locale Data Repository]] by [[Unicode]] provides a collection of such differences. Its data is used by major [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Debian]], and by major Internet companies or projects such as [[Google]] and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Examples of such differences include:
* Different "scripts" in different [[writing systems]] use different [[Character (symbol)|characters]] - a different set of letters, syllograms, logograms, or symbols.  Modern systems use the [[Unicode]] standard to represent many different languages with a single [[character encoding]].
* [[Writing direction]] is left to right in most European languages, right-to-left in Hebrew and Arabic, or both in [[boustrophedon]] scripts, and optionally vertical in some Asian languages.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* [[Complex text layout]], for languages where characters change shape depending on context
* Capitalization exists in some scripts and not in others
* Different languages and writing systems have different [[Collation|text sorting]] rules
* Different languages have different [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral systems]], which might need to be supported if [[Western Arabic numerals]] are not used
* Different languages have different pluralization rules, which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/gettext/Plural-forms.html|title=GNU gettext utilities: Plural forms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other grammar rules might also vary, e.g. [[genitive]].
* Different languages use different punctuation (e.g. quoting text using double-quotes (" ") as in English, or [[guillemet]]s (« ») as in French)
* [[Keyboard shortcut]]s can only make use of buttons actually on the [[keyboard layout]] which is being localized for.  If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language (e.g. Ctrl-s stands for "save" in English), it may need to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/do-we-need-to-localize-keyboard-shortcuts/ languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403113353/http://languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/do-we-need-to-localize-keyboard-shortcuts/ |date=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National conventions ===

Different  countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:
* [[Paper size]]s
* [[Broadcast television systems]] and popular [[storage media]]
* [[National conventions for writing telephone numbers|Telephone number formats]]
* [[Address (geography)#Mailing address format by country|Postal address formats]], [[postal code]]s, and choice of delivery services
* [[Currency]] ([[Currency symbol|symbols]], positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different [[inflation]] histories) - [[ISO 4217]] codes are often used for internationalization
* [[System of measurement]]
* [[Battery sizes]]
* [[Mains electricity by country|Voltage and current standards]]
In particular, the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases. Other areas often follow one of these.

Specific third-party services, such as online maps, weather reports, or [[payment service provider]]s, might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.

[[Time zone]]s vary across the world, and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone.  For internationalization, [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.

Different countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:
* [[Compliance (regulation)|Regulatory compliance]] may require customization for a particular jurisdiction, or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
** [[Privacy law]] compliance
** Additional [[disclaimer]]s on a web site or packaging
** Different consumer labelling requirements
** Compliance with [[export restrictions]] and regulations on [[encryption]]
** Compliance with an [[Internet censorship]] regime or [[subpoena]] procedures
** Requirements for [[accessibility]]
** Collecting different taxes, such as [[sales tax]], [[value added tax]], or [[customs duties]]
** Sensitivity to different political issues, like [[:Category:Geographical naming disputes|geographical naming disputes]] and [[Border dispute|disputed borders]] shown on maps (e.g., India has proposed a controversial bill that would make failing to show [[Kashmir]] and other areas as intended by the government a crime&lt;ref name="HaiderPakistan16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1258908/pakistan-expresses-concern-over-indias-controversial-maps-bill |title=Pakistan expresses concern over India's controversial 'maps bill' |author=Haider, M. |work=Dawn |publisher=Pakistan Herald Publication (Pvt.) Ltd |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HamdaniChanging16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/34594/changing-maps-will-not-mean-kashmir-is-a-part-of-you-india/ |title=Changing maps will not mean Kashmir is a part of you, India |author=Hamdani, Y.L. |work=The Express Tribune Blogs |publisher=Express Tribune News Network |date=18 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CourierAnOver17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://madrascourier.com/policy/an-overview-of-the-geospatial-information-regulation-bill/ |title=An Overview Of The Geospatial Information Regulation Bill |author=Madrad Courier |work=Madras Courier |publisher=Vipra Holdings Ltd |date=24 July 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Government-assigned numbers have different formats (such as passports, [[Social Security Number]]s and other [[national identification number]]s)

Localization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:
* [[List of holidays by country|Local holidays]] 
* [[Personal name]] and [[title]] conventions
* [[Aesthetics]]
* Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and [[color symbolism]]
* [[Ethnicity]], clothing, and [[socioeconomic status]] of people and architecture of locations pictured
* Local customs and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], such as social taboos, popular local religions, or superstitions such as [[blood types in Japanese culture]] vs. astrological signs in other cultures

==Business process for internationalizing software==
In order to ''internationalize'' a product, it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

Details such as field length for street addresses, unique format for the address, ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states, plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ Internationalizing a Product: What is Internationalization (i18n), Localization (L10n) and Globalization (g11n)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114350/http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Address Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc195167.aspx|work=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader approach takes into account cultural factors regarding for example the adaptation of the business process logic or the inclusion of individual cultural (behavioral) aspects.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, J.M. (2008): Culture Profiles: Facilitating Global Learning and Knowledge Sharing. Proc.
of ICCE 2008, Taiwan, Nov. 2008.  [http://users.jyu.fi/~japawlow/culture_profiles_pawlowski_draft20080901.pdf Draft Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 1990s, companies such as [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] used [[machine translation]] ([[Systran]]) in large scale, for all their translation activity: human translators handled pre-editing (making the input machine-readable) and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

==Engineering==

Both in re-engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software, the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale-dependent part (whether code, text or data) into a separate module.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;!-- § 4.3.1 --&gt; Each module can then either rely on a standard library/dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale.

The current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource strings which are loaded during program execution as needed.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; These strings, stored in resource files, are relatively easy to translate. Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.

The storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One [[software library]] and format that aids this is [[gettext]].

Thus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also [[#Standard locale data|Standard locale data]] above.

Many localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, [[OpenOffice.org]] achieves this with compilation switches.

==Process==

A globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

To some degree (e.g. for [[quality assurance]]), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enable all the others.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.

Once properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: [[free and open source software]] usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Localization in Free Software: How Translations Are Performed|last=Reina|first=Laura Arjona|last2=Robles|first2=Gregorio|last3=González-Barahona|first3=Jesús M.|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642389276|editor-last=Petrinja|editor-first=Etiel|series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|pages=153–167|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|editor-last2=Succi|editor-first2=Giancarlo|editor-last3=Ioini|editor-first3=Nabil El|editor-last4=Sillitti|editor-first4=Alberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KDE3]] project, for example, has been translated into over 100 languages;&lt;ref&gt;For the current list see [http://l10n.kde.org/teams-list.php KDE.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MediaWiki]] in 270 languages, of which 100 mostly complete {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Group_statistics|title=Translating:Group statistics - translatewiki.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/58406/sponsored-feature-how-to-translate-a-game-into-20-languages-and-avoid-going-to-hell/|title=How to translate a game into 20 languages and avoid going to hell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.

==Commercial considerations==

In a commercial setting, the benefit from localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, [[Lotus 1-2-3]] took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over [[Microsoft Multiplan]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its [[WordStar]] documentation to, an executive said, not "have the tone it should have had".&lt;ref name="schrage19850217"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/02/17/ibm-wins-dominance-in-european-computer-market/bdcb9e21-8107-4dad-88d7-713f2709a8d8/ |title=IBM Wins Dominance in European Computer Market |last=Schrage |first=Michael |date=1985-02-17 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-08-29 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.

Finally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their own operations in the new languages, in order to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may thus never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.

'''Jörundur Garðars Hilmarsson''' (15 March 1946 – 13 August 1992), was an [[Iceland]]ic linguist, scholar and grammarian specializing in comparative grammar of [[Indo-European languages]].

He finished his doctoral thesis, ''Studies in Tocharian Phonology, Morphology and Etymology with special emphasis on the o-vocalism'' at the [[Leiden University]]. He gave great importance to the study of [[Tocharian languages]], authoring a detailed [[etymological dictionary]] for the language.

Jörundur also established the international scholarly journal ''[[Tocharian and Indo-European Studies]]'' (TIES) in 1987 and continued to head its editorial staff from [[Reykjavík]] until his premature death in 1992 at the age of 46.

Upon his death, ''Tocharian and Indo-European Studies'' moved from Reykjavík to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark with the Danish professor of Indo-European languages [[Jens Elmegård Rasmussen]] as the new executive editor. Upon Jörundur's death, the journal published most of his work in 1996 under the title: "Materials for a Tocharian Historical and Etymological Dictionary".

{{Infobox NC name|Khoe-i|Khoekhoen|Khoekhoegowab||The Khoe language}}

The '''Khoekhoe language''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔɪ|k|ɔɪ}}, ''Khoekhoegowab'', also known by the ethnic term '''Nama''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑː|m|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; and formerly as '''Hottentot''', is the most widespread of those non-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages of southern Africa that contain "click" sounds and have therefore been loosely classified as [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]. It belongs to the [[Khoe languages|Khoe language family]], and is spoken in [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], and [[South Africa]] by three ethnic groups, the [[Nama people|Nama]], [[Damara (people)|Damara]], and [[Haiǁom people|Haiǁom]].

It appears that the Damara picked up the language along with the Nama in Botswana, and that they migrated to Namibia separately from the Nama {{cn|date=August 2016}}. The Haiǁom, who had spoken a [[Juu languages|Juu language]], later shifted to Khoekhoe. The name for Nama speakers, ''[[Khoikhoi|Khoekhoen]]'', is from the Nama word ''khoe'' "person", with [[reduplication]] and the suffix ''-n'' to indicate the plural {{cn|date=August 2016}}. [[Georg Friedrich Wreede]] was the first European to study the language, after arriving in Cape Town in 1659 {{cn|date=August 2016}}.

Khoekhoe is a [[national language]] in Namibia, where it is used for teaching up to the university level as well as in the public administration {{cn|date=August 2016}}. In Namibia and South Africa, state-owned broadcasting corporations produce and broadcast radio programmes in Khoekhoegowab.

==Dialects==

Modern scholars generally see three dialects:  
*[[Nama people|Nama]]–[[Damara people|Damara]], incl. [[Sesfontein Damara]]
*[[Haiǁom dialect|Haiǁom]]
*[[ǂĀkhoe dialect|ǂĀkhoe]], itself a [[dialect cluster]], and intermediate between Haiǁom and the [[Kalahari Khoe languages]]

They are distinct enough that they might be considered two or three distinct languages {{cn|date=August 2016}}.

*[[Eini dialect|Eini]] (extinct) is also close but is now generally counted as a distinct language {{cn|date=August 2016}}.

==Phonology==
[[File:Nama man giving us a lesson in the click language (3694165852).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Nama people|Nama man]] giving lessons on the Khoekhoe language]]

===Vowels===
There are 5 vowel qualities, found as oral {{IPA|/i e a o u/}} and [[nasal vowel|nasal]] {{IPA|/ĩ ã ũ/}}. {{IPA|/u/}} is strongly rounded, {{IPA|/o/}} only slightly so. {{IPA|/a/}} is the only vowel with notable allophony; it is pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}} before {{IPA|/i/}} or  {{IPA|/u/}}.

===Tone===
Nama has been described as having three&lt;ref name=H&gt;Hagman (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; or four&lt;ref name=H&amp;E&gt;Haacke &amp; Eiseb (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haacke 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brugman 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, {{IPA|/á, ā, à/}} or {{IPA|/a̋, á, à, ȁ/}}, which may occur on each [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] (vowels and final [[nasal consonant]]s). The high tone is higher when it occurs on one of the high vowels ({{IPA|/í ú/}}) or on a nasal ({{IPA|/ń ḿ/}}) than on mid or low vowels ({{IPA|/é á ó/}}).&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

The tones combine into a limited number of 'tone melodies' ([[word tone]]s), which have [[sandhi]] forms in certain syntactic environments. The most important melodies, in their citation and main sandhi forms, are as follows:&lt;ref name=H&amp;E/&gt;

{|class="wikitable IPA"
!Citation!!Sandhi!!Meaning!!Melody
|-
|ǃ̃ˀȍm̀s ||ǃ̃ˀòm̏s ||butting, hitting s.t.||low
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|ǃ̃ˀȍḿs ||an udder||low rising
|-
|colspan=2 align=center|ǃ̃ˀòm̀s ||forcing out of a burrow||mid
|-
|ǃ̃ˀòm̋s ||ǃ̃ˀòm̀s ||a pollard ||high rising
|-
|ǃ̃ˀóm̀s ||ǃ̃ˀóm̏s ||coagulating, prizing out [a thorn]||low falling
|-
|ǃ̃ˀőḿs ||ǃ̃ˀóm̀s ||a fist||high falling
|}

===Stress===
Within a phrase, [[lexical word]]s receive greater stress than [[grammatical word]]s. Within a word, the first syllable receives the most stress. Subsequent syllables receive less and less stress and are spoken more and more quickly.

===Consonants===
Nama has 31 consonants: 20 clicks and only 11 non-clicks.

====Non-clicks====
{| class=wikitable
! || [[bilabial consonant|Bilabial]] || [[alveolar consonant|Alveolar]] || [[velar consonant|Velar]] || [[glottal consonant|Glottal]]
|-align=center
! [[nasal stop|Nasal]]

|-align=center
! [[fricative consonant|Fricative]] 
| || {{IPA|s}} || {{IPA|x}} || {{IPA|h}} 
|}
Between vowels, {{IPA|/p/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[β]}} and {{IPA|/t/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. The affricate series is strongly aspirated, and may be analysed phonemically as aspirated stops; in the related [[Korana language|Korana]] they are {{IPA|[tʰ, kʰ]}}.

Beach (1938)&lt;ref&gt;D. Beach, 1938. ''The Phonetics of the Hottentot Language''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the Khoehkoe of the time had a [[velar lateral ejective affricate]], {{IPA|[kʟ̝̊ʼ]}}, a common realisation or allophone of {{IPA|/kxʼ/}} in languages with clicks. This sound no longer occurs in Khoekhoe but remains in its cousin Korana.

{{Contains Khoekhoe text}}

====Clicks====
The [[click consonant|clicks]] are [[doubly articulated consonant]]s. Each click consists of one of four primary articulations or "influxes" and one of five secondary articulation or "effluxes". The combination results in 20 phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/vowels/chapter13/nama.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The aspiration on the aspirated clicks is often light but is 'raspier' than the aspirated nasal clicks, with a sound approaching the ''ch'' of Scottish ''loch''. The glottalised clicks are clearly voiceless due to the hold before the release, and they are transcribed as simple voiceless clicks in the traditional orthography. The nasal component is not audible in initial position; the voiceless nasal component of the aspirated clicks is also difficult to hear when not between vowels, so to foreign ears, it may sound like a longer but less raspy version of the contour clicks.

Tindall notes that European learners almost invariably pronounce the lateral clicks by placing the tongue against the side teeth and that this articulation is "harsh and foreign to the native ear". The Namaqua instead cover the whole of the palate with the tongue and produce the sound "as far back in the palate as possible".&lt;ref&gt;Tindal (1858) ''A grammar and vocabulary of the Namaqua-Hottentot language''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonotactics===
Lexical root words consist of two or rarely three [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]s, in the form CVCV(C), CVV(C), or CVN(C). (The initial consonant is required.) The middle consonant may only be ''w r m n'' (''w'' is ''b~p'' and ''r'' is ''d~t''), while the final consonant (C) may only be ''p, s, ts''. Each mora carries tone, but the second may only be high or medium, for six tone "melodies": HH, MH, LH, HM, MM, LM.

Oral vowel sequences in CVV are {{IPA|/ii ee aa oo uu ai [əi] ae ao au [əu] oa oe ui/}}. Due to the reduced number of nasal vowels, nasal sequences are {{IPA|/ĩĩ ãã ũũ ãĩ [ə̃ĩ] ãũ [ə̃ũ] õã ũĩ/}}. Sequences ending in a high vowel ({{IPA|/ii uu ai au ui ĩĩ ũũ ãĩ ãũ ũĩ/}}) are pronounced more quickly than others ({{IPA|/ee aa oo ae ao oa oe ãã õã/}}), more like diphthongs and long vowels than like vowel sequences in hiatus. The tones are realised as contours. CVCV words tend to have the same vowel sequences, though there are many exceptions. The two tones are also more distinct.

Vowel-nasal sequences are restricted to non-front vowels: {{IPA|/am an om on um un/}}. Their tones are also realised as contours.

Grammatical particles have the form CV or CN, with any vowel or tone, where C may be any consonant but a click, and the latter cannot be NN. Suffixes and a third mora of a root, may have the form CV, CN, V, N, with any vowel or tone; there are also three C-only suffixes, ''-p'' 1m.sg, ''-ts'' 2m.sg, ''-s'' 2/3f.sg.

==Orthography==
There have been several orthographies used for Nama. ''A Khoekhoegowab dictionary'' (Haacke 2000) uses the modern standard.

In standard orthography, the consonants ''b d g'' are used for words with one of the lower tone melodies and ''p t k'' for one of the higher tone melodies. ''W'' is only used between vowels, though it may be replaced with ''b'' or ''p'' according to melody. Overt tone marking is otherwise generally omitted.

{|class=wikitable
!Orthography!!Transcription!!Melody!!Meaning
|-
|''gao''|| {{IPA|/kȁó/}} ||low rising ||'rule'
|-
|''kao''|| {{IPA|/kàő/}} ||high rising ||'be dumbfounded'
|-
|''ǀhubu'' (or ''ǀhuwu'')|| {{IPA|/ǀʰȕwú/}} ||low rising ||'to stop hurting'
|-
|''ǀhupu'' (or ''ǀhuwu'')|| {{IPA|/ǀʰùwű/}} ||high rising ||'to get out of breath'
|}

Nasal vowels are written with a circumflex. All nasal vowels are long, as in ''hû'' {{IPA|/hũ̀ṹ/}} 'seven'. Long (double) vowels are otherwise written with a macron, as in ''ā'' {{IPA|/ʔàa̋/}} 'to cry, weep'; these constitute two moras (two tone-bearing units).

A glottal stop is not written at the beginning of a word (where it is predictable), but it is transcribed with a hyphen in compound words, such as ''gao-aob'' {{IPA|/kȁòʔòȁp/}} 'chief'.

==Grammar==
Nama has a [[subject–object–verb]] word order, three [[grammatical gender|nouns classes]] (''masculine/gu-class, feminine/di-class'' and ''neutral/n-class'') and three [[grammatical number]]s (''singular, dual'' and ''plural''). ''Gu-class'' and ''Di-class'' nouns have separate singular, dual and plural number affixes; while ''N-class'' nouns only have singular and plural number suffixes.

{| class="wikitable"
!
! Singular
! Dual

| piri'''ra'''
| piri'''di'''

| ari'''kha'''
| ari'''gu'''
| ''dog''
|-
! Neutral/N-class
| khoe-'''i'''
| ''n/a''
| khoe'''n'''
| ''people''
|}

Khoekhoe distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive 1st person plural pronouns. ''Sida'' is the exclusive form for ''we'', it only includes a specific group; as opposed to ''sada'', which is inclusive and refers to all.

==Sample text==

Following is a sample text in the Khoekhoe language.&lt;ref&gt;''Khoekhoegowab: 3ǁî xoaigaub''. Gamsberg Macmillan, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

:In this region we find springbuck, oryx, and duiker; francolin, guinea fowl, bustard, and ostrich; and also various kinds of snake.

==Common words and phrases==
*ǃGâi tsēs – Good day
*ǃGâi ǁgoas – Good morning
*ǃGâi ǃoes – Good evening
*Matisa – How are you?
*ǃGâise ǃgû re – Goodbye
*ǃHaese mûgus – See you soon

Within the field of [[rhetoric]], the contributions of female rhetoricians have often been overlooked. Anthologies comprising the history of rhetoric or rhetoricians often leave the impression there were none. Throughout history, however, there have been a significant number of women rhetoricians.

''Re∙Vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction—is for women more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival.'' -Adrienne Rich

The following is a timeline of contributions made to the field of rhetoric by women.

==Before Common Era==

*[[Aspasia]] (c. 410 BC) was a [[Miletus|Milesian]] woman who was known and highly regarded  for her teaching of political theory and rhetoric. She is mentioned in [[Plato]]'s [[Memexenus]], and is often credited with teaching the [[Socratic method]] to [[Socrates]].

*[[Diotima of Mantinea]] (4th century BC) is an important character in Plato's [[Symposium]]. It is uncertain if she was a real person or perhaps a character modelled after Aspasia, for whom Plato had much respect.

==14th century==

First Edition'' (Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;, '''brusselair''' or '''brusseleir''') is a virtually extinct [[dialect]] spoken in [[Brussels]]. Essentially it is a heavily [[Francization of Brussels|Frenchified]] [[Brabantian|Brabant-]][[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[dialect]] additionally incorporating a sprinkle of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] dating back to the rule of the [[Spanish Netherlands|Low Countries]] by the [[Habsburgs]] (1519-1713).  Its name refers to a district of Brussels called [[Marollen]] (Marolles), a neighborhood in the south-central municipality of Brussels, not far from the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palace of Justice]].  The district takes its name from the former [[abbey]] of the [[nuns]] Maria Colentes&lt;ref&gt;http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/search:site/q/colere worshipping Mary&lt;/ref&gt; (''Marikollen'').  It was a working-class neighborhood, though now it has become a fashionable part of the city. Marols is described as "totally indecipherable to the foreigner (which covers everyone not born in the Marolles) which is probably a good thing as it is richly abusive."&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;

The Théâtre Royal de Toone in Brussels puts on [[puppet]] and plays in Marols.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;

==What is Marols?==
There is a dispute and confusion about the meaning of Marols, which many consider to be a neighborhood jargon distinct from a larger Brussels Dutch dialect, while others use the term "Marols" as an overarching substitute term for that citywide dialect.&lt;ref name="Jeanine Treffers-Daller 1994"&gt;Jeanine Treffers-Daller, ''Mixing Two Languages: French-Dutch Contact in a Comparative Perspective'' (Walter de Gruyter, 1994), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Jeanine Treffers-Daller, “the dialect has a tremendous prestige and a lot of myths are doing the rounds.”&lt;ref name="Jeanine Treffers-Daller 1994"/&gt;

{{Quotation|If you ask ten Brusselers what “Marollien” is, you get ten different answers. For some people it is French contaminated by Flemish and spoken in the neighborhood of the rue Haute and the rue Blaes, whereas for others it is Frenchified Flemish. Still others say that it is a vernacular variety of French, spoken in the whole city, etc., etc.  Marollien, however, is exceptional if not unique, because it is a double language. In fact it is not between the germanic and romance languages, it is both.|Jacques Pohl, 1953| &lt;ref&gt;Quoted Jeanine Treffers-Daller, Mixing Two Languages: French-Dutch Contact in a Comparative Perspective (Walter de Gruyter, 1994), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
An example of Marols is:

==Marols and ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''==
[[Image:Coat of Arms of Syldavia.png|thumb|200px|right|The coat-of-arms of [[Syldavia]] features a motto in [[Syldavian]], which is based on Marols. It reads ''Eih bennek, eih blavek'', in [[English language|English]]: ("Here I am, here I stay").]]
For the popular [[comic]] series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the Belgian author [[Hergé]] modeled his fictional languages [[Syldavian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zompist.com/syldavian.html Hergé's Syldavian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bordurian]] on Marols, and modeled many other personal and place-names in his works on the dialect (e.g. the city of Khemkhâh in the fictional [[Middle Eastern]] country of Khemed comes from the Marols phrase for "I'm cold").  Bordurian, for example, has as one of its words the Marols-based "mänhir", meaning "mister" (cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "mijnheer").  In the original French, the fictional Arumbaya language of [[San Theodoros]] is another incarnation of Marols.

'''Materiality''' in [[architecture]] is the concept of, or applied use of, various materials or substances in the medium of building.

Material is a relative term in architectural design and so may be used to designate materials which are considered to be [[Virtuality|virtual]], (such as [[photographs]], [[image]]s or text) or other materials which are [[natural]]. Some materials may be considered as combinations of the two. Certain [[wiktionary:veneer|veneers]] which are composed of [[image]]s printed on plastic are a good example of this. Observationally therefore, [[Virtuality|virtual]] materials can be said not to exist without a [[natural]] physical [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]. Therefore, what separates a virtual material from a natural one is some aspect of the [[mind]] and [[perception]] as well as a process of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] to produce them.

Indeed, materiality in architecture is not limited to theoretical positions on the perceived materiality of images, texts, or other objects of representation. It may refer to the materiality of specific projects, where one would need to consider the full range of materials used. Discussions on the materiality of architecture are usually synonymous with [[structural]] and [[aesthetic]] concerns in architectural design and are typically unique with each project.

A '''microtown''' is a municipality with less than 500 residents that is not part of the suburbia of a neighboring [[city]]. (Such towns might also be known as [[village]]s and [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s.)  Microtowns used to be prevalent in the West and Midwest [[United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries as people moved for cheaper land and started their own municipality.  Today, a microtown is usually a strong sign of a locality's decline, as people have moved away to seek more prosperous opportunities elsewhere,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} although many such places still exist today, always in rural America.  The smallest documented microtown is in Maine with a population of exactly one (it is legally a town), although a town usually has some degree of independence.  A population of zero is a [[ghost town]].

The term microtown has also been used to describe the birth of a new town center, predominantly on the edge of an existing town in low rent buildings and warehouses where entrepreneurial businesses congregate. This is a growing phenomenon that is seen in towns where the conventional centers struggle to find retail tenants following the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

==Examples of microtowns==
*[[Blue Eye, Missouri]], population 167
*[[Homestead, Iowa]], population 103
*[[Calvin, North Dakota]], population 27
*[[Hiseville, Kentucky]], population 220
*[[Fortescue, Missouri]], population 51
*[[Harmony, California]], population 18
*[[Weeki Wachee, Florida]], population 12

==Life==
Muhammed Said Abdulla was born in [[Makunduchi]], [[Zanzibar]] to a Muslim family. He received his secondary education at a missionary school, and after graduating in 1938, began working for the state Civil Health Department as an inspector. While there he served as editor for the Department of Agriculture's ''Swahili Bulletin.''&lt;ref name="DAB"&gt;{{cite book|last = Zúbková|first= Elena Bertoncini|chapter = Abdulla, Muhammed Said |editor=Akyeampong, Emmanuel K. |editor-link=Emmanuel K.

He later became [[assistant editor]] of ''Al-Falaq'', ''Afrika Kwetu'', and ''Al Mahda''. From 1958 to his retirement in 1968 he served as editor of the agricultural magazine ''Mkulima''.

In 1958 [[fiction]] work ''Mzimu wa Watu wa Kale'' (Shrine of the Ancestors) won top honors at the Swahili Story-Writing Competition held by the [[East African Literature Bureau]]; in 1960 the work was published as a novel. The novel was noted for breaking away from [[folklore|folktale]] traditions that were popular in Swahili literature at the time. ''Mzimu wa Watu wa Kale'' marked the first appearance of Bwana Msa, a [[detective]] character that features in most of his subsequent works.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt; The plots of Abdulla's later novels became progressively more and more complex and sophisticated. These plots usually involved a protagonist who must battle ignorance and superstition in order to resolve the conflict.

Phonetic notes:
* The classicized {{IPA|[{{IPA link|q}}]}} is an allophone for {{IPA|/ɡ/}} {{angbr|ق}} in few words and proper names as in {{lang|ar|القرآن}} {{IPA|[alqurˈʔaːn]}} ('Quran') and {{lang|ar|قانون}} {{IPA|[qaːnuːn]}} ('Law').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Al Motairi|2015|p = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The distinction between the classical {{IPA|/dˤ/}} {{angbr|ض}} and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} {{angbr|ظ}} was completely lost in Najdi Arabic, and both are realised as {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}.
* the marginal phoneme /{{IPA link|ɫ}}/ only occurs in the word {{lang|ar|الله}} {{IPA|/aɫːaːh/}} ('god') and words derived from it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fix|text=incomplete citation|date=March 2017}} it contrasts with {{IPA|/l/}} in {{lang|ar|والله}} {{IPA|/waɫːa/}} ('i swear') vs. {{lang|ar|ولَّا}} {{IPA|/walːa/}} ('or'), but it occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/{{IPA link|l}}/}} in many other contexts, especially when neighboring the phonemes {{IPA|/{{IPA link|ɡ}}, {{IPA link|x}}, {{IPA link|sˤ}}, {{IPA link|tˤ}}/}} e.g. {{lang|ar|قَلَم}} "pencile" {{IPA|/ɡalam/→[ɡaɫam]}}.
* The phonemes {{IPA|/ɣ/}} {{angbr|غ}} and {{IPA|/x/}} {{angbr|خ}} can be realised as uvular fricatives {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʁ}}]}} and {{IPA|[{{IPA link|χ}}]}} respectively.
* In the consonantal system of Najdi Arabic, there is an occurrence of the alveolar affricates {{IPA|[t͡s]}} and {{IPA|[d͡z]}} as allophonic variants of the velar stops {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Al Motairi|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Najdi Arabic sentence structure can have the word order VSO and SVO, however, VSO usually occurs more often.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607094254|title=Najdi Arabic : central Arabian|last=Bruce.|first=Ingham,|date=1994|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=9789027283122|location=Amsterdam|pages=37-44|oclc=607094254}}&lt;/ref&gt; NA morphology is distinguished by three categories which are: nouns ''ism'', verb ''fial'', and particle ''harf''. ''Ism'' means name in Arabic and it corresponds to nouns and adjectives in English. ''Fial'' means action in Arabic and it corresponds to verbs. ''Harf'' means letter and corresponds to pronouns, demonstratives, prepositions, conjunctions and articles. 

Verbs are inflected for number, gender, person, tense, aspect and transitives. Nouns shows number(singular and plural) and gender(masculine and feminine). &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alothman|first=Ebtesam|date=2012|title=Digital Vernaculars: An Investigation of Najdi Arabic in Multilingual Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~robertlewis/writings/thesis.pdf|journal=University of Manchester|volume=|pages=96-121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementizers in NA have three different classes which are: relative particle, declarative particle, and interrogative particles. The three different complementizers that are used in Najdi Arabic are: ''illi'', ''in'', ''itha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis Jr.|first=Robert|date=2013|title=Complementizer Agreement in Najdi Arabic|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~robertlewis/writings/thesis.pdf|journal=University of Kansas|volume=|pages=22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negation===
{{main|Negation in Arabic}}
Two particles are used in negation, which are: ''ma'' and ''la''. These particles come before the verb in verbal sentences.&lt;ref name=":01" /&gt; ''ma'' is used with all verbal sentences but ''la'' is used with imperative verb forms indicating present and future tense.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Neural machine translation''' (NMT) is an approach to [[machine translation]] that uses a large [[artificial neural network]] to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model.

Deep neural machine translation is an extension of neural machine translation. Both use a large neural network with the difference that deep neural machine translation processes multiple neural network layers instead of just one.&lt;ref name="layers"/&gt;

==Properties==
They require only a fraction of the memory needed by traditional [[statistical machine translation]] (SMT) models. Furthermore, unlike conventional translation systems, all parts of the neural translation model are trained jointly (end-to-end) to maximize the translation performance.&lt;ref name="KalchbrennerBlunsom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sequence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Properties"/&gt;

==History==
Deep learning applications appeared first in speech recognition in the 1990s. The first scientific paper on using neural networks in machine translation appeared in 2014, followed by a lot of advances in the following few years. (Large-vocabulary NMT, application to Image captioning, Subword-NMT, Multilingual NMT, Multi-Source NMT, Character-dec NMT, Zero-Resource NMT, Google, Fully Character-NMT, Zero-Shot NMT in 2017) In 2015 there was the first appearance of a NMT system in a public machine translation competition (OpenMT'15). WMT'15 also for the first time had a NMT contender; the following year it already had 90% of NMT systems among its winners.&lt;ref name="WMT16"/&gt;

==Workings==
NMT departs from phrase-based [[statistical machine translation|statistical]] approaches that use separately engineered subcomponents.&lt;ref name="Medical"/&gt; Neural machine translation (NMT) is not a drastic step beyond what has been traditionally done in statistical machine translation (SMT). Its main departure is the use of vector representations ("embeddings", "continuous space representations") for words and internal states. The structure of the models is simpler than phrase-based models. There is no separate language model, translation model, and reordering model, but just a single sequence model that predicts one word at a time. However, this sequence prediction is conditioned on the entire source sentence and the entire already produced target sequence.&lt;ref name="Koehn"/&gt;

NMT models use [[deep learning]] and [[representation learning]].

The word sequence modeling was at first typically done using a [[recurrent neural network]] (RNN).
A bidirectional recurrent neural network, known as an ''encoder'', is used by the neural network to encode a source sentence for a second RNN, known as a ''decoder'', that is used to predict words in the [[target language (translation)|target language]].&lt;ref name="align&amp;translate"/&gt;

Convolutional Neural Networks (Convnets) are in principle somewhat better for long continuous sequences, but were initially not used due to several weaknesses that were successfully compensated for by 2017 by using so-called "attention"-based approaches.&lt;ref name="attention"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeepL"/&gt;

==Usage==
By 2016, most of the best MT systems were using neural networks.&lt;ref name="WMT16"/&gt;
[[Google Translator|Google]], [[Microsoft Translator|Microsoft]] and [[Yandex.Translate|Yandex]]&lt;ref name="Yandex"/&gt; translation services now use NMT. Google uses [[Google Neural Machine Translation]] (GNMT) in preference to its previous statistical methods.&lt;ref name="AIawakening"/&gt; Microsoft uses a similar technology for its speech translations (including [[Microsoft Translator]] live and [[Skype Translator]]).&lt;ref name="MS-NMT"/&gt; An [[open source]] neural machine translation system, OpenNMT, has been released by the Harvard NLP group.&lt;ref name="OpenNMT"/&gt; Yandex.Translator has a hybrid model: its translation provides a statistical model and a neural network. After this, the algorithm CatBoost, which is based on machine learning, will select the best of the obtained results&lt;ref name="Yandex"/&gt; Machine translation providers who also offer neural machine translation include Pangeanic's language lab PangeaMT &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pangeamt.com {{!}} pangeamt.com|website=Machine Translation|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Omniscien Technologies (formerly Asia Online),&lt;ref name="Omniscien"/&gt; Tilde,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tilde.com/products-and-services/machine-translation/features/neural-translation|title=MT Features: Neural Machine Translation {{!}} tilde.com|website=Machine Translation|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; KantanMT,&lt;ref name="KantanMT"/&gt; [[SDL plc|SDL]],&lt;ref name="SDL"/&gt; Globalese,&lt;ref name="Globalese"/&gt; and TransPerfect. [[DeepL]] offers a generic machine translation system with deep learning AI systems while Omniscien Technologies provides customized deep neural machine translation (Deep NMT) and [[SYSTRAN|Systran]] offers Pure Neural Machine Translation with deep neural networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3776">A '''number opera''' ({{Lang-it|opera a numeri}}; {{Lang-de|Nummeroper}}) is an [[opera]] consisting of individual pieces of music ('[[number (music)|numbers]]') which can be easily extracted from the larger work.&lt;ref name=Grove2&gt;"Number opera" in [[#Sadie2001|''New Grove'']].&lt;/ref&gt; They may be numbered consecutively in the score, and may be interspersed with [[recitative]] or spoken dialogue. Opera numbers may be [[aria]]s, but also  [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] pieces, such as [[Duet (music)|duet]]s, [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, [[quartet]]s, [[quintet]]s, [[sextet]]s or [[Choir|chorus]]es. They may also be [[ballet]]s and [[instrumental]] pieces, such as [[March (music)|march]]es, [[sinfonia]]s, or [[intermezzi]].&lt;ref name=Apel582&gt;[[#Apel1969|Apel]], p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt; The number opera format was standard until the mid-19th century and most opera genres, including ''[[opera seria]]'', ''[[opera buffa]]'', ''[[opéra comique]]'', [[ballad opera]], [[Singspiel]], and [[grand opera]], were constructed in this fashion.&lt;ref name=Grove2/&gt;

The replacement of numbers with more continuous music began in operas by [[Jommelli]], [[Traetta]], [[Gluck]], and especially [[Mozart]], whose late operas ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' contain several segments in which different numbers are unified by bridge passages to form a musical whole. This trend became even more striking in the operas of the German composers [[Beethoven]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], and [[Meyerbeer]], while their Italian and French contemporaries [[Rossini]], [[Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], and [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] retained the number opera style.&lt;ref name=Apel582/&gt;

The number opera was strongly condemned by [[Wagner]] for dramatic reasons, and he replaced it with continuous music that advances the drama without interruption.&lt;ref name=Apel582/&gt; The number opera became unfashionable, and the late operas of [[Verdi]] and those of [[Puccini]] and the ''[[verismo]]'' school, cannot be described as such.&lt;ref name=Grove2/&gt;

Many operatic composers subsequent to Wagner adopted his approach.&lt;ref name=Apel582/&gt; However, in the 20th century some composers intentionally revived or adapted the number opera format, e. g., [[Busoni]]'s ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (1917),&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walton, "Neo-classical opera" in [[#Cooke2005|Cooke]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Busoni, Ferruccio (1918). ''Arlecchino''. Part.-Biibl. 1700. Leipzig: [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]]. See [http://imslp.org/wiki/Arlecchino,_BV_270_(Busoni,_Ferruccio) this work page] of the [[International Music Score Library Project]]. Accessed 3 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925),&lt;ref name=Grove2/&gt; [[Hindemith]]'s ''[[Cardillac]]'' (1926, rev. 1952), and [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951).&lt;ref name=Apel582/&gt; In [[operetta]] and in popular [[musical theatre|music theatre]], number opera format has remained the norm.

'''Openwork''' or '''open-work''' is a term in [[art history]], architecture and related fields for any technique that produces decoration by creating holes, piercings, or gaps that go right through a solid material such as metal, wood, stone, pottery, cloth, leather, or [[ivory]].&lt;ref&gt;"Openwork." [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed May 26, 2015, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T063628 subscription required].  Their article reads, in full: "Any form of decoration that is perforated".  [[OED]] "Openwork", 1, where all examples cited from earlier than 1894 are hyphenated, though this is now less common than the single word.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such techniques have been very widely used in a great number of cultures.

The term is rather flexible, and used both for additive techniques that build up the design, as for example most large features in architecture, and those that take a plain material and make cuts or holes in it. Equally techniques such as [[casting]] using [[mould]]s create the whole design in a single stage, and are common in openwork. Though much openwork relies for its effect on the viewer seeing right through the object, some pieces place a different material behind the openwork as a background.

==Varieties==
Techniques or styles that normally use openwork include all the family of [[lace]] and [[cutwork]] types in textiles, including [[broderie anglaise]] and many others.   [[Fretwork]] in wood is used for various types of objects. There has always been great use of openwork in [[jewellery]], not least to save on expensive materials and weight. For example, [[opus interrasile]] is a type of decoration used in Ancient Roman and Byzantine jewellery, piercing thin strips of gold with punches.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Favro, et al. "Rome, ancient, s 5, ii." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed May 27, 2015, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T073405pg13 subscription required]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other techniques used casting with moulds, or built up the design with wire or small strips of metal. Essentially flat objects are straightforward to cast using moulds of [[clay]] or other materials, and this technique was known in ancient China since before the [[Shang Dynasty]] of c. 1600 to 1046 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Asian Art. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/shzh/hd_shzh.htm "Shang and Zhou Dynasties: The Bronze Age of China"]. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.  (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; On a larger scale in metal, [[wrought iron]] and [[cast iron]] decoration more often than not has involved openwork.

Oxford University Press, accessed May 27, 2015, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T077242 subscription required]&lt;/ref&gt; probably partly to save weight.  [[Sukashibori]] (roughly translating to "see-through work") is the Japanese term covering a number of openwork techniques, which have been very popular in [[Japanese art]].&lt;ref name=tma&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Tokyo National Museum|title=和英対照日本美術鑑賞の手引(An Aid to the Understanding of Japanese Art)|year=1976|pages=132/133}} (revised edition; 1964 first ed.), p.132/133&lt;/ref&gt;

In ceramics, if objects such as [[sieve]]s are excluded (openwork bases for these existed in the West from classical times), decorative openwork long remained mainly a feature of East Asian ceramics, with [[Korean ceramics]] especially fond of the technique from an early date.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Roger (ed), ''Treasures from Korea: Art Through 5000 Years'', p. 68, 1984, British Museum Publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1430-8}}, 9780714114309.  Openwork bases and pedestals "became the characteristic and dominant forms in ceramics" in the [[Gaya confederacy]] period.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little use of it in European ceramics before the 18th century, when designs, mostly using [[latticework|lattice]] panels, were popular in [[rococo]] ceramic "baskets", and later in English silver trays.  Openwork sections can be made either by cutting into a conventional solid body before firing, or by building up using strips of clay, the latter often used when loose wickerwork is being imitated.  In [[glass]] openwork is rather less common, but the spectacular Ancient Roman [[cage cup]]s use it for a decorative outer layer.

Some types of objects naturally suit or even require openwork, which allows a flow of air through screens, censers or [[incense burner]]s, [[pomander]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Aftel, mandy, ''Fragrant: The Secret Life of Scent'', 2014, Penguin, {{ISBN|1101614684}}, 9781101614686, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jpxrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT129 p. 129]&lt;/ref&gt; sprinklers, ventilation [[grille]]s and panels, and various parts of heating systems. For exterior screens openwork designs allow looking out, but not looking in. For gates and other types of screens, security is required, but visibility may also be wanted.

==Architecture==
In architecture openwork takes many forms, including [[tracery]], [[balustrade]]s and [[parapet]]s, as well as screens of many kinds.  A variety of screen types especially common in the Islamic world include stone [[jali]] and equivalents in wood such as [[mashrabiya]]. [[Belfry (architecture)|Belfries]] and [[bell-tower]]s normally include open or semi-open elements to allow the sound to be heard at distance, and these are often turned to decorative use. In [[Gothic architecture]] some entire [[spire]]s are openwork. The later of the two spires on the West Front of [[Chartres Cathedral]] is very largely openwork.   As well as stone and wood the range of materials includes [[brick]], which may be used for windows, normally unglazed, and screens.  Constructions such as the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris are also described as openwork.  Here an openwork structure was crucial for the engineering, reducing not only weight but [[wind resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harriss, Joseph|title=The Eiffel Tower:Symbol of an Age|publisher=[[Paul Elek]] |location=London|year= 1975 |page=63|isbn= 0236400363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the early fourteenth-century spire at [[Freiburg Minster]], in which the pierced stonework was held together by iron cramps, the openwork spire, according to Robert Bork, represents a "radical but logical extension of the Gothic tendency towards skeletal structure."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bork, "Into Thin Air: France, Germany, and the Invention of the Openwork Spire" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''85'''.1 (March 2003, pp. 25–53), p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18 openwork spires of [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudi's]] [[Sagrada Família]] in [[Barcelona]] represent an outgrowth of this Gothic tendency. Designed and begun by Gaudi in 1884, they remained incomplete into the 21st century.

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
A '''preacher''' is a person who delivers [[sermon]]s or [[Homily|homilies]] on religious topics to an assembly of people. Less common are preachers who [[Open-air preaching|preach on the street]], or those whose message is not necessarily religious, but who preach components such as a moral or social [[worldview]] or [[philosophy]].

==History==
Preachers are common throughout most cultures. They can take the form of a [[Christian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] on a Sunday morning, or an Islamic [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imam]]. A Muslim preacher in general is referred to as a ''[[dawah|dā‘ī]]'', while one giving sermons on a Friday afternoon is called a ''[[khatib]]''. 

The sermon or homily has been an important part of Christian services since Early Christianity, and remains prominent in both [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. [[Laity|Lay]] preachers sometimes figure in these traditions of worship, for example the [[Methodist local preacher]]s, but in general preaching has usually been a function of the [[clergy]]. The [[Dominican Order]] is officially known as the ''Order of Preachers'' (''Ordo Praedicatorum'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]); [[friar]]s of this order were trained to publicly preach in [[vernacular]] languages, and the order was created by [[Saint Dominic]] to preach to the [[Cathar]]s of southern France in the early thirteenth century. The [[Franciscans]] are another important preaching order; Travelling preachers, usually friars, were an important feature of late medieval Catholicism.

In most denominations, modern preaching is kept below about 40 minutes, but historic preachers of all denominations could at times speak for well over an hour, sometimes for two or three hours,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 10&lt;/ref&gt; and use techniques of [[rhetoric]] and theatre that are today somewhat out of fashion in mainline churches.   

In many churches in the United States, the title "Preacher" is synonymous with "[[pastor]]" or "[[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]", and the church's minister is often referred to simply as "our/the preacher" or by name such as "Preacher Smith". However, among some Chinese churches, preacher (Chinese: 傳道) is different from pastor (Chinese: 牧師). A preacher in the Protestant church is one of the younger clergy, but they are not officially recognised as pastors until they can prove their capability of leading the church.

==Other uses==
*''Preacher'' is also the author of the Book of [[Ecclesiastes]] according to the King James Version. Preacher is one translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word קהלת (Qoheleth). There is much debate about the identity of this Preacher; many believe it is [[Solomon]].

[[File:PM Modi releases the Gujarati translation of Thirukkural.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi releasing a Gujarati translation of the Kural in 2015]]
The Kural remained unknown to the people of [[Gujarat]] during the medieval period as none has made any reference to the work in their writings. The Kural became more known to [[Gujarati people]] during the period of the [[Indian Independence movement]] after [[Mahatma Gandhi]] frequently made reference to the work in his speeches,&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"&gt;{{cite book

The first Gujarati translation of the Kural text was made by Najuklal Choksi in 1931 and was published by Sastu Sahitya Vardhak Karyalaya under the title ''Updeshsaraamgrahs''.&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt; The work was suggested by Swami Akhandanand Sarwati, the founder of Sastu Sahitya Vardhak Karyalaya.&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt; The second translation appeared in 1971 by [[Kantilal L. Kalani]], published by the University Grantha Nirman Board of [[Gujarat government]].&lt;ref name="TK_SeminarPapers"/&gt; Kantilal, however, translated only 852 couplets, which included only select couplets (of four to ten) from every chapter yet covering all chapters of the Tirukkural. This was republished in 1985 by [[Sardar Patel University]], [[Vallabh Vidhyanagar]], [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="OOCities_Gujarati"&gt;{{cite web

'''Western Neo-Aramaic''' is a modern [[Aramaic language]]. Today, it is spoken in three villages in the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]] of western [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, [http://meti.byu.edu/Brock_Introduction.pdf An Introduction to Syriac Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518214139/http://meti.byu.edu/Brock_Introduction.pdf |date=2013-05-18 }}. Retrieved July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Western Neo-Aramaic is the only [[modern language|living language]] among the [[Western Aramaic languages]]. All other [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] are of the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] branch.

==Distribution and history==
Western Neo-Aramaic is probably the last surviving remnant of a [[Aramaic language#Middle Aramaic|Western Middle Aramaic]] dialect which was spoken throughout the [[Orontes River]] Valley area and into the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]] in the 6th century. It now is spoken solely by the villagers of [[Maaloula]], [[Jubb'adin]] and [[Al-Sarkha (Bakhah)|Bakh'a]], about {{convert|60|km}} northeast of [[Damascus]]. The continuation of this little cluster of Aramaic in a sea of [[Arabic]] is partly due to the relative isolation of the villages and their close-knit [[Christian]] communities.

Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], there was a linguistic shift to Arabic for local Muslims and later for remaining Christians; Arabic displaced various Aramaic languages, including Western Aramaic varieties, as the [[first language]] of the majority. Despite this, Western Aramaic appears to have survived for a relatively long time at least in some villages in mountainous areas of Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon (in modern Syria). In fact, up until the 17th century, travellers in the Lebanon still reported on several Aramaic-speaking villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Owens| first = Jonathan| title = Arabic as a Minority Language| publisher = Walter de Gruyter| year = 2000| isbn = 3-11-016578-3| page = 347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last three villages where the language still survives, the dialect of Bakh'a appears to be the most conservative. It has been less influenced by Arabic than the other dialects, and retains some vocabulary that is obsolete in other dialects. The dialect of Jubb'adin has changed the most. It is heavily influenced by Arabic, and has a more developed phonology. The dialect of Maaloula is somewhere between the two, but is closer to that of Jubb'adin.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Cross-linguistic influence between Aramaic and Arabic has been mutual, as Syrian Arabic itself (and [[Levantine Arabic]] in general) retains an Aramaic [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]].

As in most of the Levant prior to the introduction of [[Islam]] in the seventh century, the villages were originally all Christian. However, Maaloula is the only village that retains a sizeable Christian population (they mostly belong to the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]) as most of the inhabitants of Bakh'a and Jubb Adin adopted Islam over the generations, and are now all Muslim. Maaloula glows in the pale blue wash with which houses are painted every year in honour of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]].

All three remaining Western Neo-Aramaic dialects are facing critical endangerment as living languages. As with any village community in the 21st century, young residents are migrating into major cities like [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] in search of better employment opportunities, thus forcing them into monolingual Arabic-speaking settings, in turn straining the opportunity to actively maintain Western Neo-Aramaic as a language of daily use. Nevertheless, the Syrian government provides support for teaching the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ankawa.com/english/?p=8246#more-8246|title=How To Save A Dying Language|last=Sabar|first=Ariel|date=18 February 2013|publisher=Ankawa|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, Maaloula has been home to an Aramaic institute established by the [[Damascus University]] that teaches courses to keep the language alive. The institute's activities were suspended in 2010 amidst fears that the square [[Aramaic alphabet]] used in the program too closely resembled the square script of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and all the signs with the square Aramaic script were taken down. The program stated that they would instead use the more distinct [[Syriac alphabet]], although use of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] has continued to some degree.&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0402/Easter-Sunday-A-Syrian-bid-to-resurrect-Aramaic-the-language-of-Jesus-Christ |title=Easter Sunday: A Syrian bid to resurrect Aramaic, the language of Jesus Christ |last=Beach |first=Alastair |publisher=''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jazeera Arabic also broadcast a program about Western Neo-Aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rbrZ1W2nAs&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 during an Aramaic Singing Festival in [[Maaloula]], a modified version of an older style of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] closer to the [[Phoenician alphabet]] was used for Western Neo-Aramaic. This script seems to be used as a true alphabet with letters to represent both consonants and vowels instead of the traditional system of the Aramaic alphabet where it's used as an abjad. A recently published book about Maaloula Aramaic also uses this script.&lt;ref name=SingingFest2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Aramaic singing festival in Maaloula for preserving Aramaic language – Syrian Arab News Agency|url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=87840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaloulaAramaicBook"&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Arameen Parle A Maaloula – Issam Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0LPDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syriac language organization Rinyo has published the [[Book of Psalms]] from the Old Testament in writing and the book ''Portrait of Jesus'' in writing with audio in Aromay in the Syriac Serto script on their website and a translation of the [[New Testament]] into Aromay has been finished in 2017 and is now available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aramaicbible.org/maluli.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rinyo.org/Bible&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Testament in Western Neo-Aramaic (Serto/Arabic)"&gt;https://scriptureearth.org/data/amw/PDF/amwMaLuliNT-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 a free course in Western Neo-Aramaic started at Damascus University.&lt;ref&gt;http://nuss.sy/41329.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sana.sy/?p=591267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tishreenonline.sy/2017/07/17/%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AC/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/483076162042401/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The [[phonology]] of Western Neo-Aramaic has developed quite differently from other Aramaic languages. The [[labial consonant]]s of older Western Aramaic, {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, have been retained in Bakh'a and Maaloula while they have mostly collapsed to {{IPA|/f/}} in Jubb'adin under influence from Arabic. The labial consonant pair {{IPA|/b~v/}} has collapsed to {{IPA|/b/}} in all three villages. Amongst [[dental consonant]]s, the fricatives {{IPA|/θ ð/}} are retained while {{IPA|/d/}} have become {{IPA|/ð/}} in most places and {{IPA|/t/}}, while remaining a phoneme, has had its traditional position in Aramaic words replaced by {{IPA|/ts/}} in Bakh'a, and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in Maaloula and Jubb'adin. However, {{IPA|[ti]}} is the usual form for the relative particle in these two villages, with a variant {{IPA|[tʃi]}}, where Bakh'a always uses {{IPA|[tsi]}}. Among the [[velar consonant]]s, the traditional voiced pair of {{IPA|/ɡ ɣ/}} has collapsed into {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, while /ɡ/ still remains a phoneme in some words. The unvoiced velar fricative, {{IPA|/x/}}, is retained, but its plosive complement {{IPA|/k/}}, while also remaining a distinct phoneme, has in its traditional positions in Aramaic words started to undergo palatalization. In Bakh'a, the palatalization is hardly apparent; in Maaloula, it is more obvious, and often leads to {{IPA|[kʲ]}}; in Jubb'adin, it has become {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and has thus merged phonemically with the original positions of {{IPA|/t/}}. The original uvular plosive, {{IPA|/q/}}, has also moved forward in Western Neo-Aramaic. In Bakh'a it has become a strongly post-velar plosive, and in Maaloula more lightly post-velar. In Jubb'adin, however, it has replaced the velar plosive, and become {{IPA|/k/}}.

:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The original positions of the consonant {{IPA|/t/}} in Aramaic words has been replaced by {{IPA|/ts/}} in Bakh'a, and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in Maaloula and Jubb'adin.
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The [[labial consonant]]s {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, have been retained in Bakh'a and Maaloula while they have mostly collapsed to {{IPA|/f/}} in Jubb'adin.
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The plosive consonant {{IPA|/k/}} has started to undergo palatalisation. In Bakh'a, the palatalisation is hardly apparent; in Maaloula, it is more obvious, and often leads to {{IPA|[kʲ]}}; in Jubb'adin, it has become {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and has thus merged phonemically with the original {{IPA|/t/}}. 
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Post-velar plosive /ḳ/ is present in Bakh'a, in Maaloula it's more lightly post-velar. In Jubb'adin, however, it is not distinguished from {{IPA|/k/}}.

=== Vowels === 
Western Neo-Aramaic has the following set of vowels&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/westernneoaramaic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;:
* [[Close front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPAslink|i}}
* [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPAslink|e}}
* [[Open front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPAslink|a}}
* [[Open back rounded vowel]] – {{IPAslink|ɒ}}
* [[Close back rounded vowel]] – {{IPAslink|u}}

Short vowels are omitted or written with diacritics, long vowels are transcribed with macrons (Āā, Ēē, Īī, Ōō, Ūū) and are written with mater lectionis ([[File:Maaloula square wawf.svg|6px|]] for /o/ and /u/, [[File:Maaloula square yod.svg|6px|]] for /i/, which are also used at the end of a word if it ends with one of these vowels and if a word begins with any of these long wovels, they begin with [[File:Maaloula square alef.svg|10px|]] + the mater lectionis). Words ending with /a/ are written with [[File:Maaloula square alef.svg|10px|]] at the end of the word, while words ending with /e/ are written with [[File:Maaloula square hi.svg|10px|]] at the end. Sometimes [[File:Maaloula square kaf 2.svg|10px|]] is used both for final [[File:Maaloula square kaf.svg|10px|]] and [[File:Maaloula square khaf.svg|10px|]] instead of also using [[File:Maaloula square khaf 2.svg|10px|]].

===Alternate Aramaic Alphabet===
Characters of the script system similar to the Old Aramaic/Phoenician alphabet used occasionally for Western Neo-Aramaic with matching transliteration. The script is used as a true alphabet with distinct letters for all phonemes including vowels instead of the traditional abjad system with plosive-fricative pairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://aramia.net/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaloulaAramaicBook"/&gt;
