The '''American Humanist Association''' ('''AHA''') is a [[501(c) organization|non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]] that advances [[secular humanism]], a philosophy of life that, without [[theism]] or other [[supernatural]] beliefs, affirms the ability and responsibility of human beings to lead personal lives of ethical fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Humanism|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism|accessdate=2009-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612211444/http://americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism|archive-date=2010-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Humanist Association was founded in 1941 and currently provides legal assistance to defend the [[constitutional rights]] of secular and religious minorities,&lt;ref name="AHLC Mission Statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=AHLC mission statement|url=http://humanistlegalcenter.org/about/mission/|accessdate=2012-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622055233/http://humanistlegalcenter.org/about/mission/|archive-date=2013-06-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; actively lobbies [[United States Congress|Congress]] on [[church-state separation]] and other issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AHA Action Center|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Support_Humanism/Action_Center/Current_Action|accessdate=2012-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306055252/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Support_Humanism/Action_Center/Current_Action|archive-date=2012-03-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a [[grassroots]] network of 150 local affiliates and chapters that engage in [[social activism]], philosophical discussion and [[civic engagement|community-building events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Group Information|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/What_We_Do/Local_Groups|accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHA has several publications, including the bi-monthly [[magazine]] ''[[The Humanist (magazine)|The Humanist]]'', a quarterly newsletter ''Free Mind'', a [[peer-reviewed]] semi-annual scholastic journal ''[[Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism]]'', and a daily online news site TheHumanist.com.&lt;ref&gt;List of Publications [http://www.americanhumanist.org/What_We_Do/Publications americanhumanist.org] (Retrieved 2011-10-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Humanism}}
In 1927 an organization called the "Humanist Fellowship" began at a gathering in Chicago. In 1928 the Fellowship started publishing the ''New Humanist'' magazine. H.G. Creel was the first editor. The ''New Humanist'' was published from 1928 to 1936. By 1935 the Humanist Fellowship had become the "Humanist Press Association", the first national association of humanism in the United States.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6XEPjO1-4e0C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=American+Humanist+Association&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jv1WVMPhG7OHsQSNgoHwCA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Humanist%20Association&amp;f=false Harris, Mark W., ''The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism'', Scarecrow Press, 2009] {{ISBN|9780810863330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933. Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and theologians. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Nicolas. ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1939 a group of [[Quakers]], inspired by the 1933 [[Humanist Manifesto]], incorporated under the state laws of [[California]] the Humanist Society of Friends as a religious, educational, charitable nonprofit organization authorized to issue charters anywhere in the world and to train and ordain its own [[ordination|ministry]]. Upon ordination these [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] were then accorded the same rights and privileges granted by law to [[priests]], ministers, and [[rabbis]] of traditional theistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Society's Early History|url=http://humanist-society.org/about|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Curtis Reese]] was a leader in the 1941 reorganization and incorporation of the "Humanist Press Association" as the American Humanist Association. Along with its reorganization, the AHA began printing ''The Humanist'' magazine. The AHA was originally headquartered in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]], then [[San Francisco, California]], and in 1978 [[Amherst, New York]].&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Subsequently, the AHA moved to [[Washington, D.C.]].

In 1952 the AHA became a founding member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHEU founding|url=http://www.iheu.org/about|accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an international coalition of Humanist organizations, the IHEU stands today as the only international umbrella group for Humanism.

The AHA was the first national membership organization to support abortion rights. Around the same time, the AHA joined hands with the American Ethical Union (AEU) to help establish the rights of nontheistic conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. This time also saw Humanists involved in the creation of the first nationwide memorial societies, giving people broader access to cheaper alternatives than the traditional burial. In the late 1960s the AHA also secured a religious tax exemption in support of its [[Celebrant USA Foundation and Institute|celebrant]] program, allowing Humanist celebrants to legally officiate at weddings, perform [[chaplaincy]] functions, and in other ways enjoy the same rights as traditional [[clergy]].

In 1991 the AHA took control of the [[Humanist Society]], a religious Humanist organization that now runs the celebrant program. Since 1991 the organization has worked as an adjunct to the American Humanist Association to certify qualified members to serve in this special capacity as ministers. The Humanist Society's ministry prepares Humanist Celebrants to lead ceremonial observances across the nation and worldwide. Celebrants provide millions of Americans an alternative to traditional religious weddings, memorial services, and other life cycle events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Society's  Services|url=http://humanist-society.org/|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this transfer, the AHA commenced the process of jettisoning its religious tax exemption and resumed its exclusively educational status. Today the AHA is recognized by the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] as a nonprofit, tax exempt, 501(c)(3), publicly supported educational organization.

Membership numbers are disputed, but Djupe and Olson place it as "definitely fewer than 50,000."&lt;ref name=Djupe&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=American+Humanist+Association&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=awZXVN7hEenlsAT3uICoCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Humanist%20Association&amp;f=false Djupe, Paul A. and Olsen, Laura R., "American Humanist Association", ''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics", Infobase Publishing, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  The AHA has over 575,000 followers on Facebook and over 42,000 followers on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/americanhumanist|title=Security Check Required|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/americnhumanist|title=American Humanist (@americnhumanist) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjuncts and affiliates==
The AHA is also the supervising organization for various Humanist affiliates and adjunct organizations.

=== Black Humanist Alliance ===
The Black Humanist Alliance of the American Humanist Association was founded in 2016 as a pillar of its new "Initiatives for Social Justice."&lt;ref name="americanhumanist.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2016-05-humanist-group-launches-initiatives-for-racial-justi|title=Humanist Group Launches Initiatives for Racial Justice, Women’s Equality and LGBTQ Rights|website=American Humanist Association|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Feminist Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, the Black Humanist Alliance uses an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] approach to addressing issues facing the Black community. As its mission states, the BHA "concern ourselves with confronting expressions of religious hegemony in public policy," but is "also devoted to confronting social, economic, and political deprivations that disproportionately impact Black America due to centuries of culturally ingrained prejudices."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blackhumanists.org/mission|title=Mission - The Black Humanist Alliance - Menu|website=blackhumanists.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist Humanist Alliance===
The Feminist Humanist Alliance (formerly the Feminist Caucus) of the American Humanist Association was established in 1977 as a coalition of both women and men within the AHA to work toward the advancement of [[women's rights]] and equality between the sexes in all aspects of society. Originally called the Women's Caucus, the new name was adopted in 1985 as more representative of all the members of the caucus and of the caucus' goals. Over the years, members of the Caucus have advocated for the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and participated in various public demonstrations, including marches for women's and civil rights. In 1982, the Caucus established its annual Humanist Heroine Award, with the initial award being presented to [[Sonia Johnson]].

In 2016, the Feminist Caucus, mirroring the Black Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, reorganized as the Feminist Humanist Alliance as a component of their larger "Initiatives for Social Justice."&lt;ref name="americanhumanist.org"/&gt; As stated on its website, the "refinement in vision" emphasized "FHA's more active partnership with outreach programs and social justice campaigns with distinctly inclusive feminist objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://feministhumanists.org/history|title=History - Feminist Humanist Alliance|website=feministhumanists.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current goal is to provide a "movement powered by and for women, transpeople, and genderqueer people to fight for social justice.

=== LGBTQ Humanist Alliance ===
The LGBTQ Humanist Alliance (formerly LGBT Humanist Council) of the American Humanist Association is committed to advancing equality for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people and their families. The alliance "seeks to cultivate safe and affirming communities, promote humanist values, and achieve full equality and social liberation of LGBTQ persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgbthumanists.org/about/|title=About the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance|website=LGBTQ Humanist Alliance|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paralleling the Black Humanist Alliance and the Feminist Humanist Alliance, the Council reformed in 2016 as the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance as a larger part of the AHA's "Initiatives for Social Justice."&lt;ref name="americanhumanist.org"/&gt;

===Disaster Recovery===
In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and Foundation Beyond Belief (FBB) merged their respective charitable programs Humanist Charities (established in 2005) and Humanist Crisis Response (established in 2011). AHA's Executive Director [[Roy Speckhardt]] commented that, “This merger is a positive move that will grow the relief efforts of the humanist community. The end result will be more money directed to charitable activities, dispelling the false claim that nonbelievers don’t give to charity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2014-05-humanist-charities-and-humanist-crisis-response-anno|title=Humanist Charities and Humanist Crisis Response Announce Merger|website=American Humanist Association|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program coordinates financial support as well as trained humanist volunteers to help impacted communities. The Disaster Recovery program is sustained through the ongoing partnership between FBB and AHA, and ensures that our community's efforts are centralized and efficient. 

Between 2014-2018, Humanist Disaster Recovery has raised over $250,000 for victims of the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Refugee Crisis]], [[2014 American immigration crisis|Refugee Children of the U.S. Border]], [[Cyclone Sam|Tropical Cyclone Sam]], and the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal]] and [[2016 Ecuador earthquake|Ecuadoran Earthquakes]], Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, and Hurricanes Irma and Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foundationbeyondbelief.org/hurricane-recovery-2018/|title=Disaster Appeal: Hurricane Recovery 2018 • Foundation Beyond Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=Foundation Beyond Belief|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to grants for recovery efforts, volunteers have also helped to rebuild homes and schools in the following locations: [[Columbia, South Carolina]] after the effects of [[Hurricane Joaquin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foundationbeyondbelief.org/hdrteams/sc2016|title=HDR Teams: South Carolina 2016|website=Foundation Beyond Belief|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in Denham Springs, Louisiana; and in Houston, Texas after the flooding from Hurricane Harvey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foundationbeyondbelief.org/disaster-recovery/archive|title=HDR Archive • Foundation Beyond Belief|website=foundationbeyondbelief.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Appignani Humanist Legal Center===
[[File:AHLC FINAL LOGO.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Official logo of the AHLC]]The American Humanist Association launched the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) in 2006 to ensure that humanists' constitutional rights are represented in court. Through [[amicus]] activity, [[litigation]], and legal advocacy, a team of cooperating lawyers, including Jim McCollum, [[Wendy Kaminer]], and [[Michael Newdow]], provide legal assistance by challenging perceived violations of the [[Establishment Clause]].

* The AHLC’s first independent litigation was filed on November 29, 2006, in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]]. Attorney James Hurley, the AHLC lawyer serving as lead counsel, filed suit against the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections on behalf of Plaintiff Jerry Rabinowitz, whose polling place was a church in [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. The church featured numerous religious symbols, including signs exhorting people to “Make a Difference with God” and anti-abortion posters, which the AHLC claimed demonstrated a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]]. In the voting area itself, "Rabinowitz observed many religious symbols in plain view, both surrounding the election judges and in direct line above the voting machines. He took photographs that will be entered in evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Jones| first =Susan| title ='Humanists' Challenge Voting Booths in Churches| work =crosswalk.com| date =2006-11-30| url =http://www.crosswalk.com/1453724| accessdate =2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge [[Donald M. Middlebrooks]] ruled that Jerry Rabinowitz did not have [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge the placement of polling sites in churches, and dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Voting in churches is constitutional, says Florida federal court.| work=www.thefreelibrary.com| date =2009-09-01| url =http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Voting+in+churches+is+constitutional,+says+Florida+federal+court.-a0168748576| accessdate =2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In February 2014, AHA brought suit to force the removal of the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a war memorial honoring 49 residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, who died in World War I. AHA represented the plaintiffs, Mr. Lowe, who drives by the memorial "about once a month" and Fred Edwords, former AHA Executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-05-25/news/bs-md-bladensburg-veterans-memorial-peace-cross-ne-20140525_1_war-memorial-cross-federal-judge-greenbelt Brown, Matthew Hay.

*In March 2014, a Southern California woman reluctantly removed a roadside memorial from near a freeway ramp where her 19-year-old son was killed after the AHA contacted the city council calling the cross on city-owned property a "serious constitutional violation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Lake-Elsinore-Atheists-Group-Demands-Cross-Removal-American-Humanist-Association-Devaney-Memorial-Religion-Church-State-248741091.html|title=Mother Removes Cross Memorial After Dispute With Atheist Rights Group|work=NBC Southern California|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*AHLC represented an atheist family who claimed that the equal rights amendment of the [[Massachusetts constitution]] prohibits mandatory daily recitations of the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] because the anthem contains the phrase “under God.” In November 2012 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court permitted a direct appeal with oral arguments set for early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =SJC to hear case from atheist family| url =http://www.lowellsun.com/todaysheadlines/ci_22021579/sjc-hear-case-from-atheist-family| accessdate =2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the daily recitation of the phrase “under god” in the US Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the Massachusetts Constitution.
*In February 2015 [[New Jersey Superior Court]] Judge [[David F. Bauman]] dismissed a lawsuit challenging the Pledge of Allegiance, ruling that "...the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don't believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message."&lt;ref name=Spoto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2015/02/under_god_is_not_discriminatory_and_will_stay_in_p.html|title='Under God' is not discriminatory and will stay in pledge, judge says|work=NJ.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, "Under (the association members') reasoning, the very constitution under which (the members) seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deem unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which (association members) do not and cannot advance here."&lt;ref name=Spoto/&gt;

==Advertising campaigns==
[[File:Humanism.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Bus Campaign]]The American Humanist Association has received media attention for its various advertising campaigns; in 2010, the AHA's campaign was said to be the more expensive than similar ad campaigns from the [[American Atheists]] and [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Goodstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/us/10atheist.html Atheist Groups Promote a Holiday Message: Join Us], ''New York Times'' (November 9, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the AHA ran ads on buses in [[Washington, D.C.]] that proclaimed "Why believe in a god? Just be good for goodness' sake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,450445,00.html#ixzz1prwHj5ru | work=Fox News | title='Why Believe in a God?'

In 2010 the AHA launched another ad campaign promoting Humanism, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' said was the "first (atheist campaign) to include spots on television and cable"&lt;ref name=Goodstein&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/us/10atheist.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein | title=Atheists' Holiday Message: Join Us | date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by [[CNN]] as the "largest, most extensive advertising campaign ever by a godless organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/09/humanists-launch-huge-godless-ad-campaign/ | work=CNN | title=Humanists launch huge 'godless' ad campaign | date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign featured violent or sexist quotes from holy books, contrasted with quotes from humanist thinkers, including  physicist [[Albert Einstein]], biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], and anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]], and was largely underwritten by Todd Stiefel, a retired pharmaceutical company executive.&lt;ref name=Goodstein/&gt;

In late 2011 the AHA launched a holiday billboard campaign, placing advertisements in 7 different cities: [[Kearny, New Jersey]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Cranston, Rhode Island]]; [[Bastrop, Louisiana]]; [[Oregon City, Oregon]]; [[College Station, Texas]] and [[Rochester Hills, Michigan]]", cities where AHA states "atheists have experienced discrimination due to their lack of belief in a traditional god".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2011-11-american-humanist-association-naughty-atheist-awaren |title=Humanists Launch "Naughty" Awareness Campaign |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization spent more than $200,000 on their campaign which included a billboard reading "Yes, Virginia, there is no god."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/ad-campaign-promoting-atheism-us-draws-ire-protest/story?id=12314529#.T3MkJ9l8vTo |title=Ad Campaign Promoting Atheism Across U.S. Draws Ire and Protest - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the AHA launched a national ad campaign to promote a new website, KidsWithoutGod.com, with ads using the slogans "I'm getting a bit old for imaginary friends"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duke |first=Barry |url=http://freethinker.co.uk/2012/11/14/getting-to-old-for-imaginary-friends-american-humanists-have-the-answer/ |title=Getting too old for imaginary friends?

==National Day of Reason==
The [[National Day of Reason]] was created by the American Humanist Association and the [[Washington Area Secular Humanists]] in 2003. In addition to serving as a holiday for [[secularists]], the National Day of Reason was created in response to the perceived [[unconstitutionality]] of the [[National Day of Prayer]]. According to the organizers of the National Day of Reason, the [[National Day of Prayer]], "violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] because it asks [[federal government of the united states|federal]], [[state government in the United States|state]], and [[Local government in the United States|local government]] entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies".&lt;ref name="About National Day of Reason"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationaldayofreason.org/about.php |title=National Day of Reason History |access-date=2012-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408154835/http://www.nationaldayofreason.org/about.php |archive-date=2012-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations associated with the National Day of Reason have organized [[food drive]]s and [[blood donations]], while other groups have called for an end to prayer invocations at city meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/crt/blood.htm|title=Positive Protest Against the Day of Prayer!

== Reason Rally ==
In 2012, the American Humanist Association co-sponsored the [[Reason Rally (2012)|Reason Rally]], a national gathering of "humanists, atheists, freethinkers and nonbelievers from across the United States and abroad" in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2012-03-american-humanist-association-sponsors-reason-rally|title=American Humanist Association Sponsors Reason Rally, Largest Atheist Event in History|website=American Humanist Association|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally, held on the [[National Mall]], had speakers such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[James Randi]], [[Adam Savage]], and student activist [[Jessica Ahlquist|Jessica Ahlqvist]].

'''Anton Kržan''' ([[Marija Gorica]], June 8, 1835 - [[Zagreb]], November 6, 1888) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] philosopher, university professor and a rector.

Professor Kržan was the third ''rector magnificus'' of the [[University of Zagreb]], in the academic year 1876/1877. Since that year, the choice of rector is ''per turnum'' (every year the rector is chosen from another faculty). He received his Ph.D. in [[philosophy]] in 1859 in [[Rome]]. He was ordained in 1862, and a year later receiving a Ph.D. in [[theology]] in Rome. After the return to Zagreb, he worked as a professor at the Archiepiscopal Seminary where he taught [[metaphysics]] and special [[dogmatics]]. He served as a full professor at the Faculty of Theology since 1874.

Kržan wrote papers on the creation and the development of the organic world, being an ardent opponent of [[Darwinism]]. That was also a topic of his inaugural rectorial speech on October 19, 1876, when he was 41 years of age. After the expiry of his 1-year mandate, he served as a prorector. He was appointed as a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in 1879. In two mandates, he served as a dean of the Faculty of Theology.

According to the beliefs of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], '''Beyul''' ({{bo|t=སྦས་ཡུལ|w=sbas-yul}}) are hidden valleys often encompassing hundreds of square kilometers, which [[Padmasambhava]] blessed as refuges. [[Tertön]]s may reveal them from [[Terma (religion)|terma]] at specific and appropriate times.  Their locations were kept on scrolls (lamyig or neyig) hidden under rocks and inside caves, monasteries and [[stupa]]s. They are places where physical and spiritual worlds overlap and Tantric practice effectiveness increases with multiple perception dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ian|title=The Heart of the World: A Journey to Tibet's Lost Paradise|date=May 2, 2006|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143036029|pages=544|edition=Reprint|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143036025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padmasambhava assigned deities to protect the beyul. Protective forces manifest as [[winter storm|snowstorm]]s, [[mist]]s and [[snow leopard]]s. [[Buddhist texts]] indicate beyul are discovered when the planet is approaching destruction and the world becomes too corrupt for spiritual practice. They describe valleys reminiscent of paradise, which can only be reached with enormous hardship.  Pilgrims who travel to these wild and distant places often recount extraordinary experiences similar to those encountered by Buddhist spiritual practitioners on the path to liberation. People who try to force their way in may encounter failure and death.&lt;ref name="Sherpa Window"&gt;{{cite book

A recent attempt to open a beyul occurred in 1962, when the Tibetan lama Tulshuk Lingpa journeyed to [[Sikkim]] in order to 'open' Beyul Demoshong, a beyul fabled to exist on the slopes of Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] straddling the Nepal/Sikkim border. He took with him over 300 followers from across the Himalayas and Tibet, each of whom had given away his or her worldly goods. Their story is told in the recent book, A Step Away from Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Step Away from Paradise|last=Shor|first=Thomas|publisher=City Lion Press|year=2017|isbn=9780999291894|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barun Valley - Nghe.jpg|thumb|left| Nghe-Beyul at [[Barun Valley]].]]

Beyul are often understood to embody [[dharmapala]] and lords of the land, which are associated with the geographic features such as mountain, trees, rocks and water sources. Pilgrims make ritual offerings to these beings to appease their wrathful nature, and to renew the symbolic unity that people share with them.  It has been argued that this attitude indicates a [[sustainability|sustainable]] approach toward land stewardship.

'''Catholic [[imagination]]''' refers to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] viewpoint that [[God]] is present in the [[creation myth|whole creation]] and in [[human beings]], as seen in its [[Roman Catholic sacraments|sacramental system]] whereby [[materialism|material things]] and human beings are channels and sources of [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]].

==Origin of the term==
===Comparing "Catholic imagination" to "Protestant imagination"===
This [[terminology]] was popularized by the [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic priest]] [[Andrew Greeley]] who wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The central [[symbol]] (of [[religion]]) is God. One's "picture" of God is in fact a [[metaphor]]ical [[narrative]] of God's relationship with the [[world]] and the self as part of the world. ...The Catholic "classics" assume a God who is present in the world, disclosing Himself in and through creation. The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be somewhat like God. The [[Protestant]] classics, on the other hand, assume a God who is radically absent from the world, and who discloses (Himself) only on rare occasions (especially in [[Jesus Christ]] and Him [[crucifixion|crucified]]). The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be radically different from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Follman |first=Jeanne |date=4 February 2010 |title=What is the Sacramental Imagination? |url=http://www.aquinasblog.com/blog/2010/02/04/what-is-the-sacramental-imagination/ |website=Aquinasblog |access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Runar Eldebo, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] seminary instructor and [[correspondent]] for ''Pietisten'' (an online ecumenical newsletter), provided a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] slant on Greeley's distinction between Catholic imagination and Protestant imagination. Invoking [[Karl Barth]], Eldebo wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Protestant imagination is [[dialectic]] and makes people [[pilgrim]]s. It is deep in conflict and antagonistic to the ingredients of a common, human life. Catholic imagination is [[analogical]]. It is founded in creation itself and views creation as God in disguise. According to Catholic imagination, God lurks everywhere. According to Protestant imagination, Karl Barth for example, God is hidden everywhere but found only in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Therefore, according to Greeley, Protestants are never at home on earth, they are pilgrims on their way. Catholics, meanwhile, like to dwell on earth. They enjoy life and are not in a hurry to get to heaven because God lurks everywhere, especially where you do not expect her to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eldebo|first=Runar |year=2003 |title=Roman Catholic Imagination According to Andrew M. Greeley |url=http://www.pietisten.org/winter0304/greeley.html |magazine=Pietisten |volume=18 |issue=2 |location= Minneapolis, Minnesota |access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
American Catholic writer [[Flannery O'Connor]] illustrated the sacramental understanding of the world in her work "Novelist and Believer":&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] wrote that the things of the world pour forth from God in a double way: intellectually into the minds of the [[angels]] and physically into the world of things. To the person who believes this – as the [[western world]] did up until a few centuries ago – this physical, sensible world is good because it proceeds from a divine source ... When [[Joseph Conrad|[Joseph] Conrad]] said that his aim as an artist was to render the highest possible [[justice]] to the visible [[universe]], he was speaking with the novelist's surest instinct. The artist penetrates the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality.{{sfn|O'Connor|1961|p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Greeley aspects of the Catholic imagination include community, salvation, hierarchy, sacred place/sacred time, and sacred desire.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=124}} As one reviewer of Greeley's book noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural works include the [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Theresa|St. Theresa in Ecstasy]]'', Marian poems by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[François Villon]], Italian American films (especially those directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]), [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], the slow movement from [[Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 26 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto no. 26]], [[Verdi]]'s ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'', [[Mission San Xavier del Bac|St. Xavier del Bac Mission]], and [[Lars von Trier]]'s motion picture, ''[[Breaking the Waves]]''.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|pp=124–125}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Analogical and dialectical discourse===
In ''The Catholic Imagination'' (2000), Greeley's aim is to "specify how the Catholic imaginative tradition differs from other versions of the Western Christian story."{{sfn|Greeley|2000|p=5}} It informs its research through the work of [[David Tracy]], especially ''The Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism'' (1981). This work suggests a strategy informed by an analogical imagination as an answer to the theological question of how to "form a new and inevitably complex theological strategy that will avoid privatism" in religious discourse that embraces pluralism.{{sfn|Tracy|1981|p=xii}} Greeley argues that the metaphor inherent in the Catholic imagination is indicative of the necessity to use metaphor in order to relate knowledge generally:&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cognitive psychology|Cognitive psychologists]] have recently begun to insist that metaphors – statements that one reality is like another reality – are the fundamental tools of human knowledge.  We understand better and explain more adequately one reality to ourselves by comparing it to another reality which we already know.{{sfn|Greeley|2000|p=6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tracy sees the tendencies of Catholic artists, writers, and theologians to emphasize a metaphorical discourse – and a way to know the world through analogy – versus a Protestant tendency to stress the disconnect inherent in metaphor, as in a dialectical imagination, which Tracy designates as "a necessary corrective to the analogical imagination."{{sfn|Greeley|2000|p=8}}

==The Catholic imagination in postmodern and contemporary art==
Greeley states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The love of God for [Catholics], in perhaps the boldest of all metaphors (and one with which the Church has been perennially uneasy), is like the passionate love between man and woman.  God lurks in aroused human love and reveals Himself to us (the two humans first of all) through it.{{sfn|Greeley|2000|p=7}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The body as a medium===
Contemporary art critic and art historian Eleanor Heartney addresses these interpretations of the Catholic imagination in her work ''Postmodern Heretics: The Catholic Imagination in Contemporary Art'', bringing to light the complex relationships underlying Catholicism's sacramental vision and the "physically provocative work it seems to inspire."{{sfn|Heartney|2004|p=viii}} She discusses how sexualization of the spiritual in [[contemporary art]] and the adverse reactions it produces – which through the 1980s to today came to be part of what is known as the "[[culture war]]" – is affected in some work by a distinctly Catholic imagination. Heartney draws this connection from the work of those artists who grew up as Catholic or were in some way surrounded by Catholicism in their own lives. Emphasis on the body, its fluids, processes, or sexual behaviors as a site of turning cultural stereotype on its head points to a sacramental influence or underpinning that acknowledges the body and its senses as a way to know the world.  She references Greeley and Tracy "to posit the existence of a distinctly Catholic consciousness which is deeply immersed in sensuality and sexuality."{{sfn|Heartney|2004|p=7}}

===America as dialectical===
Heartney questions why the carnal understanding of the world seems to be so inflammatory in American society, and discusses whether this is "peculiarly American". She reveals that in the contemporary United States, the culture war seems to pit artists with the Catholic analogical underpinning "against spokespeople for a 'Christian' (read [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]]) America for whom flesh is a condition to be transcended rather than celebrated."{{sfn|Heartney|2004|p=15}}

===Complexity of the incarnational imagination===
Leo Steinberg's controversial ''The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion'' points out that, "Renaissance Art ... became the first Christian art in a thousand years to confront the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] entire, the upper and the lower body together, not excluding even the body's sexual component."{{sfn|Heartney|2004|p=13}} He goes on to reference several works in which Christ's genitals are the focal point of the image, intentionally, so as to counter a [[heresy]] denying Christ's humanity.  He indicates that the sexuality of Christ – of God – is indeed within the canon of Catholicism itself. This controversy continues into the contemporary Catholic religion as well, revealing still a deep-seated uneasiness over how fleshly an imagination is too fleshly an imagination.  Greeley makes this point:&lt;blockquote&gt;The propensity to protect God from profanation, at the heart of the dialectical imagination, is very strong even among Catholics because official Catholicism has yet to make up its mind whether it really believes that sexual passion is not in itself lewd or lustful.{{sfn|Greeley|2000|p=9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Postmodern artists and artists today, influenced by the Catholic imagination, who are using aspects of the body to pose their questions to society, are frequently working out of the inherently complex contradictions of sacramental vision.

[[Imperial Count]] '''Christian Renatus von [[Zinzendorf]] und Pottendorf''' (September 19, 1727 - May 28, 1752) was the charismatic leader of the Single Brethren's Choir of the [[Moravian Church]] and of [[Herrnhaag]] (The Lord’s Grove), a Christian religious community built near [[Büdingen]] by his father, [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Count Nicholas Ludwig]], head of the ''Brüdergemeine'' or [[Moravian Church|Moravian Unity]]. Christian Renatus, affectionately known as '''Christel''', took his father’s marriage religion (''Ehereligion'') literally, proclaiming himself to be the living "Sidewound of Christ" in 1748, which meant he was the embodiment of Christ's sacrificial and compassionate love.

The younger Zinzendorf and his co-elder of the Single Brethren, Joachim Rubusch, also proclaimed themselves to be married to the Sidewound. This derived in part from the teaching of Zinzendorf’s father that all souls are female, regardless of gender, so that they may be married to Christ. (This image is derived from the fact that "soul" in German, ''die Seele'', is always a feminine noun.[''Cassel'''s ''German-English Dictionary'', entry ''die Seele''.]  It was also in 1748 that Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf declared all Single Brethren to be Sisters and therefore Brides of Christ.

The compounding of sexuality and spirituality at Herrnhaag led to virulent attacks from outside and within the church, threatening to undo the goodwill with other denominations that the elder Zinzendorf had sought for decades. He dismissed his son from his positions and brought him to England for the remaining three years of Christian's life.

After his death, Christian's followers in Pennsylvania named a settlement farm after him.  Since there was a flowing spring there it was called "Christiansbrunn", Christian's Spring.  while church leaders systematically destroyed most of the documents referring to the events at Herrnhaag. Only within the past two decades has a new generation of scholars and historians begun to reexamine that period to determine what happened.
[[File:Herrnhaag 1.jpg|thumb|Herrnhaag about the time it was under the leadership of Christian Renatus.]]

==Birth and formative years==
Zinzendorf was born just a month after the spiritual awakening experience on August 13, 1727, that signaled the renewal of the Ancient Unity of Brethren, in which Moravian exiles on the lands of his father committed themselves to a life in Christ. Both his parents were deeply committed to this ideal. His father and his mother, ''née'' [[Erdmuthe Dorothea of Reuss-Ebersdorf|Countess Erdmuthe Dorothea Reuss-Ebersdorf]], came from [[Pietist]] families that stressed the indwelling of the spirit. His parents considered their relationship to be a marriage of champions in which the goal was serving Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Erika (2006) Erdmuth Dorothea - Countess von Zinzendorf - Noble Servant.  Winston-Salem: John F. Blair. pp. 13. {{ISBN|0-89587-328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Zinzendorf was left in the care of his mother for most of his youth while his father pursued church activities elsewhere. His [[effeminacy]] was noted by nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century historians who typically attributed it his being raised in the company of women: "Christian Renatus . . . had all the ardor without the virility characteristic of his father." &lt;ref&gt;Levering, Joseph Mortimer. (1903) A History of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 1741-1892. Bethlehem: Times Publishing Company. pp. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong mother/weak or distant father parenting style typically associated with early [[psychoanalytic]] attempts to explain homosexuality was also used to further discredit Zinzendorf. As a student, Zinzendorf was known for being frivolous, even bringing a cat to class. At the age of sixteen, he was named vice-elder of the Single Brothers Choir. Moravian communities were dedicated to serving Christ. The traditional family unit was abandoned in order to direct all residents' energies to that goal. Much like the [[Shakers]], Moravian residents lived in groups or choirs according to gender, marital status and age.

==Christel as Christ's representative==
Many of Zinzendorf's beliefs and acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; he lives in me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, and when you have a word from me, so too you have it from him.” &lt;ref&gt;Craig D. Atwood, (1995) Blood, Sex, and Death: Life and Liturgy in Zinzendorf’s Bethlehem. Ph.D. diss., Princeton Theological Seminary. pp. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, painting and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words ''Gebrochne Augen''(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.

The idea of Christ living in another was not uncommon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is a fundamental belief shared with the [[Quakers]] and Shakers, who also had roots in Pietism and the indwelling of Christ.

[[File:Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf engraving.jpg|thumb|Mid-18th-century engraving with the (translated) words "The lovely poem/which one can see from his forehead/is the simple story/that our lord departed."]]

==Leadership and loss of leadership==
Herrnhaag was a community designed by the elder Zinzendorf, whose inhabitants were to live under the direct rule of Christ with Christian Renatus as his representative. At Herrnhaag, Christel was the link between the spiritual and the earthly as the spirit took human form. During the 1748 Single Brothers Festival at Herrnhaag, Christel and his assistants entered wearing white robes, implying it was Christ who was actually entering. Later that day, Christel and twelve assistants led Communion, further representing Christ and the apostles. During the service, those in attendance believed that the Sidehole of Christ was literally standing before them in the bodily forms of Christel and Rubusch, his co-leader of the brothers. Christel sang a welcoming hymn for Christ entering the hall, and while kissing, the brothers believed they were literally kissing the Sidehole.&lt;ref&gt;Peucker. pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of sexuality and spirituality shown at Herrnhaag was not unknown in Christian history, but it caused increasing scandal both within and without the church, particularly embarrassing for Nicholas, "who was trying to be recognized as a rightful theologian after joining the confession of Augsburg" in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Hergemoeller, Bernd-Ulrich. (1999) "Nikolaus Ludwig von and Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf," Mann fuer Mann. Hamburg: [[Männerschwarm]]. pp 765. Translated by Hilke Kuhlmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Christel’s mother was concerned, realizing the events taking place at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn were at the edge where metaphor and reality meet. Referring to a plowshare that can be raised and lowered, she later wrote to her son that "I sometimes said we have already put the peg in the last hole. If we wanted to remain in the world, the Savior would have to make three or four holes further back and lower down."&lt;ref&gt;Geiger. pp. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to increasingly embarrassing scandal and rumor, the cost of sustaining Herrnhaag and its numerous festivals put a severe financial strain on the church at a time when its missionary efforts were expanding around the world. Events reached such a point that Christel’s father denounced what was happening at Herrnhaag and ordered Christel to attend him in England. "When the twenty-two-year-old returned to Herrnhaag, he was physically and mentally broken. In August 1750 he founded a ''Bund auf die Marter Gottes'' (Covenant on the ordeal of God). During this 'phase of consolation' ordered by his father, he also composed several 'purified' poems."&lt;ref&gt;Hergemoeller. pp. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and apotheosis==
Zinzendorf died in a house in Dean's Yard of [[Westminster Abbey]], London, on May 28, 1752, from a hemorrhage due to tuberculosis, with John Nitschmann, his former tutor, beside him. He was buried on the grounds of [[Lindsey House]], "Sharon," the [[Moravian Burial Ground|Moravian Graveyard located in Chelsea]] outside London, where his father lived at that time while directing the worldwide missionary effort of the church.

When the Moravian Brethren and Sisters refused to forswear their allegiance to the elder Zinzendorf and sever their connection to the Moravian Church in the 1750s at the insistence of [[Isenburg-Büdingen#Counts of Isenburg-Büdingen-Büdingen (1341–1511)|Gustav Friedrich, Count of Isenburg-Büdingen]], Herrnhaag was closed and a great number of Moravians came to [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] and [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] in Pennsylvania. A farming community had already been established near Nazareth for the Single Brethren named ''[[Christiansbrunn]]'', Christian's Spring. One of the brothers wrote a poem stating that Christel lived again in the Congregation at the spring and that the flowing waters restored him “more and more.” &lt;ref&gt;Dennis Glew, “Christian Wedstedt’s Journey from London to Pennsylvania, June 13-September 14, 1753,” Unitas Fratrum, 10 (1981), 86-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical perspective==
For more than 200 years after his death, Christel was looked upon as a failure by Moravian historians and scholars, who saw him as weak, effeminate, ineffectual and a grave disappointment to his father whose trust he had betrayed. The only way most Moravians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries knew him was by the inclusion of several of his hymns in various Moravian hymnals, the most famous being “My Redeemer, overwhelmed with anguish, went to Olivet for me.”

Indeed, the entire period (approximately 1747-1749) became known as the "Sifting Time" from Luke 22:31: “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat.” Nicholas Zinzendorf called the ensuing scandal an “unbridled freedom of the flesh.” &lt;ref name="Peucker. pp. 63"&gt;Peucker. pp. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; His representative told the residents at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn that it was impossible to be "truly unified with our Husband" while living on earth.&lt;ref name="Peucker. pp. 63"/&gt; He further added that the residents had mistaken metaphor for reality and wrongly believed that the brothers were actually sisters.

Historians for the next two hundred years accepted this view of events and wrote off what happened as a time of embarrassing excess from which the church was saved only by the timely intervention of Nicholas.

Determining exactly what happened was made exceedingly difficult due to extensive destruction of documents amounting to official censorship that began in the eighteenth century by church officials and even archivists. There was a general shunning of the period that lasted well into the twentieth century, and almost no pertinent documents remain in either in the major Moravian archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania or Herrnhut, Germany.

A new generation of scholars and historians interested in determining exactly what happened have been able to locate documents in private collections and other sources. An indication of renewed interest in Christian Renatus and what he meant to his time was shown in September, 2008 when a birthday festival was held in his honor in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania based on eighteenth-century sources and sponsored by the Historic Bethlehem Partnership, the Moravian Music Foundation and the Moravian Archives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11024">The traditional [[culture of the Southern United States]] has been called a "culture of [[honor]]", that is, a culture where people avoid intentionally offending others, and maintain a [[reputation]] for not accepting improper conduct by others. A prevalent theory as to why the American South had or may have this culture is an assumed regional belief in [[Retributive justice|retribution]] to enforce one's rights and deter predation against one’s family, home and possessions. The concept was tested by social scientists [[Richard Nisbett]] and Dov Cohen in their book ''Culture of Honor''&lt;ref name="Nisbett, R.E. 1996"&gt;Nisbett, R.E., &amp; Cohen, D. (1996). ''Culture of honor: The psychology of violence in the South''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and repopularized by a discussion in Chapter Six of ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' by [[Malcolm Gladwell]].

==Background==

The "culture of honor" in the Southern United States is hypothesized by some social scientists&lt;ref name="Nisbett, R.E. 1996"/&gt; to have its roots in the livelihoods of the early settlers who first inhabited the region.  Unlike settlers with an agricultural heritage (mainly from the densely populated [[South East England]] and [[East Anglia]]) who settled in [[New England]], the [[Southern United States]] was settled by herders from [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Northern England]] and the [[West Country]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Herds, unlike crops, are vulnerable to theft because they are mobile and there is little government wherewithal to enforce property rights of herd animals. The theory is that developing a reputation for violent retribution against those who stole herd animals was one way to discourage [[Cattle raiding|theft]].

This thesis is limited, however, by modern evidence that a culture of honor in the American South is strongest not in the hill country, where this thesis suggests it has its cultural origins, but in Southern lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200904/is-southern-violence-due-culture-honor Nigel Barber, "Is Southern violence due to a culture of honor?", ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (April 2, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; These observers argue that [[poverty]] or [[religion]], which has been distinctive in the American South since the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the 19th century, may be a more important source of this cultural phenomenon.

Other theories  point out that the culture of honor may have its roots in the settlement of the region by members of British aristocratic families.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=PqWR2y-FKfYC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of women==

The Southern culture of honor also includes a notion that [[Lady|ladies]] should not be insulted by [[gentlemen]]. Southern gentlemen are also expected to be [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] towards women, in words and deeds.

Although "culture of honor" qualities have been generally associated with men in the southern United States, women in this region have also been affected and even shown some of the same qualities. In ''Culture of Honor'', it is stated that women play a part in the culture, both "through their role in the socialization process, as well as active participation." By passing these ideas along to their children, they are taking part in [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name="Culture of Honor p. 119"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard E. Nisbett and Dov Cohen|title=Culture of Honor: The Psychology of Violence in the South|year=1996|publisher=Colorado: Westview Press, Inc.|pages=119|url=http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/cultureofhonor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

Laboratory research has demonstrated that men in honor cultures perceive interpersonal threats more readily than do men in other cultures, including increases in cortisol and testosterone levels following insults.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, D., Nisbett, R.

==Sociology==
The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]], a Professor of History at [[Brandeis University]], makes a  case for an enduring genetic basis for a "willingness to resort to violence" (citing especially the finding of high blood levels of [[testosterone]] as discussed [[#Psychology|above]]) in the four main chapters of his book ''[[Albion's Seed]]''.&lt;ref&gt; particularly the chapter titled "Borderlands to the Backcountry: The Flight from Middle Britain and Northern Ireland, 1717-1775"&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that a Southern propensity for violence is inheritable by genetic changes wrought over generations living in traditional herding societies in [[Northern England]], the [[Scottish Borders]], and Irish [[Border Region]]. He proposes that this propensity has been transferred to other ethnic groups by shared culture, whence it can be traced to different urban populations of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', ({{ISBN|0-19-506905-6}}), [[Oxford University Press]], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; However, honor cultures were and are widely prevalent in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, John. ''Honour in African History''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. xxiv + 404 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-521-54685-0}} (paper), {{ISBN|978-0-521-83785-9}} (cloth).&lt;/ref&gt; and many other places.

Randolph Roth, in his ''American Homicide'' (2009), states that the idea of a culture of honor is oversimplified.&lt;ref name="Roth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Randolph|title=American Homicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNTu6vYe9wgC|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05454-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the violence often committed by Southerners resulted from social tensions. He hypothesizes that when people feel that they are denied social success or the means to attain it, they will be more prone to commit violent acts. His argument is that Southerners were in tension, possibly due to poor Whites being marginalized by rich Whites, free and enslaved Blacks being denied basic rights, and rich and politically empowered Whites having their power threatened by Northern politicians pushing for more federal control of the South, especially over [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]. He argues that issues over honor just triggered the already present hostility, and that people took their frustration out through violent acts often on the surface over issues of honor. He draws historical records of violence across the U.S. and [[Europe]] to show that violence largely accompanies perceptions of political weakness and the inability to advance oneself in society. Roth also shows that although the South was "obsessed with honor" in the mid-18th century, there was relatively little homicide. &lt;!--{{Clarify|including or excluding duels and other killings widely seen as justified?|date=October 2010}}--&gt; Barring under-reported crime against some groups, low homicide may simply have been [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentlemanly self-restraint]] at a time when social order was stable, a trend that reverses in the 19th century and later.{{efn|name=fn1}}

== War ==
A 2016 study suggests that honor culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under Southern presidents are "twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoe|first=Allan|last2=Caughey|first2=Devin|date=2016-04-01|title=Honor and War|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887115000416|journal=World Politics|volume=68|issue=02|pages=341–381|doi=10.1017/S0043887115000416|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=fn1|In ''American Homicide'', Randolph Roth charts changes in the character and incidence of homicide in the U.S. from colonial times to the present. Roth argues that the United States is distinctive in its level of violence among unrelated adults—friends, acquaintances, and strangers. America was extraordinarily homicidal in the mid-seventeenth century, but it became relatively non-homicidal by the mid-eighteenth century, even in the slave South; and by the early nineteenth century, rates in the North and the mountain South were extremely low. But the homicide rate rose substantially among unrelated adults in the slave South after the American Revolution; and it skyrocketed across the United States from the late 1840s through the mid-1870s, while rates in most other Western nations held steady or fell. That surge—and all subsequent increases in the homicide rate—correlated closely with four distinct phenomena: political instability; a loss of government legitimacy; a loss of fellow-feeling among members of society caused by racial, religious, or political antagonism; and a loss of faith in the social hierarchy. Those four factors, Roth argues, best explain why homicide rates have gone up and down in the United States and in other Western nations over the past four centuries, and why the United States is today the most homicidal affluent nation.&lt;ref name="Roth2009" /&gt;}}

'''Edith Stein''' (religious name '''Teresia Benedicta a Cruce''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Discalced Carmelites|OCD]]}}; also known as '''St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross'''; 12 October 1891 – 9 August 1942), was a [[German Jewish]] philosopher who converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and became a [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] [[nun]]. She is canonized as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]] of the Catholic Church, and she is one of six co-patron saints of Europe.

She was born into an observant [[Jews|Jewish]] family, but was an [[atheist]] by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of [[World War I]], in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis from the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1916, she obtained an assistantship at the [[University of Freiburg]].

From reading the works of the reformer of the [[Carmelite Order]], [[Teresa of Ávila]], she was drawn to the Catholic faith. She was [[baptized]] on 1 January 1922 into the Roman Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentors. She then taught at a Catholic [[school of education]] in [[Speyer]]. As a result of the requirement of an "[[Aryan certificate]]" for [[civil servant]]s promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], she had to quit her teaching position.

She was admitted to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in [[Cologne]] the following October. She received the [[religious habit]] of the Order as a [[novice]] in April 1934, taking the [[religious name]] Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. In 1938, she and her sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern sister (tertiaries of the Order, who would handle the community′s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]], [[Netherlands]], for their safety. Despite the Nazi invasion of that state in 1940, they remained undisturbed until they were arrested by the [[Nazi]]s on 2 August 1942 and sent to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where they died in the [[gas chamber]] on 9 August 1942.

==Early life==
Stein was born in [[Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), [[Lower Silesia]], into an observant Jewish family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day of the [[Hebrew calendar]], which combined to make her a favorite of her mother.&lt;ref name=VNS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html |title=Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein |work=Vatican News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's strong religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an atheist.

Though her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Stein to study at the [[University of Breslau]] (also known as "Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität").

==Academic career==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
In April 1913 Stein arrived in Göttingen in order to study for the summer semester with [[Edmund Husserl]].  By the end of the summer she had decided to pursue her degree as a philosopher under Husserl and "Empathy" had been chosen as her thesis topic.  Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of World War I. She then served as a volunteer wartime [[Red Cross]] nurse in an infectious diseases hospital at [[Märisch-Weisskirchen]] in 1915.  In 1916, Stein moved to Freiburg in order to complete her dissertation on Empathy.  Shortly before receiving her degree she agreed to become Husserl's assistant.  After her dissertation entitled ''Zum Problem der Einfühlung'' (''On the Problem of Empathy'') was awarded on August 3, 1916, which made her a doctor of philosophy with the ''[[summa cum laude]]'' honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DURuCQAAQBAJ |title=Body, Text, and Science: The Literacy of Investigative Practices and the Phenomenology of Edith Stein |author=M. Sawicki |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2013 |isbn=9401139792 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; she began working independently as Husserl's assistant.  In his 2007 thesis, "The Philosophical Contributions of Edith Stein",&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmsson, John Christopher, "The philosophical contributions of Edith Stein." (2007). Master's Theses. 4017. http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/etd_theses/4017&lt;/ref&gt; John C. Wilhelmsson argues that Stein influenced the work of Husserl significantly during this period. She then became a member of the faculty at the [[University of Freiburg]], where she worked as a [[teaching assistant]] to Husserl, who had transferred to that institution. Because she was a woman, Husserl did not support her submitting her [[habilitation]]al thesis (a prerequisite for an academic chair) to the University of Freiburg in 1918. Her other thesis, ''Psychische Kausalität'' (''Sentient Causality''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nuim.ie/393/1/Edith_Stein.pdf |first1=Mette |last=1Lebech |title=Study Guide to Edith Stein's Philosophy of Psychology and the Humanities |work=Faculty of Philosophy, NUIM, Maynooth}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted at the [[University of Göttingen]] the following year, was likewise rejected.

While Stein had earlier contacts with Roman Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic St. [[Teresa of Ávila]] during summer holidays in [[Bad Bergzabern]] in 1921 that prompted her conversion. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the religious life, she obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in [[Speyer]] from 1923 to 1931. While there, she translated [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''De Veritate'' (''Of Truth'') into [[German language|German]], familiarized herself with Roman Catholic philosophy in general, and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to [[Thomism]]. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific [[Pedagogy]] in [[Münster]], but [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] legislation passed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to [[Pope Pius XI]], she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime "to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name."

{{quote|
As a child of the Jewish people who, by the grace of God, for the past eleven years has also been a child of the Catholic Church, I dare to speak to the Father of Christianity about that which oppresses millions of Germans. For weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in Germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity, not to mention love of neighbor. For years the leaders of National Socialism have been preaching hatred of the Jews.... But the responsibility must fall, after all, on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in the face of such happenings.

Everything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself 'Christian'. For weeks not only Jews but also thousands of faithful Catholics in Germany, and, I believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name. Is not this idolization of race and governmental power which is being pounded into the public consciousness by the radio open heresy? Isn't the effort to destroy Jewish blood an abuse of the holiest humanity of our Savior, of the most blessed Virgin and the apostles? Is not all this diametrically opposed to the conduct of our Lord and Savior, who, even on the cross, still prayed for his persecutors? And isn't this a black mark on the record of this Holy Year which was intended to be a year of peace and reconciliation? We all, who are faithful children of the Church and who see the conditions in Germany with open eyes, fear the worst for the prestige of the Church, if the silence continues any longer.

Her letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever read it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/this-europe-letters-reveal-auschwitz-victims-plea-to-pope-pius-xi-598301.html |title=This Europe: Letters reveal Auschwitz victim's plea to Pope Pius XI |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=2003-02-21 |location=London |first=Peter |last=Popham |date=February 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' (''With Burning Anxiety''), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.

==Discalced Carmelite nun and martyr==
Stein entered the [[Discalced Carmelite]] monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in [[Cologne]] in 1933 and took the [[religious name]] of Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. There she wrote her [[metaphysical]] book ''Endliches und ewiges Sein'' (''Finite and Eternal Being''), which attempted to combine the philosophies of [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]] and Husserl.

To avoid the growing [[Nazism|Nazi]] threat, her Order transferred her and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]], [[Netherlands]]. There she wrote ''Studie über Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft'' ("Studies on [[John of the Cross]]: The Science of the Cross"). In her testament of 6 June 1939 she wrote: "I beg the Lord to take my life and my death … for all concerns of the sacred hearts of Jesus and Mary and the holy [C]hurch, especially for the preservation of our holy [O]rder, in particular the Carmelite monasteries of Cologne and Echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the Jewish People, and that the Lord will be received by [H]is own people and [H]is kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all God gave to me: that none of them shall go astray."

Stein's move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52"&gt;Mosley, J. (2006). The Ultimate Sacrifice. In Edith Stein: Modern Saint and Martyr (pp. 43-52). Mahwah, N.J.: HiddenSpring.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed she would not survive the war, going as far to write the Prioress to request her permission to "allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace" and made a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began "quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger" after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940.&lt;ref name="Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52"/&gt;

Ultimately, she was not safe in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany|Dutch Bishops' Conference]] had a public statement read in all the churches of the nation on 20 July 1942 condemning Nazi [[racism]]. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the [[Reichskommissar]] of the Netherlands, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews living in the Netherlands, Stein was arrested by the [[SS]] on 2 August 1942. Stein and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] and [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] before being deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edith Stein Convert, Nun, Martyr
|last1=Garcia |first1=Laura |date=June 6, 1997 |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center |accessdate=December 3, 2014 |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/edith-stein-convert-nun-martyr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he offered her an escape plan. Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating, "If somebody intervened at this point and took away her chance to share in the fate of her brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation."&lt;ref name="Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52"/&gt;

On 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. It was probably on 9 August that Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, her sister, and many more of her people were killed in a mass [[gas chamber]].&lt;ref name=VNS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=María Ruiz |last=Scaperlanda |title=Edith Stein: St. Teresia Benedicta of the Cross |place=Huntington, Indiana |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Press |year=2001 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and veneration==
Stein was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in [[Cologne]], Germany by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in [[Vatican City]]. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization was the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of [[paracetamol]] ([[acetaminophen]]), which causes [[Hepatic vein|hepatic]] [[necrosis]]. The young girl's father, Rev. [[Emmanuel Charles McCarthy]], a priest of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], immediately called together relatives and prayed for St. Teresa's intercession.&lt;ref name="Toronto"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewish-born nun gassed by Nazis is declared saint; Prayer to Edith Stein sparked tot's 'miraculous' recovery |date=May 24, 1997 |work=The Toronto Star |pages=A22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up completely healthy. Dr. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to Church tribunals, stating: "I was willing to say that it was miraculous."&lt;ref name="Toronto"/&gt; McCarthy would later attend St. Teresa's canonization.

St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six [[patron saint]]s of [[Europe]], together with Sts. [[Benedict of Nursia]], [[Cyril and Methodius]], [[Bridget of Sweden]], and [[Catherine of Siena]].

Today there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ess-darmstadt.de |publisher=Ess-darmstadt.de |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hengelo]], [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edithsteincollege.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpcdsb.org/STEIN |title=St. Edith Stein Elementary School |publisher=Dpcdsb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also named for her are a women's dormitory at the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edith-stein-heim.de/ |title=Edith-Stein-Studentinnen-Wohnheim |publisher=Edith-stein-heim.de |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a classroom building at [[The College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] published a book in 2006 titled ''Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922'', in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with [[Martin Heidegger]], whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a "bifurcation of personality."&lt;ref name="macstein"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xpe4WJX8kV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Edith+Stein+Alasdair+MacIntyre#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |first1=Alasdair C. |last1=MacIntyre |title=Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922 |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |location=Lanham, Md |year=2006 |page=5 |isbn=9780742559530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright Arthur Giron wrote ''Edith Stein'', a play that was inspired by Stein's life. It was produced at the [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/508/edith-stein&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Hungarian film director, [[Márta Mészáros]] made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title ''[[The Seventh Chamber|A hetedik szoba]]'' (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring [[Maia Morgenstern]]. 

In 2008, a memorial ''[[Stolperstein]]'' (Polish: ''kamienie pamięci'') was placed near Stein's childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstrasse) in Wrocław.

In 2009 her [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] was installed at the [[Walhalla Memorial]] near [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]]. In June 2009 the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edithsteincircle.com |title=The International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein |publisher=Edith Stein Circle |work=edithsteincircle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of [[D-Day]], a bell dedicated to her was named by [[Prince Charles]] at [[Bayeux]] Cathedral.

Also in 2014, the book ''Edith Stein and [[Regina Jonas]]: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps'', by Emily Leah Silverman, was published.

==Controversy as to the cause of her murder==
The [[beatification]] of St. Teresa Benedicta as a [[martyr#Christianity|martyr]] generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Catholic faith,&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, Leon Klenicki (October 1998). [http://www.adl.org/opinion/edith_stein.asp "The Canonization of Edith Stein: An Unnecessary Problem"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525130544/http://www.adl.org/opinion/edith_stein.asp |date=2011-05-25 }}, ''[[Anti-Defamation League]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to "carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities" because "official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Harry James Cargas |first1=Harry James (ed.) |last1=Cargas |year=1994 |title=The Unnecessary Problem of Edith Stein |work=Studies in the Shoah |volume=IV |publisher=[[University Press of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.

''Journal of Ecumenical Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the [[Catholic Church]] is that St. Teresa Benedicta also died because of the Dutch episcopacy's public condemnation of Nazi racism in 1942; in other words, that she died because of the moral teaching of the Church and is thus a true martyr.&lt;ref name=VNS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1998/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_11101998_stein_en.html |title=Canonization Homily |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129060507/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1998/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_11101998_stein_en.html |archivedate=2012-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''Freedom of contract''' is the freedom of private or public individuals and groups (of any legal entity) to form nonviolent contracts without [[Economic regulation|government restrictions]].  This is opposed to government restrictions such as [[minimum wage|minimum-]] or [[maximum wage|maximum-wage laws]], [[competition laws]], [[economic sanctions]], restrictions on [[price fixing]], or restrictions on contracting with [[second-class citizens]] or [[undocumented workers]].  The freedom to contract is the underpinning of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and is a cornerstone of [[Free market|free-market]] [[libertarianism]].  Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general [[freedom of choice|freedom to choose]] with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.

==History==
[[Henry James Sumner Maine]] proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from [[social status]] to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by [[Robert Nozick]], sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a "[[night-watchman state|minimal state]]."

==United States==
===''Lochner v. New York''===
{{Main|Lochner v. New York}}
In 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to "due process." Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] used the [[due process clause]] to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]] wrote for the majority: "Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment."

Writing in dissent, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] accused the majority of basing its decision on [[laissez-faire]] ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that "Liberty of Contract" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution.

===Afterward===
In his "Liberty of Contract" (1909), [[Roscoe Pound]] critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were "simply wrong" from the standpoint of common law and "even from that of a sane individualism" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of [[usury]] and that the two were "of the same type" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such "academic" and "artificial" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a "lost respect for the courts" but predicted a "bright" future for labor legislation (486-487).&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe Pound, "Liberty of Contract," 18 Yale Law Journal 454 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''. In that case the court upheld a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] law setting a [[minimum wage]].

==United Kingdom==
In the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused "freedom of contract" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in ''[[Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1875) 19 Eq 462, 465, regarding freedom of contract and patents&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir George Jessel MR]]. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In ''[[George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd]]'', [[Lord Denning MR]] compared "freedom of contract" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.

{{quote|''The heyday of freedom of contract''

None of you nowadays will remember the trouble we had – when I was called to the Bar – with exemption clauses. They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of "freedom of contract". But the freedom was all on the side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket or order form or invoice. The big concern said, "Take it or leave it." The little man had no option but to take it. The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, "You must put it in clear words", the big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption clauses or understand them.

It was a bleak winter for our law of contract. It is illustrated by two cases, ''[[Thompson v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Co.]]'' [1930] 1 K.B. 41 (in which there was exemption from liability, not on the ticket, but only in small print at the back of the timetable, and the company were held not liable) and ''[[L'Estrange v. F. Graucob Ltd.]]'' [1934] 2 K.B. 394 (in which there was complete exemption in small print at the bottom of the order form, and the company were held not liable).

''The secret weapon''

Faced with this abuse of power – by the strong against the weak – by the use of the small print of the conditions – the judges did what they could to put a curb upon it. They still had before them the idol, "freedom of contract". They still knelt down and worshipped it, but they concealed under their cloaks a secret weapon. They used it to stab the idol in the back. This weapon was called "the true construction of the contract". They used it with great skill and ingenuity. They used it so as to depart from the natural meaning of the words of the exemption clause and to put upon them a strained and unnatural construction. In case after case, they said that the words were not strong enough to give the big concern exemption from liability; or that in the circumstances the big concern was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause. If a ship deviated from the contractual voyage, the owner could not rely on the exemption clause. If a warehouseman stored the goods in the wrong warehouse, he could not pray in aid the limitation clause. If the seller supplied goods different in kind from those contracted for, he could not rely on any exemption from liability. If a shipowner delivered goods to a person without production of the bill of lading, he could not escape responsibility by reference to an exemption clause. In short, whenever the wide words – in their natural meaning – would give rise to an unreasonable result, the judges either rejected them as repugnant to the main purpose of the contract, or else cut them down to size in order to produce a reasonable result. This is illustrated by these cases in the House of Lords: ''[[Glynn v. Margetson &amp; Co.]]'' [1893] A.C. 351; ''[[London and North Western Railway Co. v. Neilson]]'' [1922] 2 A.C. 263; ''[[Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Buerger]]'' [1927] A.C. 1; and by ''[[Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King]]'' [1952] A.C. 192 and ''[[Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd. v. Rambler Cycle Co. Ltd.]]'' [1959] A.C. 576 in the Privy Council; and innumerable cases in the Court of Appeal, culminating in ''[[Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Cleaning Co. Ltd.]]'' [1978] Q.B. 69. But when the clause was itself reasonable and gave rise to a reasonable result, the judges upheld it; at any rate, when the clause did not exclude liability entirely but only limited it to a reasonable amount. So where goods were deposited in a cloakroom or sent to a laundry for cleaning, it was quite reasonable for the company to limit their liability to a reasonable amount, having regard to the small charge made for the service. These are illustrated by ''[[Gibaud v. Great Eastern Railway Co.]]'' [1921] 2 K.B. 426; ''[[Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd]]'' [1945] K.B. 189 and ''[[Gillespie Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd. v Roy Bowles Transport Ltd.]]'' [1973] Q.B. 400.}}

With the aid of scholarships, he did Further studies at [[Cambridge University]] and was able to go to Germany to study at the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War I]] he returned to Britain. In 1916 he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if he saw active service but it inspired an interest in aerodynamics.

Researching [[aeronautics]] at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], Levy published papers and books on mathematical applications pertaining to aeronautics. He also wrote about [[differential equations]] and probability.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; After leaving the laboratory, he became a professor of mathematics at the Royal College of Science of [[Imperial College London]] where he later served as the head of the department. At Imperial, he is believed to have greatly improved the department of mathematics, and in recognition to his contribution, he later became the dean of the Royal College of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Levy_Hyman.html|title=Levy_Hyman biography|last=|first=|date=|website=www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Cargill Gilston Knott]], [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]], [[James Robert Milne]] and [[George Carse|George Alexander Carse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, he married Marion Aitken Fraser,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; despite the disapproval of his family.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; They had three children. Levy was in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 1920 to 1931, and then in 1931 he joined the [[British Communist Party]]. Despite his theoretical allegiance to the principles of communism, Levy became disappointed by the way the Russian communists treated Jews, and published on the topic, leading to his expulsion from the party in 1958.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

He died in [[Wimbledon, London]] on 27 February 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Levy's paper "On Goldbach's Conjecture" from 1963, [[Lemoine's conjecture]] is incorrectly referred to by [[MathWorld]] as "Levy's conjecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Levy's Conjecture|urlname=LevysConjecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TAIAN in MyokiAN Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Sen no Rikyū's [[chashitsu]]]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Ichi-go ichi-e'''''|[[wiktionary:一|一]][[wiktionary:期|期]][[wiktionary:一|一]][[wiktionary:会|会]]||lit. "one time, one meeting"|{{IPA-ja|it͡ɕi̥.ɡo it͡ɕi̥.e|}}|lead=yes}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] four-character idiom (''[[yojijukugo]]'') that describes a cultural concept of treasuring meetings with people.  The term is often translated as "for this time only," "never again," or "one chance in a lifetime." The term reminds people to cherish any gathering that they may take part in, citing the fact that many meetings in life are not repeated. Even when the same group of people can get together again, a particular gathering will never be replicated, and thus, each moment is always once-in-a-lifetime.&lt;ref name="ii"/&gt; The concept is most commonly associated with [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese tea ceremonies]], especially tea masters [[Sen no Rikyū]] and  [[Ii Naosuke]].

==History==
[[File:Sen no Rikyu JPN.jpg|thumb|Sen no Rikyu]]
The term can be traced back to the 16th century to an expression by tea master [[Sen no Rikyū]]: {{nihongo|"one chance in a lifetime"|一期に一度|ichigo ni ichido}}.&lt;ref name="omotesenke"/&gt; Rikyū's apprentice [[Yamanoue Sōji]] instructs in ''Yamanoue Sōji Ki'' to give respect to your host {{nihongo|"as though it were a meeting that could occur only once in the lifetime"|一期に一度の会のように|ichigo ni ichido no e no yō ni}}.&lt;ref name="varley"/&gt; Ichigo ({{lang|ja|一期}}) is a Buddhist term meaning "from one's birth to death", i.e. one's lifetime.

Later, in the mid-19th century, [[Ii Naosuke]], [[Tairō]] (chief administrator) of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], elaborated on the concept in ''Chanoyu Ichie Shū'':&lt;ref name=ii/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Great attention should be given to a tea gathering, which we can speak of as "one time, one meeting" (''ichigo, ichie''). Even though the host and guests may see each other often socially, one day's gathering can never be repeated exactly. Viewed this way, the meeting is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime occasion. The host, accordingly, must in true sincerity take the greatest care with every aspect of the gathering and devote himself entirely to ensuring that nothing is rough. The guests, for their part, must understand that the gathering cannot occur again and, appreciating how the host has flawlessly planned it, must also participate with true sincerity. This is what is meant by "one time, one meeting."&lt;ref name="varley"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage established the ''[[yojijukugo]]'' (four-letter idiomatic) form ''ichi-go ichi-e'' ({{lang|ja|一期一会}}) known today.

==Interpretation and usage==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
''Ichi-go ichi-e'' is linked with [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] and concepts of transience.  The term is particularly associated with the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], and is often [[Shodo|brushed]] onto scrolls which are hung in the tea room.

The term is also much repeated in [[budō]] (martial ways).  It is sometimes used to admonish students who become careless or frequently stop techniques midway to "try again," rather than moving on with the technique despite the mistake.  In a life-or-death struggle, there is no chance to "try again."  Even though techniques may be attempted many times in the [[dojo]], each should be seen as a singular and decisive event. Similarly, in [[noh]] theater, performances are only [[rehearsal|rehearsed]] together once, a few days before the show, rather than the many times that are typical in the West, this corresponding to the transience of a given show.

==In popular culture==
* Romanian conductor [[Sergiu Celibidache]]'s focus was on creating, during each concert, the optimal conditions for a what he called a "transcendent experience". Aspects of Zen Buddhism, such as ichi-go ichi-e, were strongly influential on him. 
* The 1994 movie ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' was released in Japan with this term in the subtitle as {{nihongo|''Forrest Gump/Ichi-go Ichi-e''|『フォレスト・ガンプ/一期一会』}}, reflecting the events that happen in the movie.&lt;ref name=abe/&gt;
* The term is [[Hiro Nakamura]]'s favorite phrase in the NBC series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''.&lt;ref name="hiro"/&gt; 
* The term is used in an episode of the [[anime]] [[Azumanga Daioh]]. 
* It is also a song title in the soundtrack of ''[[Kareshi Kanojo no Jijo]]''. 
* The term is used in the manga ''[[Boys Over Flowers]]'' and later several episodes of its [[Hana Yori Dango (TV series)|2005 adaptation]]. One of the series' main characters, Sojiro Nishikado, the son of a Grand Master, uses the term to pick up girls. He later realizes its true meaning when he misses the chance to be with his first love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamio|first=Yoko| title=[[Boys Over Flowers]], Volume 28|year=2008|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1533-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is also referenced in the title of the [[Kishi Bashi]] album 151a, which read in Japanese is pronounced "ichi-go-ichi ē."
* Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] used the term to describe meetings between [[India–Japan relations|India and Japan]] during his state visit to the country on 11 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Statement by Prime Minister during his visit to Japan (November 11, 2016)|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=153525|website=pib.nic.in|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Text of PM Narendra Modi's Statement During His Visit To Japan|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/full-text-of-pm-narendra-modis-statement-during-his-visit-to-japan-1624339|website=NDTV.com|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term is the title in ''[[Mozart in the Jungle]]'' season 4 episode 8 and the episode revolves around a tea ceremony with the kanji characters of Ichi-go Ichi-e displayed in the room.
* The term also mentioned in [[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]] season 8 episode 6, "Japan with Masa".
* [[Ichigo Ichie]] is a Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]].

'''''Ignotum per ignotius''''' ([[Latin]] for "the unknown by the more unknown") describes an explanation that is less familiar than the concept it would explain.

An example would be: "The oven felt hot because of [[Fourier's Law]]." It is unlikely that a person unfamiliar with the hotness of ovens would be enlightened by a reference to a fundamental law of physics. Of course, such a person might exist in theory, so ''ignotum per ignotius'' is not strictly a logical fallacy; it is just a criticism of an argument on rhetorical grounds, stating that such an argument is not useful in a particular context.

==''Ignotum per æque ignotum''==
'''''Ignotum per æque ignotum''''', meaning "the unknown by the equally unknown", is a related form of [[fallacy]] in which one attempts to prove something unknown by deducing it from something else that is also not known to be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]], ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', Day 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John chapter 18, verse 38''' of the [[Gospel of John]], is often referred to as "jesting [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]" or "''What is truth?''", of [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Quid est veritas?'' In it, [[Pontius Pilate]] questions [[Jesus]]' claim that he is "witness to the truth" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:37|John 18:37]]).&lt;ref name=W303 &gt;''The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete New Testament'' by Warren W. Wiersbe 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7814-4539-9}} page 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Augustine &gt;''Ask Augustine'' by Paul A. Tambrino 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-894-1}} pages 192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this statement, Pilate proclaims to the masses (lit., "the Jews" referring to the Jewish authorities&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.org/netbible/joh18_notes.htm#18109 NET Bible notes on John 18:38] '''Textual note:''' Or “the Jewish authorities”; Grk “the Jews.” Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders, especially members of the Sanhedrin. See the note on the phrase “Jewish leaders” in v. 12. The term also occurs in v. 31, where it is clear the Jewish leaders are in view, because they state that they cannot legally carry out an execution. Although it is likely (in view of the synoptic parallels) that the crowd here in 18:38 was made up not just of the Jewish leaders, but of ordinary residents of Jerusalem and pilgrims who were in Jerusalem for the Passover, nevertheless in John’s Gospel Pilate is primarily in dialogue with the leadership of the nation, who are expressly mentioned in 18:35 and 19:6.&lt;/ref&gt;) that he does not consider Jesus guilty of any crime.

==Analysis==
[[File:P52 verso.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]], an ancient papyrus inscribed with John 18:37-38]]
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Nikolai Ge]] "[[Jesus|Christ]] and [[Pontius Pilate|Pilatus]]" (What is truth?), 1890.]]

The exact intention of Pilate has been subject to debate among scholars, with no firm conclusion.&lt;ref name=W303 /&gt; His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have actually intended to reflect on the philosophical position that [[truth]] is hard to ascertain.&lt;ref name=W303 /&gt; The Greek word rendered as "truth" in English translations is "[[aletheia]]", which literally means "unconcealed" and connotes sincerity in addition to factuality and reality. 

This verse reflects the Christian tradition of the "guiltlessness of Jesus" in [[Pilate's Court]].&lt;ref name=Harrington488 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington 1998 {{ISBN|0-8146-5806-7}} pages 488-489 &lt;/ref&gt; The innocence of Jesus is important in the Gospel of John, given that it emphasizes Jesus as the [[Lamb of God]].

Note that Jesus, although he does not respond to Pilate's question (perhaps because Pilate "went out again" before giving him a chance to) knows the answer. During his prayer in [[Gethsemane]], Jesus tells [[God the Father|God]], "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." (John 17:17)

In addition to the guiltlessness of Jesus this verse also reflects the rejection of the truth of God: Jesus, the witness to truth was [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected]], ignored and condemned.&lt;ref name=Harrington488 /&gt;

==Literary references==
This verse has been widely quoted and alluded to in culture and literature, particularly in that of [[philosophy|philosophical]] nature. While Pilate's question -- whether intended philosophically, jestfully, rhetorically, or born of frustration at the lack of a plain answer -- is by no means the only incident of someone questioning the nature of truth, it has been drawn upon many times as a significant occurrence thereof. 

[[Francis Bacon]] uses this musing to open his essay ''Of Truth'', saying that Pilate "would not stay for an answer". He uses this to introduce his theme of truth as an affirmation of [[faith]].{{cn|date=November 2013}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote of the line and extended praise to Pilate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only ''one'' solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor.  To take a Jewish affair ''seriously'' - he cannot persuade himself to do that.  One Jew more or less - what does it matter ?... The noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on has  enriched the New Testament with the only expression ''which'' ''possesses'' ''value'' - which is its criticism, its ''annihilation'' even: 'What is truth?..." (Nietzsche, writing in ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', §46)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mikhail Bulgakov]] fictionally expands on the relationship between Pilate and Jesus in his novel ''[[Master and Margarita]]''. Specific reference to John 18:38 comes in Chapter 2 of the novel entitled "Pontius Pilate", in which he asks the very question "What is truth?" to Jesus ("Jeshua Ha-Notsri" - "Jesus of Nazareth" in Hebrew).

[[J. L. Austin]], the ordinary-language philosopher, in a symposium on truth, comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Pilate was in advance of his time. For 'truth' itself is an abstract noun, a camel, that is, of a logical construction, which cannot get past the eye even of a grammarian. We approach it cap and categories in hand : we ask ourselves whether Truth is a substance (the Truth, the Body of Knowledge), or a quality (something like the colour red, inhering in truths), or a relation ('correspondence'). But philosophers should take something more nearly their own size to strain at. What needs discussing rather is the use, or certain uses, of the word 'true.' In vino, possibly, 'veritas,' but in a sober symposium
'verum.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Austin|first1=John Langshaw|title=Truth|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|date=1950|volume=Supplementary Volume XXIV|url=http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/pdf/austin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his novella (and play) ''Home Truths'', David Lodge lets the writer Adrian Ludlow quote "What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer" when he is interviewed by the journalist Fanny Tarrant, known for her vicious and perhaps not entirely truthful interviews.

'''Jones Very''' (August 28, 1813 &amp;ndash; May 8, 1880) was an American poet, essayist, clergyman, and mystic associated with the American [[Transcendentalism]] movement. He was known as a scholar of [[William Shakespeare]] and many of his poems were Shakespearean [[sonnet]]s. He was well-known and respected amongst the Transcendentalists, though he had a mental breakdown early in his career.

Born in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] to two unwed [[cousin|first cousins]], Jones Very became associated with [[Harvard University]], first as an undergraduate, then as a student in the [[Harvard Divinity School]] and as a tutor of [[Greek language|Greek]]. He heavily studied [[epic poetry]] and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an [[psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]]. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called ''Essays and Poems'' in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.

==Biography==
Very was born on August 28, 1813,&lt;ref name=Gittleman5&gt;Gittleman, 5&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] and spent much of his childhood at sea.&lt;ref name=Kane174&gt;Kane, Paul. ''Poetry of the American Renaissance''. New York: George Braziller, 1995: 174. {{ISBN|0-8076-1398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the oldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins;&lt;ref name=McAleer282&gt;McAleer, 282&lt;/ref&gt; his sister [[Lydia Louisa Anna Very|Lydia]] also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her [[atheism|atheistic]] beliefs known to all.&lt;ref name=Packer70&gt;Packer, 70&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 302&lt;/ref&gt; His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the [[War of 1812]] and was held in [[Nova Scotia]] for a time by the British as a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 4&lt;/ref&gt; When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a [[cabin boy]] on a trip to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. His father died on the return trip,&lt;ref name=McAleer282/&gt; apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Very was studious, well-behaved, and solitary.&lt;ref name=Gittleman5/&gt; By 1827, he left school when his mother told him he must take the place of his father and care for the family. After working at an auction house,&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman12&lt;/ref&gt; Very became a paid assistant to the principal of a private school in Salem as a teenager. The principal, Henry Kemble Oliver, exposed his young assistant to philosophers and writers, including [[James Mackintosh]], to influence his religious beliefs and counteract his mother's atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; He composed a poem for the dedication of a new Unitarian church in Salem: "O God; On this, our temple, rest thy smile, Till bent with days its tower shall nod".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard years===
Very enrolled at [[Harvard College]] in 1834.&lt;ref name=Baker121&gt;Baker, 121&lt;/ref&gt; During his college years, he was shy, studious, and ambitious of literary fame. He had become interested in the works of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]].&lt;ref name=Packer70/&gt; His first few poems were published in his hometown newspaper, the ''[[Salem Observer]]'', while he completed his studies.&lt;ref name=Baker121/&gt; He graduated from Harvard in 1836, ranked number two in his class.&lt;ref name=McAleer281&gt;McAleer, 281&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen to speak at his commencement; his address was titled "Individuality".&lt;ref name=Baker121/&gt; After graduating, Very served as a tutor in Greek before entering [[Harvard Divinity School]],&lt;ref name=Kane174/&gt; thanks to the financial assistance of an uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''New England Literary Culture: From Revolution through Renaissance''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989: 388. {{ISBN|0-521-37801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Very never completed his divinity degree, he held temporary pastorates in Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=Kane174/&gt;

Very became known for his ability to draw people into literature, and was asked to speak at a lyceum in his hometown of Salem in 1837. There he was befriended by [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who wrote to Emerson suggesting Very lecture in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].&lt;ref name=Packer71&gt;Packer, 71&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] arranged a talk by Very at the Concord Lyceum.&lt;ref name=Kane174/&gt; Very lectured on [[epic poetry]] on April 4 of that year, after he had walked twenty miles from Salem to Concord to deliver it.&lt;ref name=Packer71/&gt;  Emerson made up for the meager $10 payment by inviting Very to his home for dinner.&lt;ref name=McAleer281/&gt; Emerson signed Very's personal copy of ''[[Nature (Emerson)|Nature]]'' with the words: "Har[mony] of Man with Nature Must Be Reconciled With God".&lt;ref name=Baker121/&gt;

For a time, Very tried to recruit [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] as a brother figure in his life. Though Hawthorne treated him kindly, he was not impressed by Very.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 140&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Hawthorne, Emerson found him "remarkable" and, when Very showed up at his home unannounced along with [[Cornelius Conway Felton]] in 1838, Emerson invited several other friends, including [[Henry David Thoreau]], to meet him. Emerson, however, was surprised at Very's behavior in larger groups. "When he is in the room with other persons, speech stops, as if there were a corpse in the apartment", he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;McAleer, 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, in May 1838, the same month Very published his "Epic Poetry" lecture in the ''Christian Examiner'', Emerson brought Very to a meeting of the [[Transcendental Club]], where the topic of discussion was "the question of mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 72&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, held at the home of [[Caleb Stetson]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]], Very was actively engaged in the discussion, building his reputation as a mystic within that circle.&lt;ref name=Richardson303&gt;Richardson, 303&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Very was known as an eccentric, prone to odd behavior and may have suffered from [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=Miller139&gt;Miller, 139&lt;/ref&gt; The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on [[William Shakespeare]]. As Very later explained, "I felt within me a new will... it was not a feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me".&lt;ref name=Baker122&gt;Baker, 122&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 338&lt;/ref&gt; As he told [[Henry Ware Jr.]], professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and that Christ was having his [[Second Coming]] within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father".&lt;ref name=Baker122/&gt; Very also claimed that he was under the influence of the Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, "cannot the spirit parse &amp; spell?"&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 288&lt;/ref&gt; Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his "sacrifice of Beauty".&lt;ref name=Packer70/&gt;

One of Very's students, a fellow native of Salem named Samuel Johnson Jr., said that people ridiculed Very behind his back since he had "gained the fame of being cracked (or crazy, if you are not acquainted with Harvard technicalities)".&lt;ref name=Baker122/&gt; During one of his tutoring sessions, Very declared that he was "infallible: that he was a man of heaven, and superior to all the world around him".&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 79&lt;/ref&gt; He then cried out to his students, "Flee to the mountains, for the end of all things is at hand".&lt;ref name=Richardson303/&gt; Harvard president [[Josiah Quincy III]] relieved Very of his duties, referring to a "nervous collapse" that required him to be left in the care of his younger brother Washington Very, himself a freshman at Harvard.&lt;ref name=Baker123&gt;Baker, 123&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Salem, he visited Elizabeth Peabody on September 16, 1838,&lt;ref name=Richardson304/&gt; apparently having given up his rule "not to speak or look at women".&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 276&lt;/ref&gt; As she recalled,

{{quote|text=He looked much flushed and his eyes very brilliant and unwinking. It struck me at once that there was something unnatural—and dangerous in his air—As soon as we were within the parlor door he laid his hand on my head—and said "I come to [[baptism|baptize]] you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire"—and then he prayed.&lt;ref name=Richardson304/&gt;}}

After this, Very told her she would soon feel different, explaining, "I am the Second Coming".&lt;ref name=Baker123/&gt; He performed similar "baptisms" to other people throughout Salem, including ministers. It was Reverend [[Charles Wentworth Upham]] who finally had him committed.&lt;ref name=Richardson304&gt;Richardson, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Somerville Mclean asylum map 1884.jpg|right|thumb|Map of the original location of McLean Insane Asylum from an 1884 atlas of Somerville, Massachusetts]]
Very was institutionalized for a month at a hospital near Boston,&lt;ref name=Miller139/&gt; the [[McLean Hospital|McLean Asylum]], as he wrote, "contrary to my will".&lt;ref name=Marshall344&gt;Marshall, 344&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he finished an essay on ''[[Hamlet]]'', arguing that the play is about "the great reality of a soul unsatisfied in its longings after immortality" and that "Hamlet has been called mad, but as we think, Shakespeare thought more of his madness than he did of the wisdom of the rest of the play".&lt;ref name=Richardson304/&gt; During his stay at the hospital, Very lectured his fellow patients on Shakespeare and on poetry in general.&lt;ref name=Beam37&gt;Beam, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released on October 17, 1838,&lt;ref name=Richardson304/&gt; though he refused to renounce his beliefs. His fellow patients reportedly thanked him as he left.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 80&lt;/ref&gt; McLean's superintendent Luther Bell took credit for saving him "from the delusion of being a prophet extraordinaire", which Luther thought was caused by Very's digestive system being "entirely out of order".&lt;ref name=Beam37/&gt; The same month he was released, Very stayed with Emerson at his home in Concord for a week. While he was visiting, Emerson wrote in his journal on October 29, "J. Very charmed us all by telling us he hated us all."&lt;ref name=McAleer281/&gt;

[[Amos Bronson Alcott]] wrote of Very in December 1838:
{{quote|text=I received a letter on Monday of this week from Jones Very of Salem, formerly Tutor in Greek at Harvard College — which institution he left, a few weeks since, being deemed insane by the Faculty.  A few weeks ago he visited me....He is a remarkable man.  His influence at Cambridge on the best young men was very fine. His talents are of a high order....Is he insane?  If so, there yet linger glimpses of wisdom in his memory.  He is insane with God — diswitted in the contemplation of the holiness of Divinity.  He distrusts intellect... Living, not thinking, he regards as the worship meet for the soul.  This is mysticism in its highest form.&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Amos Bronson (ed. Odell Shepard). ''The Journals of Bronson Alcott.'' Boston: Little, Brown, 1938: 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Poetry===
[[File:Very-Essays and Poems.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Essays and Poems'' (1839) by Jones Very]]
Emerson saw a kindred spirit in Very and defended his sanity. As he wrote to [[Margaret Fuller]], "Such a mind cannot be lost".&lt;ref name=Marshall344/&gt; Emerson was sympathetic with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the "[[Divinity School Address]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 345&lt;/ref&gt; He helped Very publish a small volume, ''Essays and Poems'' in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 194&lt;/ref&gt; The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the ''Western Messenger'' between 1838 and 1840&lt;ref name=Gittleman354&gt;Gittleman, 354&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[The Dial]]'', the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt a little sad at the aspect of the piece."&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 333&lt;/ref&gt; He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten by the end of the nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the [[Transcendentalists]], including Emerson, as well as [[William Cullen Bryant]], praised his work.&lt;ref name=Kane174/&gt;

Very continued writing throughout his life, though sparingly. Many of his later poems were never collected but only distributed in manuscript form among the Transcendentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 81&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1843, his work was included in the first issue of ''The Pioneer'', a journal edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] which also included the first publication of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe's]] "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years and death===
[[File:JonesVeryGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Jones Very in Peabody, Massachusetts]]
Jones Very believed his role as a prophet would last only twelve months. By September 1839, his role was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 360&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson suggested that Very's temporary mental instability was worth the message he had delivered. In his essay "[[s:Essays: First Series/Friendship|Friendship]]", Emerson referred to Very:
{{quote|text=I knew a man who under a certain religious frenzy cast off this drapery, and spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At first, all men agreed he was mad. But persisting, he attained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him... To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not?&lt;ref&gt;Beam, 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last decades of Very's life were spent in Salem as a recluse under the care of his sister.&lt;ref name=Kane174/&gt; It was during these years that he held roles as a visiting minister in [[Eastport, Maine]] and [[Beverly, Massachusetts|North Beverly, Massachusetts]], though these roles were temporary because he had become too shy. By age 45, he had retired.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 306&lt;/ref&gt; In his last forty years, Very did very little. As biographer Edwin Gittleman wrote, "Although he lived until 1880, Very's effective life was over by the end of 1840."&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 372&lt;/ref&gt; He died on May 8, 1880 and, upon hearing of Very's death, Alcott wrote a brief remembrance on May 16, 1880:
{{quote|text=The newspapers record the death of Jones Very of Salem, Mass. It was my fortune to have known the man while he was tutor in Harvard College and writing his Sonnets and Essays on Shakespeare, which were edited by Emerson, and published in 1839.  Very was then the dreamy mystic of our circle of Transcendentalists, and a subject of speculation by us.  He professed to be taught by the Spirit and to write under its inspiration.  When his papers were submitted to Emerson for criticism the spelling was found faulty and on Emerson's pointing out the defect, he was told that this was by dictation of the Spirit also.  Whether Emerson's witty reply, "that the Spirit should be a better speller," qualified the mystic's vision does not appear otherwise than that the printed volume shows no traces of illiteracy in the text.&lt;br&gt;
Very often came to see me.  His shadowy aspect at times gave him a ghostly air.  While walking by his side, I remember, he seemed spectral, — and somehow using my feet instead of his own, keeping as near me as he could, and jostling me frequently.  His voice had a certain hollowness, as if echoing mine.  His whole bearing made an impression as if himself were detached from his thought and his body were another's.  He ventured, withal, to warn me of falling into idolatries, while he brought a sonnet or two (since printed) for my benefit.&lt;br&gt;
His temperament was delicate and nervous, disposed to visionariness and a dreamy idealism, stimulated by over-studies and the school of thought then in the ascendant.  His sonnets and Shakespearean essays surpass any that have since appeared in subtlety and simplicity of execution.&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Amos Bronson (ed. Odell Shepard).  ''The Journals of Bronson Alcott.'' Boston: Little, Brown, 1938: 516–517&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Critical assessment==
The first critical review of Very's book was written by Margaret Fuller and published in [[Orestes Brownson]]'s ''Boston Quarterly Review''; it said Very's poems had "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 356–357&lt;/ref&gt; She mocked the "sing song" style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known."&lt;ref&gt;Capper, Charles. ''Margaret Fuller:  An American Romantic Life: The Private Years''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992: 319. {{ISBN|0-19-509267-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Freeman Clarke]] admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the ''Western Messenger'', between 1838 and 1840.&lt;ref name=Gittleman354/&gt; [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|William Ellery Channing]] admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity "is only superficial".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 305&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Henry Dana Sr.]] also commented positively on Very's poetry: "The thought is deeply spiritual; and while there is a certain character of ''peculiarity'' which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets."&lt;ref name=Gittleman354/&gt;

Editor and critic [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] was impressed enough by Very's poetry to include him in the first edition of his anthology ''[[The Poets and Poetry of America]]'' in 1842. He wrote to Emerson asking for more information about him and expressing his opinion of his poetry: "Though comparatively unknown, he seems to be a true poet."&lt;ref&gt;Griswold, Rufus W. to Ralph Waldo Emerson. September 18, 1841. Letter in the manuscript collection at Houghton Library, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern reassessment of Jones Very as an author of literary importance can be dated to a 1936 essay by [[Yvor Winters]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Deese, Helen R., Editor. ''Jones Very: The Complete Poems.'' Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1993: xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote of the poet, “In the past two decades two major American writers have been rediscovered and established securely in their rightful places in literary history. I refer to [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Herman Melville]]. I am proposing the establishment of a third.”&lt;ref&gt;Winters,Yvor. “Jones Very: A New England Mystic.” ''American Review'' (May 1936): 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Winters, in speaking of Very’s relations with Emerson and his circle, concluded, “The attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very is instructive and amusing, and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them. In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will, he agreed with them in principle; but whereas they recommended the surrender, he practised it, and they regarded him with amazement.”&lt;ref&gt;Winters,Yvor. “Jones Very: A New England Mystic.” ''American Review'' (May 1936): 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, William Irving Bartlett, in 1942, outlined the basic biographical facts of Very’s life in ''Jones Very, Emerson’s “Brave Saint.”''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  A complete scholarly edition of Very’s poetic works belatedly appeared, over a century after the poet’s death, in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Deese, Helen R., Editor. ''Jones Very: The Complete Poems.'' Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judea Pearl''' (born September 4, 1936) is an Israeli-American [[computer scientist]] and [[philosopher]], best known for championing the probabilistic approach to [[artificial intelligence]] and the development of [[Bayesian networks]] (see the article on [[belief propagation]]). He is also credited for developing a theory of causal and counterfactual inference based on structural models (see article on [[causality]]). He is the 2011 winner of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Turing Award]], the highest distinction in computer science, "for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning".&lt;ref name="acm-turing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acm_2011_Turing_award_ Judea_Pearl_press_release"&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
Judea Pearl was born in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]], in 1936 to Polish-immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.640044&lt;/ref&gt; He is a descendant of [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]] on his mother's side. After serving in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and joining a kibbutz, Pearl decided to study engineering in 1956. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the [[Technion]] 1960. That same year, he emigrated to the United States and pursued graduate studies. He received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Newark College of Engineering (now the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]]) in 1961, and went on to receive an M.S. in Physics from [[Rutgers University]] and a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]]) in 1965.&lt;ref name=amturing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/pearl_2658896.cfm |title= JUDEA PEARL United States 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at [[RCA#Diversification|RCA]] Research Laboratories on superconductive [[parametric amplifiers]] and storage devices and at Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems.&lt;ref name=amturing/&gt; When [[semiconductor]]s "wiped out" Pearl's work, as he later expressed it,&lt;ref name="cacm"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Q&amp;A: A Sure Thing |author=Leah Hoffmann |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=55 |number=6 |pages=135–136 |doi=10.1145/2184319.2184347 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined [[UCLA]]'s [[Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering]] in 1970 and started work on probabilistic [[artificial intelligence]]. He is one of the founding editors of the ''Journal of Causal Inference''.

Pearl is currently a professor of computer science and statistics and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA. He and his wife, Ruth, had three children. In addition, {{As of|2011|lc=y}}, he is a member of the International Advisory Board of [[NGO Monitor]].&lt;ref name = "NGO"&gt;{{cite web

Emeritus Chief Rabbi, The Right Honourable Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]] quoted Judea Pearl's beliefs in a lesson on Judaism. "I asked Judea Pearl, father of the murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, why he was working for reconciliation between Jews and Muslims, he replied with heartbreaking lucidity, "Hate killed my son. Therefore I am determined to fight hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Emeritus Chief Rabbi, The Right Honourable Lord Sacks|title=Judaism: Covenant &amp; Conversation: Against Hate|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/15622|work=[[Israel National News]]|date=September 5, 2014|quote=I asked Judea Pearl, father of the murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, why he was working for reconciliation between Jews and Muslims, he replied with heartbreaking lucidity, "Hate killed my son.

==Research==
Judea Pearl was one of the pioneers of [[Bayesian networks]] and the [[probability|probabilistic]] approach to [[artificial intelligence]], and one of the first to mathematize causal modeling in the empirical sciences. His work is also intended as a high-level [[cognitive model]]. He is interested in the [[philosophy of science]], [[knowledge representation]], nonstandard logics, and learning. Pearl is described as "one of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence" by UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf.&lt;ref name ="Korf"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Mahirwan Mamtani''' (born 2 November 1935 in [[Bhiria]] (Nawabshah) [[Sindh]], India) is painter, graphic and multimedia artist.

[[Image:Mahirwan Mamtani.JPG|thumb|150px|Mahirwan Mamtani]]

Mamtani grew up in India, studied there and moved 1966 to Germany, where he had been awarded a scholarship by [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] (German Academic Exchange Service) to study painting at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|Kunstakademie]]. Since that time he lives and works in and around [[Munich]].

==Early years==
Already at the age of six in Sindh, Mahirwan Mamtani began to paint, mainly with charcoal and chalks on walls.  At the age of 12, due to the [[partition of India]], in 1947 the family moved to [[Delhi]]. Because of miserable living conditions as a refugee, lying on sick bed he taught himself without proper schooling.  He used to doodle with pencil or pastels on paper.  However circumstances forced Mamtani to earn money doing several jobs and his urge to paint was suppressed due to lack of time and money.  After some years of such conditions, loneliness and hard work at self-education, Mamtani besides his jobs started studying for Bachelor of Arts and then joined evening classes at the Fine Arts Department of [[Delhi College of Engineering|Delhi Polytechnic]] to study painting.  He obtained the National Diploma in 1962.  In 1966 he was awarded a scholarship by [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) to study painting at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich]] under Prof. [[:de:Franz Nagel|Franz Nagel]].  Since then he is living with his family in and around the Munich and Bavaria area.

==Career==
[[Image:Centrovision 168.jpg|thumb|300px|Centrovision 168]]

Already at the beginning of his studies, Mamtani was aware of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], one of the groundbreakers of [[modernism]], who had been searching for spiritual dimensions in art.  For Mamtani it can go as far back as [[William Blake]] in the 18th century or extend to a German contemporary like [[Joseph Beuys]], who was influenced by the [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophic]] teachings of [[Rudolf Steiner]].

In Munich, in the 1960s, he was influenced by [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], and with his Indian background, by [[Tantra]] art.  Out of these origins arose his "Centrovision" series, which – already in 1990 – consisted of more than 3000 works.

===Quote===
[[Image:Centrovision 1204.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Centrovision 1204]]
{{quote|text=The inspiration for Mahirwan Mamtani's conception of "Centrovision" is derived from the manifestation of tantric doctrines. Emanating from the centre toward the outside, his forms are akin to the [[mandala]] concept, the visual manifestation of which are based on the [[axiom]] of [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm versus macrocosm]]. The feeling of procreation is evoked by the rhythmical arrangement of symmetrical, curvilinear organic forms, the roots of which could be traced in the form of the female, the symbol of [[Shakti]], the supreme cosmic energy. Instead of having a flux of light, the paintings are permeated with the whispering tonal values achieved through the integration of colour hues with soft light which becomes the essential ingredient for the modulation of pulsating circular forms.|sign=Dr. L.P. Sihare|source=Neo-Tantra Exhibition Catalogue|lang=en}}

Some of his earlier multimedia projects were graphic animation films: CENTROVISION (1981) and FACES (1982). 
Starting in 1990 he built upon an idea from earlier (1985) works, where he had begun to let faces appear in some of his artwork. He performed dances wearing several mandala masks, which he had painted on wood, and recorded these dances in the form of photos and videos with the help of a self-timer.&lt;ref name = "Video Samples"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/Mamtani#p/a/u/0/b9MV8tnGNgk Video Sample ''Dancing Birds'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;
He then painted over the surface of the resulting photo sheets with acrylic colours, creating a series of new mixed-media works of art which he called "Transmuted Fotos". During that time he also experimented with other mixed media.

From the year 2000 onwards, Mamtani created "Mandala Conscious Beings" where he focused on figurative paintings using mandala masks as central elements. This was driven by his urge to deal with human emotions (masks). His remarks were "We all are constantly wearing masks. We are changing the masks, but not removing them."

Around 2003, he also started working on earlier dance videos, recomposing them into new clips (some of them available on YouTube).&lt;ref name = "Mamtani Videos"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/Mamtani Videos at YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kinkakuji 2004-09-21.jpg|thumb|260px|Art of ''Miyabi'' on the [[Muromachi period]]. ([[Kinkaku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]])]]
'''''Miyabi''''' (雅) is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though not as prevalent as [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]] or [[Wabi-sabi]]. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as "elegance," "refinement," or "courtliness" and sometimes to a "sweet loved one".

The ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the "polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace." It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the [[Heian period|Heian]] era. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of [[Mono no aware]], a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi. An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree. The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware, but also miyabi in the process.

Adherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period, such as those contained in the [[Man'yōshū]], the oldest extant collection of [[Japanese poetry]]. The [[Man'yōshū]] contained poems by people of every walk of life, many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi. For example, one poem in the collection likened a woman's hair to snail innards. The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this.  Furthermore, appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences. It was believed that only members of the upper class, the courtiers, could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi.

Miyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created. Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude, and in doing so, prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works. In later years, miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], such as [[Wabi-sabi]], [[Yugen|Yuugen]] and [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]].

The characters of the classic eleventh-century Japanese novel "[[The Tale of Genji]]" by [[Lady Murasaki]] provide  examples of  miyabi.&lt;ref&gt;''Japanese Aesthetics and Culture'' Nancy G. Hume, {{ISBN|978-0791424001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born Morris Laizerowitz in [[Lodz, Poland]], his father, Max and eldest sister emigrated to the United States in 1912 and through their hard work, saved enough money to bring the rest of the family to join them three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitely|first=Murray|title=Morris Lazerowitz 1907-1987|journal=Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association|year=1987|volume=61|issue=1|pages=169–171|jstor=3130273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family settled in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Morris studied the violin and becoming proficient enough to be substituting in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra by the age of nineteen. However he was forced by a back injury to give this up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ambrose|first=Alice|title=Lazerowitz, Morris|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01673.html|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Lazerowitz enrolled at [[Nebraska University]] and was taught philosophy by [[O.K. Bouwsma]]. Lazerowitz completed his degree at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1933. A traveling fellowship, 1936-1937, enabled him to do postdoctorate work at Cambridge University and at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitely|first=Murray|title=Morris Lazerowitz 1907-1987|journal=Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association|year=1987|volume=61|issue=1|pages=169–171|jstor=3130273}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Cambridge he was taught by [[G.E. Moore]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

==Career==
From 1938 Lazerowitz taught at [[Smith College]], marrying fellow philosopher [[Alice Ambrose]] that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smithpedia|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/faculty-staff/lazerowitz-alice-ambrose/|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a year where he was Fulbright Professor at Bedford College, London, he went on to teach at Smith for 35 years.
After he retired from teaching in 1973, Lazerowitz was named [[professor emeritus]] of philosophy at Smith College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazerowitz, Morris|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11986.html|website=Encyclopaedia Judaica|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He still continued to teach as visiting professor at Carleton College, Hampshire College and the [[University of Delaware]].

==Publications==
Lazerowitz co-wrote a number of books with Ambrose including a primer on logic which became a widely used textbook in the 1950s and was known as "Ambrose and Lazerowitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ambrose, A. &amp; M. Lazerowitz |title=Fundamentals of Symbolic Logic |year=1948 |publisher=Rinehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with his wife on a number of works: ''Fundamentals of Symbolic Logic'' (1948), ''Logic: The Theory of Formal Inference'' (1961), ''Philosophical Theories'' (1976) and ''Essays in the Unknown Wittgenstein'' (1984). 
His chief contribution to philosophy was his development of the study of metaphilosophy. Morris claims to have created the term ‘metaphilosophy’ around 1940 and used it in print in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lazerowitz, M. |year=1970 |title=A note on "metaphilosophy" |journal=Metaphilosophy  |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=91 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1970.tb00792.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined 'metaphilosophy' as an investigation of the nature of philosophical theories and their supporting arguments, with the aim of explaining their centuries-long irresolvability. (See Metaphilosophy [1990]: 91 and The Language of Philosophy, chap. 1.)  His most important books are ''The Structure of Metaphysics'' (1955) and ''Studies in Metaphilosophy'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazerowitz, Morris|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11986.html|website= Encyclopaedia Judaica|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''Philosophy and Illusion'' (1968), ''The Language of Philosophy: Freud and Wittgenstein'' (1977), and ''Cassandra in Philosophy'' (1983).

==Initiation==
Usually the secret name is not given to the [[Wiktionary:neophyte|neophyte]] directly, but only after the completion of '''[[initiation]]'''. The connection between the initiation and the presentation of a secret name is considered a rite of passage by most esoteric orders.  It is understood that this process represents the mystery of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] (or [[childbirth|birth]] - [[death]] - [[reincarnation|rebirth]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6811">The '''North American Invasive Species Network''' ('''NAISN''') is an American non-profit organization formed in 2010 by a group of government scientists and universities in North America. The network integrates various invasive species institutes, centers, laboratories and networks from the US, Canada and Mexico to help meet the needs of public conservation land and waterway resource managers.&lt;ref name=volone&gt;

Membership is targeted toward regional centers and institutes, research labs, and/or other groups and individuals with invasive species interests and qualification. Because invasive species are not restricted by jurisdictional boundary lines, it was formed as a single international network. Currently there are eight invasive species organizations in collaboration with NAISN.&lt;ref name="naisn" /&gt;

== Overview ==

In 1997, a letter  o-written by Don C. Schmitz, Dr. James T. Carlton, Dr. [[Daniel Simberloff]], and Dr. Phyllis N. Windle, and signed by more than 500 scientists, resource and agriculture officials, urged the [[U.S. government]] to form a commission to recommend new strategies to prevent and manage [[invasive species]].  One of the its recommendations was to form a center analogous to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to help coordinate the multi-jurisdictional aspects of invasive species management in the U.S. The letter resulted in   Executive Order 13112&lt;ref name="invasivespeciesinfo_a"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. (2012). [https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/laws/execorder.shtml Executive Order 13112]. Retrieved 26 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; on February 3, 1999, calling for the establishment of a national plan and creating the National Invasive Species Council.
 
As a result of a November 2010 workshop, led by Don C. Schmitz and Dan Simberloff, seven invasive species centers or institutes and one federally funded Canadian research network agreed to become part of the North American Invasive Species Network (NAISN). Since then, NAISN has added another Canadian member&lt;ref name="naisn"&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, eight invasive species centers and institutes, and one regional network,  are part of the North American Invasive Species Network (NAISN) either as a hub (1) or a node (2).&lt;ref name="naisn"/&gt;

In 2011, NAISN was established as a non-profit organization in the United States (501(C)3) to unify  and connect these existing invasive species efforts into a single network,  .  Participating member organizations, groups, or individuals can participate as Hubs1, Nodes2, or Affiliates3.&lt;ref name="naisn" /&gt;

In April 2012, the third NAISN workshop was held to develop a five-year business strategic plan It is envisioned that, as NAISN grows and expands, the Network will work to enhance information exchange among scientists, government agencies, and private landowners through the use of a comprehensive website modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, and the aggregation of information from over 250 current databases that contain information of invasive species .  NAISN will also begin to track invasive species expenditures through annual surveys of federal, provincial, state, municipal and tribal governments and oversee a comprehensive analysis of economic impacts of invasive species; such information could readily be used by policy-makers and elected officials.   Finally, NAISN will provide a single source for the news media and develop and implement national public awareness campaigns about invasive species.&lt;ref name="naisn" /&gt;

'''Paired opposites''' are an ancient, pre-Socratic method of establishing [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis and synthesis]] in terms of a standard for what is right and proper in [[natural philosophy]].

== Paired opposites in the proportions of units ==

[[Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar]] ranges and [[coordinate system]]s are paired opposites within [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Incorporating [[dimensions]] of positive and negative numbers and [[exponent]]s, or expanding x, y and z coordinates, by adding a fourth dimension of time allows a resolution of position relative to the standard of the [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] which is often taken as 0,0,0,0 with additional dimensions added as referential scales are expanded from space and time to mass and energy.

Ancient systems frequently scaled their degree of opposition by rate of increase or rate of decrease. [[Linear]] increase was enhanced by doubling systems. An [[acceleration]] in the rate of increase or decrease could be analyzed arithmetrically, geometrically, or through a wide range of other numerical and physical analysis. [[Arithmetic series|Arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]], and other methods of rating proportionate expansion or contraction could be thought of as [[wikt:convergent|convergent]] or [[divergence (statistics)|divergent]] toward a position.

Though unit quantities were first defined by [[spatial dimensions]], and then expanded by adding coordinates of time, the weight or mass a given spatial dimension could contain was also considered and even in antiquity, conditions under which the standard would be established such as at a given temperature, distance from sea level, or density were added.

Rates of change over time were then considered as either indexes of production or depletion

== Paired opposites as rhetorical device==

Paired opposites are used as poetic diction meaning "everything".  Common phrases incorporated paired opposites in English include "all creatures great and small," "working for the man every night and day," "more things in heaven and Earth" "searching high and low" "in sickness and in health".   In Greek literature, [[Homer]] uses the device when he lets [[Telemachus]] say, "I know all things, the good and the evil" (Od.20:309-10).&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Cyrus H.|last2=Rendsburg |first2=Gary A. |title=The Bible and the ancient Near East |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-31689-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWmBUBre55QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Bible+and+the+Ancient+Near+East+gordon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UnLGWjWlY_&amp;sig=I0IV9A6pkpZjRWXR5rTCqfetph8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=as4xUNLHAsjNiwKCp4CYBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20merism&amp;f=false |edition=4th |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same phrase is used in Hebrew in text of Genesis, referring to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s notes to the NJPS Torah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space and Time in the Religious Life of the Near East |last=Wyatt |first=Nicolas |page=244 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-567-04942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugate Variables==

In [[quantum mechanics]], as well as some fields of mathematics, [[conjugate variables]] are a form of paired opposites, in which knowledge of one precludes knowledge of the other.  A standard example is the relation between position (x) and momentum (p), which can be expressed in terms of the [[uncertainty principle]] as &lt;math&gt; \Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar&lt;/math&gt;.

(1970). ''Psychology as a Human Science.'' New York : Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Early phenomenologists such as Husserl, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] conducted philosophical investigations of consciousness in the early 20th century. Their critiques of [[psychologism]] and [[positivism]] later influenced at least two main fields of contemporary psychology: the phenomenological psychological approach of the [[Duquesne School]] (The [[Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology]]), including [[Amedeo Giorgi]]&lt;ref name="Giorgi1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giorgi2"&gt;[[Amedeo Giorgi|Giorgi, Amedeo]]. (2009). ''The Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology.'' Duquesne University Press: Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Wertz]]; and the experimental approaches associated with [[Francisco Varela]], [[Shaun Gallagher]], [[Evan Thompson]], and others ([[Embodied cognition|embodied mind thesis]]). Other names associated with the movement include [[Jonathan Smith (psychologist)|Jonathan Smith]] ([[interpretative phenomenological analysis]]), [[Steinar Kvale]], and [[Wolfgang Köhler]]. But "an even stronger influence on psychopathology came from Heidegger (1963), particularly through [[Alice Holzhey-Kunz|Kunz]] (1931), Blankenburg (1971), Tellenbach (1983), [[Ludwig Binswanger|Binswanger]] (1994), and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Albert|title=Existential a prioris and the phenomenology of schizophrenia|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–7|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A10-01.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303044508/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A10-01.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenological psychologists have also figured prominently in the history of the [[humanistic psychology]] movement.

The experiencing subject can be considered to be the [[person]] or [[self (psychology)|self]], for purposes of convenience. In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[philosophy]] (and in particular in the work of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Heidegger]], and [[Merleau-Ponty]]), "experience" is a considerably more complex concept than it is usually taken to be in everyday use. Instead, experience (or being, or existence itself) is an "in-relation-to" phenomenon, and it is defined by qualities of directedness, embodiment, and worldliness, which are evoked by the term "Being-in-the-World".&lt;ref name="Langdridge, D. 2006"&gt;Langdridge, D. (2006). Phenomenological psychology: theory, research and method. Harlow: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality or nature of a given experience is often referred to by the term [[qualia]], whose archetypical exemplar is "redness". For example, we might ask, "Is my experience of redness the same as yours?" While it is difficult to answer such a question in any concrete way, the concept of [[intersubjectivity]] is often used as a mechanism for understanding how it is that humans are able to empathise with one another's experiences, and indeed to engage in meaningful communication about them. The phenomenological formulation of [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-in-the-world|Being-in-the-World]], where person and world are mutually constitutive, is central here.

==Difficulties in considering subjective phenomena==
The philosophical psychology prevalent before the end of the 19th century relied heavily on [[introspection]]. The speculations concerning the mind based on those observations were criticized by the pioneering advocates of a more scientific approach to psychology, such as [[William James]] and the behaviorists [[Edward Thorndike]], [[Clark Hull]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]]. However, not everyone agrees that introspection is intrinsically problematic, such as [[Francisco Varela]], who has trained experimental participants in the structured "introspection" of [[phenomenological reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F.J. (1996). Neurophenomenology: a methodological remedy to the hard problem. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 3330-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Amedeo Giorgi applied phenomenological theory to his development of the Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology in order to overcome certain problems he perceived, from his work in psychophysics, with approaching subjective phenomena from the traditional hypothetical-deductive framework of the natural sciences. Giorgi hoped to use what he had learned from his natural science background to develop a rigorous qualitative research method. Giorgi has thus described his overall project as such: "[Phenomenological psychology] is nothing like natural sciences... because its [sic] [dealing with] human experiences and human phenomena. [However] I want to be sure that our criteria is this: that every natural scientist will have to respect our method. I'm not just trying to satisfy clinicians, or therapists, or humanists, I'm trying to satisfy the most severe criterion—natural scientists... because I anticipate that some day, when qualitative research develops and gets strong, the natural science people are going to criticize it. And I want to be able to stand up and say, 'Go ahead, criticize it—but you won't find any flaws here'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=485|title=Amedeo Giorgi: A Life in Phenomenology - PhenomenologyBlog|author=|date=|website=phenomenologyblog.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023180038/http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=485|archivedate=23 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers have long confronted the problem of "[[qualia]]". Few philosophers believe that it is possible to be sure that one person's [[experience]] of the "redness" of an object is the same as another person's, even if both persons had effectively identical genetic and experiential histories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In principle, the same difficulty arises in [[feeling]]s (the subjective experience of emotion), in the experience of effort, and especially in the "meaning" of concepts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} As a result, many qualitative psychologists have claimed phenomenological inquiry to be essentially a matter of "[[meaning-making]]" and thus a question to be addressed by interpretive approaches.&lt;ref name="Langdridge, D. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1989). "Köhler's Dilemma", In ''Issues of Language Assessment''. vol 3. Ed., Stanley S.Seidner. Springfield, Il.: State Board of Education. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychotherapy and the phenomenology of emotion==
[[Carl Rogers]]' [[person-centered psychotherapy]] theory is based directly on the "[[phenomenal field theory|phenomenal field]]" personality theory of Combs and Snygg.&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, Donald and Combs, Arthur W. (1949), ''Individual Behavior: A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R. (1951) ''Client-Centered Therapy''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; That theory in turn was grounded in phenomenological thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html "Personality Theories"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807230307/http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg%26combs.html |date=2007-08-07 }}, Boeree, C. George, Donald Snygg and Arthur Combs in ''Personality Theory'' retrieved Oct. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers attempts to put a therapist in closer contact with a person by listening to the person's report of their recent subjective experiences, especially emotions of which the person is not fully aware. For example, in relationships the problem at hand is often not based around what actually happened but, instead, based around the perceptions and feelings of each individual in the relationship. The phenomenal field focuses on "how one feels right now".

'''''Prima facie''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|_|ˈ|f|eɪ|ʃ|i|i|,_|-|ʃ|ə|,_|-|ʃ|iː}}; {{ety|la|prīmā faciē}}) is a [[List of Latin phrases|Latin expression]] meaning ''on its first encounter'' or ''at first sight''. The literal translation would be "at first face" or "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of ''primus'' ("first") and ''facies'' ("face"), both in the [[ablative (Latin)|ablative case]]. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be "on the face of it". The term ''prima facie'' is used in modern [[legal English]] (including both [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating [[evidence]] appears to exist to support a case. In [[common law]] jurisdictions, ''prima facie'' denotes evidence that, unless [[rebuttal|rebutted]], would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic [[philosophy]]. Most legal proceedings, in most [[jurisdiction]]s, require a ''prima facie'' case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.

==Burden of proof==
{{main|Legal burden of proof}}
In most legal proceedings, one [[Party (law)|party]] has a [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], which requires it to present ''prima facie'' evidence for all of the essential facts in its case. If it cannot, its claim may be dismissed without any need for a response by other parties. A ''prima facie'' case might not stand or fall on its own; if an opposing party introduces other evidence or asserts an [[affirmative defense]] it can only be reconciled with a full [[trial]]. Sometimes the introduction of ''prima facie'' evidence is informally called ''making a case'' or ''building a case''.

For example, in a trial under [[criminal law]] the [[prosecution]] has the burden of presenting ''prima facie'' evidence of each element of the crime charged against the [[defendant]]. In a [[murder]] case, this would include evidence that the victim was in fact dead, that the defendant's act caused the death, and evidence that the defendant acted with [[malice aforethought]].  If no party introduces new evidence, the case stands or falls just by the ''prima facie'' evidence or lack thereof.

''Prima facie'' evidence does not need to be conclusive or irrefutable: at this stage, evidence rebutting the case is not considered, only whether any party's case has enough merit to take it to a full trial.

In [[common law]] jurisdictions such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], the prosecution in a criminal trial must disclose all evidence to the defense. This includes the ''prima facie'' evidence.

An aim of the doctrine of ''prima facie'' is to prevent litigants from bringing spurious charges which simply waste all other parties' time.

==''Res ipsa loquitur''==
''Prima facie'' is often confused with ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'' ("the thing speaks for itself", or literally "the thing itself speaks"), the common law doctrine that when the facts make it self-evident that negligence or other responsibility lies with a party, it is not necessary to provide extraneous details, since any reasonable person would immediately find the facts of the case.

The difference between the two is that ''prima facie'' is a term meaning there is enough evidence for there to be a case to answer, while ''Res ipsa loquitur'' means that the facts are so obvious a party does not need to explain any more. For example: "There is a ''prima facie'' case that the defendant is liable. They controlled the pump. The pump was left on and flooded the [[plaintiff]]'s house. The plaintiff was away and had left the house in the control of the defendant. ''Res ipsa loquitur''."

This doctrine has been subsumed by general negligence law in Canadian tort law.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Use in academic philosophy==
The phrase is also used in academic [[philosophy]]. Among its most notable uses is in the theory of [[ethics]] first proposed by [[W. D. Ross]], often called the ''Ethic of Prima Facie Duties'', as well as in [[epistemology]], as used, for example, by [[Robert Audi]]. It is generally used in reference to an obligation. "I have a ''prima facie'' obligation to keep my promise and meet my friend" means that I am under an obligation, but this may yield to a more pressing duty. A more modern usage prefers the title ''pro tanto obligation'': an obligation that may be later overruled by another more pressing one; it exists only ''[[pro tempore]]''.

==Other uses and references==

[[File:Example photo 1 of a prima facie speed limit - Rapid River, Michigan (United States).jpg|thumb|Example of a ''prima facie'' speed limit posted in [[Rapid River, Michigan]] (United States)]]
The phrase ''prima facie'' is sometimes misspelled ''{{sic|hide=y|prima facia}}'' in the mistaken belief that ''{{sic|hide=y|facia}}'' is the actual Latin word; however, ''faciē'' is in fact the [[ablative (Latin)|ablative case]] of ''faciēs'', a [[Latin declension#Fifth declension (e stems)|fifth declension]] Latin noun.

In [[policy debate]] theory, ''prima facie'' is used to describe the mandates or planks of an affirmative case, or, in some rare cases, a negative [[counterplan]]. When the negative team appeals to ''prima facie'', it appeals to the fact that the affirmative team cannot add or amend anything in its plan after being stated in the first affirmative constructive.

A common usage of the phrase is the concept of a "''prima facie'' speed limit", which has been used in [[Australia]] and the [[United States]]. A ''prima facie'' speed limit is a default speed limit that applies when no other specific speed limit is posted, and may be exceeded by a driver. However, if the driver is detected, and cited by police for exceeding the limit, the onus of proof is on the driver, to show that the speed at which the driver was travelling was safe under the circumstances. In most jurisdictions, this type of speed limit has been replaced by absolute speed limits.

'''John Richard Jefferies''' (6 November 1848 – 14 August 1887) was an English nature writer, noted for his depiction of English rural life in essays, books of natural history, and novels. His childhood on a small [[Wiltshire]] farm had a great influence on him and provides the background to all his major works of fiction.

Jefferies's corpus of writings includes a diversity of genres and topics, including ''Bevis'' (1882), a classic children's book, and ''After London'' (1885), an early work of science fiction. For much of his adult life, he suffered from [[tuberculosis]], and his struggles with the illness and with poverty also play a role in his writing. Jefferies valued and cultivated an intensity of feeling in his experience of the world around him, a cultivation that he describes in detail in ''[[The Story of My Heart]]'' (1883). This work, an introspective depiction of his thoughts and feelings on the world, gained him the reputation of a nature mystic at the time. But it is his success in conveying his awareness of nature and people within it, both in his fiction and in essay collections such as ''The Amateur Poacher'' (1879) and ''Round About a Great Estate'' (1880), that has drawn most admirers. [[Walter Besant]] wrote of his reaction on first reading Jefferies: "Why, we must have been blind all our lives; here were the most wonderful things possible going on under our very noses, but we saw them not."&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and works==
[[File:Coatefarm.jpg|thumb|Coate farm in 1896. The roof was originally thatched.&lt;ref&gt;Looker and Porteous (1965), 4, cite a letter by James Jefferies: "My old house was originally thatch. ... I have not seen it since Blue Slates as {{sic}} been put on."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Early life===
John Richard Jefferies (he used the first name only during his childhood)&lt;ref name="Thomas 1909, 29"&gt;Thomas (1909), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; was born at [[Coate Water Country Park|Coate]], in the parish of [[Chiseldon]], near [[Swindon]], Wiltshire, the son of a farmer, James Luckett Jefferies (1816–1896).&lt;ref name="Rossabi 2004"&gt;Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; His birthplace and home is now a museum open to the public. James Jefferies had the farm from his father, John Jefferies, who had been a London printer before returning to Swindon to run the family mill and bakery. Richard's mother, Elizabeth Gyde (1817–1895), always called Betsy, was the daughter of John Jefferies's binder and manager.&lt;ref name="Rossabi 2004"/&gt;

These relationships are mirrored in the characters of Jefferies's late novel ''Amaryllis at the Fair'' (1887); and the portraits of the family in the novel tally with external accounts of the Jefferies.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 5; 14–16; Thomas (1909), 24–5; 28–29; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  James Jefferies, like Iden in ''Amaryllis'', was devoted to his garden, while struggling to make a financial success of the farm. The garden, lovingly recalled in ''Wood Magic''  and ''Amaryllis'', also makes a strong impression on the memories of those who knew the Jefferies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 4; Thomas (1909), 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Betsy, like Iden's wife, seems to have been dissatisfied with life on the farm:&lt;ref name="Thomas 1909, 29"/&gt; "a town-bred woman with a beautiful face and a pleasure-loving soul, kind and generous to a fault, but unsuited to a country life." The farm was very small, with {{convert|39|acre|m2}} of pasture; and a mortgage of £1500 would later begin a slide into debt for James Jefferies, who lost the farm in 1877 and became a jobbing gardener.&lt;ref&gt;Rossabi (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  But these difficulties were less evident in Richard's childhood. The situation was much as in ''After London'' (1885), where the farming and gardening Baron is again based on James Jefferies:&lt;ref&gt;''After London'', Chapter 4, cited in Thomas (1909), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; "The whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it seemed to be flowing with milk and honey". One part of the Jefferies family is strikingly missing from the books. In ''Wood Magic'', ''Bevis'' and ''Amaryllis'', the hero (or heroine) has no siblings; only ''After London'' gives the main character brothers and depicts the imperfect sympathy between them. James and Elizabeth's first child, Ellen, had died young; but Richard had two younger brothers and a younger sister.&lt;ref name="Thomas 1909, 29"/&gt;

Jefferies spent several of his earlier years, between the ages of four and nine, with his aunt and uncle, the Harrilds, in [[Sydenham]], where he attended a private school, returning to Coate in the holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 27–8; Thomas (1909), 39; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  His uncle, Thomas Harrild, was a son of the printing innovator [[Robert Harrild]]. Jefferies kept a close friendship with Mrs. Ellen Harrild (nee Gyde) and his letters to her are an important source for biographers. At Coate, he spent most of his time in the countryside; and much of what he narrates of Bevis is true of himself. His father had taken him shooting when he was eight; and already at nine he had shot a rabbit. He was soon spending much of his time hunting (both with a gun and with snares) and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 39; 41–2; Looker and Porteous (1965), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also, like Bevis, added home-made rigging to a boat to sail on the reservoir; and he is said to have built his own canoe, like the hero of ''After London''.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 29–30; Thomas (1909), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, he became a keen reader: favourite books included Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry|Percy's ''Reliques'']], ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Pathfinder, or The Inland Sea|The Pathfinder]]'', which served as a model for mock battles fought on a field between the farm and the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1864, at the age of sixteen, he and a cousin, [[James Cox (labourer)|James Cox]], ran off to France, intending to walk to Russia. (Cox, slightly older than Jefferies, worked for the [[Great Western Railway]] and had a little money saved.) After crossing the channel, they soon found that their schoolboy French was insufficient and returned to England. Before they reached Swindon, they noticed an advertisement for cheap crossings from [[Liverpool]] to America and set off in this new direction. The tickets however, did not include the cost of food; and the boys were forced to return to Swindon after an attempt to pawn their watches had drawn the attention of the police.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 50–3; Thomas (1909), 46–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richardjefferies00thom 0107.jpg|thumb|left|Jefferies in 1872]]Jefferies left school at fifteen and at first continued his habits of solitary wanderings about the local countryside. He dressed carelessly and allowed his hair to grow down to his collar. This, with his "bent form and long, rapid stride made him an object of wonder in the town of Swindon. But he was perfectly unconscious of this, or indifferent to it."&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 57; Thomas (1909), 56; 65; Looker and Porteous (1965), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  He helped little on the farm (his only enthusiasm was for chopping and splitting wood) and was regarded as something of an idler. The gun that he always carried drew the suspicion of local landowners – one said, "That young Jefferies is not the sort of fellow you want hanging about in your covers".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 47–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, early in 1866, he started work as a newspaper reporter for the ''[[Gazette and Herald|North Wiltshire Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  For several years he worked as a reporter, contributing not only to the ''North Wiltshire Herald'', but also to the ''Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard'' and to the ''[[Swindon Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 60; Thomas (1909), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of the ''Swindon Advertiser'', William Morris, an antiquarian and local historian, lent Jefferies books and encouraged his early writing attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 54–5; 60; Thomas (1909), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jefferies himself developed an antiquarian interest in the countryside: he published articles on local history in the ''North Wiltshire Herald'' and was the first to notice a stone circle near Coate Farm. He was also spending much time on the downs, particularly at the iron age hill fort, [[Liddington Castle]], where he would lie on the grass, ecstatically feeling and seeking a connection with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 20; 57–8; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1867 and July 1868 he was very ill. In retrospect the illnesses were clearly the first symptoms of the tuberculosis that would kill him. He emerged from them weakened and very thin – "My legs are as thin as a grasshopper's", he wrote to his aunt. Illness also prompted some reconsideration of his own character: he was going to be "not swell but stylish" in future, since people set so much store by appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 70–5; Thomas (1909), 61–3; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was now actively pursuing a career as a writer, writing a history of the Goddards, a local family, and ''Reporting, Editing, and Authorship: Practical Hints for Beginners in Literature'' (1873), in which he shared the fruits of his brief experience as a local reporter. Meanwhile the novels he was writing could not find a publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 74–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  What national attention he attracted was instead from a series of letters to ''[[The Times]]'' on the Wiltshire agricultural labourer, published in November 1872. The letters, like his other writings from this period, reflect the Conservative outlook of his upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 80–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, the year of his first published novel, ''The Scarlet Shawl'', he married Jessie Baden (1853–1926), the daughter of a nearby farmer. After living for a few months at Coate Farm, the couple moved to a house in Swindon in 1875 (its current address is 93 Victoria Road); and their first child, Richard Harold Jefferies, was born there on 3 May.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 96; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===First successes===

====Essays====
While in Swindon, Jefferies had found it difficult to seek publication or employment with London publishers;&lt;ref&gt;Besant (1905), 83–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and early in 1877, with Jessie and their baby son Harold, he moved to a house at what is now 296 Ewell Road, [[Tolworth]], near [[Surbiton]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 111; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (There is a wooden plaque commemorating this by the entrance to Surbiton Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnowensmith.co.uk/books/lis1873855508.htm Literary Surrey] Page 72&lt;/ref&gt;) The area was then at the limits of London's growth. Jefferies spent much time wandering through the nearby countryside; and these walks would later provide the material for ''Nature Near London'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 111–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jefferies' Anemone.jpg|thumb|[[Anemone nemorosa|Anemone]] leaf from ''Round About a Great Estate'', described in chap. 5. Smith, Elder &amp; Co. used the emblem in subsequent editions of Jefferies's books.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Matthews (1993), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Surbiton years were momentous. The couple's next child, a daughter called Jessie after her mother (but known by her second name, Phyllis), was born (on 6 December 1880),&lt;ref name="Rossabi 2004"/&gt; and Jefferies began to make his name at last. His new surroundings defined him, both to himself and others, as a country writer. Articles drawing on Jefferies's Wiltshire experiences found a ready market in ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]''. First came a series of essays based on his friendship with the keeper of the Burderop estate, near Coate, ''The Gamekeeper at Home'', collected as a book in 1878. The book was well received and Jefferies was compared with the great English nature writer, [[Gilbert White]].&lt;ref name="Rossabi 2004"/&gt;  Three more collections followed the same pattern of publication in ''The Pall Mall Gazette'' and then in book form: ''Wild Life in a Southern County'' and ''The Amateur Poacher'' (both 1879), and ''Round About a Great Estate'' (1880). Another collection, ''Hodge and his Masters'' (1880), brought together articles first published in the ''Standard''. In the few years that Jefferies took to write these essays, his literary skill developed rapidly: ''The Amateur Poacher'' in particular is regarded as a major advance on the earlier works, the first in which he approaches the autobiographical subject matter that is behind his best works.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 132; Keith (1965), 64 "It is, in my opinion, easily the best of the country books, and this judgment would not, I think, be disputed by most readers".&lt;/ref&gt;  A minor novel,  ''Greene Ferne Farm'' (1880), was the first to gain recognition, both from contemporaries and in later scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Matthews (1993), 202 on its contemporary reception; Leavis (1989), 262, "''Greene Ferne Farm'' is the best of his early novels comparable with the Hardy of ''Under the Greenwood Tree''."&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Bevis books====
Two books of these years form a sequence. ''Wood Magic: A Fable'' (1881) introduces his child-hero, Bevis, a small child on a farm near a small lake, called the "Longpond", clearly Coate Farm and Coate Reservoir. Bevis's exploration of the garden and neighbouring fields brings him into contact with the country's birds and animals, who can speak to him, as can even inanimate parts of nature, such as the stream and the wind. Part of the book is a depiction of a small child's interaction with the natural world, but much is a cynical [[animal fable]] of a revolt against the magpie Kapchack, the local tyrant. In ''Bevis'' (1882), the boy is older, and the fantasy element, by which animals can talk, is quite absent. Rather, we have realistically related adventures of Bevis and his friend Mark, fighting a mock battle with other local children, rigging a boat and sailing to an island on the lake (which they call "The New Sea"), fishing and even shooting with a homemade gun.

===Illness and death===

====Onset====
In December 1881, Jefferies began to suffer from his until then undiagnosed tuberculosis, with an [[anal fistula]]. After a series of painful operations, he moved to West [[Brighton]] to convalesce.&lt;ref name="Rossabi 2004"/&gt;  About this time he wrote his extraordinary autobiography, ''[[The Story of My Heart]]'' (1883). He had been planning this work for seventeen years and, in his words, it was "absolutely and unflinchingly true". It was not an autobiography of the events of his life, but an outpouring of his deepest thoughts and feelings.

Articles about the Surbiton area were reprinted in the popular ''Nature Near London'' (1883), although the last chapters of the book refer to [[Beachy Head]], [[Ditchling Beacon]] and other [[Sussex]] landmarks.

In Brighton, his third child, Richard Oliver Launcelot Jefferies, was born on 18 July 1883. But his life was to be a short one. Jefferies moved to [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], then in [[Kent]], now a part of [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]], in June 1884, and here, early in 1885, the child died suddenly of [[meningitis]]. Jefferies was so affected that he could not attend the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Looker and Porteous (1965), 169, quoting Jefferies's son Harold, "His sufferings were so great that they prevented him from attending the funeral ... The agonized expression on father's face, as he stood at the open door, watching the little procession move away, haunted my mind for many years"; Rossabi (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''After London''====
Jefferies's next novel, ''After London'' (1885), can be seen as an early example of "[[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]]": after some sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature, and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life.

The book has two parts. The first, "The Relapse into Barbarism", is the account by some later historian of the fall of civilisation and its consequences, with a loving description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, the hated London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The second part, "Wild England", is largely a straightforward adventure set many years later in the wild landscape and society (here too Jefferies was setting an example for the genre); but the opening section, despite some improbabilities, has been much admired for its rigour and compelling narrative.

Critics dissatisfied with the second part often make an exception of chapters 22–24, which go beyond recreation of a medieval world to give a disturbing and surreal description of the site of the fallen city.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1909), 256 "[The Relapse into Barbarism] reveals an unsuspected strength of remorseless logic and restraint"; Fowles (1980), xviii–xix; Miller and Matthews (1993), 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferies's interest in catastrophes predates ''After London'': two short unpublished pieces from the 1870s describe social collapse after London is paralysed by freak winter conditions. In the better achieved of these, the narrator is a future historian piecing the story together from surviving accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Fowles (1980), x (the fragment, called ''The Great Snow'' by Looker, is given in an appendix to the same edition, 243-8); Miller and Matthews (1993), 432–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fantasy of the second part also has a predecessor in a short work, ''The Rise of Maximin, Emperor of the Occident'', serialised in ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' in 1876, in this case an adventure set in a remote and imaginary past.&lt;ref&gt;Fowles (1980), xi–xv; Miller and Matthews (1993), 33–6, 431–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the society that Jefferies depicts after the fall of London is an unpleasant one, with oppressive petty tyrants at war with each other, and insecurity and injustice for the poor, it still served as an inspiration for [[William Morris]]'s utopian ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890). In a letter of 1885, he writes of his reaction to ''After London'': "absurd hopes curled around my heart as I read it."&lt;ref&gt;Fowles (1980), vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; ''After London'' also influenced [[M.P. Shiel]]'s post-apocalyptic novel,
''[[The Purple Cloud]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"In writing ''The Purple Cloud'', Shiel drew heavily on another fine
novel, Richard Jefferies' ''After London''".[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]], "Introduction" to ''The Purple Cloud'', [[Penguin Classics]], 2012.
{{ISBN|9780141196428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final years====
After Eltham, Jefferies lived briefly in various parts of Sussex, first at [[Rotherfield]], then in a house on [[Crowborough]] Hill. In Crowborough Jefferies completed his most ambitious and most unusual novel, ''Amaryllis at the Fair'' (1887). Closely based on his own family at Coate, it describes a farm and family imperceptibly approaching disaster. There is little narrative development; instead significant or typical moments are presented in short scenes or even [[Tableau vivant|tableaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Besant (1905), 151–2 (on the later novels generally); Keith (1965), 139–43, particularly 139, citing a letter of Jefferies: "I originally intended this book to form a series of scenes from country life and so proposed to call it ''Scenes from Country Life'' ... The idea of calling it a novel was secondary."&lt;/ref&gt;

Illness and resulting lower productivity had impoverished Jefferies; and the editor Charles Longman suggested an application to the [[Royal Literary Fund]]. At first Jefferies resisted the suggestion, regarding aid from aristocratic patrons not involved in literary work humiliating: "Patrons of literature! was there ever such a disgrace in the nineteenth century? Patrons of literature! The thing is simply abominable!"  Longman finally succeeded in convincing Jefferies that the fund was "assisted by everybody who had made any success in literature". An application was accepted and the committee voted a grant of one hundred pounds. Another fund arranged by Longman enabled Jefferies to move nearer to the sea, to the [[Worthing]] suburb of [[Goring-by-Sea|Goring]].&lt;ref&gt;Looker and Porteous (1965), 198–202.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, on 14 August 1887, he died of tuberculosis and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Rossabi 2004"/&gt;  He is buried in Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery in Worthing.

After his death, a number of posthumous collections were made of his writings previously published in newspapers and magazines, beginning with ''Field and Hedgerow'' (1889), edited by his widow. New collections have appeared over the century following his birth, but even now not all have been reprinted in book form.

==Influence and reputation==
Early works included three by [[Henry Stephens Salt]]:
*''Richard Jefferies: A Study'' (1894)
*''Richard Jefferies: His Life and His Ideas'' (1905)
*''The Faith of Richard Jefferies'' (1906)

Jefferies's works inspired [[Henry Williamson]] to take up writing ; Williamson edited a collection of Jefferies's writings with a title that indicates the great regard that he held for Jefferies:

==Published books by Jefferies==
The following list is necessarily selective. Much of Jefferies's writing was not published in book form in his lifetime. Many works surviving in manuscript or only published in journals have been published piecemeal by various editors since his death. Since his contributions to journals were generally anonymous, identification is often a problem. For a fuller survey, see Miller and Matthews (1993).

[[File:HP garage front.JPG|thumb|David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded their company.]]

The '''rules of the garage''' are a set of eleven rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that [[William Redington Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] when they founded [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of [[Silicon Valley]].

== Etymology ==
The Rules were first articulated in 1999 by then HP CEO Carly Fiorina - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and they were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/rules-of-the-ga/ |title=Rules of the Garage, And Then Some |work=Wired |first=John C |last=Abell |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to [[HP Garage|David Packard's garage]] in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby [[Stanford University]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio |location=New York |first=Michael S |last=Malone |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eleven "Rules of the Garage" ==
The eleven rules are:&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
# Believe you can change the world.
# Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
# Know when to work alone and when to work together.
# Share — tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
# No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage.)
# The customer defines a job well done.
# Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
# Invent different ways of working.
# Make a contribution every day. If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.
# Believe that together we can do anything.
# Invent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2714">'''Social Reserves''' refer to the intangible ties that bind a country together. As a resource, they may be contrasted to a country’s [[Reserve (accounting)|financial reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singaporeans-must/874912.html Channel NewsAsia, “Singaporeans must contribute to nation's 'social reserves': President Tony Tan” 5 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term bears some similarity to the [[Bhutan]]ese concept of [[Gross national happiness]], in that it attempts to value quality of life in a way that goes beyond traditional economic indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grossnationalhappiness.com Gross National Happiness, The Centre for Bhutan Studies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in November 2013 by Singapore President [[Tony Tan|Dr Tony Tan]] at an event organised by [[St. Joseph's Institution, Singapore]]. Speaking in a lecture series on leadership, President Tan said:

:”The social reserves of a nation are the intangible ties that bind us to one another, and make a nation greater than the sum of individual citizens. [They] are the goodwill that makes us look out for one another even during difficult times, the resilience to overcome challenges and constraints, and the tenacity to progress as individuals and as a nation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=254332097 XIN MSN News, 5 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore maintains large financial reserves, primarily through two [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. The [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation]] (GIC) manages Singapore’s [[foreign reserve]]s; [[Temasek Holdings]] is an [[investment company]] owned by the [[Government of Singapore]]. Prior to running for Singapore’s elected presidency, President [[Tony Tan]] was Executive Director of GIC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istana.gov.sg/content/istana/thepresident/biography.html Istana, Biography of the President.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907160824/http://www.istana.gov.sg/content/istana/thepresident/biography.html |date=2013-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an effort to build up social reserves, he said, was the way that he had expanded Singapore's [[President's Challenge]] charity event to go beyond fund-raising to promote volunteerism and social entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/spore-needs-both-financial-and-social-reserves-thrive-president-tony-tan Leong Wai Kit, “S’pore needs both financial and ‘social’ reserves to thrive: President Tony Tan”, ''Today'', 6 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8780">'''Somaesthetics''' is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry aimed at promoting and integrating the theoretical, empirical and practical disciplines related to bodily perception, performance and presentation.

== Etymology ==
The term ‘somaesthetics’ was coined by the American pragmatist philosopher [[Richard Shusterman]] in 1996 through the compounding of “soma”, an expression derived from the Greek word for body, and “[[aesthetics]]”, a word derived from the Greek ''aesthesis'', meaning ‘sensory perception’.&lt;ref&gt;While Shusterman was the first to use 'somaesthetics' in reference to a philosophical discipline, a form of the term had been in use within the neurological sciences as an alternate label for the somatosensory cortex, i.e. the somaesthetic cortex. In American English, this alternate label is usually rendered with a different spelling: somesthetic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman has reported in a number of his works that he chose ‘soma’ over more familiar terms “to avoid problematic associations of body (which can be a lifeless, mindless thing) and flesh (which designates only the fleshly parts of the body and is strongly associated with Christian notions of sin)” and to emphasize that the project “concerns the lived, sentient, purposive body rather than merely a physical body”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an amalgamation, ‘somaesthetics’ “implies a project of appreciating and cultivating the body not only as an object that externally displays beauty, sublimity, grace, and other aesthetic qualities, but also as a subjectivity that perceives these qualities and that experiences attendant aesthetic pleasures somatically”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Origin and development ==
Somaesthetics as a research project initially arose from the work of Richard Shusterman during the mid-1990s in response to what he perceived as needed developments within his two principal modes of inquiry: pragmatist aesthetics and philosophy as an embodied art of living. While pragmatist aesthetics, according to Shusterman, advocates for more active and creative engagement than traditional aesthetics, he believed it should also recognize that artistic, practical and political action requires humanity’s primary tool, the body, and that such action could be improved partly by improving this instrument.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the philosophical life could be improved through greater mastery of the soma -- our medium of living. He moreover lamented the reduction of aesthetics (as well as philosophy itself) from “a noble art of living into a minor, specialized university discipline” narrowly concerned with beauty and fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=301|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman thus argued for the revival of “[[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]’s idea of aesthetics as a life-improving cognitive discipline that extends far beyond questions of beauty and fine arts and that involves both theory and practical exercise” and for an end to “the neglect of the body that Baumgarten disastrously introduced into aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ibid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As proposed, Shusterman’s project of somaesthetics would restore “the soma — the living, sentient, purposive body — as the indispensable medium for all perception".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Such heightening of somatic consciousness would not only enhance artistic appreciation and creation, but increase the perceptual awareness of meanings and feelings that have the potential to elevate everyday experience into an art of living.

Shusterman proposed three fundamental dimensions of his emerging field:
&lt;br /&gt;
• Analytic somaesthetics, as the most theoretically-oriented of the three, “describes the basic nature of bodily perceptions and practices and also of their function in our knowledge and construction of reality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=304|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Pragmatic somaesthetics presupposes the analytic dimension and “has a distinctly normative, prescriptive character – by proposing specific methods of somatic improvement and engaging in their comparative critique”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|pages=304–305|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Practical somaesthetics focuses on practicing somatic care “through intelligently disciplined body work aimed at somatic self-improvement (whether in a representational, experiential, or performative mode)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=307|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two decades, somaesthetics has become a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. Originally conceived by Shusterman as being under the umbrella of [[philosophy]], or perhaps even a branch of [[aesthetics]], somaesthetics has evolved into an “open field for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transcultural inquiry” with applications “ranging from the arts, product design, and politics to fashion, health, sports, martial arts, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs in education”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html#heading_Genealogy_and_Emergence_page_107797|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Strong theologian - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|James Strong (1822–1894)]]
{{italic title}}
'''''The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible''''',{{refn|group=n|The complete title of the original work was ''The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible: Showing Every Word of the Text of the Common English Version of the Canonical Books, and Every Occurrence of Each Word in Regular Order: Together with A Comparative Concordance of the Authorized and Revised Versions, Including the American Variations; Also Brief Dictionaries of the Hebrew and Greek Words of the Original, with References to the English Words''.{{sfnp|Strong|1890|p=1}}}} generally known as '''''Strong's Concordance''''', is a [[Bible concordance]], an index of every word in the [[King James Version]] (KJV), constructed under the direction of [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]]. Strong first published his ''Concordance'' in 1890, while professor of [[Exegesis|exegetical]] [[theology]] at [[Drew University|Drew Theological Seminary]].

[[File:Strongs Concordances.png|thumb|Editions and reprints of ''Strong's Concordance'', now in public domain]]

==Purpose==
The purpose of ''Strong's Concordance'' is not to provide content or commentary about the Bible, but to provide an [[Index (publishing)|index]] to the Bible. This allows the reader to find words where they appear in the Bible. This index allows a student of the Bible to re-find a phrase or passage previously studied. It also lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used elsewhere in the Bible. In this way Strong provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of text.

==Strong's numbers==
Each original-language word is given an entry number in the dictionary of those original language words listed in the back of the concordance. These have become known as the "Strong's numbers". The main concordance lists each word that appears in the [[KJV Bible]] in alphabetical order with each verse in which it appears listed in order of its appearance in the Bible, with a snippet of the surrounding text (including the word in italics). Appearing to the right of the scripture reference is the Strong's number. This allows the user of the concordance to look up the meaning of the original language word in the associated dictionary in the back, thereby showing how the original language word was translated into the English word in the KJV Bible.

''Strong's Concordance'' includes:
* The 8674 [[biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] root words used in the [[Old Testament]]. (Example: ''{{Strong Hebrew|582}}'')
* The 5624 [[koine Greek|Greek]] root words used in the [[New Testament]]. (Example: ''{{Strong Greek|3056}}'')

New editions of ''Strong's'' may exclude the comparative section (1611 KJV to 1614) and the asterisks that denote differential definitions of the same Hebrew or Greek words; due perhaps to denominational considerations, definitions may also be altered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

Although the Greek words in ''Strong's Concordance'' are numbered 1–5624, the numbers 2717 and 3203–3302 are unassigned due to "changes in the enumeration while in progress". Not every distinct word is assigned a number, but only the root words. For example, αγαπησεις is assigned the same number as αγαπατε – both are listed as {{Strong Greek|25}} αγαπαω.

Other authors have used Strong's numbers in concordances of other Bible translations, such as the ''[[New International Version]]'' and ''[[American Standard Version]]''.

Due to Strong's numbers it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible ("Новая учебная Библия Томпсона", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society "The Bible for everyone", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from [[Thompson Chain-Reference Bible]] (''The New Thompson Study Bible,'' La Buona Novella Inc. &amp; B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then its Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

New editions of ''Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible'' remain in print {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}.

==Strong's Dictionaries==
In the 1890 version, Strong added a "Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary" and a "Greek Dictionary of the New Testament" to his concordance. In the preface to both dictionaries, Strong explains that these are "brief and simple" dictionaries, not meant to replace reference to "a more copious and elaborate Lexicon." He mentions [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]] and [[Bible concordance#Hebrew|Fürst]] as examples of the lexicons that Strong's is drawn from. His dictionaries were meant to give students a quick and simple way to look up words and have a general idea of their meaning.

Strong reportedly based his lexicons on the work of contemporary scholars such as Gesenius, Fürst, [[A Greek-English Lexicon|Liddell &amp; Scott]], [[Joseph Henry Thayer|Thayer]], and [[Brown-Driver-Briggs|Brown, Driver, and Briggs]]. According to the preface, he and his team also made "numerous original suggestions, relations, and distinctions... especially in the affinities of roots and the classification of meanings." The work is intended to represent the best of 19th century scholarship, and both a simplification of it and an improvement on it. An important feature of Strong's dictionaries is the listing of every translation of a source word in the [[King James Version|AV (King James)]] after the definition itself.

It is important to note Strong's association with the committee working on the [[American Standard Version|American]] [[Revised Version|Revised Version]] of the Bible. His work does not tend to support the authority of the King James Version. He was part of the effort to update and replace it with what the translators believed would be a better version. As a result, he contributed deeper and more thorough study of Biblical languages, especially etymology, but also an inherently suspicious attitude toward the [[Textus Receptus]], the King James, and toward traditional, less "secular" definitions of original words. The translation committee was associated with the [[Historical criticism|Higher Critical]] movement and with the [[Westcott-Hort]] version of the Greek text. Strong, a Methodist layman and college professor, was acceptable to the committee, but one cannot assume he shared all of its views.&lt;ref name="Strong Delusion"&gt;[http://www.avpublications.com/avnew/downloads/PDF/HazMat/H-pp_157-202_Chapter_7_Strong_Delusion-James_Strongs_Dang.pdf], This is a hostile source but it cites original sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synderesis''' or '''synteresis''', in [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[moral philosophy]], is the natural ''capacity'' or disposition (habitus) of the ''[[practical reason]]'' to apprehend intuitively the universal ''[[first principles]]'' of human ''action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14384a.htm | title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Synderesis | work=Catholic Encyclopedia | access-date=2 January 2016 | quote=Synderesis, or more correctly synteresis, is a term used by the Scholastic theologians to signify the habitual knowledge of the universal practical principles of moral action.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reason]] is a single faculty, but is called differently according to the end that it assigns to its search for [[truth]]; when its goal is the mere consideration (contemplation) of truth, it is called ''speculative reason''; when it considers truth in view of action ([[Praxis (process)|praxis]]), it is called ''practical reason''. In both cases reason uses demonstration ([[syllogism]]) as its tool; it proceeds from the understanding of previously known truths ([[premise]]s) to the statement of a proposition ([[logical consequence|conclusion]]) whose truth follows necessarily from the premises.

How does one know that those premises (and consequently their conclusion) are true? Because they are themselves conclusions of previous demonstrations. Although one could take back this process of demonstration of the truth of premises as far as we want, a [[Infinite regress|regression ad infinitum]] would deprive the demonstrative chain of certitude. Consequently, it is necessary that the point of departure of human reasoning be some immediately knowable, i.e. [[self-evident]], [[proposition]]s called ''first principles'', whose truth is not, indeed cannot be grasped through demonstration, but only by [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (noûs).

The habit or disposition that allows the speculative reason to apprehend intuitively the principles that preside over its [[discursive reasoning]] is called "understanding of principles" (intellectus principiorum).  The principles of "[[principle of non-contradiction|non contradiction]]", of "[[principle of identity|identity]]" and of "[[law of excluded middle|excluded middle]]", all of which are ultimately based on the notion of "[[being]]", which is the first that our reason apprehends absolutely, are all examples of those principles.

Similarly, the capacity or disposition that allows the practical reason to apprehend intuitively the principles or laws that preside over its discursive reasoning regarding human action is called ''synderesis''. Just as "being" is the first notion apprehended absolutely, so also "[[goodness and value theory|good]]" is the first thing that is apprehended by the practical reason, since everything that acts does so for an end which possesses the quality of goodness. That is why the first principle or law of the practical reason is "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided". Also the precepts of natural law can be considered object of synderesis insofar as all the things towards which the human being has a natural inclination are naturally apprehended by the intellect as good and therefore as objects to be pursued, and their opposites as evils to be avoided.

Synderesis is the capacity not only to apprehend the first principles, but also to judge every step of the practical discourse in the light of those principles. But, as an intellectual disposition concerned with knowledge of the first principles of action, synderesis provides only the [[universal premise]] of the practical syllogism. Every human ''action'', however, is singular, [[contingent]] and takes place in particular circumstances. To complete the practical discourse and reach a conclusion regarding what has to be done ''hic et nunc'' [here and now] and what means are  to be used, other capacities are necessary besides synderesis, and to actually effect the action other faculties are required besides reason. That is why the whole picture concerning human action includes powers, dispositions and acts such as conscience, desire, will, etc.

The origin of the notion of synderesis as presented here can be traced, on the one hand, to the Commentary on [[Ezechiel]] by [[Saint Jerome]] (A.D. 347–419), where ''syntéresin'' (συντήρησιν) is mentioned among the powers of the [[soul]] and is described as the spark of conscience (''scintilla conscientiae'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/synderes.htm | title=Synderesis &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | author=Anonymous | work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | access-date=2 January 2016 | quote="Synderesis" is a technical term from scholastic philosophy, signifying the innate principle in the moral consciousness of every person which directs the agent to good and restrains him from evil. It is first found in a single passage of St Jerome (d. 420) in his explanation of the four living creatures in Ezekiel's vision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the other, to the interpretation of Jerome's text given, in the 13th century, by [[Albertus|Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the light of Aristotelian psychology and [[Aristotelianism|ethics]]. The word ''synderesis'' is by most scholars reckoned to be a corruption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for shared knowledge or conscience, ''syneidêsis'' ({{lang|grc|συνείδησις}}), the corruption appearing in the medieval manuscripts of Jerome's Commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kries in ''Traditio'' vol. 57: ''Origen, Plato, and Conscience (Synderesis) in Jerome's Ezekiel Commentary'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of synderesis was proposed by [[Bonaventure]], who considered it as the natural inclination of the ''[[will (philosophy)|will]]'' towards moral good.

The term is found applied in psychiatric studies too, with particular reference to [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Martha Stout'', (2005) ''The Sociopath Next Door'', Broadway Books, {{ISBN|0-7679-1582-8}} (term ''synderesis'' in pages 27, 28, 29, 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-semi|small=yes}}

A '''term of endearment''' is a word or phrase used to address or describe a person, animal or inanimate object for which the speaker feels [[love]] or [[affection]]. Terms of endearment are used for a variety of reasons, such as parents addressing their [[children]] and [[sexual partner|lovers]] addressing each other.

== Etymology ==
Such words may not in their original use, bear any resemblance in meaning to the meaning attached when used as a term of endearment, for example calling a significant other "pumpkin". Some words are clearly derived from each other, such as  "sweetheart" and "sweetie", while others bear no etymological resemblance, such as "baby", "babe", and "cutie". "Honey" has been documented as a term of endearment from at least the 14th century. "Baby" is first used in 1839 and "sugar" only appears as recently as 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Each term of endearment has its own connotations, which are highly dependent on the situation they are used in, such as tone of voice, body language, and social context. Saying "Hey baby, you're looking good" varies greatly from the use "Baby, don't swim at the deep end of the pool!" Certain terms can be perceived as offensive or patronizing, depending on the context and speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7748164.stm|title=Stop using 'dearie', nurses told|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-11-26|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminists]] have complained that while 'terms of endearment are words used by close friends, families, and lovers...they are also used on women by perfect strangers...[[double standard]]' – because 'between strangers terms of endearment imply a judgment of incompetence on the part of the target'.&lt;ref&gt;Alette Olin Hill, ''Mother Tongue, Father Time'' (1986) p. 86 and p. 90-1&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed out however that, in an informal setting like a pub, 'the use of terms of endearment here was a positive politeness strategy. A term like "mate", or "sweetie", shifts the focus of the request away from its imposition...toward the camaraderie existing between interlocutors'.&lt;ref&gt;José Santaemilia ed., ''Género'' (2003) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms of endearment often 'make use of internal rhyme...[with] still current forms such as lovey-dovey, which appeared in 1819, and honey bunny',&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steven Morton, ''The Lover's Tongue'' (2003) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; or of other duplications. Some such combinations seem nonsensical, odd, or too long, however, such as ''baby pie'' or ''love dear'', and are seldom used.

Terms of endearment can lose their original meaning over the course of time: thus for example 'in the early twentieth century the word ''[[crumpet]]'' was used as a term of endearment by both sexes', before diminishing later into a 'term of objectification'&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; for women.

Terms of endearment are also used as a sort of "significant other identity".

=== French ===
'French has all kinds of interesting terms of endearment, including a rather odd assortment of barnyard animals...[like] mon canard (my duck)'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawlessfrench.com/vocabulary/terms-of-endearment/ Laura K. Lawless, "French Terms of Endearment"]&lt;/ref&gt; – something which may be compared to the British 'baby talk...duckie'.&lt;ref&gt;Laurell K. Hamilton, ''Incubus Dreams'' (2004) p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proper names ==
When proper names escape one, terms of endearment can always substitute, producing (as [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] put it) the 'opacity of the ejaculations of love, when, lacking a signifier to name the object of its epithalamium, it employs the crudest trickery of the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]]. "I'll eat you up....Sweetie!" "You'll love it...Rat!"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Sweetheart" ==
[[Eric Berne]] identified the marital [[Transactional analysis#Games and their analysis|game]] of "Sweetheart", where 'White makes a subtly derogatory remark about Mrs White, disguised as anecdote, and ends: "Isn't that right, sweetheart?" Mrs. White tends to agree...because it would seem surly to disagree with a man who calls one "sweetheart" in public'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin 1966) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne points out that 'the more tense the situation, and the closer the game is to exposure, the more bitterly is the word "sweetheart" enunciated'; while the wife's antithesis is either 'to reply: "Yes, ''honey''!"' or to 'respond with a similar "Sweetheart" type anecdote about the husband, saying in effect, "You have a dirty face too, dear"'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 94-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary anecdotes ==
* In [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''Last Things'', the narrator's wife, faced with their son's unconventional marriage, turns to her husband and says: '"Tell me, Lewis" (actually she used a pet name which meant she needed me) "is that a real marriage?"'&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Last Things'' (Penguin 1974) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Virginia Woolf]] – 'Mandril or Marmoset for Leonard' her husband – wrote 'the story "Lappin and Lapinova", published in 1938, which describes the death of a marriage when the erotic, escapist fantasy of the animal names is cruelly killed off by the husband'.&lt;ref&gt;Hermione Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (London 1996) p. 111-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Way the World Is: Christian Perspective of a Scientist''''' is a book first published in 1983 by the [[John Polkinghorne]], who was a Professor of Mathematical Physics at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]]. It has sold over a million copies (including a second edition in 1992),{{Fact|date=February 2007}} although was superseded to a degree by ''[[The Faith of a Physicist]]'' published in 1994.

It is a short volume which was written in response to the surprise of a number of working scientists when Polkinghorne quit academic research in 1979 to train for [[ordination]] in the [[Church of England]]. He subsequently returned to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], as Dean in 1986, and later as the President of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]].

== Synopsis ==
The first part of the book goes through the familiar territory of the scientist's '[[Standard Model]]' of the universe from the [[Big Bang]] to the development of human life on Earth. Whilst discussing these the book gives an overview of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[indeterminism]], which Polkinghorn believes represent a challenge to [[metaphysical naturalism]]. The book asserts that aspects of human experiences cannot be reduced to physics and biology. 

The remaining chapters consider core Christian beliefs, New Testament history and how they fit into this perspective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7653">'''Thomas Vaughan''' (1621 − 27 February 1666) was a Welsh [[philosopher]] and [[alchemy|alchemist]], who wrote in English. He is now remembered for his work in the field of [[natural magic]].

==Life==
A [[Cavalier|Royalist]] clergyman from [[Brecon]], [[Wales]], Thomas was the twin brother of the poet [[Henry Vaughan]],&lt;ref name=WBO2&gt;"[Henry's] twin brother was THOMAS VAUGHAN (1621-1666). . ." [http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-VAUG-HEN-1621.html Vaughan, Henry] in Welsh Biography Online, at National Library of Wales&lt;/ref&gt; both being born at [[Newton, Brecknockshire|Newton]], in the parish of St. Briget's, in 1621.&lt;ref name=WBO1&gt;The twins were the sons of Thomas Vaughan of 'Trenewydd', Newton . . . "who m. the heiress of Newton in Llansantffraed" [http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-VAUG-TRE-1450.html VAUGHAN family, of Tretower Court] in Welsh Biography Online, at National Library of Wales.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Jesus College, Oxford]], in 1638, and remained there for a decade during the [[English Civil War]].

Vaughan took part in the [[Battle of Rowton Heath]] in 1645.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Garrett A. Sullivan |author2=Alan Stewart |title=The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7UeL_0Pu3oC&amp;pg=PA1001 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=1 February 2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-9449-5 |pages=1001–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became rector of the parish of [[Llansantffraed]] (St Bridget) Wales and took up medical studies, motivated by the lack of doctors in Wales. But in 1650, Vaughan was evicted from the parish because of his Royalist sympathies.

Vaughan later became involved with a plan of [[Robert Child (agriculturalist)|Robert Child]] to form a chemical club, with a laboratory and library, the main aim being to translate and collect chemical works. He married his wife Rebecca in 1651 and spent the next period of his life in London. His wife died in 1658.

Vaughan died at the house of [[Samuel Kem]], at [[Albury, Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{ODNBweb |id=28148 |title=Vaughan, Thomas |first=Barbara |last=Donagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Although he did not practice medicine, Vaughan sought to apply his chemical skills to preparing medicines in the manner recommended by [[Paracelsus]]. He corresponded with [[Samuel Hartlib]], who by 1650 was paying attention to Vaughan as author,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs]] |title=The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy, Or, "The Hunting of the Greene Lyon"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=29 April 1983 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=978-0-521-27381-7 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established a reputation with his book ''[[Anthroposophia Theomagica]]'', a magico-mystical work. Vaughan was the author of tracts published under the pseudonym [[Eugenius Philalethes]], as is now generally agreed.

Vaughan was unusual amongst alchemists of the time&lt;ref&gt; Peter Levenda [https://books.google.ro/books?id=aFJOBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Tantric Alchemist: Thomas Vaughan and the Indian Tantric Tradition''](2015)&lt;/ref&gt; in that he worked closely with his wife Rebecca Vaughan. He was a self-described member of the "Society of Unknown Philosophers", and was responsible for translating into English in 1652 the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]] Rosae Crucis'', an anonymous [[Rosicrucian]] manifesto first published in 1614 in [[Kassel]].

[[Allen G. Debus]] has written that a simple explanation of Vaughan's natural philosophy, in its mature form, is as the ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De occulta]]'' of [[Cornelius Agrippa]], in an exposition coming via the views of [[Michael Sendivogius]].&lt;ref name="Debus2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Allen G. Debus]] |title=Alchemy and Early Modern Chemistry: Papers from Ambix |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsm8r2oXYp4C&amp;pg=PA417 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing |isbn=978-0-9546484-1-1 |page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer in the school of Sendivogius, Vaughan follows [[Jacques de Nuisement]] and [[Andreas Orthelius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William R. Newman |title=Gehennical Fire: The Lives of George Starkey, an American Alchemist in the Scientific Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXFs8ergtYUC&amp;pg=PA213 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=15 February 2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-57714-2 |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed himself in the tradition of the Rosicrucian reformers of education, and of [[Johannes Trithemius]], his teacher Libanius Gallus, and Pelagius of Majorca, teacher of Libanius (of whom the last two are not known to have been real people apart from what Trithemius relates of them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Noel L. Brann |title=Trithemius and Magical Theology: A Chapter in the Controversy Over Occult Studies in Early Modern Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU81YW06ZH0C&amp;pg=PA109 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |year=1999 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3961-6 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paola Zambelli |title=White Magic, Black Magic in the European Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tp6PhNsz43EC&amp;pg=PA77 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |year=2007 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-16098-9 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some writers of catalogues of hermetic and alchemical treatises (such as John Ferguson, Denis Ian Duveen, [[Vinci Verginelli]] et al.), Thomas Vaughan could be the anonymous author of the treatise ''Reconditorium ac Reclusorium Opulentiae Sapientiaeque Numinis Mundi Magni, cui deditur in titulum CHYMICA VANNUS... Amstelodami... Anno 1666'', i. e. a mysterious masterpiece of the hermetic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Italian translation by Gerolamo Moggia and Vinci Verginelli, manuscript, 1921–1925, reviewed by Mario Marta and Giovanni Sergio, self-publishing www.youcanprint.it, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Controversies==
Vaughan quarrelled in print with [[Henry More]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Juliet Cummins |title=Milton and the Ends of Time |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1FITAztgmwC&amp;pg=PA34 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=1 May 2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-81665-6 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their pamphlet war petered out, but More returned to the subject of alchemists in ''Enthusiasmus Triumphatus'' (1656).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs |title=The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy, Or, "The Hunting of the Greene Lyon" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=29 April 1983 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=978-0-521-27381-7 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of Vaughan was [[John Gaule]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Vaughan fell out with an alchemical collaborator, Edward Bolnest, over money matters and alleged broken promises, and the matter came to litigation after Bolnest had threatened violence.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Vaughan was accused as part of this affair of spending "most of his time in the study of Naturall Philosophy and Chimicall Phisick". He is reported as having confessed that he had "long sought and long missed... the [[philosopher's stone]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1080">'''Vagrant predicates''' are logical constructions that exhibit an inherent limit to conceptual knowledge.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Rescher N., ''Unknowability'', Lexington books, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Such predicates can be used in general descriptions but are self-contradictory when applied to particulars. For instance, there are numbers which have never been mentioned but no example can be given as this would  contradict its definition. Vagrant predicates have been proposed and studied by [[Nicholas Rescher]]. 

F is a vagrant predicate [[iff]] (&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;u)Fu is true while nevertheless Fu&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is false for each and every specifically identified  u&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Rescher N., ''Informal Logic'', Vol. 28, No.4 (2008), pp. 282-294&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[infinity]] is thought as number greater than any given, a similar idea is conceived. However vagrancy needs not to be monotonous and occurs also within bounds. Rescher has used vagrant predicates to solve the [[vagueness]] problem.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

{{Philosophy sidebar}}
{{Vaishnavism}}
'''Vishishtadvaita''' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Viśiṣṭādvaita }}''; {{lang-sa|विशिष्टाद्वैत}}) is one of the most popular schools of the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Vedanta]] literally means the ''end of the [[Vedas]].'' ''VishishtAdvaita'' (literally "[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] with uniqueness; qualifications") is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta philosophy. It is [[non-dualism]] of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as qualified monism or qualified non-dualism or attributive [[monism]]. It is a school of Vedanta philosophy which believes in all diversity subsuming to an underlying unity.

[[Ramanuja]], the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the [[Prasthanatrayi]] ("The three courses"), namely the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Gita|Bhagavad Gita]], and the [[Brahmasutra|Brahma Sutras]] are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency. [[Vedanta Desika]] defines ''Vishishtadvaita'' using the statement, ''Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam :'' [[Brahman]], as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality.{{Hindu philosophy}}

==Philosophers==
The Vishishtadvaitic thought is considered to have existed for a long time, and it is surmised that the earliest works are no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandrankunnel|first=Matthew|title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|year=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|location=New Delhi|page=945}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The names of the earliest of these philosophers is only known through [[Ramanuja]]'s ''Vedartha Sangraham''. Bodhayana, Dramida, Tanka, Guhadeva, Kapardi and Bharuci the prominent ones in the line of the philosophers considered to have expounded the VisishtAdvaitic system.

[[Bodhayana]] is considered to have written an extensive ''vritti'' (commentary) on the [[Purva Mimamsa|Purva]] and [[Uttara Mimamsa]]s. Tanka is attributed with having written commentaries on [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and Brahma Sutras.  [[Nathamuni]] of the ninth century AD, the foremost [[Acharya]] of the [[Vaishnava]]s, collected the Tamil [[Divya Prabandha|prabandhas]], classified them, made the redaction, set the hymns to music and spread them everywhere.  He is said to have received the divine hymns straight from [[Nammalvar]], the foremost of the twelve [[Alvars]], by yogic insight in the temple at Alwar Thirunagari, which is located near [[Tirunelveli]] in South [[India]]. [[Yamunacharya]] renounced kingship and spent his last days in the service of the Lord at [[Srirangam]] and in laying the fundamentals of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy by writing four basic works on the subject.

Ramanuja is the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy. The philosophy itself is considered to have existed long before Ramanuja's time.&lt;ref name="EoH 490"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0816073368|pages=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramanuja continues along the line of thought of his predecessors while expounding the knowledge expressed in the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and Bhagavad Gita. [[Vedanta Desika]] and [[Pillai Lokacharya]], disciples in the tradition of Ramanuja, had minor disagreements not on the [[philosophy]], but on some aspects of the [[theology]], giving rise to the [[Vadakalai]] and [[Thenkalai]] schools of thought, as explained below.

[[Swaminarayan]], the founder of [[Swaminarayan Hinduism]], also propagated this philosophy and based the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] (original name is [[Uddhava]] Sampraday) on these ideals.&lt;ref name="Williams Swaminarayan Vishishtadvait"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 65279 0|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key principles ==
There are three key principles of Vishishtadvaita:{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
* ''[[Tattva]]'': The knowledge of the 3 real entities namely, ''[[jiva]]'' (living souls; the sentient); ''[[ajiva]]'' (the nonsentient) and [[Ishvara]] (''Vishnu-Narayana'' or ''Parahbrahman'', creator and controller of the world).
* ''[[Hitā|Hita]]'': The means of realization, as through ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) and ''[[prapatti]]'' (self-surrender).
* ''[[Purushartha]]'': The goal to be attained, as ''moksha'' or liberation from bondage.

==Epistemology==

=== Pramanas ===
''[[Pramana]]'' refers to the correct knowledge, arrived at by thorough reasoning, of any object. ''Pramana'' ("sources of knowledge", Sanskrit) forms one part of a ''triputi'' (trio).
# ''Pramatir'', the ''subject''; the ''knower'' of the knowledge
# ''Pramana'', the ''cause'' or the ''means'' of the knowledge
# ''Prameya'', the ''object'' of knowledge

In Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, only the following three ''pramanas'' are accepted as valid means of knowledge:
* ''Pratyaksa'' — the knowledge gained by means of ''perception''. Perception refers to knowledge obtained by cognition of external objects based on sensory perception.  In modern-day usage this will also include knowledge obtained by means of observation through scientific instruments since they are an extension of perception.
* ''Anumana'' — the knowledge gained by means of ''inference''. Inference refers to knowledge obtained by deductive reasoning and analysis.
* ''[[Shabda]]'' — the knowledge gained by means of ''[[shruti]]''. ''Shruti'' refers to knowledge gained from scriptures - primarily the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.

====Rules of epistemology====
There are three rules of hierarchy when there is apparent conflict between the three modes of acquiring knowledge:
* ''Shabda'' or ''Shruti'', Pramana occupies the highest position in matters which cannot be settled or resolved by ''pratyaksa'' (perception) or by ''anumana'' (inference).
* ''Anumana'' occupies the next position. When an issue cannot be settled through sensory perception alone, it is settled based on inference, that is, whichever is the more logical argument.
* When ''pratyaksa'' yields a definitive position on a particular issue, such a perception cannot be ignored by interpreting ''Shabda'' in a way which violates that perception.

==Metaphysics==

===Ontology===

The [[ontology]] in Vishishtadvaita consists of explaining the relationship between [[Ishvara]] (''Parabrahman''), the sentient beings (''chit-brahman'') and the insentient Universe (''achit-brahman''). In the broadest sense, Ishvara is the Universal Soul of the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings. The three ontological entities are described below:

====Ishvara====

[[Ishvara]] (denoted by Vishnu-Narayana) is the Supreme Cosmic Spirit who maintains complete control over the Universe and all the sentient beings, which together also form the pan-organistic body of Ishvara. The triad of Ishvara along with the universe and the sentient beings is Brahman, which signifies the completeness of existence. Ishvara is Parabrahman endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities (Kalyana Gunas). Ishvara is perfect, omniscient, omnipresent, incorporeal, independent, the creator of the universe, its active ruler and also its eventual destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;White Yajurveda 32.3&lt;/ref&gt; He is causeless, eternal and unchangeable — and is yet the material and the efficient cause of the universe and sentient beings. He is both immanent (like whiteness in milk) and transcendent (like a watch-maker independent of a watch). He is the subject of worship. He is the basis of morality and giver of the fruits of one's Karma. He rules the world with His Maya — His divine power.

Ishvara is considered to have a 2-fold characteristic: he is the indweller of all beings and all beings dwell in Ishvara.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

=====Antarvyapi=====

When Ishvara is thought of as the indweller of all beings, he is referred to as the [[Paramatman]], or the innermost self of all beings.

''He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does not know, whose body water is and who controls water from within — He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.''

''He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun from within — He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal'' - [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.7.4-14

=====Bahuvyapi=====

When Ishvara is thought of as the all encomposing and the residence of all beings that is, all beings reside in Ishvara, he is referred to as the paramapurusha. The sentient beings and the insentient universe which form part of the pan-organistic body of Ishvara are encapsulated by Ishvara.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}

''Sarvam khalvidam Brahma'' [[Chandogya Upanishad]]

''Isavasyam idam sarvam'' [[Isha Upanishad]]

====Chit====

[[Satchitananda|Chit]] is the world of sentient beings, or of entities possessing consciousness. It is similar to the [[Purusha]] of Samkhya system. The sentient beings are called Jīvās and they are possessors of individual consciousness as denoted by "I". The scope of Chit refers to all beings with an "I" consciousness, or more specifically self-awareness. Therefore, all entities which are aware of their own individual existence are denoted as ''chit''. This is called ''Dharmi-jnana'' or ''substantive consciousness''. The sentient beings also possess varying levels of ''Dharma-bhuta-jnana'' or ''attributive consciousness''

The jivas possess three different types of existence:
* ''Nityas'', or the eternally free Jivas who were never in [[Samsara]]
* ''Muktas'', or the Jivas that were once in Samsara but are free
* ''Baddhas'', or the Jivas which are still in Samsara

====Achit====
[[Achit (metaphysics)|Achit]] is the world of insentient entities as denoted by matter or more specifically the non-conscious Universe. It is similar to the [[Prakriti]] of Samkhya system.

====Brahman====
There is a subtle difference between Ishvara and Brahman. Ishvara is the substantive part of Brahman, while jivas and jagat are its modes (also secondary attributes), and kalyanagunas (auspicious attributes) are the primary attributes. The secondary attributes become manifested in the effect state when the world is differentiated by name and form. The kalyanagunas are eternally manifest.

''Brahman is the description of Ishvara when comprehended in fullness– i.e., a simultaneous vision of Ishvara with all his modes and attributes. ''

The relationship between Brahman and Jivas, Jagat is expressed by Rāmānujā in numerous ways. He calls this relationship as one of:
* '''sharIra/sharIrI (शरीर/ शरीरी)'''        (''body/indweller'');
* '''prakAra/prakArI'''      (''attribute or mode/substance'');
* '''‌shesha/sheshi'''          (''Owned/owner'');
* '''amsha/amshI'''            (''part/whole'');
* '''AdhAradeya/sambandha''' (''supporter/supported'');
* '''niyamya/niyanta'''      (''controlled/controller'');
* '''rashksya/rakshaka'''      (''redeemed/redeemer'');

These relationships can be experienced holding Brahman as the father, son, mother, sister, wife, husband, friend, lover and lord. Hence, Brahman is a personal being.
* What does Nirguna Brahman mean?

Ramanuja argues vehemently against understanding Brahman as one without attributes. Brahman is Nirguna in the sense that impure qualities do not touch it. He provides three valid reasons for staking such a claim:

Shruti/ Shabda Pramana: All shrutis and shabdas denoting Brahman always list either attributes inherent to Brahman or not inherent to Brahman. The shrutis only seek to deny Brahman from possessing impure and defective qualities which affect the world of beings. There is evidence in the shrutis to this regard. The shrutis proclaim Brahman to be beyond the tri-gunas which are observed. However, Brahman possesses an infinite number of transcendental attributes, the evidence of which is given in vakhyas like "satyam jnanam anantam Brahma" (Taittiriya Upanishad).

Pratyaksha Pramana: Ramanuja states that "a contentless cognition is impossible". And all cognition must necessarily involve knowing Brahman through the attributes of Brahman.

Anumana Pramana: Ramanuja states that "Nirgunatva" itself becomes an attribute of Brahman on account of the uniqueness of no other entity being Nirguna.
Ramanuja had simplified relationship between bramha and soul.According to him though soul is integral part of bramha it has independent existence.&lt;ref&gt;J.L.Mehta VOl3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of Existence===
The three ontological entities i.e. Ishvara, Chit and Achit are fundamentally real. It upholds the doctrine of ''[[Satkaryavada]]'' as against ''[[Asatkaryavada]]''.

Briefly,
* Satkaryavada is pre-existence of the effect in the cause. It maintains that karya (effect) is sat or real.  It is present in the karana (cause) in a potential form, even before its manifestation.
* Asatkaryavada is non-existence of the effect in the cause.  It maintains that karya (effect) is asat or unreal until it comes into being.  Every effect, then, is a new beginning and is not born out of cause.

More specifically, the effect is a modification of what exists in the cause and does not involve new entities coming into existence.  This is called as ''parinamavada'' or evolution of effect from the cause.  This doctrine is common to the Samkhya system and Vishishtadvaita system.  The Samkhya system adheres to Prakriti-Parinama vada whereas Vishishtadvaita is a modified form of Brahma-Parinama vada.

==== {{IAST|Kārya and kārana}} ====

The {{IAST|kārana}} (''cause'') and {{IAST|kārya}} (''effect'') in Vishishtadvaita is different from other systems of [[Indian Philosophy]]. Brahman is both the {{IAST|kārana}} (''cause'') and the {{IAST|kārya}} (''effect'').  Brahman as the cause '''does not''' become the Universe as the effect.

Brahman is assigned two {{IAST|kāranatvas}} (''ways of being the cause''):

# {{IAST|Nimitta kāranatva}} — ''Being the Efficient/ Instrumental cause''. For example, a goldsmith is assigned {{IAST|Nimitta kāranatva}} as he acts as the maker of jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery's ''Instrumental cause''.
# {{IAST|Upādāna kāranatva}} — ''Being the material cause''. For example, the gold is assigned {{IAST|Upādāna kāranatva}} as it acts as the material of the jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery's ''material cause''.

According to Vishishtadvaita, the Universe and Sentients always exist. However, they begin from a subtle state and undergo transformation. The subtle state is called a causal state, while the transformed state is called the effect state. The causal state is when Brahman is internally not distinguishable by name and form.

It can be said that Vishishtadvaita follows '''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Brahma-Prakara-Parinama Vada]]'''. That is to say, it is the modes (Jivas and Jagath) of Brahman which is under evolution. The cause and effect only refer to the pan-organistic body transformation. Brahman as the Universal Self is unchanging and eternal.

Brahman having the subtle (sūkshma) chit and achit entities as his ''Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)'' before manifestation is the same Brahman having the expanded (stūla) chit and achit entities as ''Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)'' after manifestation.

The essential feature is that the underlying entity is the same, the changes are in the description of that entity.

For e.g. ''Jack was a baby. Jack was a small kid. Jack was a middle-aged person. Jack was an old man. Jack is dead''

The body of a single personality named Jack is described as continuously changing. Jack does not become "James" because of the change.

==Ethics==

Souls and Matter are only the body of God. Creation is a real act of God. It is the expansion of intelligence. Matter is fundamentally real and undergoes real revelation. The Soul is a higher mode than Matter, because it is conscious. It is also eternally real and eternally distinct. Final release, that comes, by the Lord's [[divine grace|Grace]], after the death of the body is a Communion with God. This philosophy believes in liberation through one's [[Karma]]s (actions) in accordance with the Vedas, the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]] ([[caste]] or class) system and the four [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashramas]] (stages of life), along with intense devotion to Vishnu. Individual Souls retain their separate identities even after moksha. They live in Fellowship with God either serving Him or meditating on Him. The philosophy of this school is SriVaishnavism, a branch of [[Vaishnavism]].

==Interpretation of Mahāvākyas==
1. sarvam khalv idam brahma''' from [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 3.14.1

Translated literally, this means ''All this is Brahman''. The ontology of Vishishtadvaita system consists of:

a. Ishvara is ''Para-brahman'' with infinite superlative qualities, whose substantive nature imparts the existence to the modes

b. Jivas are ''chit-brahman'' or sentient beings (which possess consciousness). They are the modes of Brahman which show consciousness.

c. Jagat is ''achit-brahman'' or matter/Universe (which are non-conscious). They are the mode of Brahman which are not conscious.

Brahman is the composite whole of the triad consisting of Ishvara along with his modes i.e. Jivas and Jagat.

2. ayam ātmā brahma''' from [[Mandukya Upanishad]] 1.2

Translated literally, this means the ''Self is Brahman''.
From the earlier statement, it follows that on account of everything being Brahman, the self is not different from Brahman.

3. Tat tvam asi''' from [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 6.8.7

Translated literally, it means ''Thou art that''

''that'' here refers to ''Brahman'' and ''thou'' refers to ''jiva''

Rāmānujā chooses to take the position of universal identity. He interprets this passage to mean the subsistence of all attributes in a common underlying substratum. This is referred to as ''samānādhikaranya''. Thus Rāmānujā says the purport of the passage is to show the unity of all beings in a common base. Ishvara (''Parabrahman'') who is the Cosmic Spirit for the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings, is also  simultaneously the innermost self (Atmān) for each individual sentient being (Jīvā). All the bodies, the Cosmic and the individual, are held in an adjectival relationship (aprthak-siddhi) in the one Isvara.

Tat Tvam Asi declares that oneness of Isvara.

When multiple entities point to a single object, the relationship is established as one of substance and its attributes.

For e.g. in a statement:

''Jack is a tall and intelligent boy''

The descriptors ''tall-ness'',''intelligence'' and ''boy-ness'' all refer to a common underlying ''Jack''

Similarly, when the upanishads declare Brahman is the Universe, Purusha, Self, Prana, Vayu, and so on, the entities are attributes or modes of Brahman.

If the statement '''tat tvam asi''' is taken to mean as only ''the self is brahman'', then '''sarvam khalv idam brahma''' will not make sense.

===Understanding Neti-Neti===
{{Original research|date=April 2008}}
This is an upanishadic concept which is employed while attempting to know Brahman. The purport of this exercise is understood in many different ways and also influences the understanding of Brahman.
In the overall sense, this phrase is accepted to refer to the indescribable nature of Brahman who is beyond all rationalisations.

Taittiriya Upanishad 2-9-1 passage "yato vacho nivartanthe.."  (words recoil, mind can not grasp...) etc., state the same concept regarding Brahman .  The visishtadvaita interpretation is that these passages do not indicate  a black hole, but the incompleteness of any statement or thought or concept concerning Brahman.  Brahman is these and more. This interpretation is consistent with "sarvam kalvidam brahma".  Antaryami Brahmanam of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad passage "yasya prithvi sariram yasya atma sariram"  is also interpreted to show that Brahman is not a zero point - "nirvisesha chinmatra" (an entity which has nothing except existence)

The typical interpretation of Neti-Neti is ''not this, not this'' or ''neither this, nor that''. It is a phrase meant to convey the inexpressibility of Brahman in words and the futility of trying to approximate Brahman with conceptual models.In VisishtAdvaita, the phrase is taken in the sense of ''not just this, not just this'' or ''not just this, not just that''. This means that Brahman cannot be restricted to one specific or a few specific descriptions. Consequently, Brahman is understood to possess infinite qualities and each of these qualities are infinite in extent.

==Purpose of human existence==
The purpose or goal of human existence is called [[purushartha]]. According to the Vedas, there are four goals namely [[artha]] (wealth), [[kama]] (pleasure), [[dharma]] (righteousness) and [[moksha]] (permanent freedom from worldly bondage). According to this philosophy, the first three goals are not an end by themselves but need to be pursued with the ideal of attaining moksha.

===Moksha===
Moksha means liberation or release from [[samsara]], the cycle of rebirth.

===Bhakti as the means of attaining  moksha===
[[Bhakti Yoga]] is the sole means of liberation in Vishishtadvaita. Through [[Bhakti]] (devotion), a [[Jiva]] ascends to the realm of the Lord, where it continues to delight in His service. Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are natural outcomes of Bhakti, total surrender, as the devotee acquires the knowledge that the Lord is the inner self. A devotee realizes his own state as dependent on, and supported by, and being led by the Lord, who is the Master. One is to lead a life as an instrument of the Lord, offering all his [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word, and deed]] to the feet of the Lord. One is to see the Lord in everything and everything in Him. This is the unity in diversity achieved through devotion.&lt;ref&gt;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9014610686337442954&lt;/ref&gt;
However Sri [[Ramanuja]] and the Vishishtadvata tradition accept Saranagati, total surrender at the Lord's lotus feet alone as the sole means to moksha, liberation from samsara and going to Vaikuntha. This is a distinguishing feature of this school of philosophy, as both Adishankara's advaita and Anandatirtha's dvaita accept bhakthi for moksha. Swami Ramanuja has supported this opinion with various citations directly from the vedas, and various incidents highlighting sharangathi as means to moksha, over bhakthi. Observing total surrender at the Lord's feet guarantees moksha at the end of this birth, and in the time between sharanagathi and death, the surrendered soul may spend his time piously by involving in devotion. So bhakthi is not a moksha sadhana, but just for [[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]] in the Vishishtadvaita Sampradaya

== Thenkalai and Vadakalai schools of thought ==
The [[Vadakalai]]  sect of Sri Vaishnavism associate themselves with [[Vedanta Desikan]] and Ramanujacharya. Vedanta Desikan is one of the foremost learned scholars and philosophers of medieval India, who has written more than a hundred works in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Prakrit]] and [[Manipravalam|Manipravala]].  He is said to have been born as an incarnation of the divine bell of Lord [[Venkateswara|Venkateshwara]] of [[Tirupati]] and also of [[Ramanuja|Ramanujacharya]] in the month of [[Purattasi]] under the star [[Hindu calendar#Nakshatra|Thiruvonam (Sravana)]], in the year 1268 CE. All of his works are characterized by his versatility, irrefutable reasoning, logic, examination, deep spiritual insight, ethical fervour and excellent expressions of devotional emotion in delightful style. His [[Paduka-sahasram]] and ''Rahasyatrayasaram'' are some classic examples.  He was a great teacher, logician, expositor, debater, poet, philosopher, thinker and defender of the faith of Vaishnavism. "''Kavitaarkika Simham"'' (lion among poets and debaters), ''"Sarvatantra Svatantrar"'' (all-knowing and all-powerful), ''"Vedaantaachaarya"'' (the master and preceptor of the Vedanta) are some of the titles attributed to him.

[[Pillai Lokacharya]] literally meaning "Teacher for the whole world" is one of the leading lights on the Sri Vaishnava Vedanta philosophy. His work Sri Vachana Bhusanam is a classic and provides the essence of Upanishads. The [[Tenkalai]] sect of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] looks up to him apart from Swami Ramanuja and Swami Manavala Mamuni. He was a senior contemporary of Vedanta Desika. He is said to have been born as an ''amsa'' ("essence") of Kanchi Devaraja (Varadaraja) Perumal to document and immortalize Ramanuja's message in the month of [[Tamil months#Months|Aippaci]] under the star [[Hindu calendar#Nakshatra|Thiruvonam (Sravana)]], in the year 1205 CE.&lt;ref name="PQM 946"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandrankunnel|first=Matthew|title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|year=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|location=New Delhi|page=946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is said to have lived for 106 years, during which time, he also helped to safeguard the idol of [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Ranganatha]] at [[Srirangam]] from [[Muslim]] invaders.&lt;ref name="PQM 946" /&gt;  Pillai Lokacharya confirmed the basics of the Sri Vaishnava system in his 18 monumental works popularly known as ''Ashtadasa Rahasyangal'' ("the eighteen secrets") also called the [[Rahasya granthas]] ("doctrines that explain the inner meanings") out of which Sri Vachana Bhushanam and Mumukshuppadi are the most famous. [[Manavala Mamuni]] expanded on and popularized Lokacharya's teachings arguments in Tamil.

==Traditions following Vishishtadvaita==
* [[Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya]] of south India.
* [[Ramanandi Sampradaya|Sri Ramanandi Sect]] of Northern India, it has the largest monastic order in whole India.
* [[Sri Swaminarayan Sampraday]] of Gujarat.
* Dāmodariya Vaiśņava sampraday of Assam.

=== Visishtadvaita and Sri Vaishnavism ===

The Absolute Supreme Reality referred to as Brahman, is a Transcendent Personality. He is Narayana, also known as Lord Vishnu.

''A man who has discrimination for his charioteer and holds the reins of the mind firmly, reaches the end of the road; and that is the supreme position of Vishnu.'' - 1.3.9 [[Katha Upanishad]]

''Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects is the mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the intellect, the Great Atman; beyond the Great Atman, the Unmanifest; beyond the Unmanifest, the Purusha. Beyond the Purusha there is nothing: this is the end, the Supreme Goal.''- 1.3.10,11 [[Katha Upanishad]]

In terms of theology, Ramanujacharya puts forth the view that both the Supreme Goddess Lakshmi and Supreme God Narayana together constitute Brahman - the Absolute. Sri Lakshmi is the female personification of Brahman and Narayana is the male personification of Brahman, but they are both inseparable, co-eternal, co-absolute and are always substantially one. Thus, in reference to these dual aspects of Brahman, the Supreme is referred to in the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya as Sriman Narayana.

==Conclusion==
Narayana is the Absolute God. The Soul and the Universe are only parts of this Absolute and hence, Vishishtadvaita is the solution to [[panentheistic]] and [[pantheistic]] ideologies. The relationship of God to the Soul and the Universe is like the relationship of the Soul of Man to the body of Man. Individual souls are only parts of Brahman. God, Soul and Universe together form an inseparable unity which is one and has no second.  This is the non-duality part. Matter and Souls inhere in that Ultimate Reality as attributes to a substance [needs to improvisation]. This is the qualification part of the non-duality.

'''Vladimír Čermák''' (September 3, 1929 – July 21, 2004) was Czech [[philosopher]], [[political scientist]], [[lawyer]] and [[judge]]. 

He is author of the [[pentalogy]] called ''The Question of Democracy'' (''Otázka demokracie''), which was very likely the most systematic work on [[democracy]] from the perspective of [[political theory]] during the period of the [[Communist state|communist regime]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The pentalogy was finished in 1988 but it could be published after the end of the communist regime. The titles of five volumes are: “Democracy and Totalitarianism”, “Man”, “Society and State”, “Values, Norms and Institutions” and “Functions of Democracy”. The pentalogy was not reflected enough by politologists in the Czech republic and abroad yet.

In 1993–2003 Čermák served as a judge of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]].

'''''Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma''''' is a [[self-help book]] by American therapist Peter A. Levine and Ann Frederick published in [[1997 in literature|1997]]. It presents a [[somatic experiencing]] approach which it says helps people who are struggling with [[psychological trauma]]. The book discusses inhibition and release of a form of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]" that was poorly defined.

== Synopsis ==
''Waking the Tiger'' contains four sections: Section I: The Body as Healer; Section II: Symptoms of Trauma; Section III: Transformation and Renegotiation; and Section IV: First Aid for Trauma. Peter Levine argues in the book that it is through action instead of talking that people can assist others who are struggling with [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="Marzillier2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marzillier |first=John |date=May 2011 |authorlink=John Marzillier |title=Book reviews |url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-5/book-reviews |publisher=[[British Psychological Society]] |accessdate=2017-05-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qWOaj0rP?url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-5/book-reviews |archivedate=2017-05-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He presents the [[somatic experiencing]] approach.&lt;ref name="Marzillier2011"/&gt;

Levine received a doctorate in [[medical biophysics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and has an independent [[psychology]] doctorate.&lt;ref name="Newton1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newton |first=Ruth P. |date=March 1998 |title=Book Reviews: Waking the Tiger, Healing Trauma |url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Citation/1998/03000/Waking_the_Tiger,_Healing_Trauma.22.aspx |journal=[[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |page=233 |accessdate=2017-05-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qrZ5Ylxj?url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Citation/1998/03000/Waking_the_Tiger,_Healing_Trauma.22.aspx |archivedate=2017-05-31 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 Levine encountered a graduate student, Nancy, who experienced brutalizing [[panic attack]]s, unexplainable in her view. Levine started their discussion with a typical [[relaxation technique]]. While Nancy was silently paying attention in her seat, she failed to react. When he continued attempting to get her to relax, she unexpectedly had a massive panic attack. Levine says he became immersed in her panic attack. In his mind, he suddenly saw a tiger stopped low and preparing to jump at them. Immersed in the nightmare, he ordered, "Nancy! You are being attacked by a large tiger! See the tiger as it comes toward you! Run toward that tree! Run, Nancy, run! Climb up! Escape!"&lt;ref name="Blakeslee2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blakeslee |first1=Sandra |authorlink1=Sandra Blakeslee |last2=Blakeslee |first2=Matthew |date=2008 |title=The Body Has a Mind of Its Own: How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do (Almost) Everything Better |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TrSg8jxzcQC&amp;pg=PA47 |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |pages=47–48 |isbn=1588368122 |accessdate=2017-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine said Nancy's legs began moving as if she was sprinting. Nancy said that, for her first time, she had remembered a scary childhood experience. When she was three years old she experienced a [[tonsillectomy]] during which she was secured to an [[operating table]] to prevent movement. The [[anesthesia]] could have been only partially working which caused her to feel like she was being strangled. Her experience was drilled into her and could not just be remembered while she was alert. While counseling Nancy, Levine at the time also was researching [[predation]], which [[Sandra Blakeslee]] and Matthew Blakeslee noted could be the reason Levine pictured a tiger.&lt;ref name="Blakeslee2008"/&gt; Experts generally have not found evidence to support Levine's findings; he found that for prey that have completely lost the ability to move, "the sudden immobility of a highly charged nervous system compresses energy that is then 'stored' in the nervous system if not released".&lt;ref name="Newton1998"/&gt;

When prey are able to avoid predators, however, prey will sprint away and "literally shake off the residual effects of the immobility response" while "their bodies convulse with paroxysmal spasms".&lt;ref name="Blakeslee2008"/&gt; There is no evidence for Levine's conclusions about the prey's responses or Nancy's response to their session. Observing Nancy, Levine concluded that her convulsions were an "instinctive and long-overdue response" to her being strapped down and scared when a child. He concluded without evidence that Nancy's panic attacks were caused by the "frozen residue of 'energy'" that remained stuck in her, not from the traumatic experience.&lt;ref name="Blakeslee2008"/&gt; Levine argues that humans cannot effortlessly release energy from a traumatic memory because human's [[triune brain]] structure which, shaped by feelings and acumen, frequently supersedes instinct.&lt;ref name="Newton1998"/&gt; He said that Nancy stopped experiencing panic attacks after she had additional sessions with him that involved more convulsions".&lt;ref name="Blakeslee2008"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Ruth P. Newton, a professor at the [[University of California, San Diego]], wrote a mixed review of the book in the journal ''[[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]]''. She found the [[case method#Case materials|case materials]] to be "interesting" because readers can observe how Levine "uses his theory to guide his clinical work". But Newton found that "the theory and case material are entangled by a self-help format that weakens his presentation and jeopardizes the overall organization of the book". She concluded that "the book is more appropriately used by professionals rather than directly by patients or clients".&lt;ref name="Newton1998"/&gt; Newton strongly criticized the book's self-help therapy activities that improperly claim to help readers to overcome their frightening experiences, writing, "I shudder to imagine a patient or client who is drawn to self-help books that will ''heal'' secret traumas alone in his or her living room with an exercise that asks them to '… pretend you are in an airplane flying at 30,000 feet… [when] you suddenly hear a loud explosion…followed by complete silence'."&lt;ref name="Newton1998"/&gt;

[[John Marzillier]] for [[British Psychological Society]] wrote that "The psychologist Peter Levine is a major figure in the trauma field. His earlier book, Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma (North Atlantic Books, 1997), aimed at a general readership, was very successful."&lt;ref name="Marzillier2011"/&gt; Marzillier found that in ''Waking the Tiger'', the "notion of 'energy' was relatively undeveloped, a weakness in his model".&lt;ref name="Marzillier2011"/&gt; In ''[[Psychology Today]]'', Cheryl Eckl called ''Waking the Tiger'' a "seminal book" in which Levine tells readers "we can learn much about trauma from observing animals in the wild".&lt;ref name="Eckl2011-08-27"&gt;{{cite news |last=Eckl |first=Cheryl |date=2011-08-27 |title=Heal the Trauma, Then the Grief |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-grief/201108/heal-the-trauma-then-the-grief |newspaper=[[Psychology Today]] |accessdate=2017-05-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qWQDaFpz?url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-grief/201108/heal-the-trauma-then-the-grief |archivedate=2017-05-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Dubislav''' (20 September 1895 – 17 September 1937) was a German [[logician]] and [[philosopher of science]] (''Wissenschaftstheoretiker'').

==Biography==
After studying [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], Dubislav attained a [[doctorate]] in 1922 with "Contributions to the theories of definition and proof within mathematical logic" (''Beiträge zur Lehre von der Definition und vom Beweis vom Standpunkt der mathematischen Logik aus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=20689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 he became a private lecturer in [[philosophy of mathematics]] and the [[natural sciences]] at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] and from 1931 was ''Professor Extraordinarius'' (''außerordentlicher Professor, ao. Prof.''). In 1936 he [[emigrated]] to Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|4|145|145|Dubislav, Walter Ernst Otto|Menne, Albert|116229853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was joint founder (with [[Hans Reichenbach]] and [[Kurt Grelling]]) of the [[Berlin Circle|'Berlin Society for Empirical (''later: Scientific'') Philosophy']] (''Berliner Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie''), which, along with the [[Vienna Circle]], is one of the points of origin of [[logical empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members of the Berlin Circle were listed as sympathisers within the Vienna Circle.

Dubislav focused on a [[logical]] and [[mechanistic]] foundation of mathematics and physics, influenced by [[Bernard Bolzano]]'s "Theory of Science" (''Wissenschaftslehre''). He presented a formalised account of [[Gottlob Frege]]'s theory of definitions.

'''William Derham''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (26 November 1657 – 5 April 1735)&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Smolenaars, Marja. ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7528 Derham, William (1657–1735)]’, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. Accessed 26 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was an English clergyman, [[natural theology|natural theologian]], [[natural philosopher]] and [[scientist]]. He produced the earliest, reasonably accurate estimate of the [[speed of sound]].

==Life==
William Derham was the son of Thomas Derham. He was born at Stoulton, in [[Worcestershire]], England. He was educated at [[Blockley]], [[Gloucestershire]] and at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] from 1675 to 1679.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; He was ordained on 29 May 1681. In 1682, he became [[vicar]] of [[Wargrave]], [[Berkshire]] and from 1689 to 1735 he was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|Rector]] at [[Upminster]], [[Essex]]. While at Upminster, in 1716 he became a [[Canon of Windsor]] and the vestry minutes show that thereafter he divided his time between those two places.  The parish registers of Upminster record his burial at St. Laurence's in 1735.  However, the precise site of his grave is unknown and, in accordance with his wishes, there is no memorial to him in the church.&lt;ref name="Tony Fox"&gt;{{cite book | title=Essex Journal | author=Fox, Tony | pages=12–16 | year=2003 | publisher=Essex Arch &amp; Hist Soc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Title page of Physico-Theology by William Derham 1713 (this ed 1723).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Title page of 1723 edition of Derham's ''Physico-Theology'']]

In 1696, he published his ''Artificial Clockmaker'', which went through several editions. The best known of his subsequent works are ''Physico-Theology'', published in 1713; ''Astro-Theology'', 1714; and ''Christo-Theology'', 1730. All three of these books are [[teleology|teleological]] arguments for the being and attributes of [[God]], and were used by [[William Paley]] nearly a century later.  However, these books also include quantities of original scientific observations.  For example, ''Physico-Theology'' contains his recognition of natural variation within species and that he knew that ''Didelphis virginialis'' (the [[Virginia opossum]]) was the only marsupial in [[North America]]. It also includes one of the earliest theoretical descriptions of a [[marine chronometer]], accompanied by a discussion of the use of vacuum seals to reduce inaccuracies in the operation of timepieces. He is the first person known to have used the word ''chronometer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Koberer | first =Wolfgang | title =Notes: On the First Use of the Term "Chronometer"= | journal =The Mariner's Mirror | volume =102 | issue =2 | pages =203–205 | publisher =Society for Nautical Research | location =United Kingdom | date =May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, ''Astro-Theology'' includes several newly identified [[nebula]]e (this was the name used at the time for all extended astronomical objects: some of his nebulae are what we would now call  [[star cluster]]s).  His 16-feet long telescope (also used when measuring the velocity of sound) was at the top of the tower of St Laurence's Church, where the necessary doors are still in place.&lt;ref name="Tony Fox"/&gt;

On 3 February 1703, Derham was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]]. He was [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]] in 1711–1712. His last known work, entitled ''A Defence of the Church's Right in Leasehold Estates'', appeared as early as 1731.

But besides the works published in his own name, Derham contributed a variety of papers to the ''Transactions of the Royal Society''. He revised the ''Miscellanea Curiosa''. He edited the correspondence and wrote a biography of [[John Ray]], whose 'physico-theology' ([[natural theology]]) tradition he continued, making him an early [[parson-naturalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gilbert White. A biography of the author of The Natural History of Selborne | publisher=Century Hutchinson | year=1986 | author=Mabey, Richard | authorlink=Richard Mabey | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He edited [[Eleazar Albin]]'s ''Natural History'', and published some of the manuscripts of the scientist [[Robert Hooke]]. His meteorological observations at [[Upminster]] (in the ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society]]'') are amongst the earliest series in England.

===Speed of sound===

In 1709 Derham published a more accurate measure of the speed of sound, at 1,072 [[Paris inch|Parisian feet]] per second.&lt;ref name=meridian&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derham used a telescope from the tower of the [[church of St Laurence, Upminster]] to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including [[North Ockendon]] church. The distance was known by [[triangulation]], and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.&lt;ref name="Tony Fox"/&gt;

Zubiri was a member of the School of Madrid, composed by philosophers [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Julián Marías]] and [[Pedro Laín Entralgo]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=La evolución de la escuela de Madrid (1939-1978): Zubiri, Marías y Laín Entralgo|curly=|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/centros/cont/descargas/documento34341.pdf|work=José Luis Cañas Fernández|year=2012|accessdate=2013-10-15|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubiri's philosophy has been categorized as a "materialist open realism",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Voluntad de Liberacion|curly=|url=http://www.uca.edu.sv/filosofia/admin/files/1203712190.pdf|work=Hector Samour|year=2003|accessdate=2013-10-15|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "attempted to reformulate classical metaphysics, in a language that was entirely compatible with modern science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=La filosofía natural de Zubiri|curly=|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/10144/1/La%20filosof%C3%ADa%20natural%20de%20Zubiri.pdf|work=José Luis González Quirós|year=1997|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to Xavier Zubiri's educational background. Zubiri first received a philosophical and theological formation in [[Madrid]] and [[Rome]]. Later, he deepend his studies in philosophy through his graduate studies in [[Leuven|Louvain]], writing his dissertation on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Le problème de l'objectivité d'après Ed. Husserl|curly=|url=https://services.libis.be/query?query=sys:LBS01000334602&amp;view=KULeuven&amp;institution=KUL&amp;builder=primo_opensearch&amp;host=limo.libis.be|work=Xavier Zubiri|date=1921–1922|accessdate=2013-10-15|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Zubiri's critical interest in this current of thought took him to [[Freiburg]], when he already was a professor in Madrid. There, he studied with [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. In 1930, Zubiri moved to [[Berlin]], where he studied [[physics]], [[philology]] and [[biology]]. There, he was hosted in [[Harnack House]], which enabled Zubiri to socialize with important minds of this great period of academic activity in the [[Weimar republic]]. For example, [[Albert Einstein]] (whom Zubiri had already met in Madrid, at Universidad Central, in 1923),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Conología del viaje de Einstein a España|curly=|url=http://quark.prbb.org/36/036054.pdf|work=Quark, Ciencia, Medicina, Comunicación y Cultura. Publicación del Observatorio de Comunicación Científica de la Universitat Pomeu Fabra|date=May–August 2005|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Planck]], [[Werner Jaeger]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], among others. 

When [[Spanish civil war|civil war]] broke out in Spain in 1936, Zubiri moved to Paris. There, he continued having an intensive intellectual life, attending courses with [[Louis de Broglie]], [[Frédéric Joliot]], [[Irène Curie]], [[Elie Joseph Cartan]] and [[Emile Benveniste]], among others. In 1939, just before France declared war to Germany, Zubiri returned to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Xavier Zubiri: La soledad sonora|curly=|url=http://www.editorialtaurus.com/uploads/ficheros/libro/primeras-paginas/200603/primeras-paginas-xavier-zubiri.pdf|work=Jordi Corominas and Joan Vicens|year=2006|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Biografía de Xavier Zubiri|curly=|url=https://sites.google.com/site/corominasescude/Home/escrits-i-publicacions/presentacion/biografia-de-xavier-zubiri|work=Jordi Corominas and Joan Vicens|year=2006|accessdate=2013-10-19|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubiri's philosophy is little known outside of [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]], mostly because Zubiri was compelled to resign from formal academic positions in [[Spain]], in 1942. This had to do with the lack of academic freedoms in [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Zubiri, vasco universal|curly=|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1980/10/10/opinion/339980408_850215.html|work=Ignacio Ellacuría|date=1980-10-10|accessdate=2013-10-19|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was possible for Zubiri to continue his work as an [[academic]], through the sponsorship of family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Xavier Zubiri: La soledad sonora|curly=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aUQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Xavier+Zubiri:+La+Soledad+Sonora&amp;dq=Xavier+Zubiri:+La+Soledad+Sonora&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=av1gUpa3OJGQ4ASu7oDQAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA|work=Jordi Corominas and Joan Vicens|year=2006|accessdate=2013-10-15|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zubiri was a prolific author in the Spanish magazines ''[[Cruz y Raya]]'' (led by [[José Bergamín]])  and ''[[Revista de Occidente]]'' (led by [[José Ortega y Gasset]]) under the [[second Spanish republic]]. However, after his resignation from Spanish universities, Zubiri did not publish much in established [[peer reviewed]] journals. Nonetheless, he did publish a series of books and research articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Xavier Zubiri: La soledad sonora, Chapter 14, 15 and 39 on "La República" (The Republic) (pp. 245-265), "Cruz y Raya" (the magazine) (pp. 265 - 287) and "El duro oficio de escribir" (The hard task of writing) (pp. 589-606), respectively|curly=|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Xavier_Zubiri.html?id=1aUQAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|work=Jordi Corominas and Joan Vicens|year=2006|accessdate=2014-12-12|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubiri's work was initially not well received by established academic environments in Spain. This was mostly explained by the political context under Franco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Zubiri tras el problema de toma de posición tras el comienzo de la guerra civil |curly= |url=http://www.javier.org.es/archivos/enlaces/_private/trabajos/exiliozubiri1.htm |work=Javier Borrego Gutierrez |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-10-18 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022164339/http://www.javier.org.es/archivos/enlaces/_private/trabajos/exiliozubiri1.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Zubiri's relationship to scholars like [[Ignacio Ellacuría]] made Zubiri's work widely known in Latin America, where Zubiri's thought has been further developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Actualidad de Zubiri en América Latina|curly=|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2293976|work=Germán Marquínez Argote|year=2006|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recently, Spanish academics have begun to recognize the importance of Zubiri's life and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Amigos y discípulos de Zubiri reivindican su gigantesca talla intelectual en su centenario|curly=|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1998/12/02/cultura/912553204_850215.html|work=El País|date=1998-12-02|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Zubiri, hombre, filósofo y fenomenólogo|curly=|url=http://www.uned.es/dpto_fim/InvFen/InvFen05/pdf/07_SAN_MARTIN.pdf|work=Javier San Martin|year=2006|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the same reasons outlined above, Zubiri's contact with the formal academic environments of the English speaking world was limited. There is all but one recorded visit by Zubiri to the [[United States]], specifically [[Princeton University]], on October 2, 1946. In Princeton, Zubiri lectured in French on "The real and mathematics- A philosophical problem" ("Le reel et les mathematiques—Un probleme de philosophie").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Daily Princetonian, Volume 70, Number 105, 2 October 1946|curly=|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19461002-01.2.18&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-zubiri----#|work=Official Notices|date=1946-10-02|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Zubiri's work has been translated to English: "On Essence" (Caponigri, 1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=On Essence|curly=|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Essence.html?id=VZ3WAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|work=Xavier Zubiri, translated by A.

In 1979, the German government awarded Zubiri and Laín Entralgo the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]. Zubiri was awarded this distinction for his work in his books "Nature, History, God" (1954) and "On Essence" (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=El Gobierno alemán condecora a Zubiri y a Laín|curly=|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1979/12/04/cultura/313110004_850215.html|date=1979-12-04|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubiri's work has also been translated to [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Traducciones de las obras de Zubiri a otros idiomas|curly=|url=http://www.zubiri.net/idiomas.html|work=Funación Xavier Zubiri|accessdate=2013-10-18|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Zenkei Shibayama'''|柴山 全慶|Shibayama Zenkei|1894 - 1974}}, a former Abbot of [[Nanzen-ji]], was a [[Japan]]ese [[Rinzai]] master well known for his commentary on the [[Mumonkan]]. One of his better-known students was [[Keido Fukushima]], abbot of [[Tōfuku-ji]]. Shibayama also taught at [[Otani University]] and was the head abbot of the entire Nanzenji Organization, overseeing the administration of over five hundred temples.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loori, 344&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to a number of lecture tours he undertook to the United States in the 1960s, and the translation of several of his books into English, Shibayama was a significant contributor to the establishment of Zen in America.

'''Zentatsu Richard Baker''' (born March 30, 1936), born '''Richard Dudley Baker''', is an [[United States|American]] [[Soto Zen]] master (or [[Rōshi|roshi]]), the founder and guiding teacher of Dharma Sangha—which consists of Crestone Mountain Zen Center located in [[Crestone, Colorado]] and the Buddhistisches Studienzentrum&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, Arnold. '' Engaged Buddhist Reader''. p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; (Johanneshof) in [[Germany]]'s [[Black Forest]].&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; As the American [[Dharma heir]] to [[Shunryu Suzuki]], Baker assumed abbottship of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (SFZC) shortly before Suzuki's death in 1971. He remained abbot there until 1984, the year he resigned his position after it was disclosed in the previous year that he and the wife of one of SFZC's benefactors had been having an ongoing affair. Despite the controversy connected with his resignation, Baker was instrumental in helping the San Francisco Zen Center to become one of the most successful Zen institutions in the [[United States]].

==Early life and practice==
Richard Baker was born in [[Biddeford, Maine|Biddeford]], [[Maine]] on March 30, 1936. Because his family moved around frequently, he lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[Indiana]], and [[Pittsburgh]] growing up. A descendant of [[Thomas Dudley]],&lt;ref name="tworkov"&gt;Tworkov, Helen. ''Zen in America: Profiles of Five Teachers''. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was raised in a family of moderate wealth. He attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied [[architecture]] and [[history]]. He then arrived in [[San Francisco, California]] in 1960—beginning to sit with [[Shunryu Suzuki]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;Schneider, Sugata. ''The Long Learning Curve: An Interview With Richard Baker Roshi''&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was ordained a [[Sōtō]] priest by Suzuki in 1966 just before the opening of [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]].&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;Prebish, Charles S. ''Luminous Passage''. pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was instrumental in orchestrating the acquisition of Tassajara, raising $150,000 for the purchase in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, James Ishmael. ''Zen Master Who?''. pp. 124–128&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 to 1971, he traveled to [[Japan]] to practice at the primary [[Sōtō]] monasteries there, including [[Antaiji]], [[Eiheiji]], and [[Daitoku-ji|Daitokuji]].&lt;ref name="Richard Baker-roshi"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Richard Baker-roshi| work =| publisher =Crestone Mountain Zen Center| url =http://www.dharmasangha.org/teachers.html| doi =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080305085432/http://www.dharmasangha.org/teachers.html| archivedate =2008-03-05| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Francisco Zen Center==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|left|[[San Francisco Zen Center]]'s Page St. location]]
Baker received [[Dharma transmission]] from Suzuki in 1970,&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; and then was installed as abbot of [[San Francisco Zen Center]] during the "Mountain Seat Ceremony" on November 21, 1971.&lt;ref name="prebish" /&gt; Baker also penned the introduction to Suzuki's famous book, ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Azara, Nancy J. '' Spirit Taking Form''. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Within a very short period of time Baker broadened the scope of SFZC, starting first with the acquisition of [[Green Gulch Farm]] in southern Marin county, in 1972.&lt;ref name="prebish" /&gt; 

San Francisco Zen Center expanded quickly with Baker at the helm. In fifteen years, the Center's annual budget increased from $6,000, to $4 million. It acquired property worth around $20 million and built up a network of affiliated businesses staffed by Zen Center students, which included the vegetarian [[Greens Restaurant]] in [[Fort Mason]], a bakery, and a grocery store.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;Coleman, James William. ''The New Buddhism'' pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;  In the midst of the growth, Baker became a popular public figure. Although his salary was reportedly modest, he lived a lifestyle which many perceived as extravagant.  With so many students and so much public attention, some felt Baker became less available to the members of the community.  All of this discontent emerged when it was made public that Baker had allegedly been having an affair with the wife of an influential sangha member.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt;

==Resignation==

Although Baker claimed that his relationship with the woman was a love-affair which had not yet been consummated, the outcry surrounding the incident led to a series of accusations of impropriety on Baker's part, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot.&lt;ref name="david schneider 138"&gt;Schneider, David. ''Street Zen'' pp.138–140&lt;/ref&gt; The community's sense of crisis sharpened when the woman's husband, one of SFZC's primary benefactors, threatened to hold the organization legally responsible for its abbot's apparent misconduct.&lt;ref name="crews"&gt;Crews, Frederick C. ''Follies of the Wise'' pp. 283–284&lt;/ref&gt;

These revelations led to community-wide pandemonium, and in 1984 Baker was forced to resign as abbot.&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; However, San Francisco Zen Center's website now comments: "Although the circumstances leading to his resignation as abbot in 1984 were difficult and complex, in recent years, there has been increased contact; a renewal of friendship and dharma relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Lineage| work =| publisher =[[San Francisco Zen Center]]| url =http://www.sfzc.org/zc/display.asp?catid=1,5&amp;pageid=426| format =| doi =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; And Baker, for his part, is quoted as having said in a 1994 interview with Sugata Schneider:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

I don't think that the gossipy or official versions of what happened are right, but I feel definitely that if I were back in the situation again as the person I am now, it wouldn't have happened.  Which means it's basically my fault.  I had a kind of insecurity and self-importance, which I didn't see for a long time, that was a bad dynamic in the community.&lt;ref name="schneider" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1983 [[Tenshin Reb Anderson]] received [[shiho]] (Dharma Transmission) from Richard Baker. Anderson succeeded him as abbot, and later co-abbot.&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt;

In the late-1980s Baker also gave shiho to [[Issan Dorsey]], whom he had ordained as a priest in 1975.  Dorsey went on to serve as abbot of the [[Hartford Street Zen Center]] in San Francisco, where he worked to develop hospice care for AIDS patients.&lt;ref name="david schneider 113"&gt;Schneider, David. ''Street Zen'' pp. 113, 162, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharma Sangha==
Following his departure from the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] in 1984, Baker relocated to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] where he founded a new community known as Dharma Sangha.&lt;ref name="prebish" /&gt; One student who followed him to his new community was the priest [[Philip Whalen]] (ordained by Baker as a priest in 1973), who became tanto (head monk) of the new center. In July 1987 Baker gave [[Dharma transmission]] to Whalen; Whalen later became abbot of the [[Hartford Street Zen Center]] (following the tenure of [[Issan Dorsey]]) in the [[Castro district]] of [[San Francisco]]. After the founding of Dharma Sangha in New Mexico, Baker met with William Irwin Thompson, the founder of the Lindisfarne Association. At a meeting of the Board of Directors of Lindisfarne at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, Thompson convinced the board to donate the campus that he had established--with its passive solar Lindisfarne Fellows House, Founder's House, and Lindisfarne Chapel--to Baker-roshi's Dharma Sangha.  Baker then moved to [[Crestone, Colorado]] and [[Germany]] to found other practice sites for Dharma Sangha. Baker also gives seminars at Boulder Zen Center in [[Boulder, Colorado]] twice each year, typically on the last weekends of January and April.&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prebish" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =2008 Seminar Dates| work =| publisher =Boulder Zen Center| url =http://www.boulderzen.org/#instruction| format =| doi =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A once controversial figure, Richard Baker was publicly criticized for his behavior at San Francisco Zen Center. Former students have said that he was addicted to power, abusive of his position, extravagant in his personal spending, and inappropriate in his love life.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Sandy. ''Turning the Wheel''. p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twenty-five years since leaving San Francisco Zen Center, Baker has continued his career as a Zen teacher, founding and developing two practice centers.&lt;ref name="Richard Baker-roshi" /&gt; [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] wrote of Baker, "To me, he embodies very much the future of Buddhism in the West with his creative intelligence and his aliveness."&lt;ref name="david schneider 145"&gt;Schneider, David. ''Street Zen'' pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
On September 25, 1999, Baker married Her Grand Ducal Highness Princess Marie Louise Elisabeth Mathilde Theodora Cecilie Sarah Charlotte of Baden, daughter of [[Maximilian, Margrave of Baden]] and wife [[Archduchess Valerie of Austria]]. Princess Marie Louise is grandniece of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and first cousin once removed of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. They have a daughter, Sophia Baker, born on March 1, 2001, in [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]], Colorado.  He has two daughters, Sally and Elizabeth, from a prior marriage to Virginia Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/fashion/weddings/31vows.html | work=The New York Times | first=Carol | last=Pogash | title=Jason Kibbey and Elizabeth Baker | date=July 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
