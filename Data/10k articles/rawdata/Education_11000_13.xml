'''''Academic Matters: The Journal of Higher Education''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[magazine]] which publishes articles on issues of relevance to [[postsecondary education]] in Canada and internationally, as well as [[literature]] and [[film review]]s, original [[fiction]], [[research]] notes and [[Criticism|commentaries]]. The magazine's mandate is to be a forum for original, thoughtful and engaging discussion of current trends in higher education and consideration of academe's future direction.

==History==

''Academic Matters'' was launched in November 2005 to fill a critical need in the Canadian [[News media|media]] coverage of [[university|universities]]. The idea for the magazine came from the recognition that while universities are influential in many ways, there was no independent Canadian journal that examined university issues in a serious but accessible and visually engaging manner for both academics and the general public.

Published by the [[Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations]], ''Academic Matters'' has a circulation of 17,000 readers, including [[professor]]s, academic [[librarian]]s and others interested in higher education issues across Canada. The magazine's editorial board consists of highly regarded academics and journalists who have worked at ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [[Canadian Broadcasting Centre]], [[National Film Board of Canada]], and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

A bi-annual publication, the thematic issues of ''Academic Matters'' have included the education "arms race" and public perceptions of higher education; "[[Generation Next]]"&amp;nbsp;– the new wave of faculty now entering universities; threats to [[academic freedom]] in Canada, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]; the impact of [[technology]] on universities; and diversity and equity on university campuses.

Articles in ''Academic Matters'' have been picked up by media in both the United States and Canada, including ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', ''The Globe and Mail'', ''[[National Post]],'' and ''[[Toronto Star]]''.

==Contributors==

Academics, journalists and novelists who have contributed to ''Academic Matters'' include [[Michael Ignatieff]], [[Carl Wieman]], [[Camilla Gibb]], [[David Foot (economist)|David Foot]], [[George Elliott Clarke]], [[Richard Lipsey]], [[Lee Gowan]], [[Kim Echlin]], [[Eric Wright (writer)|Eric Wright]], [[Judy Rebick]], [[David Suzuki]], and [[Mark Kingwell]].

[[Slovenia]] inherited the [[academic grading]] system of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. A five-point [[grading scale]] is used in [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s:

*5: excellent (''odlično'', best possible grade; usually 90%+)
*4: very good (''prav dobro'', usually 80%+)
*3: good (''dobro'', usually 65%+)
*2: sufficient (''zadostno'', lowest passing grade; usually 50%+)
*1: insufficient (''nezadostno'', lowest possible grade; failing)

Many teachers use minus and plus symbols as grade modifiers. For example, "−5" denotes a grade slightly lower than "excellent", while "+4" denotes a grade slightly higher than "very good". Half-grades such as "4/5" are also used. However, these modifiers are unofficial and do not appear in final [[Report card|grade reports]].

In [[Universities in Slovenia|universities]], a six-level grading scale is used:

*10 - excellent (best possible grade)
*9 - very good
*8 - very good
*7 - good
*6 - sufficient (lowest passing grade)
*5 or less (failing grades)

'''Alberto Massavanhane''' ( {{birth date|1930|02|09|df=y}} – {{death date|1993|09|29|df=y}}) was a [[List of Mozambicans|Mozambican]] diplomat, teacher, and the first [[Mayor]] of [[Maputo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vidas, Lugares e Tempos|last=Chissano|first=Joaquim|publisher=Texto Editores, Lda|year=2010|isbn=9789724745121|location=Alfragide - Portugal|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the signing of [[Lusaka Accord]], in 1974, Massavanhane was nominated by [[FRELIMO|Frelimo]] as Mayor of [[Lourenço Marques, Mozambique|Lourenço Marques]] during the transition government,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2010/0406/fsl/fsl_hardtimes.html|title=Easum {{!}} Hard Times for the Africa Bureau 1974-1976|website=www.unc.edu|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first Mozambican to be President of the Executive Council of Maputo after [[Mozambican War of Independence|Independence of Mozambique]] in 1975. In 1983 Alberto Massavanhane was again called to be the head of Maputo local government, before being designated as Ambassador of Mozambique in the [[Sweden|Kingdom of Sweden]] from 1988 until his death in 1993.

== Early years ==
Alberto was born in [[Xai-Xai]] in February 9, 1930, district capital of [[Gaza Province|Gaza]], being the youngest of the three sons of Massavanhane Nhancume and his wife Chonipane, a family of small farmers and shepherds. By the age of 13 he went to live to [[Lourenço Marques]], taking up his education in the [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian Mission]] of Magude. By the age of 20 in the same Magude Mission, he contacted religious marriage with Rosa Paulo Chadraca.

== Political Activities and Career ==
Subversive to the Portuguese colonialist regime, Alberto was the teacher of future Mozambican Prime-Minister and President [[Joaquim Chissano]]. Both locally, as a Mozambican teacher, and internationally as an African head of local government he always continued to have a role in the fight against colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=psimg.jstor.org/fsi/img/pdf/t0/10.5555/puun1976003vol2.pdf|url=http://psimg.jstor.org/fsi/img/pdf/t0/10.5555/puun1976003vol2.pdf|doi=10.5555/puun1976003vol2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mozambique's Independence Massavanhane became the first black, Mozambican, Mayor of Maputo serving two terms, the first from 1974 (before the Declaration of Independence) until 1980, and the second term from 1983 to 1988.

During his second term he developed several actions concerting Maputo with international institutions and strategies. In 1985 he was very involved in fighting the malaria epidemics in Maputo, alongside other African nations and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=US Government Publications|first=FBSI|date=1985|title=Epidemiology - Worldwide Report|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a360353.pdf|journal=JPRS|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1985, along with Lisbon's Mayor Nuno Kruz Abecassis, Massavanhane had a pivotal role in the constitution of UCCLA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uccla.pt/pessoas/nuno-kruz-abecasis|title=Nuno Kruz Abecasis {{!}} UCCLA|website=www.uccla.pt|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (União das Cidades Capitais Luso-Afro-Américo-Asiáticas) the precursor of [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|CPLP]].

In 1988 Alberto Massavanhane was designated plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Republic of Mozambique to the Kingdom of Sweden, with embassy in Stockholm.

'''Allan M. Campbell''' (April 27, 1929 – April 19, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.stanford.edu/2018/05/01/stanford-microbiologist-allan-campbell-dies-88/ Stanford microbiologist Allan Campbell dies at 88]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American microbiologist and [[geneticist]] whose pioneering work on [[Lambda phage]] has helped advance [[molecular biology]] in the late 20th century.

Dr. Campbell has been a professor of in the Department of Biology at Stanford University since 1968, and he was appointed to the Barbara Kimball Browning endowed chair in 1992.
Campbell earned his bachelor's degree at the University of California-Berkeley and master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Illinois. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Dr. Campbell received the 2004 Abbott-ASM Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[American Society for Microbiology]] at the society's 104th general meeting in New Orleans on Monday, May 24, 2004.  Campbell delivered the Abbott-ASM Award Lecture  and was honored at a dinner ceremony that evening. The award includes a $20,000 cash prize and a commemorative piece.

In honoring Campbell, ASM officials cited his "exceptional insights and achievements in the field of molecular genetics - a career of groundbreaking research that has had a profound influence on several fields, including molecular cloning and gene therapy."

Dr. Campbell's research has concentrated on the genetics of bacteria and their viruses, especially the integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes.

His most prominent discovery was the proposal of the “Campbell model” of virus insertion, where viral DNA is inserted into the host chromosome, becoming covalently bonded to the bacterial DNA, and then remains dormant until activation.  Dr. Campbell’s research was focused on a specific bacterial virus, phage lambda, and its host bacterium E. coli, but the model provided insights into how [[extrachromosomal DNA]] can be inserted and excised in other organisms.

This model was proposed in the book “Episomes’ published in 1968, which was one of the first comprehensive treatments of plasmid biology.

While study of the regulation of integration and excision of phage lambda in E coli has been  a primary focus of his research, Dr. Campbell and research associates also studied regulation and expression of E coli genes linked to the lambda insertion location, including the biotin (bio) and galactose (gal) genes.

== Background on phage lambda and lysogeny ==
Early studies on bacterial viruses began after the discovery by Twort and d’Herelle of ‘filterable agents’ which were able to destroy bacteria.  These were demonstrated by creating a lawn of bacteria on appropriate media, mixing with these ‘filterable agents’ and then observing areas of destroyed cells seen as cleared circular areas (plaques) on the lawn.  These plaques were interpreted as the result of a single agent infecting a bacterial cell, reproducing in the cell and then bursting open to infect surrounding cells, repeating the process until a clear circular area of destroyed cells becomes visible to the unaided eye.  These filterable agents were named bacteriophages (eaters of bacteria) or phage for short.

The 1940s produced the first pictures of bacterial viruses using electron microscopy produced the first photos of bacterial viruses, and research on the mechanism of infection and reproduction dramatically increased.  One of the focal points of this research was Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, where a ‘[[phage group]]’ led by [[Salvador Luria]], [[Max Delbrück]], [[Alfred Hershey]] and others met in the summers for research and training of new investigators.

In 1951 [[Esther Lederberg]] discovered [[lambda phage]], which had an unusual characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estherlederberg.com/Papers.html#LAMBDAP&lt;/ref&gt;  While lambda could infect and reproduce in some strains of its host bacterium E. coli, other strains seemed immune to infection.  However, when the immune strains were mixed with non-immune strains, occasionally lambda phage could be observed infecting the non-immune strains.  Further research suggested that the immune strains contained a dormant copy of the lambda genome which protected it from infection, but that dormant copy could be activated into the active viral state to begin a new round of infection.  This dormant phase was called the ‘lysogenic’ state and the actively infectious state was called the ‘lytic’ state.  The dormant form of the lambda genome was called the ‘prophage’

Study of phage lambda over the next 50 years provided valuable insights into virus life cycles, the regulation and expression of genetic material, and the mechanism of integration and excision of genetic material into chromosomal locations.

Allan Campbell’s contribution to the field with the ‘Campbell model’ of integration and excision marked a major step forward in the understanding of this process.

{{Reading}}
According to the '''alphabetic principle''', [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s and combinations of letters are the [[symbol]]s used to represent the [[phoneme|speech sounds]] of a language based on systematic and predictable relationships between written letters, symbols, and spoken words. The alphabetic principle is the foundation of any alphabetic writing system (such as the [[English (language)|English]] variety of the [[Roman alphabet]]), which is one of the more common types of [[List of writing systems|writing systems]] in use today.

Alphabetic writing systems that use an (in practice) almost perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] have a single letter for each individual speech sound and a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letters that represent them. Such systems are used, for example, in the modern languages [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (arguably, an example of perfect phonemic orthography), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Such languages have a straightforward [[spelling]] system, enabling a writer to predict the spelling of a word given its [[pronunciation]] and similarly enabling a reader to predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling. Ancient languages with such almost perfectly phonemic writing systems include [[Avestan alphabet|Avestic]], [[Latin]], [[Tamil script|Tamil]], [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]], and [[Sanskrit]] ([[Devanāgarī]]— an [[abugida]]; see [[Vyakarana]]). On the other hand, [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] have a strong difference between sounds and symbols.

The alphabetic principle does not underlie [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] like [[written Chinese|Chinese]] or [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]. [[Korean Language|Korean]], along with Chinese and Japanese, is a member of the [[CJK characters|CJK group]] and shares origins for many of the symbols. [[Hangul]], the Korean writing system, is actually strongly alphabetic while it may look logographic or syllabic to outsiders.

==Latin alphabet==
{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
Most [[orthographies]] that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin writing system]] are imperfectly phonological and diverge from that ideal to a greater or lesser extent. This is because the ancient Romans designed the alphabet specifically for Latin. In the Middle Ages, it was adapted to the Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin, as well as to the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and some Slavic languages, and finally to most of the languages of Europe.

===English orthography===

{{Main|English orthography}}
[[English orthography]] is based on the alphabetic principle, but the acquisition of sounds and spellings from a variety of languages has made English spelling patterns confusing. Spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions but nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled with different letters or letter combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, Sebastian. Exception Words, Southwest Educational Development Laboratory. Retrieved from http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183306/http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html |date=2007-10-11 }}, September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters ''ee'' almost always represent {{IPA|/i/}}, but the sound can also be represented by the letter ''y'' or the letters ''ie''.

The spelling systems for some languages, such as [[Spanish orthography|Spanish]], are relatively simple because they adhere closely to the ideal one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. In [[English orthography|English]] the spelling system is more complex and varies considerably in the degree to which it follows the stated pattern. There are several reasons for this, including: first, the alphabet has 26 letters, but the English language has 40 sounds that must be reflected in word spellings; second, English spelling began to be standardized in the 15th century, and most spellings have not been revised to reflect the long-term changes in pronunciation that are typical for all languages; and third, English frequently adopts foreign words without changing the spelling of those words.

==Role in beginning reading==
{{See also|Phonics|Whole Language}}
Learning the connection between written letters and spoken sounds has been viewed as a critical heuristic to word identification for decades. Understanding that there is a direct relationship between letters and sounds enables an emergent reader to decode the pronunciation of an unknown written word and associate it with a known spoken word. Typically, emergent readers identify the majority of unfamiliar printed words by sounding them out. Similarly, understanding the relationship of letters and sounds is also seen as a critical heuristic for learning to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Juel | first1 = Connie | title = Handbook of Reading Research, II | chapter = 27 Beginning Reading | volume = 2 |pages=759–788 | editor = Rebecca Barr | editor2 = Michael L.

Two contrasting philosophies exist with regard to emergent readers learning to associate letters to speech sounds in English. Proponents of [[phonics]] argue that this relationship needs to be taught explicitly and to be learned to [[automaticity]], in order to facilitate the rapid word recognition upon which comprehension depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chall |first=Jeanne S. |authorlink=Jeanne Chall |date=1996 | edition=3rd |title=Learning to read: The great debate |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/learning-to-read-the-great-debate/oclc/8974797/editions  | page= |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |access-date=2010-07-01 | quote= }} '''[See [[Talk: Alphabetic principle#Chall| Talk page]]&amp;zwj;]'''&lt;/ref&gt;   
Others, including advocates of [[Whole language|whole-language]] who hold that reading should be taught [[Holistic education|holistically]], assert that children can naturally intuit the relationship between letters and sounds.

&lt;!--Deleted text: The alphabetic principle is that, in such writing systems, each [[grapheme]] (contextually) represented a [[phoneme]] at the time and place of its [[orthography|orthographic]] inception or last change. ... , where one written word may have several readings and one spoken word may have several writings. The principle is generally not applied to a [[syllabary]] like [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]], because of the huge amount of [[syllable]]s possible compared to [[phone]]s.
Due to [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] change and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] geographical and sociocultural differences, there is, by definition, no standardised alphabet that renders the spoken language truthfully (and vice versa).

'''Anna Pessiak-Schmerling''' (1834 – 14 March 1896) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] composer born in [[Vienna]].

==Life and career==
She was born Anna Schmerling, daughter of Maria Anna Giannatasio del Río (1792-1868), and the granddaughter of Cajetan Giannatasio del Río (1764-1828) who had a boarding school in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beethoven's letters: a critical edition : with explanatory notes, Volume 2|first=Ludwig|last=van Beethoven|first2=Alfred|last2=Christlieb Kalischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied with [[Mathilde Marchesi]] (1821-1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Musical times, Volume 37|publisher=JSTOR|date=May 1, 1896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-Z8gtxuC1kC&amp;pg=PA338 |format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterward worked as a professor of voice at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]].

'''Bernard Weiner''' (born 1935) is an American [[social psychologist]] known for developing a form of [[attribution theory]] which explains the emotional and motivational entailments of academic success and failure. Bernard Weiner got interested in the field of attribution after the first studying achievement motivation. He used [[Thematic_Apperception_Test|TAT]] to identify differences in people’s achievement needs and then turned to the study of individual issues people face when they think of their own successes and failures. One of his students, Linda Beckman, came up with this topic, and from then on, Bernard Weiner carried on further investigation which led him to a road of the cognitive processes that have motivational influence.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Janna|author2=Michael Shaughnessy|title=An interview with Bernard Weiner|journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]]|year=1996|volume=8|series=2|pages=165–174|doi=10.1007/bf02160679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a three-stage process, attribution theory explains the causes of an event or behavior. The three stages include observations and determination of behavior, and attributing to causes. There are two types of attributions; external and internal. External attribution relates causality to outside agents, whereas, internal attribution assigns the person himself for any behavior. In one of his interviews in 1996, Bernard Weiner was asked the following: "How does attribution contribute to high ability, high achievement, and giftedness?" His answer is the proceeding paragraph.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are two perspectives to consider: self-perception and the perception
of others. Certain attributions are maladaptive in that they are
likely to reduce achievement strivings. Among these are attributions of failure
to lack of ability, which produce low expectancies of future success
(tied to the stability dimension of causality), low self-esteem (linked with
the locus dimension), and humiliation and shame (because these are perceived
as uncontrollable). On the other hand, failure ascribed to insufficient
effort results in maintenance of expectancy of success and guilt, both motivators.
Continuing commerce with the task increases specific ability (which
is unstable, as opposed to underlying "intelligence" which is perceived as
stable). Thus, by influencing task persistence, attributions also influence actual
task ability.
The same is true from the perspective of others. If I ascribe your failure
to low ability, then I (as teacher) offer sympathy, do not punish for
failure, and give unsolicited help. All these are cues that you "cannot,"
which starts the cycle indicated above. So other-perception and self-perception
form a unity, together, which influence task persistence and, therefore,
actual ability. Some of this is captured in the false-expectancy
literature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Education ==
A product of Chicago's public schools, he received his
undergraduate degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Chicago
in 1955 and an MBA, majoring in Industrial Relations, from the same university in 1957.
Following two years of service in the U.S. Army, Weiner enrolled in a PhD program in
personality at the [[University of Michigan]], where he was mentored by John Atkinson, one of the leading personality and motivational psychologists of that era. Weiner completed his PhD from Michigan in 1963, spent two years as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota before joining the psychology faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1965, where he remained active into the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.com/reference/article/weiner-bernard-1935-/ Graham, Sandra. Weiner, Bernard 1935-]. Accessed March 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiner has published 15 books and many articles on the psychology of [[motivation]] and [[emotion]], and has been a Professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] for many years. His contributions including linking attribution theory, the psychology of motivation, and emotion. He is the author of  An  Attributional  Theory  of  Motivation  and Emotion. For example, he believes that throughout education, we all have similar '''psychodynamics''' in the classroom; students tend to seek explanation for personal failure. He is the father of [[Mark Weiner]], a professor of law at [[Rutgers School of Law–Newark]]. Bernard raised the question on what is considered "sin" and what is "sickness." The construals he gave surrounded obesity: obesity due to overeating is a sin; obesity because of a thyroid problem is a sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel &amp; Shaughnessy, [http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/87/art%253A10.1007%252FBF02160679.pdf?auth66=1365460135_47113f62da5dd6b472051386a3d0a734&amp;ext=.pdf "An Interview with Bernard Weiner"], ''Educational Psychology Review'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard hoped that these type of scenarios would help him come up with a general theory of social conduct.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

For   over  30 years, the   fields of  personality and  social  psychology have been   influenced by  the   work  of  Bernard  Weiner. His attribution theory of  motivation and  emotions  has  contributed greatly to the   educational  psychologist's  understanding  of   how  perceived  causation  influences  motivation,  behavior,  and  emotions.  This  theory  has  been   applied  to  a  wide 
range  of  topics and  has been  supported by numerous  empirical studies.c Today, Dr. Weiner can be reached at the University of California, Los Angeles, Psychology Department, Franz Hall, Los Angeles, California 90024, where he continues his work on the attribution theory and motivation.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation's (CBF) '''Brock Environmental Center''' is located on the banks of the [[Lynnhaven River]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. It is designed to meet the highest environmental standards in accordance with [[U.S. Green Building Council|The U.S. Green Building Council's]] [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] and the [[Living Building Challenge]]. Home to CBF's Hampton Roads staff and local conservation group, Lynnhaven River NOW, the Brock Center will benefit the larger public with spaces indoors and out for community and student groups.&lt;ref name=npr-2014dec04&gt;{{cite episode |last1=Komp |first1=Catherine |title=New Model For Green Building Opens In Virginia Beach |url=http://ideastations.org/radio/news/new-model-green-building-opens-virginia-beach |accessdate=15 January 2015 |series=Virginia Currents |station=[[WCVE-FM]] |network=[[NPR]] |date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Pleasure House Point ===
Pleasure House Point is a 118-acre peninsula on the [[Lynnhaven River]] in Virginia Beach at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Developers purchased the land and planned to build "Indigo Dunes," a development of more than 1,100 new high-rise condos and townhouses.&lt;ref name=dc-2014nov14&gt;{{cite news |last1=Everett |first1=Christy |title=Rethinking Coastal Development in Virginia Beach |url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/14/rethinking-coastal-development-in-virginia-beach/ |accessdate=15 January 2015 |website=[[Daily Caller]] |date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the housing market collapsed in 2008, the building plans came to a halt, and the bank foreclosed on the property.&lt;ref name=vp-2012mar14&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hixenbaugh |first1=Mike |title=Virginia Beach Deal Preserves A Slice of Nature |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2012/03/virginia-beach-deal-preserves-slice-nature |accessdate=15 January 2015 |newspaper=[[Virginian Pilot]] |date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, The Chesapeake Bay Foundation partnered with the City of Virginia Beach, the Trust for Public Land, and the local community to buy Pleasure House Point for $13 million, preserving it for recreation and education.&lt;ref name=lrn&gt;{{cite web |last1=Forget |first1=Karen |title=Pleasure House Point |url=http://www.lynnhavenrivernow.org/files/pages/LYNN-20252-SummrNews_12%20(2).pdf |website=www.lynnhavenrivernow.org |publisher=LynnHaven River Now |accessdate=15 January 2015 |date=Summer 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115163542/http://www.lynnhavenrivernow.org/files/pages/LYNN-20252-SummrNews_12%20%282%29.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation bought a small corner of the property to build the Brock Environmental Center. The building takes its name from Virginia Beach philanthropist [[Dollar Tree]] founder Macon Brock and his wife Joan.&lt;ref name=vp-2014nov09 /&gt;

=== Living Building Challenge ===
The Living Building Challenge is the highest standard of certification for energy efficient, environmentally smart design and construction.  The Challenge is composed of seven performance categories called Petals: Place, Water, Energy, Health and Happiness, Materials, Equity, and Beauty.&lt;ref name=ilfi&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Building Challenge |url=http://living-future.org/lbc |website=www.Living-future.org |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=15 January 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation expects that the center will be LEED-Platinum certified and that it will meet the Living Building Challenge certification. This rare designation means the building has a [[Zero-energy building|net-zero]] impact on the environment even after a full year of operation.&lt;ref name=cbf&gt;{{cite web |title=Making of a Green Building |url=http://www.cbf.org/about-cbf/offices-operations/brock-center-about/making-of-a-green-building--review-only |website=www.cbf.org |publisher=Chesapeake Bay Foundation |accessdate=15 January 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and construction ==
=== Energy independence ===
Rooftop [[photovoltaics|photo-voltaic panels]] produce approximately 60 percent of the Brock Environmental Center’s energy needs. Two residential-scale 10-kilowatt [[wind turbines]] provide the additional 40 percent of energy. [[Geothermal energy|Geothermal wells]] are used to take advantage of the earth's constant 54-degree temperature by exchanging heat with a recirculated fluid that is sent down a closed loop located 300 feet below the surface after which the fluid sent back up to the surface to warm the building air in the winter and cool the building air in the summer before sent down the earth again. The treated air is circulate through the building with a high-efficiency HVAC.&lt;ref name=cbf /&gt;

As a result of other energy efficient and conservation design elements, the building uses 80% less energy than a typical building its size.&lt;ref name=npr-2014dec04 /&gt;

The building is positioned to receive maximum southern exposure for warmth and to receive natural ventilation from the prevailing winds. Exterior walls, floors, and roof insulation are designed to reduce energy demands by maximizing the building’s insulation.

=== Water independence ===
Two 1,600-gallon (6,056-liter) [[rainwater tank|rain cisterns]] and a filtering system make the Brock Environmental Center the first project in the United States to receive a commercial permit for drinking filtered rainwater.&lt;ref name=inhabitat&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marks |first1=Josh |title=CBF's Brock Environmental Center Will Soon Be the Most Sustainable Building in Virginia |url=http://inhabitat.com/cbfs-brock-environmental-center-will-soon-be-the-most-sustainable-building-in-virginia/brock_gallery_1/?extend=1 |accessdate=15 January 2015 |work=Inhabitat |date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skanska&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Megan |title=Creating One of the World's Greenest Buildings |url=http://blog.usa.skanska.com/creating-one-of-the-worlds-greenest-buildings/ |work=[[Skanska]] |date=8 January 2015 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rtd-2014nov20&gt;{{cite news |title=Cutting-edge environmental center opers at Pleasure House Point in Virginia Beach |url=http://outdoors.blogs.timesdispatch.com/2014/11/20/cutting-edge-environmental-center-opens-pleasure-house-point-virginia-beach/ |accessdate=15 January 2015 |newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=20 November 2014 |first=Tee |last=Clarkson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119081452/http://outdoors.blogs.timesdispatch.com/2014/11/20/cutting-edge-environmental-center-opens-pleasure-house-point-virginia-beach/ |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial permit was given in accordance with the federal [[drinking water]] requirements.

The [[composting toilet|toilets]] are composting waterless units that turn human waste into usable organic material. Rain gardens will capture and filter extra runoff, and a special [[graywater]] garden will cleanse graywater (wastewater generated from sinks and showers).&lt;ref name=npr-2014dec04 /&gt;

=== Materials ===
To meet the Living Building Challenge, designers did not use any “Red List” materials that include chemicals and materials considered harmful to humans and the environment. Materials and chemicals listed on the Living Building Challenge’s Red List include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and halogenated flame retardants, among others.&lt;ref name=cbf /&gt;

The builders also worked with the community to use reclaimed and salvaged materials such as sinks, doors, mirrors, counters, cabinets, floor boards, used bike racks, student art tables, and old wood paneling. Supplies came from sources throughout the community including old office buildings, school houses, and a local parks department.&lt;ref name=hp-2014oct13&gt;{{cite news |last1=Everett |first1=Christy |title=Dumpster Diving to Save the Chesapeake Bay |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christy-everett/dumpster-diving-to-save-t_b_5968010.html |accessdate=15 January 2015 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of building ==
=== Education center ===
The Brock Environmental Center is home base for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s outdoor field education program serving Hampton Roads students and teachers. According to CBF "Our courses combine many academic disciplines – [[earth science]], [[biology]], [[history]], [[art]], English/writing, [[math]], [[chemistry]], [[civics]], [[economics]], [[government]], and responsible citizenship. As a result, students become exceptionally informed and inspired, valuing the bay and its watershed as a living, connected system."&lt;ref name=vp-2014nov09 /&gt; Pleasure House Point is an active demonstration site for important and relevant restoration projects, including oyster, wetland, and other habitat restoration, as well as water quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref name=vb&gt;{{cite web |title=Pleasure House Point Natural Area |url=http://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/parks-recreation/parks-trails/natural-areas/Pages/pleasure-house-point.aspx |website=www.vbgov.com |publisher=[[Virginia Beach, Virginia|City of Virginia Beach]] |accessdate=15 January 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By engaging in outdoor educational experiences in natural areas and on waterways, program participants can better understand the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref name=aps&gt;{{cite web |title=Washington-Lee High School's Chesapeake Bay Trip Featured on Green Scene |url=http://www.apsva.us//site/Default.aspx?PageID=27888 |website=www.apsva.us |publisher=[[Arlington Public Schools]] |accessdate=15 January 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community resource ===
The Brock Center contains a large conference room and smaller meeting spaces available for community meetings, discussions, and collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12434">The '''Diplôme d'études universitaires générales''' (French for ''General Academic Studies Degree''), abbreviated '''DEUG''', was a [[France|French]] national degree. It was delivered between 1973 and the {{Interlanguage link multi|LMD reform|fr|3=Réforme Licence-Master-Doctorat}} (implemented between 2003 and 2006 depending on the university) by [[universities]] one year before the [[Licence#Academia|license]] (roughly equivalent to [[Associate degree]]).

== History ==

=== Creation ===
The DEUG was created in 1973 by the [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] of [[Joseph Fontanet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite French decree|number=73-226|date in French=27 février 1973|full name=relatif aux diplômes nationaux de l'enseignement supérieur|URL=http://www.alliot.fr/esr/decret-73-226.pdf}} et arrêté du 27 février 1973 relatif au diplôme d'études universitaires générales&lt;/ref&gt; and replaces the various diplomas and undergraduate studies in each faculty: the general legal diploma, the general economic diploma, the degree of literary studies and the degree of scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.larousse.fr/archives/journaux_annee/1973/356/education DEUG]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[decree]] of creation, the DEUG "sanctions a multidisciplinary undergraduate general education and guidance", "lessons aim to develop in students the skills and knowledge to: the expression and realization ; understanding of the contemporary world, the study and use of concepts and scientific methods". Regarding the opportunities of this degree, "the lessons are organized to allow students who are studying to be admitted to a graduate or graduate, or at another university, students who do not pursue can directly enter the workforce". The courses leading to this degree span two years and only one time twice a year is normally permitted.
Orders of 1 March 1973 set the agenda of the general university degree in six mentions: [[law]], [[economics]], economic and [[social administration]], [[humanities]] (with sections [[philosophy]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[history]] and [[geography]]), [[science]] (sections: science and structures of [[matter]], the [[natural sciences]] and life).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.cren-nantes.net/IMG/pdf/Dumoulin.pdf Construire l’université de masse. Genèse de la filière Administration économique et social], Céline Dumoulin, Alexandra Filhon&lt;/ref&gt; Educational programs include 50 to 60% of required courses defined by national laws for each section and mention, they also have at least 5% of modern language teaching and 30 to 40% over the choice of universities with 10 to 20% of courses from outside the section or the main entry to the choice of students, such as "sociology and social psychology" for students of the word "science". According to the statements, the total minimum teaching for this degree is 700 to 1100 hours.

=== From 1993 to 1997 ===
Between 1993 and 1997, the DEUG was governed by the [[decree]] of 26 May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000723595&amp;dateTexte= Arrêté du 26 mai 1992 relatif au diplôme d'études universitaires générales, à la licence et à la maîtrise]&lt;/ref&gt; This applies from the start of 1993 (Reform [[Lionel Jospin|Jospin]]).
This DEUG was open to any holder of [[Baccalauréat]] or equivalent. It was organized in two levels. The lessons are grouped by modules. The first year included a tutorial. Universities should organize two examination sessions per year.
Only three annual entrants were allowed to graduate unless exceptions.
Students of ''institut universitaire professionnalisé'' also received a DEUG at the end of their first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000343811&amp;dateTexte= Décret n°92-85 du 23 janvier 1992 portant organisation dans les instituts universitaires professionnalisés des études conduisant à la délivrance du titre d'ingénieur-maître]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From 1997 to Bologna Process ===
Before the [[Bologna Process]], the DEUG was governed by the [[decree]] of 9 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000748934&amp;dateTexte= Arrêté du 9 avril 1997 relatif au diplôme d'études universitaires générales, à la licence et à la maîtrise]&lt;/ref&gt; This applied since September 1997 ([[François Bayrou|Bayrou]] reform), it is also still in force today.
This DEUG is open to any holder of [[Baccalauréat]] or equivalent. It is organized into four semesters, the first being a half of orientation. The lessons are grouped by academic units. The first year included a tutorial. Universities must conduct two examination sessions. Access is made in the second year if the student had validated 70% of the first year (and 80% of DEUG enough to access the [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], but did not get the degree).
Only three annual entrants were allowed to graduate unless exceptions.
The DEUG included nine areas:

* The Science and Technology DEUG the program is determined by ''arrêté'';&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000200660&amp;dateTexte= Arrêté du 30 avril 1997 relatif au diplôme d'études universitaires générales Sciences et technologies et aux licences et maîtrises du secteur Sciences et technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Since Bologna Process ===
Since the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]] (2003 to 2006 depending on the university), the DEUG is a diploma through the [[Bachelor's degree]]. It is issued if students are successfully completed double degrees first four (of six) semesters and receive one diploma with both major fields.

The '''Doctor of Pastoral Theology''' (Abbreviated P.Th.D. for the [[Latin]] ''Pastoralis Theologiæ Doctor,'' PThD) is a theological [[professional degree]] geared to provide higher academic training to those who have already entered the pastoral ministry and who seek to continue their work while pursuing further theological study.

The Doctor of Pastoral Theology ''(P.Th.D.)'' is comparable to the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] ''(Ph.D.)'' or the [[Doctor of Theology|Doctor in Theology]] ''(Th. D.)'' in terms of its academic load and level of study, with a grade of research represented by its required doctoral dissertation project of up to two hundred pages. Said pre-approved dissertation is usually expected to relate and complement the doctorate candidate's ongoing field of work.

As with the [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] (''S.T.D. = Sacrae Theologiae Doctor'') issued by the [[pontifical university]] system of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which builds upon the work of the [[Bachelor of Sacred Theology]] ''(S.T.B.)'' and the [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology]] ''(S.T.L.)'', the P.Th.D. also necessitates the completion of both a [[Bachelor's degree]] and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in a field of ministry training. The P.Th.D., however, is meant to enhance further the teaching, preaching, and leadership effectiveness of the current pastor/overseer of a congregational ministry, while the S.T.D. graduate is usually expected to seek the professorate in a Catholic university—see ''Sapientia Cristiana'' on Ecclesiastical Universities, Part One, Section VII, Article 50. n.1 at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120920150336/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_15041979_sapientia-christiana_en.html].

It was originally designed to meet the requirements of four test schools: Rocca Al Mare School, Jüri Gymnasium, Kuresaare Gymnasium and Tallinn Arte Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;Postimees. http://www.postimees.ee/381272/e-kool-vahetas-omanikke&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has grown to cover 90% of Estonian school network.

==History==

eKool started in 2002  to replace printed school diaries by digital journals which would enable parents and students to see their grades and homework assignments online. The pilot project was launched by the specifications of 4 schools: Rocca Al Mare School, Jüri Gymnasium, Kuressaare Gymnaasium and Tallinn Arte Gymnasium. The initial Look@World program ended in 2005 after which it was turned into a private company: Koolitööde AS. In the next few years the eKool mostly expanded over the Estonian school system reaching over 420 schools by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Koolielu. eKool tähistas 10. sünnipäeva http://koolielu.ee/info/readnews/200898/ekool-tahistas-10-sunnipaeva&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 eKool is also supported by [[Mobile app|mobile application]] which allows students and parents to access their information from mobile phones. However schools and teachers still need to use a computer.

==Functionalities==

eKool can be accessed by combination of user-name and password, [[Estonian ID card|Estonian ID-card]], [[Mobile signature#Estonian Mobile-ID|Estonian Mobile-ID]], [[Smart-ID]] or through online bank identification. eKool can be used by various interest groups: school personnel, students, parents and to some extent the local government overseeing their own school's. With one user account a person can access functionalities for different user groups where the user belongs to.

The schools personnel carries out most of the data entry process to eKool which latter can be used by all parties that have right to access the information. Among the information schools provide are:

* E-Journal
* [[School timetable|Timetable]]
* Lesson topics and [[homework]]
* [[Grading in education|Grades]]
* [[Absenteeism|Absences]] of students
* Notifications of school events and news&lt;ref&gt;BBC: How Estonia became E-stonia https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22317297&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents and the students can access the information and keep themselves up to date. From their own side they make it easy for the school to collect contact information because parents and students enter it themselves and keep eKool updated by using it.

== Education ==
In 2000, the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Millennium Development Goals]], a set of development goals for the year 2015, more specifically, “to ensure that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of [[Primary education|primary schooling]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_FS_2_EN.pdf|title=Millennium Development Goals Goal 2 Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=September 2010|website=un.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[World Education Forum]] met in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]], and adopted the Dakar Framework for Action reaffirming the commitment to achieving Education for All by the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-all/|title=Education for All {{!}} Education {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, according to [[UNESCO]], only 57% of African children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001572/157229e.pdf|title=Regional overview: sub-Saharan Africa|last=|first=|date=2008|website=unesco.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also showed marked gender inequalities: in almost all countries enrollment of boys far outpaced that of girls. However in some countries, education is relatively strong. In Zimbabwe, literacy has reached 92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SA can learn a thing or two from Zimbabwe’s education system |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/ideas/2017-11-30-sa-can-learn-a-thing-or-two-from-zimbabwes-education-system/}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Steps such as the abolition of school fees, investments in teaching infrastructure and resources, and school meals from the [[World Food Programme]] helped drive enrollment up by millions. Yet despite the significant progress of many countries, the world fell short of meeting its goal of [[Universal Primary Education]] (UPE). In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2013, only about 79% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-Admin-Data-updated-Oct.-2015-includes-8-tabs_77.xlsx,%20http://data.unicef.org/topic/education/overview/|title=Overview - UNICEF DATA|work=UNICEF DATA|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enrollment of girls continued to lag behind that of boys. Disparity between genders is partially due to females being excluded from school for being pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Africa: Make Girls’ Access to Education a Reality |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/16/africa-make-girls-access-education-reality |website=Human Rights Watch |language=en |date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the expiration of the MDGs in 2015, the UN adopted a set of [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for the year 2030. The fourth goal addressed education, with the stated aim to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The World Education Forum also convened in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea|Korea]] to discuss the implementation of this goal, and adopted the Incheon Declaration for Education 2030. It remains to be seen what effect the latest measures have on the state of education participation in African countries.

Regarding issues of quality in education and equity, there are underlying causes that deter progress such as high drop-out rates, grade repetition, poor quality of education and educational resources, teacher shortages, poor infrastructure and supplies, access to education for rural and remote areas, and stigmas for marginalized groups. 

===Language===

Due to high linguistic diversity, the legacy of colonialism and the need for knowledge of international languages such as English and French in employment and higher education, most schooling in Africa takes places in languages that teachers and pupils do not speak natively, and in some cases simply do not understand. There is considerable evidence that pupils schooled in a second language achieve poorer results than those schooled in their mother tongue, as lack of proficiency in the second language impairs understanding and encourages ineffective rote learning.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, S. L. (2015). Mother Tongue-based Education in Developing Countries: Some emerging insights. Researchgate.net.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutcher, N. in collaboration with Tucker, G. R. (1997). The Use of First and Second Languages in Education: A Review of Educational Experience, Washington D.C., World Bank, Country Department III.&lt;/ref&gt; Although UNESCO have recommended since the 1950s that children be taught early literacy in their mother tongue, progressing later to other languages, not all African countries implement this effectively. Even where the earliest grades are taught in the mother tongue, pupils are typically forced to switch to languages such as English and French before acquiring proficiency in these languages.&lt;ref&gt;Mehrotra, S. (1999). Education for All: Policy Lessons From High-Achieving Countries. UNICEF Staff Working Papers, New York, Unicef.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of proper facilities and educators===

Another reason for the low education rates in Africa is the lack of proper schooling facilities and unequal opportunity for education across countries.  Many schools across Africa find it hard to employ teachers due to the low pay and lack of suitable people. This is particularly true for schools in remote areas. Most people who manage to receive education would prefer to move to big cities or even overseas where more opportunities and higher pay await. Thus, there will be an overly large class sizes and high average number of students per teacher in a school. Moreover, the teachers are usually those unqualified with few teaching aids and poor textbook provision. Due to this, children attending schools in rural areas usually attain poorer results in standardised tests compared to their urban counterparts. This can be seen in the reports given by the Northern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SACMEQ III|title=SACMEQ III Project Results: Pupil achievement levels in reading and mathematics Working Document Number 1|url=http://www.sacmeq.org/downloads/sacmeqIII/WD01_SACMEQ_III_Results_Pupil_Achievement.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727230449/http://www.sacmeq.org/downloads/sacmeqIII/WD01_SACMEQ_III_Results_Pupil_Achievement.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those taking the tests in rural areas score much lower than those in small towns and big cities. This shows a lack of equal education opportunity given to children from different parts of the same country.

With teachers being less qualified than others in urban areas the teaching to learning environment takes an effect amongst the students. In one instance teachers took the same test as their students and three fourths of them had failed.&lt;ref&gt;"End It, Don't Mend It - Our Falling Education Standards." Africa News Service 15 Dec. 2011. Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 19 July. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, those that do not receive the same education to those in the bigger cities have trouble even after graduation with reading, writing, and doing math.&lt;ref&gt;"Sub-Saharan Africa Strengthens Advocacy for Quality Education." Africa News Service 10 June 2011. Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 19 July. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Students who do not attain the same equal education to those in urban environments do not achieve the same outcome in establishing success with a career. With education being a major concern towards achieving a career and establishing a future, Africa needs to be aware that equal education needs to be established within all schools throughout the countries.

===Emigration===

Next, [[emigration]] leads to a loss of highly educated people and financial loss. The loss of skilled people can only be replaced with another huge cost which imply the loss of money spent educating people who leave and new people to replace them. Even though an almost 5.5% of [[GDP]] investment in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa: fast facts|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm#education|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719213531/http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm#education|archivedate=2008-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the loss makes it difficult for the government to budget another amount in education as they will need to prioritize other needs such as military budget and debt servicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Kevin|title=Basic education for all Africans|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/134edu.htm|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
Western models and standards still continue to dominate African education. Because of colonization African institutions, particularly universities, still instruct using Euro-centric curriculums with almost no connection to life in Africa. This is further perpetuated by the use of European and American imported textbooks. Many view this lack of self sufficiency as an ongoing effect of colonization upheld by the modern, corrupt African elite. This attitude rests on the basis that during colonization the African ruling elite exploited their own people for their own benefit rather than advocate for the interests of their own people. 

=== Global water crisis ===
The global water crisis has severe effects on education in rural countries in Africa. Limited access to education and health issues can be further compounded by inadequate water systems or disease that may follow. Malaria, cited to be a main cause of death in Africa, is a mosquito-borne disease that can commonly be found in unmanaged pools of still water. The mosquitos breed in such pools and consequently children who drink from these pools can die or fall severely ill. Furthermore, such an intense illness can later affect the cognitive abilities of children who fall ill at a young age. This is not only applicable biologically but also as an effect of falling ill: children who miss a significant amount of school are unable to optimize their education due to missing lessons.

===Military and conflict===

Military spending is causing education spending to decrease immensely. According to a March 2011 report by [[UNESCO]], [[armed conflict]] is the biggest threat to education in Africa. While the number of dropouts across the continent has been increasing dramatically, one of the influences of war and conflict on education is the diversion of public funds from education to military spending. An already underfunded system is losing more money. Twenty-one African countries have been identified as the highest spenders of gross domestic product on military globally compared with the amount directed toward education. Military and conflict also leads to the displacement of children. It often forces them to remain in camps or flee to their neighboring countries where education is not available to them.&lt;ref name="War Hurting Learning in Continent"&gt;{{cite web|title=War Hurting Learning in Continent|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential initiatives ==
Initiatives to improve education in Africa include:

===Intracontinental===

* [[NEPAD]]'s [[NEPAD E-School programme|E-school programme]] is an ambitious plan to provide internet and computer facilities to all schools on the continent.
* [http://www.sacmeq.org SACMEQ] is a consortium of 15 Ministries of Education in Southern and Eastern Africa which undertakes integrated research and training activities to monitor and evaluate the quality of basic education, and generates information that can be used by decision-makers to plan and improve the quality of education.
* For 10 years, the [http://benineducationfund.org/blog/ Benin Education Fund (BEF)] has provided scholarships and education support to students from the Atakora province in northeastern Benin. Over 450 students have been able to stay in school because of their programmes.

===International===

* [[She's the First]] is a [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]-based non-profit organization. The organization seeks to empower girls in Asia, Africa, and Latin America by facilitating the sponsorship of their education through creative and innovative means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=She's the First|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5277312,00.html|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Working through local organizations, [[The African Children's Educational Trust]] is supporting thousands of youngsters with long-term scholarships and a community rural elementary schools building programme. It has built seven schools to date and is raising funds for more.
* [[British Airways]]' "" project which, in collaboration with [[UNICEF]], opened the model school [[Kuje Science Primary School]] in Nigeria in 2002.
* The [[Elias Fund]] provides scholarships to children in [[Zimbabwe]] to get a better education.
* The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] in association with [[Humanity First]], an international charity organisation, has built over 500 schools in the African continent and is running a 'learn a skill' initiative for young men and women.
*[http://www.worldbank.org/education/efafti/ Fast Track Initiative]
*The Volkswagen Foundation has been running a funding initiative called "Knowledge for Tomorrow – Cooperative Research Projects in Sub-Saharan Africa" since 2003. It provides scholarships for young African researchers and helps to establish a scientific community in African universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/way-ensure-research-cooperation-eyelevel-between-junior-scientists-africa-and-their-german|title=A way to ensure research cooperation at eyelevel between  junior scientists from Africa and their German peers|work=D+C|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corruption in education ==

A 2010 [[Transparency International]] report, with research gathered from 8,500 educators and parents in [[Ghana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Morocco]], [[Niger]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Uganda]], found that education is being denied to African children in incredibly large numbers.&lt;ref name="image.guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa Education Watch Good Governance Lessons for Primary Education|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2010/02/23/AfricaEducationWatch.pdf |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of parent involvement, especially as an overseer of government activities also leads to enormous corruption. This was most often found to be because parents and communities feel as though they lack any kind of power in regard to their child's education. In [[Uganda]] only 50% of parents believe that they have the power to influence decisions regarding the education of their child. In [[Morocco]], just 20% of parents believed they held any sort of power.&lt;ref name="image.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

The unavailability and incompleteness of records in schools and districts prevents the documentation and prevention of corrupt practices. The African Education Watch conducted surveys all over the continent and identified the three most common practices of corruption:

* '''Illegal collection of fees:''' One part of their research focused on so-called registration fees. Parents from every country surveyed reported paying even though, by law, primary schooling is free. The report found that the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9% in [[Ghana]], to 90% in [[Morocco]]. An average of 44% of parents still report paying skill fees in the study. The average fee cost $4.16, a major expense for families in countries like [[Madagascar]], [[Niger]] and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="image.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
* '''Embezzlement of school funds:''' In the study, [[Transparency International]] found that 64% of the schools surveyed on the continent published no financial information at all.&lt;ref name="image.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
* '''Power abuse:''' Another major problem is incompetent management. The report found that in many schools the little resources they did have were being wasted or lost. Overall, 85% of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all. In Morocco, just 23% of head teachers received training in financial management, despite being responsible for budgets. The TI report found that there was sexual abuse in schools from teachers. The TI report also found that many schools were plagued by teacher absenteeism and alcoholism.&lt;ref name="image.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

Without this basic education, the report found it was nearly impossible to go on to high school or college. African children are missing this link that allows them to have a chance in trade or to go beyond their villages.
&lt;ref name="dw-world.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Stifles Learning in Africa, Report Finds|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5277312,00.html |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NGO involvement ==

A report by [[USAID]] and the Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development, found that NGOs are increasingly participating in contribute to the delivery of education services, education policy decisions and are included by donors and government officials in many parts of the education system. Of course, this varies country to country and region to region.

NGOs working in education in Africa often encountered tension and competition when working. Schools, parents and, most often government officials, feel threatened by third-party involvement and feel that they are "crashing the party." The report continues that for NGOs to be effective, they must understand that they do not have the same perspective as government officials as to who is in control. If they do not recognize the government of the country they are working in, they will compromise their objectives.&lt;ref name="pdf.usaid.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolving Partnerships: The Role of NGOs in Basic Education in Africa|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACQ444.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report goes into more detail about [[NGO]] relations with governments in education. The relationship is viewed from completely separate points. African governments see NGOs and their work as "an affair of government" or, in other words, working as a part and in collaboration with the country's government. NGOs on the other hand view themselves as very separate entities in African education. They see themselves fulfilling [[moral responsibility]]. They believe that they are identifying needs or areas of development in situations under which the government has ultimately been unaccountable and separately mobilizing resources toward those needs or development areas. Government and NGOs are hold contrasting beliefs about each other's abilities. Governments often think NGOs are unqualified to make important policy decision and that they could undermine their legitimacy if seen as superior. In some cases, NGOs have found government incompetent themselves, if not their own fault, as the fault of a lack of resources. In the best cases, NGOs and government officials find each other's mutual strengths in [[education policy]] and find ways to practically collaborate and reach both of their objectives.&lt;ref name="pdf.usaid.gov"/&gt;

To be effective in education in Africa NGOs must effect policy and create policy changes that support their projects. NGOs also found that, to see this policy change that they are striving for, they must create and foster relationships with many different stakeholders. The most important stakeholders are usually donors and government officials. The biggest challenge for NGOs has been linking these networks together. NGO interventions to change policy have revealed that NGO programmes have failed to create a successful way to change the policy process while making sure that the public understands and is a part of education policy. This problem will prove more influential in the future if it is not solved.&lt;ref name="pdf.usaid.gov"/&gt;

==Adult education==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 6 19 - School for adults in Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tiff|thumb|Open air school for adults, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]
'''Adult education in Africa''', having experienced a comeback following the independence and increasing prosperity of many African nations, poses specific requirements on policymakers and planners to take into consideration indigenous cultural traits and characteristics. With a moderate backlash against Western ideals and educational traditions, many [[universities]] and other institutes of higher education take it upon themselves to develop a new approach to higher education and adult education.

Most contemporary analysts regard illiteracy as a development issue because of the link between poverty and illiteracy.&lt;ref&gt;Nassimbeni, Mary and Bev May. "Adult education in South African public libraries: enabling conditions and inhibiting factors". University of Cape Town, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is inadequate and inconsistent and is needed for priority areas such as educator training, monitoring, and evaluation.&lt;ref name="Aitchison 2009, p.3"&gt;Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. "The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa". UNESCO, 2009, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clear need for investment in capacity development, having a full, sufficiently paid and well qualified professionalized staff, and increasing the demands for adult education professionals. The majority of adult educators are untrained, especially in basic literacy. Governments often employ schoolteachers and others in adult education posts rather than experienced adult educators.&lt;ref name="Aitchison 2009, p.3"/&gt;  Many of the difficulties experienced could be solved by allocation of resources to meet the needs (adequate funds, more staff, appropriate training for staff and suitable material). Underfunding is a huge threat to the sustainability of these programs, and in some cases, to their continued existence.&lt;ref&gt;Nassimbeni, Mary and Bev May. "Adult education in South African public libraries: enabling conditions and inhibiting factors". University of Cape Town, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The best-reported data on funding is about adult literacy and non-formal education programs. Funding for continuing education, either academic or vocational is provided and reported on, but little data is given on its financing. Funding may come from public or private sector sources. International and foreign aid is also likely to be important. The costs of much adult education seem to be kept artificially low by the use of state facilities and by the extremely low salaries paid to many adult education specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. "The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa". UNESCO, 2009, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Public universities have not been successful in attracting older students onto mainstream degree programs and so the post-apartheid ideal of opening access to public higher education for growing numbers of non-traditional students is not yet a reality.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, Karen. "Boom in Adult Basic Education". University World News, 16 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain countries have reported some success rates in Adult Education programs.  Between 1990 and 2007 Uganda enrolled over 2million participants in the functional adult literacy program. The Family Basic Education program was active in 18 schools by 2005, reaching over 3,300 children and 1,400 parents. This is a successful family literacy mediation whose impact at household, school and community level has been evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. "The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa". UNESCO, 2009, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the national reports typically do not provide sufficient information on the content of the adult education programs that run in their countries. In the majority of cases the name of the program is as much detail as is given. Curriculum content does not seem to be a major issue.&lt;ref&gt;Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. "The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa". UNESCO, 2009, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural considerations===
African communities are very close knit; activities, lifestyles, particularities of individuals are nearly always common knowledge.  Because of this, it is difficult for any one member or group within an area to take a significantly different approach to any facet of life within the community.  For this reason, program planners for adult learners in Africa find higher rates of success when they employ a participatory approach.  Through open and honest dialogue about the fears, motivations, beliefs and ambitions of the community as a whole, there is less social strain concerning individual divergent behavior.

In addition to strong traditional beliefs, years of slavery through colonization have led to a sense of unity and common struggle in African communities.  Therefore, lesson plans in these areas should reflect this [[cultural sensibility]]; collaboration and cooperation are key components of successful programs.  Teaching techniques that utilize these ideas may include story-telling, experiential simulation, and the practice of indigenous traditions with slight modifications.  Every program and lesson must be tailored to the particular community because they almost always learn, live, and achieve as a group or not at all.

Informal education plays a strong role within indigenous learning in African communities.  This poses a significant challenge to western-style program planners that emphasize formal learning within a designated time-frame and setting.  These requirements must often be abandoned in order to achieve success in communities that have no strong affinity for time and formal education.  Programs must be planned that become ingrained into the daily life of participants, that reflects their values and add positive functionality to their lives.  Successful programs often involve more long-term learning arrangements consisting of regular visits and the free, unforced offer of information.

===Philosophies===
African philosophy of adult education recognizes the western ideas such as [[liberalism]], [[progressivism]], [[humanism]] and [[behaviorism]], while complementing them with native African perspectives.

*''[[Ethnophilosophy]]'' is the idea that the main purpose of adult education is to enable social harmony at all levels of society, from immediate family to community and country.  It is of primary importance to ensure the retention of knowledge passed down from one generation to another concerning values, cultural understanding and beliefs.  This philosophy promotes active learning – learning by doing, following, practicing the work of the elders.  Particular lessons may be taught through activities such as role-play, practical demonstrations, exhibitions, discussions or competitions.&lt;ref name="Nafukho"&gt;{{cite book |first=Fredrick |last=Nafukho |author2=Amutabi, Maurice|author3= Ruth Otango |title=Foundations of Adult Education in Africa (Uie Studies) |publisher=UNESCO |year=2005 |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[nationalist-ideological]]'' philosophy separates itself from ethnophilosophy in that it less concerned with the methods of learning and more with its use.  As a philosophy born of the revolutionary movements of the 1950s, it is unsurprising that its main focus is to be able to apply knowledge to active participation in politics and civil society.  Although it is important in this philosophy to retain the communal nature of traditional African society, functionalism for social understanding and change takes prime importance in its implementation.
*''Professional philosophy'' represents the strongest bridge between western and traditional African educational systems.  It promotes a hybrid approach to adult programs, allowing for a wide range of learning techniques, even purely cognitive lecture, so long as community values are accounted for within the lesson.  Finally, [[African philosophy#Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity|philosophic sagacity]] suggests that the only true African philosophies are those that have developed with no contact with the West whatsoever.  Rather than a specific approach, this idea simply notes the huge range of educational techniques which may exist through the continent by a wide variety of people.  It essentially states that there is no one correct method, and that the subject and activities should always be set by the participants.&lt;ref name="Caffarella"&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary S. |last=Caffarella |title=Planning Programs for Adult Learners: A Practical Guide for Educators, Trainers, and Staff Developers |edition=2nd |publisher=Jossey-Bass |year=2001 |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fasokun"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Fasokun |author2=Anne Katahoire|author3=Akpovire Oduaran |title=The Psychology of Adult Learning in Africa (Uie Studies) |publisher=UNESCO |year=2005 |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indabawa"&gt;{{cite book |first=Indabawa |last=S. |author2=S.

== Women's education ==
A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in [[primary school]] and the [[gross national product]] and increase of [[life expectancy]].

In 2000, 93.4 million women in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] were illiterate. Many reasons exist for why formal education for females is unavailable to so many, including cultural reasons. For example, some believe that a woman's education will get in the way of her duties as a wife and a mother. In some places in Africa where women marry at age 12 or 13, education is considered a hindrance to a young woman's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of Education in Africa|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/15_58.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's education is sometimes corrupted by sexual violence. Sexual violence against girls and female students affects many African education systems. In Sub-Saharan Africa, sexual violence is one of the most common and least known forms of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International conference "Fighting corruption and good governance"

=== Disparity in Education ===
While most of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] face a deadline of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/gender.html|title=UNICEF  - Goal: Promote gender equality and empower women|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender disparity is defined as inequalities of some quantity attributed to the reason of gender type. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of an estimated 101 million children not in school, more than half are girls.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/education|title=Education|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this statistic increased when examining secondary school education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In high-income countries, 95% as many girls as boys attend primary and secondary schools. However, in sub-Saharan Africa the figure is just 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3045818.stm|title=Why don't Africa's girls go to school?|date=2003-07-04|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foremost factor limiting [[female education]] is poverty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sharma, Geeta. "Gender Inequality in Education and Employment." Learningchannel.org. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic poverty plays a key role when it comes to coping with direct costs such as tuition fees, cost of textbooks, uniforms, transportation and other expenses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Wherever, especially in families with many children, these costs exceed the income of the family, girls are the first to be denied schooling. This gender bias decision in sending females to school is also based on gender roles dictated by culture. Girls usually are required to complete household chores or take care of their younger siblings when they reach home. This limits their time to study and in many cases, may even have to miss school to complete their duties.&lt;ref&gt;Manuh, Takyiwaa. "Africa Recovery/UN/Briefing Paper #11 on Women." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. 11 Apr. 1998. Web. {{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/bpaper/maineng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105024547/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/bpaper/maineng.htm |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for girls to be taken out of school at this point. Boys however, may be given more time to study if their parents believe that the education will allow them to earn more in the future. Expectations, attitudes and biases in communities and families, economic costs, social traditions, and religious and cultural beliefs limit girls’ educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Additionally, in most [[Water scarcity in Africa|African societies]], women are seen as the collectors, managers, and guardians of water, especially within the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] that includes household chores, cooking, washing, and child rearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Water Scarcity on Women's Life|url=http://www.worldpulse.com/node/20165|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these traditional [[Gender role|gender labor roles]], women are forced to spend around sixty percent of each day collecting water, which translates to approximately 200 million collective work hours by women globally per day&lt;ref name=wac&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Affected by the Crisis|url=http://water.org/learn-about-the-water-crisis/women|accessdate=18 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205050519/http://water.org/learn-about-the-water-crisis/women|archivedate=5 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decrease in the amount of time available for education, shown by the correlation of decrease in access to water with a decrease in combined [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]], and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] enrollment of women.&lt;ref name=GRAW&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Relations and Access to Water: What We Want to Know About Social Relations and Women's Time Allocation|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m5033gv#page-1|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the underlying reason(s) are, about having large numbers of girls outside the formal schooling system brings developmental challenges to both current and future generations . According to the UNESCO, the rates of female children out of primary school is higher than that of male children in all the African countries where data is available.&lt;ref&gt;• ^ "Table 7: Measures of children out of school".&lt;/ref&gt; Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, it will be impossible to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, placing the rest of the development agenda at risk.

===Significance===
In Africa and the Arab world, promoting gender equality and empowering women is perhaps the most important of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baliamoune-Lutz, Mina, and Mark McGillivray.""Gender Inequality and Growth: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa and Arab Countries." 1 Sept. 2007. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The target associated with achieving this goal is to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary enrollment preferably by 2005, and at all levels by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;"United Nations (2000), Millennium Declaration, New York: United Nations".&lt;/ref&gt; Women deserve the instrumental effects of gender equality in education and the intrinsic dimension of female education; which in essence derives from the role of education in enhancing a woman’s set of capabilities.&lt;ref name="Sen, A. 1999"&gt;Sen, A. (1999), Development as Freedom, New York: Knopf&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in theory, there is a [[Women's education and development|direct effect from female education to income]] (or growth).&lt;ref name="Sen, A. 1999"/&gt;
Education, especially for girls, has social and economic benefits for society as a whole.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women earn only one tenth of the world’s income and own less than one percent of property, so households without a male head are at special risk of impoverishment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These women will also be less likely to immunize their children and know how to help them survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women who are educated tend to have fewer and healthier children, and these children are more likely to attend school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Higher female education makes women better-informed mothers and hence could
contribute to lowering child mortality rates and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Aly 1990; Smith and
Haddad, 1999; Knowles et al. 2002; Klasen 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, limited education and employment opportunities for women reduce annual per capita growth by 0.8%. Had this growth taken place, Africa’s economies would have doubled over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="Girls 2008"&gt;"Investing in Women and Girls." United Nations Department of Public Information, Jan.-Feb. 2008. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that some low-income countries in Africa would need up to $23.8 billion annually to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]] focused on promoting gender equality and empowering women by 2015. This would translate from $7to $13 per capita per year from 2006 to 2015, according to OECD-DAC.
&lt;ref name="Girls 2008"/&gt; Education is also key to an effective response to HIV/AIDS. Studies show that educated women are more likely to know how to prevent HIV infection, to delay sexual activity and to take measures to protect themselves.&lt;ref name="Survive p. 2"&gt;Global Campaign for Education. 2004.
Learning to Survive: How Education for All would save millions of young people from HIV/AIDS. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; New analysis by the Global Campaign for Education suggests that if all children received a complete primary education, the economic impact of HIV/AIDS could be greatly reduced and around 700,000 cases of HIV in young adults could be prevented each year—seven million in a decade.&lt;ref name="Survive p. 2"/&gt; According to the Global Campaign for Education, "research shows that a primary education is the minimum threshold needed to benefit from health information programmes. Not only is a basic education essential to be able to process and evaluate information, it also gives the most marginalized groups in society—notably young women—the status and confidence needed to act on information and refuse unsafe sex."&lt;ref name="Survive p. 2"/&gt;

=== Current policies of Progression ===
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from discrimination and equality under the law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; CEDAW has realized the rights and equality of woman is also the key to the survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help African women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"&gt;"CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. Web. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=2011-04-01 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt; Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programmes and the adaptation of teaching methods.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt; Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt; Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programmes of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programmes, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt; Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programmes for girls and women who have left school prematurely.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt; Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt; Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning.&lt;ref name="CEDAW_29"/&gt;

Other global goals echoing these commitments include the World Education Forum’s Dakar platform, which stresses the rights of girls, ethnic minorities and children in difficult circumstances; and A World Fit for Children’s emphasis on ensuring girls’ equal access to and achievement in basic education of good quality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In April 2000 more than 1,100 participants from 164 countries gathered in Dakar, Senegal, for the World Education Forum.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;"Education for All A Framework for Action in Sub-Saharan Africa: Education for African Renaissance in the Twenty-first Century Adopted by the Regional Conference on Education for All for Sub-Saharan Africa." http://www.unesco.org/education. Dec. 1999. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranging from teachers to prime ministers, academics to policymakers, non-governmental bodies to the heads of major international organizations, they adopted the Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments. The goal is education for all as laid out by the World Conference on Education for All&lt;ref&gt;Jomtien, Thailand, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and other international conferences. Between 1990 and 1998 the net enrollment of boys increased by 9 per cent to 56 per cent, and of girls by 7 per cent to 48 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; However, these figures mask considerable regional variations. In countries of the Indian Ocean, both girls and boys attained over 70 per cent net enrollment.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; The most outstanding progress in terms of percentage increase of boys' enrollment was in East Africa, where the net enrollment of boys increased by 27 per cent (to 60 per cent) and of girls by 18 per cent (to 50 per cent).&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; For girls in Southern Africa, the comparable figures for girls were 23 per cent (to 76 per cent) and for boys, 16 per cent (to 58 per cent).&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; This is the resurgence of a vibrant Africa, rich in its cultural diversity, history, languages and arts, standing united to end its marginalization in world progress and development.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; A prosperous Africa, where the knowledge and the skills of its people are its first and most important resource.

The Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) announces a call for the second round of research proposals from research institutions for its Strengthening Gender Research To Improve Girls’ And Women’s Education In Africa initiative. The initiative, which is supported by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), promotes girls and women’s education through the integration of gender into education policy and practice in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="FAWE"&gt;"[http://www.fawe.org/news/news/article.php?article=100 FAWE Calls for Proposals to Conduct Research on Gender and Education in Africa]." FAWE | Forum for African Women Educationalists.&lt;/ref&gt; FAWE believes it is vital to invest in research in Africa as way producing current information for advocacy in education policy. This three-year research initiative aims to work collaboratively with established research institutions to produce pertinent and robust research.&lt;ref name="FAWE"/&gt; That can be used to constructively engage government, policy makers and other regional bodies on strategies to advance girls' education in Africa.&lt;ref name="FAWE"/&gt; Findings from the research will be used to inform FAWE’s advocacy work and help redress gender inequities that hinder women's fulfillment of their right to education and meaningful participation in Africa’s social and economic advancement.

== Major progress in access to education ==
A joint study by the [[World Bank]] and [[Agence française de développement|AFD]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Mingat, A., Lesoux, B., &amp; Rakotomalala, R. (2010). ''L’enseignement post-primaire en Afrique Subsaharienne. Viabilité financière des différentes options de développement''.

The study puts it this way: ''“In the reference year'' ''(2005), our sample of 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had 14.9 million pupils enrolled in the first year of secondary school. If the rate of completion of the primary stage reaches 95% by 2020 with levels of transition from primary to the first year of secondary maintained at their current level in each country, the first year of secondary school would have 37.2 million pupils in 2020, or 2.5 times the current number. If all the pupils finishing primary school could continue with their education, the number of pupils in the first year of secondary school would reach 62.9 million by 2020, a multiplication by 4.2 over the period.”''&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO.

Only a few countries are falling seriously behind in education at the same time as having to address a steady growth in their school-age population: [[Niger]], [[Eritrea]], [[Burundi]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Uganda]] and to a lesser extent [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mozambique]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]] and [[Malawi]] are particularly affected by this dual constraint. The EFA 2012 report highlights great disparities between the sub-Saharan African countries: the percentage of children excluded from primary school is only 7% in [[Gabon]] and 14% in Congo compared to over 55% in Burkina Faso and Niger.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. (2014).

The majority of out-of-school populations are to be found in countries where there is conflict or very weak governance. At the Dakar Forum, the 181 signatory countries of the [[Dakar Framework for Action]] identified armed conflict as well as internal instability within a country as “a major barrier towards attaining Education for All” (EFA) – education being one of the sectors to suffer most from the effects of armed conflict and political instability. In the 2011 EFA Global Monitoring Report, UNESCO pointed out that the countries touched by conflict showed a gross rate of secondary school admissions almost 30% lower than countries of equivalent revenue that were at peace.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;UNESCO. (2011). The hidden crisis: armed conflict and education. ''EFA Global Monitoring Report.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001907/190743e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts also affect the rate of literacy of the population. At the global level, the rate of literacy among adults in countries touched by conflict was 69% in 2010 compared to 85% in peaceful countries. Twenty States in sub-Saharan Africa have been touched by conflict since 1999.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Those countries affected by armed conflict, such as [[Somalia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], are furthest from meeting the EFA goals and contain the majority of the unschooled inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in [[North Kivu]], a region particularly affected by conflicts, for example, the likelihood of young people aged between 17 and 22 having had only two years of schooling was twice the national average.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). Digital Services for Education in Africa. ''Savoirs communs, 17.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than half the children in sub-Saharan Africa can neither read nor write: a quarter of primary school age children reach the fourth year without having acquired the basics and over a third do not reach the fourth year. [A]ccording to the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring Report, “millions of children are leaving school without having acquired basic skills. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, young adults with five years of education had a 40% probability of being illiterate”.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (2010). Reaching the marginalized. ''EFA Global Monitoring Report.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001866/186606E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher training systems are generally not able to meet the quantitive and qualitative needs of training. In Chad, for example, only 35.5% of teachers are certified to teach.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015).

== Educational technology ==
{{Main|Educational technology in sub-Saharan Africa}}

Educational technology in sub-Saharan Africa refers to the promotion, development and use of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT), [[m-learning]], media, and other technological tools to improve aspects of education in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of individual computer technology has proved a major turning point in the implementation of projects dependent on technology use, and calls for the acquisition of computer skills first by teachers and then by pupils. Between 1990 and 2000, multiple actions were started in order to turn technologies into a lever for improving education in sub-Saharan Africa. Many initiatives focused on equipping schools with computer hardware. A number of NGOs contributed, on varying scales, to bringing computer hardware into Africa, such as groups like [[Computer Aid International]], Digital Links, SchoolNet Africa and [[World Computer Exchange]]. Sometimes with backing from cooperation agencies or development agencies like [[USAID]], the African Bank or the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], these individual initiatives grew without adequate coordination. States found it difficult to define their national strategies with regard to [[ICT In Education|ICT in Education]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). Digital Services for Education in Africa. ''Savoirs communs, 17.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The American [[One Laptop per Child|One Laptop per Child (OLPC)]] project, launched in several African countries in 2005, aimed to equip schools with laptop computers at low cost. While the average price of an inexpensive personal computer was between US$ 200 and US$ 500, OLPC offered its ultraportable [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]] computer at the price of US$ 100. This technological breakthrough marked an important step in potential access to ICT. OLPC became an institutional system: the programme was “bought” by governments, which then took responsibility for distribution to the schools. The underlying logic of the initiative was one of centralization, thus enabling the largescale distribution of the equipment. Almost 2 million teachers and pupils are now involved in the programme worldwide (http://one.laptop.org/) and more than 2.4 million computers have been delivered.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). Digital Services for Education in Africa. ''Savoirs communs, 17.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following on from OLPC, the [[Intel|Intel group]] launched [[Classmate PC]], a similar programme also intended for pupils in developing countries. Though it has a smaller presence in sub-Saharan Africa than the OLPC project, Classmate PC has enabled laptop computers to be delivered to primary schools in the [[Seychelles]] and [[Kenya]], particularly in rural areas. Also in Kenya, the [[Computer for School in Kenya|CFSK (Computer for School in Kenya)]] project was started in 2002 with the aim of distributing computers to almost 9,000 schools.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

The cross-fertilization of teaching models and tools has now broadened the potential of ICT within the educational framework. Certain technologies, perceived as outdated compared to more innovative technology, nonetheless remain very much embedded in local practice. Today they are undergoing a partial revival, thanks to the combination of different media that can be used in any single project. Despite its limited uses in teaching, radio is a medium that still has considerable reach in terms of its audience. Cheaper than a computer, it also has a cost-benefit ratio that makes it attractive to many project planners.&lt;ref&gt;Trucano M. (2005). Knowledge Maps: ICT in Education. Washington: infoDev/World Bank. http://www.infodev.org/infodev-files/resource/InfodevDocuments_8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in 2008, the [[BBC Janala]] programme, offering English courses in a combination of different media, including lessons of a few minutes via mobile phone, received more than 85,000 calls per day in the weeks following the launch of the service. In 15 months, over 10 million calls (paid, but at a reduced price compared to a normal communication) were made, by over 3 million users.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). Digital Services for Education in Africa. ''Savoirs communs, 17.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Television, a feature of very many households, is witnessing a revival in its educational uses, by being combined with other media. As part of the Bridge IT programme in Tanzania, short educational videos, also available on mobile phones, are broadcast on the classroom television so that all the pupils can take part collectively. The e-Schools’ Network in South Africa has also, since March 2013, been developing an educational project, the object of which is to exploit unused television frequencies. There are currently ten schools taking part in the project.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; 

Another digital tool with multiple uses, the [[Interactive whiteboard|interactive whiteboard (IWB)]], is also being used in some schools in sub-Saharan Africa. At the end of the 2000s, the Education for All Network (REPTA), in partnership with the [[Digital solidarity fund|Worldwide Fund for Digital Solidarity (FSN)]] and, in France, the interministerial delegation for digital education in Africa (DIENA) made interactive whiteboards available to schools in Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, Senegal and Mali, along with open content. The use of the IWB has had a positive effect on motivation, for pupils and teachers alike. However, their impact in terms of learning has been muted. This system marginalizes the direct participation of the pupils in favour of multi-media demonstrations initiated by the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;AFD. (2010). Bilan critique en matière d’utilisation pédagogique des NTIC dans le secteur de l’éducation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main initiatives based on the use of ICT and the Internet in education originally focused on [[distance learning]] at university level. Thus, the [[African Virtual University|African Virtual University (AVU)]], set up by the World Bank in 1997, was originally conceived as an alternative to traditional teaching. When it became an intergovernmental agency in 2003, it was training 40,000 people, mostly on short programmes. It shifted its focus to teacher training and to integrating technology into higher education. The AVU has ten e-learning centres. The [[Agence universitaire de la Francophonie|Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF)]] has also, since 1999, set up around forty Frenchspeaking digital campuses, more than half of them in Africa. In these infrastructures, dedicated to technology and set up within the universities, the AUF offers access to over 80 first and masters degrees entirely by distance learning, about 30 of which are awarded by African institutions and created with its support. More recently, the [[MOOCs|MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)]] phenomenon has grown up, first in the United States and then in Europe.&lt;ref name=":210"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO.

==Recommendations for reform==
* Government review and regulate school and district financial record-keeping.
* More comprehensive training of head teachers and administrators in economical administration.
* Regular government inspection of schools.
* Encourage parents to complain or fight against schools fees and proactively help parents to know their rights.
* Empower and mobilize local watchdog organizations such as parent-teacher organizations and school-management committees.
* Improve teacher compensation.&lt;ref name="dw-world.de"/&gt;
*Government investment in child and youth development through appropriate education and health     policies and programmes. 
*Increase access to early childhood development programmes. 
*Increase access to schools. 
*Improve transportation infrastructure in rural areas.
*Diversifying systems of education and broadening skills taught to make education more pertinent to     the demands of the economy. 

There is also a push in many African countries to reform colonial education standards to emphasize the importance of indigenous languages and cultures instead of European languages and cultures. Critics of these reforms maintain that European languages should continue to be the focus of education to ensure that African students can be competitive in a European-dominated global economy.

==Recommendations for higher education reform==
* [[Curriculum]] reform geared towards [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] skills and jobs in the [[private sector]].
* Greater emphasis on locally-relevant [[diploma]] and [[Academic certificate|certificate]] programs, instead of overproducing university graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Kigotho| first =Wachira| title =Producing unemployable graduates wastes time and money| newspaper =University World News| date =20 March 2015| url =http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150319130200274| accessdate =21 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees.
*Adoption of a system based on undergraduate and graduate degree cycles.
*Promotion of student and faculty mobility.
**Training and student opportunities should be accessible to students. 
**All educational faculty such as administrative staff, professors, and researchers should have access to services relevant to their fields of study. 

==History==
The origins of African education may be found in [[Egypt]] in [[Northern Africa]].  One of the first convenient mediums for retaining information, papyrus, was used to develop systems for learning and developing new ideas. In fact, one of the first forms of higher education in Africa were the School of Holy Scriptures built in Ethiopia and Al-Azhar which was in Egypt. These schools became cultural and academic centers as many people traveled from all over the globe for knowledge and instruction. Well before contact with external cultures, Africans had developed pools of understanding and educational tools.  In fact, the world’s first university was located in [[Timbuktu]], opened in 2600 BC.

Indigenous knowledge systems, a tradition in which communities teach and learn from themselves through daily life rather than strict education, were also highly important and effective.  The [[apprenticeship]] perspective was of particular use to ancient Africans; by modeling the necessary skills for others, junior members of the community learned to hunt, gather water, hold meetings, etc.  The overall purpose of this task-orientation type of education was to both learn specific skills and "produce an individual who is honest, respectable, skilled, cooperative and conforms to the societal order of the day." &lt;ref name="Fafunwa"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Babs |last=Fafunwa |title=African education and social dynamics |publisher=University of Ghana |year=1962 |location=Accra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of the colonial period in the 19th century marked the beginning of the end for traditional African education.  European forces, [[missionaries]], and colonists all came ready and willing to change existing traditions to meet their own needs and ambitions. Colonial powers such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and France colonized the continent without putting in a system of education. Because the primary focus of colonization was reaping benefits from commercial colonial economies, cash crop production, extraction of raw materials, other physically laborious tasks were prioritized. These economies did not expand to require jobs of a higher skill set or more labor, therefore intensive labor that required little skill was high in demand. Because of such circumstances there was little demand to educate or train the colonized populations. Furthermore, colonial powers were unwilling to offer education to those they colonized unless it benefited them. Either colonial powers did not view investing in African education as a practical use of their revenue or they refrained from educating Africans in order to avoid any uprisings. Those in positions of authority were in fear of access to widespread access to higher education specifically. Colonial powers often found themselves in a debate whether or not to educate their colonized populations and if so, to what extent. Specifically, the British Education Committee of the Privy Council advocated for vocational education and training rather than one focused on academia. This vocational training however neglected professions such as engineering, technology, or similar subjects. Instead the vocational training had a dominant racial overtone which stressed African training for skills fitting with their assumed social and mental inadequacy. Notably, the Belgians under King Leopold prohibited access to higher education in their colonies whereas other colonial powers put in barriers in infrastructure or access such as limiting language of instruction to the language of the colonizer, limits on teaching curriculums, and ensuring the curriculum did not reflect any Afro-ethnicity. By demanding that communities create physical schools with strict [[curriculum]], the foreign powers were able to dictate what the people learned, adjusting it to further their agenda.  This not only forced new form and content to education, but abandoned the knowledge gained from the largely informal education.  With less community awareness, efficiency in learning skills, and especially understanding of the past, African communities began to dwindle in education and prosperity. Aspects of colonialism are still prevalent in African countries that struggled to escape effects of colonization today.   

Between the 1950s and 1990s, African countries finally regained their independence.  With this recovered freedom, they began to rebuild their traditional forms of education.  What had inevitably evolved, however, was a hybrid of the two models. With the collaboration of donor agencies and Western demand, pushes for development of African education and the building of human capital dominated global conversation. Namely, the 1960s were known as the First Development Decade by the UN. Policymakers prioritized secondary and tertiary education before also setting their sights for universal primary education around 1980. This set the precedent for educational planning. Although children and adults may learn from their families and community, a sense of individuality has also developed that today both drives ingenuity and creates separation between groups and cultural tradition.  African education programs have developed that involve both groups; an [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] awareness program, for example, may involve members coming into communities and sharing their knowledge.  Although this is a direct, cognitive approach, they also try to involve all members of the community, allowing for the creation of ownership and cultural acceptance.

[[Image:Flipchart1-Asio.JPG|thumb|A flip chart]]
A '''flip chart''' is a [[stationery]] item consisting of a pad of large [[paper]] sheets. It is typically fixed to the upper edge of a [[whiteboard]], typically supported on a [[tripod]] or four-legged easel. Such charts are commonly used for [[presentation]]s.

==Flip charts==
Although most commonly supported on a tripod, flip charts come in various forms. Some of these are:
* stand-alone flip chart: resembles a big isosceles triangle box that usually sits on a table. Imagine a book that you would open at 270° angle and then lay on a table. The paper is flipped from one side of the top of the triangle box to the other.
* metallic tripod (or easel) stand: usually has 3 or 4 metallic legs that are linked together at one extremity. A support board is attached to two of these legs to support the large paper pad. This is the most common type of flip chart stand.
* metallic mount on wheels: usually has a flat base to support the paper pad and is mounted on one or two legs that then have a set of wheels. The advantage of these more recent forms of stands is that it is easier to transport the flip chart from one location to another.

Text is usually [[handwriting|hand written]] with [[marker pen]]s and may include figures or charts. A sheet can be flipped over by the presenter to continue to a new page.

Some flip charts may have a reduced version of the page that faces the audience printed on the back of the preceding page, making it possible for the presenter to see the same thing the audience is seeing. Others have teaching notes printed on the back.

Flip charts are used in many different settings such as:
* in any type of presentation where the papers pads are pre-filled with information on a given topic
* for capturing information in meetings and brainstorming sessions
* in classrooms and teaching institutions of any kind
* to record relevant information in manufacturing plants
* a creative drawing board for Art students
* a palette for artists in “life-drawing” classes
* for strategy coaching for sports teams
* for teaching

A variety of paper sizes are used from the floor standing through to the smaller table-top versions, subject to the country's adopted paper sizes. These include [[A1 paper size|A1]], B1, 25" x30" through to 20" x 23".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staples.co.uk/SearchEngine-flip+chart http://www.staples.co.uk/SearchEngine-flip+chart]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staples.com/flipi+chart/directory_flipi+chart? http://www.staples.com/flipi+chart/directory_flipi+chart?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known patent of a flipchart is from May 8, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Patent US1087336 USPTO&lt;/ref&gt; Flip charts have being in use from the 1900s, the earliest recorded use of a flip chart is a photo from 1912 of John Henry Patterson (1844-1922), NCR’s CEO while addressing the 100 Point Club standing next to a pair of flip charts on casters.&lt;ref&gt;The Patterson Principles of Selling, by Jeffrey Gitomer, 2014 (page 53)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The flipchart we know (on a small whiteboard) was invented by Peter Kent in the 1970s. Peter Kent was the founder and CEO of the visual communications group Nobo plc, and it is believed&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{By whom|date=November 2018}} that they were the first company to put the large pieces of paper over whiteboards, rather than over other materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Digital==
Recently{{when|date=May 2013}}, scientists have developed a digital self writing flip chart which writes word for word everything it is instructed to record. The disability action group "Armless" has stated that this is a significant step forward for disabilities groups to have conferences like people without disabilities.
Also available are flipchart stands which are self heightening.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A '''hand boiler''' or (less commonly) '''love meter''' is a [[glass sculpture]] used as an [[experimental]] tool to demonstrate [[vapour-liquid equilibrium]], or as a [[collector's item]] to whimsically "measure love." It consists of a lower [[bulb]] containing a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid and a mixture of gases that is connected usually by a twisting [[glass tube]] that connects to an upper or "receiving" glass bulb.
[[File:Pen Finger Boiler.jpg|thumb|Hand boiler toy, built into a ballpoint pen. The warmth from the fingertips vaporizes some of the red liquid inside the tube, causing it to rise and bubble up into the top chamber as if the liquid was boiling.  ]]
==Mechanics==
A hand boiler functions similar to the "[[drinking bird]]" toy:&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  {{cite journal|last1=Ucke|first1=Christian|last2=Schlichting|first2=Hans-Joachim|title=Der Kaffeekugelschreiber oder das Liebesthermometer|journal=Physik in unserer Zeit|date=1995|volume=26|issue=4|pages=192–193|trans-title=The coffee-percolator pen or the love thermometer|language=German}}  Available at: [http://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/fachbereich_physik/didaktik_physik/publikationen/kaffeekugelschreiber_liebesthermometer.pdf University of Münster (Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany)]
*  {{cite book|last1=Ucke|first1=Christian|last2=Schlichting|first2=Hans-Joachim|title=Spiel, Physik und Spaß: Physik zum Mitdenken und Nachmachen|trans-title=Playing, physics and fun: physics to follow along and replicate|date=2011|publisher=Wiley VHC Verlag &amp; Co.|location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=78–79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGDYuxw74vgC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper and lower bulbs of the device are at different temperatures, and therefore the vapor pressure in the two bulbs is different.  Since the lower bulb is warmer, the vapor pressure in it is higher.  The difference in vapor pressure forces the liquid from the lower bulb to the upper bulb.  Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta h = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;

where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt; = the height of the column of fluid above the fluid's level in the lower bulb&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; = the difference in vapor pressure between the two bulbs (which can be determined via the [[Antoine equation]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = the density of the liquid&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; = the acceleration of gravity at the Earth's surface

The liquid inside a hand boiler does not actually boil. The "boiling" is caused by the relationship between the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] of a gas. As the temperature of a gas in a closed container rises, the pressure also rises. There must be a temperature (and pressure) difference between the two large chambers for the liquid to move. When held upright (with the smaller bulb on top), the liquid will move from the bulb with the higher pressure to the bulb with lower pressure. As the gas continues to expand, the gas will then bubble through the liquid, making it appear to boil. The fact that the liquid is volatile (easily vaporized) makes the hand boiler more effective. Adding heat to the liquid produces more gas, also increasing pressure in the closed container.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/hand-boiler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a hand boiler is used to show properties of [[distillation]]. Since the liquid both [[evaporates]] and [[condenses]] at relatively cool temperatures while in an enclosed system, the boiler can be turned upside down, and the top end can be placed in ice water. The gaseous form of the liquid will condense in the cooled chamber. Since the liquid is often colored with dye, but the dye does not evaporate or condense at the same temperature, the liquid that condenses in the cooled chamber is colorless, leaving the [[pigment]] behind.

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, hand boilers used to be sometimes known as "love meters" because the tube that separates the upper and lower bulbs is twisted into a heart shape and the volatile liquid is colored red. Love meters were a common collector's item or a souvenir. Depending on how the item was packaged, one would grasp the lower bulb to "prove" how passionate one was, or a couple would each grasp one end to see who would force the liquid into the other's bulb.

Hand boilers are much more commonly used as a scientific novelty today.

== History ==

Hand boilers date back at least as early as 1767, when the American polymath [[Benjamin Franklin]] encountered them in Germany.  He developed an improved version in 1768,&lt;ref&gt;See:

[[Image:DieterichCaracas2 (cropped).JPG|thumb|200px|right|Heinz Dieterich lectures about ''21st Century Socialism'' at the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth|WFDY]], Caracas, 2005]]
'''Heinz Dieterich''' or '''Heinz Dieterich Steffan''' (born 1943) is a [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]] and a [[political]] analyst residing in [[Mexico]]. He is better known for his [[political left|leftist]] ideals. He contributes to several journals and has published more than 30 books about conflict in Latin America, global society and the ideological controversies that characterised the 20th century, among other philosophical and social scientific topics.

== Life ==
Dieterich was born in 1943 in [[Rotenburg an der Wümme]]. After completing his university studies in [[sociology]] in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Bremen]], he moved to [[Latin America]]. Since 1977 he has been a professor in sociology and methodology at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in [[Mexico, D.F.]]. Since then he has shown a lot of interest in politics and [[social movements]] in Latin America, and documented a great deal of their activity.

He is considered one of the most important figures in the "[[New School of Bremen]]" in sociology, constituted by [[Arno Peters]], [[Carsten Stahmer]], and the Cuban physicist [[Raimundo Franco]]. This school implements principles of [[cybernetics]], [[quantum mechanics]] and the "principle of equivalence" to sociology. In 1996, Steffan contributed to the creation of the alternative information website [[Rebelion.org]], where he contributes regularly.

== Ideological contributions ==
Steffan's contributions represent one of the most relevant references to analyse the theoretical and practical implications of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[anticapitalism|anticapitalist]] [[leftist|leftist movements]] that followed the fall of the [[USSR]].  His contributions suggest an alternative economic, political and social project, which the [[alter-globalization|alter-globalistic]] movements lacked during the 1990s.

In his book ''[[Socialism of the 21st century|The Socialism of the 21st century]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Sozialismus des 21. Jahrhunderts}}), Steffan explains the theoretical basis of the new socialism, which finds its most practical application in the revolutionary process of [[Venezuela]], and to a lesser extent in [[Bolivia]] and [[Ecuador]].  Dieterich was an advisor of the Venezuelan government.

Some of his most important books are "Global Society" and "Latin America: From Colonization to Globalization", which he wrote in cooperation with [[Noam Chomsky]].

His ideas have raised several controversies, especially in Venezuela. The Marxist theoretician [[Alan Woods (politician)|Alan Woods]] has written a whole book against his allegedly [[reformist]] positions, ''Reformism or Revolution - A Reply to Heinz Dieterich''. However, his relationship with Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] deteriorated after he defended [[Raúl Baduel|General Baduel]], who led the "no" campaign in the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007|2007 constitutional referendum]]. On 15 August 2011 he submitted an article to the website kaosenlared.net where he explained the reasons over his break with Chávez.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20111225124652/http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/dia-de-ruptura-con-hugo-chavez&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30648">'''[[Higher education]] in [[Ukraine]]''' operates several levels, all of which are regulated by the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]]. In early 2016, Ukraine had 802 universities,&lt;ref name="umewfu" /&gt; but the Ministry intends to lower that number to 317.&lt;ref name="umewfu" /&gt;  In 2016-17, the number of students in higher education was 1,586,700.

For specific universities, see the [[List of universities in Ukraine]].

== Brief historical survey ==
The first higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in [[Ukraine]] during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the [[Ostroh Academy|Ostrozka School]], or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest [[university]] was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognized by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865), and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kiev]] (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipro|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organizations.

The ''[[Constitution of Ukraine]] (1996)'', ''Law on Education (1996)'', the ''Law on Higher Education (2002)'' and the major reform legislation ''Law on Higher Education (2014)'' constitute the legal framework for Ukrainian higher education.  Ukrainian legislation regulating higher education includes also more limited legislation as well as decrees and regulations of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

Because of a perceived lack of quality, 76 higher education institutions and their branches were denied licenses in 2015.&lt;ref name=umewfu&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7100764/ Ministry of Education will close 10 more schools], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (1 March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Access and affordability==
{{see also|External independent evaluation}}
As with most communist Soviet and Eastern European states access to education for the masses was deemed a high priority, this was largely due to the fact that during imperial times mostly only the nobles and the wealthy had access to post secondary institutions. Citizens of the [[Soviet Union]] had free access to secondary education and were required to complete at least a junior specialist degree, equivalent to an associate degree in the US. Moreover, the Soviet Union exercised mandatory conscription of its male population, however those studying for a degree were exempt from the draft until the completion of their studies, therefore men would often stay enrolled to reach master's degrees to delay their entry into the military.

After gaining independence Ukraine retained the Soviet principle of having a post secondary education system that is affordable to its population. In 2009 Ukraine spent 7.3% of GDP on education compared to the United States' 5.2%. Trade schools (Technikums), which are analogous to community colleges in the US and award the junior specialist degree continued to remain freely accessible by most citizens, students wishing to enroll in a trade school do not need to complete the full 11 grades of school and may enroll in 9th grade. However budget constraints forced tuition charges on University programs. Students wishing to enroll in universities must complete the full secondary education curriculum, during the last year of school they take a placement test which determines their chances of enrolling and whether or not they will have to pay tuition or not. Moreover, students enrolled may receive a monthly stipend which is designed to cover their living and school expenses while they are enrolled in college. In 2012 the minimum monthly stipend was 550 UAH for students enrolled in Technikums and 730 UAH for students enrolled in Universities. In 2016 tuition costs for higher education were averaging less than $1,000 per academic year; but because of [[corruption in Ukraine#Corruption in higher education|corruption]] students costs were considerably higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/trading-bribes-for-diplomas-in-ukraines-universities-taxes-transparency-education-corruption/ In Ukraine’s universities, trading bribes for diplomas], [[Politico Europe]] (30 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Students pursuing a doctoral degree beyond Specialist or master's degree are generally treated in a similar manner to graduate students in the US where they are expected to assist the faculty and may receive pay from the university as they perform their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.roditeli.ua/deti/education/scholarship_from_1_september|title=Стипендия с 1 сентября повысится|publisher=Roditeli.ua|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS|title=Public Sector Spending on Education by country|publisher=World Bank|date=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although online education is not predominant in Ukraine students may enroll in extramural college, which is the most common type of long distance education in Ukraine and many other former Soviet nations. During this type of enrollment the student continues to work and is given all of their assignments for the semester ahead of time. The student completes the assignments then returns to the university to explain their reasoning and complete testing. Many businesses in Ukraine subsidize their employees who return to pursue a higher degree using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spbstu.ru/education/higher_edu/edu_dl.asp |title=заочное обучение |publisher=St. Petersburg State University |date=2014-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915025109/http://www.spbstu.ru/education/higher_edu/edu_dl.asp |archivedate=2014-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ubr.ua/labor-market/education/v-nogu-so-vremenem-distancionnoe-obrazovanie-na-prostorah-ukrainy-132938|title=В НОГУ СО ВРЕМЕНЕМ: ДИСТАНЦИОННОЕ ОБРАЗОВАНИЕ НА ПРОСТОРАХ УКРАИНЫ|publisher=UBR|date=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher education qualifications ==
Higher education qualifications combine both academic and professional qualifications. This is a very important feature of Ukrainian higher education inherited from its Soviet past. The State Diploma serves as both an educational certificate and a professional license. Employment is determined by a match between the state determination of the knowledge and skills required for different occupation levels and the state determination of levels of educational qualification. Hence is the correspondence between classification of educational qualification and that of the occupational structure, leading to the introduction of the term ‘educational-proficiency’ level.

The ''Law on Higher Education'' (2002) establishes a three-level structure of higher education: incomplete, basic, and complete educational levels with corresponding educational-proficiency levels of Junior Specialist, Bachelor, Specialist and Master. In 2016 the Ministry of Education transformed this system to the levels of Junior bachelor, bachelor's, master's, [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and [[Doktor nauk|Doctor of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Ministry of Education cancels"/&gt;

===Junior Specialist===
'''''Junior Specialist or Junior bachelor''''' is an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who on the basis of complete [[secondary education]] has attained incomplete higher education, special skills and knowledge sufficient for discharging productive functions at a certain level of professional activity, stipulated for initial positions in a certain type of economic activity. The normative period of training makes 2.5–3 years.

Persons with basic secondary education may study in the educational and professional programs of junior specialist’s training, obtaining at the same time complete secondary education.

===Bachelor===
'''''Bachelor''''' is an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who on the basis of complete [[secondary education]] has attained basic higher education, fundamental and special skills and knowledge, sufficient to cope with tasks and duties (work) at a certain level of professional activity (in economy, science, engineering, culture, arts, etc.). The normative period of training makes 4 years (240 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits).

Training specialists of the educational-proficiency level of Bachelor may be carried out according to the shortened programme of studies on the basis of the educational- proficiency level of Junior Specialist.

===Master===
'''''Master''''' is an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who has attained complete higher education, special skills and knowledge, sufficient to cope with professional tasks and duties (work) of innovative character at a certain level of professional activity (in engineering, business administration, pedagogy, arts, etc.).

Training specialists of the educational-proficiency level of Master may also be carried out on the basis of the educational-proficiency level of [[Specialist degree|Specialist]]. The period of training makes typically 1–1.5 year (60-90 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits).

During his/her studies at the Master’s or Specialist's level, students are required to write his/her final work on a selected subject and make its presentation, to be able to collect, analyse and summarize, synthesize and to communicate study and practical material; often knowledge of a foreign language is required.

Training specialists of the educational-proficiency level of Specialist or Master in such [[field of study|fields]] as [[medicine]], [[dentistry]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[teaching]]  is carried out on the basis of complete [[secondary education]] within the period of 5–6 years (301-360 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits) (as is common in [[Western Europe]] for state registered [[profession]]s).

===Former higher education qualifications ===

====Specialist====
'''''[[Specialist degree|Specialist]]''''' was an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who on the basis of the educational-proficiency level of Bachelor had attained complete higher education, special skills and knowledge, sufficient to cope with tasks and duties (work) at a certain level of professional activity (in economy, science, engineering, culture, arts, etc.). The normative period of training was 1 year (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits). In 2016 the specialist degree was disbanded in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Education cancels"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://life.pravda.com.ua/technology/2016/07/11/215073 Ministry of Education cancels the "experts" and "Ph.D."], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (11 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diplomas and Certificates ==
Higher education [[Graduation|graduates]] are awarded qualifications of the appropriate educational-proficiency levels and they are granted [[diploma]]s of the state format. The Diploma is the State-recognized document which serves as both an educational certificate and a professional licence, confirming the attainment of the appropriate higher educational level and qualification of a certain educational-proficiency level (an [[academic degree]] in a [[field of study]] and speciality). The ''Law on Higher Education'' (2002) establishes the following types of documents that confirm higher education qualifications:
*''Dyplom Molodshoho Spetsialista'' (Diploma/ qualification of Junior Specialist)
*''Dyplom Bakalavra'' (Diploma/ qualification of Bachelor)
*''Dyplom Spetsialista'' (Diploma/ qualification of [[Specialist degree|Specialist]])
*''Dyplom Mahistra'' (Diploma/ qualification of Master)

== Quality assurance ==
The national system of quality assurance (QA) in Ukraine is realized by means of licensing and [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] procedures carried out by the Department for Licensing, Accreditation and Nostrification of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, through the State Accreditation Commission, the State Inspectorate of HEIs, and the Higher (Supreme) Attestation Board.

=== Licensing ===
The ''Law on Higher Education'' (2002) stipulates that educational establishments in Ukraine including those owned privately must be licensed before they can offer tertiary level educational programmes. To be granted a licence a HEI must meet the required standards set by the Ministry of Education and Science for higher education status at a certain level. These standards refer to: physical infrastructure, equipment and facilities, the learning resources (library and other media materials), the logistical, scientific-methodological and information base, and the number and qualification level of its staff, appropriate to the area of education and research in which it intends to offer programmes of study. The licence process assesses the list of subjects, the content of the educational programme of these subjects and the assessment tools used to examine students.

Licensed HEIs are listed in the Ministry’s Public Register of HEIs.

=== Accreditation===
In Ukraine accreditation procedures include both [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] of the programmes of study in a certain [[field of study]] and speciality offered by HEIs, and institutional accreditation of HEIs.

==== Accreditation of programmes of study====
To have a study programme accredited in a certain [[field of study]] and speciality a HEI must meet the demands of the higher education standards in terms of educational and professional provision offered by it. Programmes of study are accredited in relation to the relevant qualification associated with a certain educational-proficiency level, and thus at a certain level of [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]].

==== Institutional accreditation of HEIs ====
The status of a HEI is determined by the proportion of programmes that it has accredited at particular levels. A higher education institution may receive institutional accreditation at a certain level, if at least two thirds of its specialities (specialisms) have already received [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] at this level.

The Law of Ukraine ''On Higher Education'' (2002) establishes four levels of accreditation of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=2984%2D14&amp;p=1157311622966330 ''Law on Higher Education'' (2002) Закон України "Про вищу освіту"]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Higher education institutions of the first accreditation level train ''Junior specialists'';
#Higher education institutions of the second accreditation level train ''Junior specialists'' and/or ''Bachelors'';
#Higher education institutions of the third accreditation level train ''Bachelors'', ''[[Specialist degree|Specialist]]s'' and, in certain [[profession]]s (specialities), ''Masters'';
#Higher education institutions of the fourth accreditation level train ''Bachelors'', ''Masters'' and ''[[Specialist degree|Specialist]]s''. Additional criteria for the institutions of the fourth accreditation level include [[postgraduate]] and [[Doctoral]] courses, high-level [[research]] and [[publication]]s activities.

== Level structure of HEIs ==
There are six types of higher education institutions in Ukraine:&lt;ref&gt;''Law on Higher Education (2002), Article 25''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of universities in Ukraine|Universities]]: have fourth level of accreditation and may be multi-disciplinary establishments (follow a classical university model) or ‘branch’ (mono-disciplinary/specialist) establishments (focused on some particular professional field (Technical, Medical, Agricultural, Pedagogical, Economics, etc.)). They act as leading research and methodological centres in both fundamental and [[applied research]].
* [[List of academies in Ukraine|Academies]]: have fourth level of accreditation.  Their educational provision is concentrated in a specific branch of knowledge in which they also act as leading research and methodological centres in both fundamental and [[applied research]] fields;
* [[Institute]]s: have third and fourth level of accreditation. Their educational provision is concentrated in a specific branch of knowledge in which they also conduct research and methodological research in both fundamental and applied fields.  They may be independent or a sub-unit of a [[university]] or [[academy]];
* [[Conservatoire]]s: have third and fourth level of accreditation. Their educational provision is concentrated in culture and the arts, specifically music.  They also conduct research and act as leading centres in the areas of their activity;
* [[College]]s: have second level of accreditation largely related to the provision of training leading to the acquisition of specific higher education qualifications.  They may also constitute sub-units within higher education establishments with third and fourth level accreditation;
* [[Technical School]]s: have first level of accreditation.  They carry out educational activity leading to specialist areas of knowledge and skills related to specific occupations. They may also constitute sub-units within higher education establishments with third and fourth level accreditation.

=== Types of Universities (Academies) ===
The Ministry of Education and Science (Sports and Youth) recognizes the following categories of institutions of the
top-level accreditation:
* Classical Universities
* Technical Universities
* Technological (Construction, Transportation)
* Pedagogical (Humanitarian, Physical Education and Sports)
* Culture (Arts, Design)
* Health Care Universities
* Agrarian Universities
* Economics (Finance, Administration, Entrepreneurship)
* Law (Law enforcement, Civil protection and life safety)
* Private Universities

===National Universities===
[[File:Cernauti Residentia 03.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Chernivtsi University]].]]
Higher education institutions with 4th accreditation level may be bestowed the status of ‘''National''’ for outstanding performance in research and scientific activity. This status brings with it added powers in relation to [[immovable property]], facilities, enterprises, institutions and other structural sub-units of the HEI; the award of professorial status; and ‘symbiotic’ and material incentives and rewards for [[employee]]s of the HEI.&lt;ref&gt;''Law on Higher Education (2002), Article 26''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it also accrues an additional budget for research activities.

== Postgraduate education ==
In Ukraine, postgraduate education is regarded as specialist education and professional training commencing after the [[Specialist degree|Specialist]], Master phase.&lt;ref&gt;PROJECT: TERTIARY EDUCATION ASSESSMENT UKRAINE. EUROPEAN UNION. DELEGATION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO UKRAINE.- 2007. - P.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Law of Higher Education (Article 10)'' and the ''Law on Education (Article 47)'' regard Post-Graduate education as specialised [[education]] and [[Professional development|professional training]] on the basis of the previously obtained educational-proficiency level and experience of the practical work. It is defined as [[retraining]], specialisation within a [[profession]]; expansion of the professional profile; probation within a profession, i.e. post-qualifying education or [[continuous professional development]]. The system of postgraduate training serves as a ground for [[lifelong learning]].

=== Lifelong learning ===
There is a long tradition and pride in this kind of educational provision for ‘[[continuing education]]’ and for ‘social inclusion’, that continues today. [[Lifelong learning]] (LLL) is conceptualized on the one hand as the progression through [[Academic degree|academic qualifications]]: Bachelor, [[Specialist degree|Specialist]], Master, [[Candidate of Science]], [[Doctor of Science]]. On the other hand, it also covers a wide range of educational courses designed for: ‘second chance’ [[student]]s; for those who wish to change occupations; for [[on-the-job training]] for citizens in [[employment]]; for updating [[professional]]s; for second diplomas where only the specialist part of the [[curriculum]] needs to be followed; and to provide [[secondary school]] [[Academic certificate|certificate]] for those who left school without qualification.

== Doctoral degrees ==
At the doctoral level, Ukraine has a two-degree system. The first qualification is the '''''[[Candidate of Sciences]]''''' (scientific degree of ''[[Kandydat Nauk]]'') which normally requires at least three years of study after the award of the [[Specialist degree|Specialist]] or the Master [[diploma]] and is achieved by submitting and defending a [[thesis]] ([[dissertation]]), as well as following [[post-graduate studies]] (''[[aspirantura]]'') in the specialist field. The second qualification is the '''''[[Doctor of Sciences]]''''' (scientific degree of ''[[Doktor Nauk]]''), the highest degree in Ukraine which is achieved by [[dissertation]] that must make an original contribution to a given field of learning, and after a period of further studies (''doktorantura'') following the award of [[Kandidat Nauk]] degree.

Doctoral study programmes (post-graduate course, [[aspirantura]] – for [[Kandydat Nauk]] degree and doctoral course, doktorantura – for [[Doktor Nauk]] degree) can be opened in higher education institutions of the third and fourth levels of accreditation or in [[research institute]]s and their branches.

The two [[doctoral degree]]s can be earned in two ways: as a result of studies in [[aspirantura]] and doktorantura or independently. The public defense of the [[dissertation]] is held in the form of a public [[presentation]] and [[scientific debate]]s.

Professors have different ranks within the university system. For example a Dosent (Доцент) is analogous to an assistant professor in the United States.

==International study and student exchange==
According to 2013 figures of the [[Ministry of Education (Ukraine)|Minister of Education]] there are 61,000 foreign students in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/foreign-students-bring-over-uah-4-b-to-ukraines-treasury-this-academic-year-says-minister/ Foreign students bring over UAH 4 b to Ukraine’s treasury this academic year, says minister], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (14 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 International Admission Center with support of [[Ministry of Education (Ukraine)|Ministry of Education]] founded the [[Ukrainian Admission Center]] for foreign students
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukraine.admission.center/ With support of Ministry of education founded official Ukrainian Admission Center], [[Ministry of Education (Ukraine)]] (01 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputations==
According to [[Frances Cairncross]] (in April 2010) “There are too many small universities, the majority of which are ineffectively governed and mired in [[Corruption in Ukraine#Corruption in higher education|corruption]]. They are not able to withstand existing global challenges.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/education-problems-deeper-than-language-63027.html Education problems deeper than language], [[Kyiv Post]] (2 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Anders Åslund]] (in October 2012) the quality of doctoral education is bad, particularly in management training, economics, law and languages.&lt;ref name=AAonUESO12&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/why-ukraine-keeps-falling-behind-educationally-economically-313833.html Outdated educational system translates into lagging economy], [[Kyiv Post]] (4 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; He also signaled that the greatest problem in the Ukrainian education system is corruption.&lt;ref name=AAonUESO12/&gt;

76 higher education institutions and their branches were denied licenses by the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]] in 2015 because of a perceived lack of quality (education).&lt;ref name="umewfu"/&gt;

In 2017, the highest average scores on the national entrance exam (External Independent Evaluation) were had by students entering the [[Ukrainian Catholic University]], [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]], and the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/vnz-rate/29012005.html|title=How to find the best university in Ukraine? (2017 version)|last=[in Ukrainian]|first=|date=|website=RadioSvoboda.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International rankings===
No Ukrainian university has ever been ranked in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanghairanking.com/Search.jsp Ranking per country], [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]&lt;/ref&gt; nor in the [[Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ranking.heeact.edu.tw/en-us/2011/Country/All Top Universities by Countries], [[Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[QS World University Rankings]] 2013/14 listed four Ukrainian HEIs including [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]] (ranked 441-450), [[Kyiv Polytechnic Institute]] (601-650), [[Donetsk National University]] and [[Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute]] (both 701+).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013#sorting=rank+region=+country=207+faculty=+stars=false+search= Rankings Ukraine], [[QS World University Rankings]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Webometrics Ranking of World Universities]], Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (838th) is the highest ranked university, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, [[Kharkiv National University]] and [[Odessa University]] (1788th) are (also) ranked in the top 2000, and 303 are ranked lower than that (the lowest is Kherson State Maritime Academy at place 20,942).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webometrics.info/en/Europe/Ukraine%20 Rankings Ukraine], [[Webometrics Ranking of World Universities]]&lt;/ref&gt; Four Ukrainian Universities were ranked in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] for the 2016-2017 school year, Lviv Polytechnic National University, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and the Karazin Kharkiv National University, which were all ranked in the 801+ category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/35/length/25/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only|title=World University Rankings 2016-2017|publisher=Times Higher Education World University Rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Ukraine's Higher Education system was ranked as the top in Eastern Europe by Universitas 21, ahead of Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, Russia and Slovakia. The research group cited high Education spending as a proportion of GDP compared to other nations as a likely cause of Ukraine having the best post secondary system in East Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://wnu-ukraine.com/news/culture-lifestyle/?id=1688&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Japan Teachers Union''' |日本教職員組合 |''Nihon Kyōshokuin Kumiai'' | extra=JTU}}, abbreviated {{nihongo|"Nikkyoso"|日教組|''Nikkyōso''}}, is Japan's largest and oldest [[trade union|labor union]] of teachers and school staff. The union is known for its critical stance against the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] government on such issues as ''[[Kimi ga Yo]]'' (the national anthem), the [[Flag of Japan]], and the screening of [[Japanese history textbook controversies|history textbooks]] since its near continuous one-party rule since 1945. It is affiliated to the trade union confederation [[RENGO|Rengo]]. It had 290,857 members as of December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Rengo website [http://www.jtuc-rengo.org/about/data/erng_pam_2010.pdf Rengo brochure 2010-2011] Retrieved on July 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established in 1947, it was the largest teachers union until a split in the late 1980s. The union functioned as a national federation of prefectural teachers unions, although each of these unions had considerable autonomy and its own strengths and political orientation. Historically, there had been considerable antagonism between the union and the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]], owing to a variety of factors. Some were political, because the stance of the union had been strongly [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and it often opposed the more conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Another factor was the trade union perspective that the teachers union had on the profession of teaching. Additional differences on education issues concerned training requirements for new teachers, [[decentralization]] in education, school autonomy, [[curriculum|curricula]], textbook censorship, and, in the late 1980s, the reform movement.

[[Karel van Wolferen]] describes the historical clashes between the Ministry of Education and the Union in ''[[The Enigma of Japanese Power]]'' (e.g., former Ministers coming from the Naimusho "Thought Police" of the 1930s, using thugs to systematically attack Union members and union meetings and eliminate elected Boards of Education).

The union tended to support the [[Japan Socialist Party]], while a minority faction supported the [[Japan Communist Party]]. In the late 1980s, internal disagreements in the Japan Teachers Union on political orientation and on the union's relationships to other national labor organizations finally caused a rupture. The union thus became less effective than in previous years at a time when the national government and the Ministry were moving ahead on reform issues. The union had opposed many reforms proposed or instituted by the ministry, but it failed to forestall changes in certification and teacher training, two issues on which it was often at odds with the government. The new union leadership that emerged after several years of internal discord seemed to take a more conciliatory approach to the ministry and reform issues, but the union's future directions were not clear.

The [[National Union of General Workers]] (Zenkoku Ippan Rodo Kumiai) serves as the largest union representing foreign and migrant education workers in Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">'''Justin Georgescu''' (June 11, 1922 – August 1942) was a [[Romania]]n [[Communism|communist]] activist and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] militant assassinated in police custody during [[World War II]].

Born in [[Bucharest]], Romania's capital, in 1922, Justin Georgescu became an orphan at an early age. After finishing primary school, in 1933 he entered in the [[Matei Basarab National College (Bucharest)|Matei Basarab High School]], where he was one of the top students. By autumn 1939, Georgescu took contact with communist ideals, becoming a member of the clandestine [[Union of Communist Youth]] (UTC). In the following months he took part in several action of the group, spreading manifestos and leaflets against [[Carol II]]'s [[1938 Constitution of Romania|authoritarian regime]] and its alignment with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. He also organized a protest of the students with communist sympathies against an initiative of his high school that would have eliminated poor students. Soon after, the UTC nominated him as leader of a "technical group", responsible for propaganda work in Bucharest's [[Sector 6 (Bucharest)|Green Sector]].

In 1941, Georgescu enrolled in the Faculty of Letters of the [[University of Bucharest]], and in spring 1942 he was elected a member in the leadership of the university's UTC cell. There he continued the anti-fascist propaganda by spreading manifestos condemning the pro-fascist dictatorship of ''Conducător'' [[Ion Antonescu]] and Romania's collaboration with Nazi Germany in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], as well as presenting the achievements of the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] and of the other [[Resistance during World War II|European resistance movements]] in the fight against the [[Axis powers]]. Manifestos also demanded that Romania sign a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

On August 29, 1942 he was arrested while going to a secret meeting of the UTC. After being tortured in Bucharest's Police Headquarters, he was ultimately killed. In an attempt to cover the murder, and present it as a suicide, his body was thrown out of a window.

After the [[Romanian Communist Party]] came to power in Romania, Justin Georgescu, along other young Romanian anti-fascists fallen during World War II, was honoured as a "Hero of the youth".

===Activities===
Keshet Eilon is involved in a variety of activities

'''Summer seminar and master classes'''

Every year a three week long international seminar is being held in Kibbutz Eilon, where students attend private lessons and master classes with prominent violin masters, [[Haim Taub]], [[Edward Grach]], [[Itzhak Rashkovsky]], [[Ani Schnarch]], [[Vadim Gluzman]] and [[Hagai Shaham]], to name just a few.

'''Learning Link Ghana'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learninglinkghana.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a UK-based registered [[Charitable organization|charity]]. Its mission is to support the advancement of education of children in [[Kumasi]], [[Ghana]], and in particular the [[City of Kumasi Preparatory School]], by providing or assisting in the provision of facilities, which would not be otherwise available.  It arranges sponsorship for children who, because of [[poverty]], would miss the opportunity to receive basic education, especially girls and children with [[special educational needs]]. In addition, it aims to promote friendship and exchange programmes between children in Ghana and the UK.

== History ==
Learning Link Ghana was founded in 1999 by Frank Nkansa-Dwamena.

Frank's father, Nana Nkansa-Dwamena, founded the City of Kumasi School, in [[Kumasi]], [[Ghana]], in 1966 and remained as Principal until his death in 1998, at which time Frank returned to Ghana to become the Managing Director of the school.

Frank is a former Head of Special Education at the [[London Borough of Brent]]. On his retirement, Frank recognised the potential for using the experience of [[educationists]] in the UK to benefit children in Ghana. He invited a number of his ex-colleagues to join him, and the charity was registered in 2000.

The charity celebrated its ten-year anniversary on 5 March 2009.

== Members ==

The charity is chaired by Gladys Nkansa-Dwamena with Vice-Chair Eugene Nkansa-Dwamena. It consists of two trustees Mrs Averill Lovatt and Mrs Jill Morgan both retired educationists who look after the sponsorship side of the charity. Patrons of the charity are Jenni Smith, a valued and respected trustee of LLG for fourteen years, working tirelessly to support the children of the school.  She was one of Frank’s colleagues in Brent and was invited to become involved in Learning Link Ghana. She became Chair in 2000 when the charity became registered and held that position until 2009.  Jenni’s interest in Africa began when, as a young teacher, she travelled to Tanzania in East Africa to teach primary school children when her husband was appointed to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nations to organize veterinary research work.

Jenni returned to London three years later and after her ten years at home looking after her children, she re-qualified as an educational psychologist and has worked in several local educational authorities. In 1993/4 she visited Zimbabwe and was involved in teacher training there. Jenni remained in educational work until 2006 when she retired as Principal Educational Psychologist (Acting) in Waltham Forest, East London. Knowledge and love of Africa has underpinned her interest in being an active member of Learning Link Ghana.

'''Jonathan Braham''': Jonathan Braham was born in Jamaica and educated there and in the United Kingdom. He eschewed working in the family business, taught English at private schools, worked as an editor in a publishing company, as producer in a television company and later set up an advertising agency. When that failed in the recession of the late 1970s he returned to his first love – writing. He’d written his first novel when he was sixteen years old, and many short stories for the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation radio programme, Jamaica Woman, while still at school. He’s written for radio, newspapers, theatre, the Jamaica Journal, and won awards for his work in the Jamaica Literary Festival. He arrived in London intending to publish but after a year had a change of direction and found himself working in a fascinating area of work – Education Welfare. Since 1990 he has been director of the Education Welfare Service in a Local Authority in London.

'''The Reverend David Nash''': David Nash is a Church of England priest who retired in 2008, having served over forty years in ministry mostly in North London parishes. During this time he served as Area Dean of Enfield, and later, of Central Barnet. In addition he was for ten years a clergy selector, and for seven years a tutor on the Edmonton Area Christian Studies Course. Currently he assists in local parishes in Enfield where he and his wife Bridget now live. He is also a member of the pastoral team of St Paul's Cathedral. He enjoys reading and keeping up with current affairs, dabbling with art and pottering in the garden.

'''Mrs Bridget Nash''': Bridget Nash, wife of David, retired in 2009 as a senior social worker with Barnet Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service where she served for 17 years. After graduating at Manchester University, she spent a year as a VSO volunteer at St Monica's School, Mampong, in Ghana and she is still in regular touch with a number of the volunteers and teachers who were serving there at the same time. She and David have four children and three grandchildren so there will be few empty spaces in their retirement plans.

'''Mr Geoffrey Smith''': Geoff is a veterinary surgeon, now retired, whose working life was spent in carrying out research into infectious diseases of animals, at the Moredun Institute in Edinburgh and the Zoological Society of London, with an intervening period of three years in Tanzania as an adviser for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation. During his working life, he also visited and advised in other parts of Africa (Kenya, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ghana) and South America (Paraguay, Bolivia).

A full list of all current trustees and financial information about the charity can be found on the Charity Commission's website.  The charity's registration number is 1081329.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/ContactAndTrustees.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1081329&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0&amp;TID=2161592|title=Register Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partner schools in the UK ==

Learning Link Ghana creates partnerships between the City of Kumasi school and schools in the UK, which hold their own sponsorship events to raise funds for children in Ghana. Current partner schools included [[Ravenscroft Technology College]] now [[Totteridge Academy]].  [[Monken Hadley CE School]] in Barnet, and [[FitzWimarc School]] in Rayleigh, Essex.

We have had links with Monken Hadley Church of England Primary school since 2006. This is a small single entry primary school in North London, Barnet, where pupils, parents and staff at the school have supported Learning Link Ghana through sponsored events such as a 'Sponsored Bounce', sales of the school magazine, and through running a stall at the school’s Christmas and Summer Fairs.

The Ravenscroft School (now The Totteridge Academy) is a Technology College in North London.  Sponsorship from Ravenscroft was facilitated through the Interact Group, which is a group of sixth formers who meet with a representative of the local Barnet Rotary Club to support and help people in the community. The international theme was developed through the Rotary Club and in 2007 the Interact Group sponsored a teenaged pupil at the City of Kumasi Preparatory School through taking a collection at the Christmas Carol Service. They have continued their support by making and selling cakes to raise adequate funds.

LLG has been linked with FitzWimarc School in Rayleigh, Essex since 2009. Fitz is a large 11-16 comprehensive school that has an excellent reputation in its local area and outstanding examination results. The link with LLG and the City of Kumasi School was established by the then Head of Geography, Miss Julia Hammond, who was able to visit the school in February 2010 and again in 2011.

== Achievements ==

*Over 20 children have received sponsorship from Learning Link Ghana this year{{when|date=February 2018}} alone. In total since its inception we have sponsored over 300 children.
*The charity has contributed to the building of a domestic science block, a nursery, a library, and ICT suite to the school. The ICT Suite has just recently been refurbished with the help of Martin Tanner, Director at ADM COMPUTING. Martin Tanner visited the school in December 2014 with a colleague, Marc Overton a Senior BT Structural Engineer. They were able to advise the staff on new procedures and donated equipment to refurbish the ICT Suite and give it a new lease of life.
*'''Learning Link Ghana''' recently ventured in the world of online promotional activity, and now has a website and a profile on social networking site, [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Learning-Link-Ghana/19028266509|title=Learning Link Ghana|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current and future activity ==
Current and future projects include:

* Partnership with Whitings Hill Primary School The children are encouraged to wear international clothes on Wednesday 22 April and donate £1 to Learning Link Ghana. International clothes could be anything from National dress/ traditional clothes to sports team kits.
* continuing to sponsor the education of eligible children;
* exploring online activities; and
* developing new links with UK schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2286">A '''lecture consultant''' is an independent [[consultant]] who helps [[lecturers]] and [[institutions]] with the delivery of teaching, with particular focus on [[pedagogy]] and [[communication]].

==Role==
The role is analogous to that of an educational consultant, but rather than providing independent consulting advice to parents/students, they provide consulting advice to teachers. As with the accountability purpose of the educational consultant role, consultant lecturers keep lecturers accountable by ensuring lecturers have met the requisite standard for Shum's Three Forces, a framework for educational industry analysis:&lt;ref&gt;Shum, J.H., Learning in a kinesthetic environment, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Written syllabus to a requisite but encompassed standard
# Communication adopting kinesthetic, auditory and visual cues
# Arousing interest in students to continue furthered search

Consulting lecturers help with pre-class planning including [[syllabus]] writing to ensure state bylaw requirements relating to education are met. For example, in South Australia, this would include assisting teachers to follow the [[SSABSA]] guidelines relating to the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]].

In the classroom, consulting lecturers provide advice on improving [[communication]] effectiveness, including both verbal and nonverbal communication, including visual and kinesthetic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2. SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some institutions, the role of the lecture consultant is governed by a Department of Learning and Teaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2812">The '''National Centre for Biotechnology Education''' (NCBE) is a national resource centre at the [[University of Reading]] to teach pre-university [[biotechnology]] in schools in the UK.

==History==
It began as the National Centre for School Biotechnology (NCSB) in 1985 in the Department of Microbiology. It became the NCBE in 1990. For many years it was the only centre in Europe that was devoted to the teaching of biotechnology in schools. The [[Dolan DNA Learning Center]] had been set up in the USA.

It was set up as an education project by the Society for General Microbiology, now the [[Microbiology Society]]. Money from the [[Laboratory of the Government Chemist]] set up the National Centre for School Biotechnology (NCSB). Money also came from the [[Gatsby Charitable Foundation]]. For the first five years, the UK government's [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] was involved, but from 1990 onwards wanted the organization to become self-supporting as it had to cut back on budgets. By 1992 the government provided no money for the centre. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yujAquGBnksC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143 Establishment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The site was set up in former buildings of the University of Reading's Department of Microbiology. 

==Function==
It reaches out to schools to give up-to-date information on biotechnology. Biotechnology is a rapidly evolving subject, and schools cannot keep up-to-date with all that they would be required to know. It produces educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.store.reading.ac.uk/browse/department.asp?compid=2&amp;modid=1&amp;deptid=36 Educational resources]&lt;/ref&gt; It runs the Microbiology in Schools Advisory Committee (MISAC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misac.org.uk/ MISAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Healthy Schools Programme''' (NHSP)  was a joint [[Department of Health]] and  [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] project intended to improve health, raise pupil achievement, improve social inclusion and encourage closer working between health and education providers in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=NHS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.healthyschools.gov.uk/p/Static/AboutUs|title=About Healthy Schools|publisher=healthyschools.gov.uk|date=2009-11-02|accessdate=2011-01-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110052746/http://resources.healthyschools.gov.uk/p/Static/AboutUs|archivedate=2011-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=8709960|title=National Healthy Schools Programme|publisher=Local Government Improvement and Development|accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programme started in 1998 and formed part of the strategy described in the Department for Children, Schools and Families' [http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/childrensplan/ Children’s Plan (DCSF 2007)] and in the Department of Health's [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_082378 Healthy Weight, healthy Lives (DH 2008)].

It had four themes, each with its own criteria:
* [[Personal, Social and Health Education]] including sex and relationships and drugs education. These come under P.H.S.H. lessons for years 7, 8 and 9 and can be included in Religious studies classes. It provides young people with knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes to make informed decisions about their lives.
* Healthy Eating includes healthy and nutritious foods being made in school canteens and available in schools as well as enabling young people to make informed decisions about healthy food.
* Physical Activity encourages young people to do physical activity as well as being given opportunities to be physically active. It helps understanding on how physical activity can make people healthier and can improve life as well as being part of it.
* Emotional Health and Well-being, including bullying, how to express feelings build confidence and emotional strength as well as supporting emotional health through counselors and chaplains. It is the promotion of positive emotional health and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audit.healthyschools.gov.uk/Themes/default.aspx|title=Healthy schools:The Four Themes|publisher=healthyschools.gov.uk|accessdate=2011-01-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108143016/http://audit.healthyschools.gov.uk/Themes/default.aspx|archivedate=2011-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Note: the references below are now obsolete as the website has been relocated.--&gt;

==National Healthy Schools Status==
The '''National Healthy Schools Status''' is an award made under the scheme to schools which have achieved the four criteria.&lt;ref name=NHSS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.healthyschools.gov.uk/v/11dbcd7b-c696-46d1-b1b1-9cbc010c8bd0|title=Achieving NHSS|publisher=healthyschools.gov.uk|date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2011-01-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206214601/http%3A//resources.healthyschools.gov.uk/v/11dbcd7b%2Dc696%2D46d1%2Db1b1%2D9cbc010c8bd0|archivedate=2011-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school must undergo a self validation as follows:- 
* School is briefed on the criteria and minimum standards expected.
* School completes a [[Needs analysis]]
* Local programme provides support.
* Once it believes it meets the criteria, the school sends in self-validation form signed off by the Head, a staff representative, a governor, a child/young person representative and a parent/carer.
* Quality Assurance Group accepts the school’s submission unless it has reason to believe that the school has overlooked some aspect.
* The Local Programme changes database to record that the school has achieved National Healthy School Status
* The school is required to continue improving and is subject to further reviews.&lt;ref name=NHSS/&gt;

The Government has set a target for all schools to work towards achieving National Healthy Schools Status, more than 97% are participating in the scheme and 75% achieved this by December 2009.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The system was created and designed technically by contractor Eugene Le Roux &lt;ref name="Healthy Schools System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredforhealth.gov.uk/cat.php?catid=1120&amp;docid=7754 |title=Health Schools System |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213221721/http://www.wiredforhealth.gov.uk/cat.php?catid=1120&amp;docid=7754 |archivedate=February 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 'systems' design input from National Healthy Schools Programme National Adviser Stuart G.

The '''Norrington Table''' is an annual ranking of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|college]]s of the [[University of Oxford]] based on a score computed from the fraction of undergraduate students earning each of the various [[British undergraduate degree classification|degree classifications]] based on that year's [[final examination]]s.

== Overview ==
The rankings of each college in the Norrington Table are calculated by awarding 5 points for a student who receives a First [[British undergraduate degree classification|Class degree]], 3 points for a 2:1, 2 for a 2:2 and 1 for a Third; the total is then divided by the maximum possible score (i.e. the number of finalists in that college multiplied by 5), and the result for each college is expressed as a percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places. Although the difference between the highest places on the table is usually very slight, the top colleges remain very competitive about their rankings in the Table. Their competitiveness has been heightened in recent years by increased media attention towards the rankings.

Previously the university had refused to endorse an official table, leading to inaccuracies (see [[Norrington Table#Criticisms|Criticisms]] below), so the university finally published its own rankings using examination results from all final year undergraduates in 2005.

== History==

Contrary to popular belief, the Norrington Table was not created in 1962 by [[Arthur Lionel Pugh Norrington|Sir Arthur Norrington]], who was then president of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]].  Norrington did not invent the idea of producing a table of the results of [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford Colleges]].  Rather, he suggested a refinement to the weightings given to results by a pre-existing table.  Norrington's scoring system was suggested in 1963 and abandoned after 1985, owing to changes in the Oxford examination system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/exams&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 1963, Norrington had a letter published in ''[[The Times]]'', in which he objected to the table that their correspondent had invented two days earlier (3 September 1963, p.&amp;nbsp;12).  ''The Times'' had previously published a table of Oxford Colleges' results in 1962 (29 August 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;5).

Norrington wrote: "Your Correspondent has analysed the final examination results this year and gives an order of merit, among the first colleges, based on the percentage of Firsts and Seconds.  This, in effect, is the same as basing it on the percentage of Thirds, and gives it no extra credit for Firsts.  College A, for example, that gets 20 Firsts, 60 Seconds, and 20 Thirds scores less by this method than College B that gets no Firsts, 81 Seconds and 19 Thirds, but surely A has, in reality, done much better than B.  A better result, I submit, is obtained by a points system in which a First scores more than a second and a Second more than a Third.  If you make the points 3, 2, and 1 respectively and calculate what percentage of its "possible" each college has secured, you will find that College A, with 200 points out of 300, has scored 66.67 per cent, and B, with 181, only 60 per cent.  This method of calculation will be found to promote Magdalen and Merton, which come surprisingly low in your Correspondent's order."  (5 September 1963, p.&amp;nbsp;13)

In 1986, when Oxford for the first time split Second Class honours into Upper Seconds and Lower Seconds, ''The Times'' unilaterally adopted the [[Tompkins Table]], which gives more weight to a First class degree: five points for a First, three for a 2.1, two for a 2.2, and one for a Third.  This system was invented in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, of [[Birkenhead]], as a method of classifying the results of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] colleges, and a table compiled by Tompkins on this basis was published on 28 August by ''The Times'' (28 Aug 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;10) alongside a table using the Norrington scoring system, which had been compiled by the ''[[Cambridge Evening News]]''.  The Tompkins Table became the preferred rating for [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge colleges]] and has prevailed for Oxford colleges, too, since 1986.

[[File:Norrington_Table.svg]]

== Criticisms ==
The table is biased towards colleges with above average proportions of students in science subjects such as chemistry and mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stokes|first1=Matt|last2=Lewis|first2=Alis|last3=Restall|first3=James|title=Merton plummet in latest Norrington Table|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2012/08/16/magdalen-top-dogs-in-norrington-table/|website=The Oxford Student|accessdate=16 June 2017|date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which a higher proportion attain a First Class degree compared to humanities (for which more students attain a 2.1). The corresponding [[Tompkins Table]] at Cambridge makes an adjustment for this feature.

[[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]], Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]], presented a critique of the Norrington Table in a 1980 article titled "Norrington Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, John R., [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/itolduso/norrblue.html "Norrington Blues"], ''Oxford'' (May 1980), pp. 45-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Point Park University''' is a [[liberal arts college|liberal arts university]] in [[downtown Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Formerly known as Point Park College, the school name was revised in 2004 to reflect the number of graduate programs being offered.

Point Park University is a comprehensive doctoral-level university with a liberal arts tradition, and is located in the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh. Point Park enrolls more than 3,800 full-and part-time students in 82 undergraduate programs and 18 graduate programs offered through its School of Arts and Sciences, School of Business, School of Communication and the Conservatory of Performing Arts.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The university began in 1933 as a one-room business school called Business Training College with an initial enrollment of 50 students, under the direction of [[Dorothy Finkelhor]], a New York native, and her husband, [[L. Herbert Finkelhor]]. At the time, it was notable for a woman to found such an institution. Finkelhor provided her students with business and [[Secretary|secretarial]] skills. At the same time, she served in multiple roles as teacher, the dean of women, social chairman, janitor, telephone operator, admissions and finance director, and registrar.

By 1960, the business school had grown to nearly 880 students and moved to the university's current academic center, Academic Hall, on Wood Street in central [[Downtown Pittsburgh]]. The Finkelhors' small secretarial school became '''Point Park Junior College''', named for the city's historic [[Point State Park]]. The junior college added two-year programs in [[engineering technology]], education and journalism. It also acquired performing arts space at The Pittsburgh Playhouse in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood.  Five years later, the college was granted four-year status, officially becoming '''Point Park College'''. Dance and theatre programs were introduced. These programs laid the groundwork for Point Park's current Conservatory of Performing Arts.

Thirty-four years after forming the college, Dorothy Finkelhor retired in 1967. The school's reins remained within the family as son-in-law Arthur M. Blum assumed the presidency. Blum purchased the Sherwyn Hotel, a 20-story building across from Academic Hall, which became [[David L. Lawrence]] Hall. The hall currently contains most of the school's social and entertaining facilities, as well as classrooms, offices and residential facilities.

Blum's Lawrence Hall investment continues to benefit the school. Blum also established a campus in [[Lugano, Switzerland]]. A gift from Lester Hamburg brought the school a conference center in Portersville, Pennsylvania.

John V. Hopkins succeeded Blum.

===Stability===
With the budget climbing out of the red, the school began a slow healing process into the 1980s. Enrollment grew beyond 1,000 students. At the same time, the school introduced its first postgraduate degree, a master's degree in journalism and [[mass communication]].

J. Matthew Simon served as the college's next president from 1986 to 1995, providing nearly a decade of relative calm in the institution's turbulent history. Simon oversaw the acquisition of a new library, program growth and the school's largest endowment.    Simon retired in 2007, having taught at Point Park as a professor in the department of Natural Sciences and Engineering Technology after his tenure as president.

===1994 crisis===
Another crisis came with the election of James Hunter as president. Hunter, Point Park's most controversial leader, served for a little over a year but managed to garner outcry for an admissions scandal and a breakdown of communication within the school.

At the same time, growth remained slow in the city, and Pittsburgh's economy still had not recovered from the collapse of the steel industry. The college's finances suffered, and Point Park again neared bankruptcy. Negotiations began with [[Duquesne University]] to sell what remained of Point Park College to the larger school.

Hunter resigned amidst the melee, and Katherine Henderson was appointed president by the [[board of trustees]] soon after.

===Growth and change===
Henderson implemented a strategic plan to revive the college. Plans to sell the school were abandoned as Henderson began another procedural overhaul.

Henderson's tenure became the most successful for Point Park. During the late ’90s, budget woes disintegrated as enrollment rose to over 3,000 students and the endowment grew by over 200 percent. Point Park finished major renovations of its existing buildings soon after the turn of the century.

By 2004, the school hit a new high-water mark and successfully applied for university status. It was officially renamed '''Point Park University''' that year, and the administration began an aggressive $1 million branding campaign to attract more enrollment.

Henderson retired in 2006 while on a self-imposed sabbatical.

===Current efforts===
The [[board of trustees]] officially named Paul Hennigan as Henderson's permanent successor at the beginning of the 2006 fall term. Hennigan has continued the process of creating a new strategic plan. As part of the plan, the university has purchased several [[Downtown Pittsburgh|Downtown]] properties for development. Point Park is also poised to become a key player in the city's efforts for Downtown revitalization, owning properties along the coveted Fifth and Forbes corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07231/810647-298.stm |title=Point Park University's enrollment growth spurs expansion |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Mark | last=Belko | date=August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university partnered with a private contractor to renovate two historic buildings into suite-style residence halls. One of these residence halls became home to a [[Starbucks]] in August 2007. The coffee shop is the first full-service retail entity incorporated into Point Park's campus.

A $16 million {{convert|44000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} state-of-the-art dance complex opened in 2007. The complex includes five rehearsal and performance studios, and recently received Gold LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Located in the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh, the complex is home to the George Rowland White Performance Studio, a 188-seat convertible performance space.

Point Park purchased the building occupied by the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh on the Boulevard of the Allies in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08101/872062-298.stm |title=Growth spurt: Point Park University buying YMCA |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Mark | last=Belko | date=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the newly renovated former YMCA building reopened as the interim Student Center with exercise and fitness facilities and equipment, a gymnasium, meeting space and much more.

The university is currently creating a "New Academic Village" that will make the school, and downtown, a vibrant area for students. With the introduction of this initiative, Point Park has evolved into one of the largest investors in Downtown Pittsburgh real estate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointpark.edu/About/AcademicVilliageInitiative|title=Academic Village Initiative|publisher=Point Park University|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Point Park University is a [[not-for-profit]] educational institution registered under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=501(c)(3)Lookup: Point Park University|url=http://501c3lookup.org/point_park_university/|publisher=http://501c3lookup.org|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Point Park University added a new center for journalism at the former location of Nathan's Famous hot dogs. "Located at Wood Street and Third Avenue, the 4,000-square-foot center will have floor-to-ceiling glass walls, flat-screen televisions and a digital ticker that offers a New York City-style media hub where passersby can be entertained and informed as students learn their craft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointpark.edu/news-communication/point-park-university-announces-new-center-for-media-innovation|title=Point Park University announces new Center for Media Innovation - Point Park University|author=|date=|website=www.pointpark.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Lawrence Hall.jpg|thumb|right|'''Lawrence Hall''', the former Sherwyn Hotel, contains residence halls, offices, lounges, the Point Café, and classrooms.]]
Point Park is situated about half a mile from [[Point State Park]], the university's name sake, in the city's Golden Triangle. The school is in the midst of the business district situated near [[PPG Place]], one of the skyline's most recognizable buildings, and the brand new LEED Platinum Certified headquarters of [[The Tower at PNC Plaza|PNC Bank]]. The physical campus is mostly vertical, with buildings scattered intermittently among non-school structures. Point Park also owns the [[Pittsburgh Playhouse]] in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood. Since the campus is not continuous, the school has used the phrase "Pittsburgh is our campus" in its literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pittsburgh is our campus | publisher=Point Park University Web site | year=2006 | url=http://www.pointpark.edu/default.aspx?id=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its Downtown locale, the school is within walking distance of the [[Cultural District, Pittsburgh|Cultural District]] and the city's sports facilities, [[PNC Park]], [[PPG Paints Arena]], and [[Heinz Field]]. It is also close to Pittsburgh's major nightlife areas on the [[Southside (Pittsburgh)|Southside]], in [[Station Square]], and in the [[Strip District (Pittsburgh)|Strip District]]. Nearly 1,000 full-time undergraduate students live on campus. The majority of Point Park students commute to campus.

With 15 existing buildings and other properties that run from the Monongahela River to Forbes Avenue, the university has one of the largest footprints in Downtown Pittsburgh.

==WPPJ==
WPPJ (670 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is Point Park University's [[campus radio|campus]] radio station. This unlicensed [[carrier-current]] station was established in 1967 and is known as  "The Voice of Point Park". It is a co-curricular activity for students with an interest in radio, news, sports, contemporary/popular music, media sales and promotions. WPPJ also serves as a training facility for students of any major who desire a career in professional broadcasting. The station is an open-format college radio station, playing primarily [[indie rock]] and [[hip-hop]], with a fair number of sports and [[talk radio]] shows. The music department charts independent artists with [[CMJ]]. The 28th Annual WPPJ Rock-a-Thon was held from October 28–31, 2008, at the university, raising over $3,700 for the Early Learning Institute, a charity for families in Allegheny County, due to the efforts of sales director, Anthony Pignetti.

==Athletics==
Point Park teams, nicknamed athletically as the Pioneers, are part of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), primarily competing in the [[River States Conference]] (RSC). The Pioneers formerly competed as a member of the [[American Mideast Conference]] until its dissolution during the 2011–12 academic year. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf and soccer. However, baseball is the dominant sport of the university, bringing home the most championships. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball and volleyball.

Point Park joined the RSC in the 2012–13 academic year. The RSC is an NAIA conference that was founded in 1916 as the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and adopted its current name starting with the 2016–17 school year. With the addition of Point Park and Carlow University in 2012, the RSC grew to a membership of 11 institutions; it has since expanded to 13.

===Pioneers logo===
[[File:PointParkPioneers.png|thumb|left|Official athletics logo.]]
The Point Park Pioneers logo prominently displays the school name as well as the nickname for the sports teams – Pioneers. A central figure is the bison, which has long been a mascot for the school. The bison was first used as a school mascot in the 1967–68 school year, the first year of intercollegiate competition versus four-year institutions.

The bison became a mascot for the school in 1967 when the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity teamed with the Varsity Club to acquire a live bison. The bison was named Black Diamond II in reference to the [[Black Diamond (buffalo)|Black Diamond]] bison on the reverse side of the U.S. nickel at the time. It was kept at South Park and was a featured attraction at parades on the Boulevard of the Allies as well as at sporting events.
Black Diamond II was widely popular at Point Park and was a source of pride for the entire school. Although Black Diamond II eventually died, it remains a fixture at the school at present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pointpark.edu/Athletics/PointParkPioneersLogo |title=Point Park University Pioneers Logo |publisher=Point Park University |accessdate=24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also prominently displayed is the Downtown Pittsburgh environment of which Point Park is a part. In the back left are iconic pieces of the Pittsburgh skyline, and in the back right are two central pieces to the Point Park campus – Lawrence Hall and Academic Hall. Included is the pedestrian bridge above Wood Street that connects the two Point Park buildings. The shape at the bottom of the logo is representative of the bastions of Fort Duquesne and Fort Pitt, which were once located in the area now known as Point State Park. Point Park University derives its name from Point State Park, which is located at the meeting place of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Point State Park is just a few blocks from the University's campus.

==Urban legend==
After a 1962 visit to Pittsburgh the producer and creator of the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' cartoon is rumored to have used Lawrence Hall as the inspiration for the cartoons opening where Rocky the flying squirrel takes off from the building's roof to Bullwinkle below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tJQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2037%2C8080235|title=The Pittsburgh Press|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Childcare}}
A '''preschool''', also known as '''nursery school''', '''pre-primary school''', '''playschool''' or '''[[kindergarten]]''', is an [[school|educational establishment]] or [[learning space]] offering [[early childhood education]] to [[child]]ren before they begin [[compulsory education]] at [[primary school]]. It may be publicly or privately operated, and may be subsidized from public funds.

==Terminology==
{{inappropriate person|section|date=November 2018}}
Terminology varies by country. In some European countries the term "kindergarten" refers to formal education of children classified as ''[[International Standard Classification of Education|ISCED level 0]]'' - with one or several years of such education being compulsory -  before children start primary school at ''ISCED level 1''.&lt;ref&gt;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/images/2/24/Compulsory_Education_in_Europe_2016_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The following terms may be used for educational establishments for this age group:
*'''Pre-Primary'''&lt;ref name="cintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childcareintro.com/preschool_report|title=Preschool Report|last=Stephens|first=Terence|date = 2013-11-28|accessdate = 2013-12-09|publisher=ChildCareIntro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 6 weeks old to 6 years old- is an educational childcare service you can enroll your child(ren) in before primary school. May also be used to define services for children younger than kindergarten age, especially in countries where kindergarten is compulsory. The Pre-Primary program takes place in a '''Nursery School'''.

*'''Preschool''' (US and UK) from 3 to 4 years old- held in a Nursery School; readiness has to do with whether your child is developmentally appropriate, potty training is a big factor, so you can start as early as 2½ years old. Preschool education is important and beneficial for any child attending nursery school because it gives your kid a head start through social interactions. Through Cognitive, Psychosocial and Physical developments based learning a child in preschool will learn about their environment and how to verbal communicate with others. Children who attend Preschool learns how the world works around them through play and communication. During this school year children will learn how to properly express themselves, share, communicate with their classroom, follow classroom rules, proper hygiene and how to sleep during naptime. They'll learn simple English like how to identify all the letters in the alphabet, write their full name, the beginnings of phonics and how to trace all the letters in the alphabet. In Math class they'll learn how to identify basic shapes, recognize size difference, count to 100, how to trace numbers 1-10 and simple adding &amp; subtracting. In Science class they do simple things learning the name's of different types of weather, the names of the season and animals name, environmental habits &amp; sounds. In Social Studies they'll learn about places we see/visit in everyday life, how things work in certain public places and what are the names &amp; jobs of the people who work in our communities. During recesses'''-'''playtime'''-'''lunchtime, children will interact with their peers playing dress-up, interacting on the playground, eating lunch/snack together and how to play certain games with others. Children can also express themselves creativity during Arts &amp; Crafts class by learning the names of the colors, creating an craft projects using their imagination, listening to music and learning the different sounds of an instrument. Some nursery schools even do immersion programs or dual language programs were a child can also learn to understand and speak different languages at this age too. *By the end of preschool kids will know how to recite their full name, address, home phone number, know their parents/guardian(s) full name, and the names of the days of the week &amp; month.  
  
*'''[[Pre-kindergarten|Pre-K]]''' (or Pre-Kindergarten) from 4 to 5 years old- held in Nursery School and is an initiative to improve access to pre-primary schools for children in the USA. There is much more than teaching your child colors, numbers, shapes and so on. The children need to learn how to follow rules, feed themselves with minimal assistance, learning how hygiene skills, learn how to use the bathroom without needing as much help(wearing underwear instead of diapers). The teachers are there to help guide your child into the right path making sure he/her is sharing, retain information learned in the classroom and helping your kid be a model citizen by teaching them to treat others with respect &amp; kindness. In Pre-K kids will recap all that they learned in Preschool and expand on what they already know. In English class children will learn basic phonics on how to sound out words, how to write their name, write all the letters in the alphabet and how to read &amp; write simple sight words. In Math class children will learn how to tell time, learn all the 2D/3D shapes, count into 3-digits numbers, be able to add &amp; subtract 2 digit numbers, and count by ones, tens, hundreds, and what is a minute, second, hour, day, month, and year is. In Social Studies class they will have to be able to identify places on a map such as the country they live in, the name os the continents, learn the names of different ethnic-racial groups, their cultures &amp; customs and where people originate on the map. In Science class they'll how weather works &amp; impacts the environment(ozone layer), how food is harvest to how it gets to the supermarket, how to plant seeds in a garden, reduce/reuse/recycle, and how to group animals based on habit &amp; environment on a map. During recesses-playtime-lunchtime children how to follow step by step instructions in many extra curricular activities, use their imagination to problem solve puzzles or during a game, play dress up to create stories, and learn how to fully share with others. Children can express themselves creativity during Arts &amp; Crafts time by learning about secondary colors, using their imagination to create step by step art projects, doing certain dances to music, and reading music to play an instrument. Some nursery schools even do immersion programs or dual language so your child can also learn to understand and speak different languages at this age too. *By the end of Pre-K the child should have the basic knowledge to enter Kindergarten and excel and should be able to read short books, count to 100, know how how the environment works, and where they country &amp; continent they live in(and all their preschool work).

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Samuel Wilderspin Payne.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Wilderspin]], one of the founders of preschool education. 1848 engraving by [[John Rogers Herbert]].]]
In an age when school was restricted to children who had already learned to read and write at home, there were many attempts to make school accessible to orphans or to the children of women who worked in factories.

In 1779, [[J. F. Oberlin|Johann Friedrich Oberlin]] and Louise Scheppler founded in [[Strassbourg]] an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lorenzo Knapp (1846), ‘'Female biography: containing notices of distinguished women'' Philadelphia: Thomas Wardle. p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in [[Bavaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Berger, [http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/414.html "Kurze Chronik der ehemaligen und gegenwärtigen Ausbildungsstätten für Kleinkindlehrerinnen, Kindergärtnerinnen, Hortnerinnen ... und ErzieherInnen in Bayern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904234012/http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/414.html |date=4 September 2013 }} in '‘Das Kita-Handbuch ‘‘, ed. Martin R. Textor&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, Pauline zur Lippe established a preschool center in [[Detmold]].

In 1816, [[Robert Owen]], a philosopher and [[pedagogue]], opened the first British and probably globally the first infant school in [[New Lanark]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="vag75"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9248527032015273/ |title=The Influence of the English Infant School in Hungary |first=Otto |last=Vag |journal=International Journal of Early Childhood |publisher=Springer |volume=7|issue=1 |date=March 1975|pages=132–136 |doi=10.1007/bf03175934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlanark.org/kids/index2.html New Lanark Kids: Robert Owen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infed&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-owen.htm Education in Robert Owen's New Society: the New Lanark Institute and schools]&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with his venture for [[cooperative]] mills Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialist-courier.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/robert-owen-and-new-lanark.html |title=Socialist - Courier: Robert Owen and New Lanark |publisher=Socialist-courier.blogspot.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Wilderspin]] opened his first infant school in London in 1819,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGYWAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Importance of Educating the Infant Poor|year=1823|first=Samuel|last=Wilderspin|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the [[playground]]. In 1823, Wilderspin published ''On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor'', based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote "The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers off all children from 1 to seven years of age".

===Spread===
Countess [[Theresa Brunszvik]] (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], was influenced by this example to open an ''Angyalkert'' ('angel garden' in Hungarian) on 27 May 1828 in her residence in [[Budapest|Buda]], the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children.&lt;ref&gt;Budapest Lexikon, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Preschool Education In Hungary: A Historical Survey, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the Hungarian kingdom.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-37156-0001, Beentz, Erntekindergartengruppe.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kindergarten]] in Germany in 1954]]
[[Friedrich Fröbel]] (1782–1852) opened a ''Play and Activity'' institute in 1837 in the village of [[Bad Blankenburg]] in the [[principality]] of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], Thuringia, which he renamed [[Kindergarten]] on 28 June 1840.

Women trained by Fröbel opened Kindergartens throughout Europe and around the World. The [[First Kindergarten|first kindergarten]] in the United States was founded in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856 and was conducted in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watertown Historical Society|url=http://www.watertownhistory.org/|publisher=Watertown Historical Society|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Peabody]] founded America's first English-language kindergarten in 1860 and the first free kindergarten in America was founded in 1870 by [[Conrad Poppenhusen]], a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the [[Poppenhusen Institute]] and the first publicly financed kindergarten in the United States was established in [[St. Louis]] in 1873 by [[Susan Blow]]. Canada's first private kindergarten was opened by the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1870 and by the end of the decade, they were common in large Canadian towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, M.I. 1955.

Larry Prochner and Nina Howe), Vancouver: UBC Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The country's first public-school kindergartens were established in [[Berlin, Ontario]] in 1882 at [[Suddaby Public School|Central School]].&lt;ref name="can-au-nz"&gt;Larry Prochner, ''History of Early Childhood Education in Canada, Australia and New Zealand'', UBC Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, the [[Toronto Normal School]] (teacher training) opened a department for Kindergarten teaching.&lt;ref name="can-au-nz"/&gt;

[[Elizabeth Harrison (educator)|Elizabeth Harrison]] wrote extensively on the theory of [[early childhood education]] and worked to enhance educational standards for kindergarten teachers by establishing what became the [[National-Louis University|National College of Education]] in 1886.

[[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] was the first publicly funded preschool program in the US, created in 1965 by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] for low-income families—only 10% of children were then enrolled in preschool. Due to large demand, various states subsidized preschool for low-income families in the 1980s.

==Developmental areas==
{{main|Early childhood education}}

The areas of development that preschool education covers varies. However, the following main themes are typically offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_5984.aspx The foundation stage: education for children aged 3 to 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807164330/http://www.qca.org.uk/qca_5984.aspx |date=7 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/earlyyears/about/curriculum/framechildren3to5/downloadsections.asp A Curriculum Framework for Children 3 to 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803081853/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/earlyyears/about/curriculum/framechildren3to5/downloadsections.asp |date=3 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Personal, social, economic and emotional development
* Communication (including [[sign language]]), talking and listening
* [[World knowledge]] and [[understanding|World Understanding]]
* [[Creative and aesthetic development]]
* [[Mathematical awareness]]
* [[Physical development]]
* [[Physical health]]
* [[Play (activity)|Play]]

* [[Literacy]]

Preschool systems observe standards for structure (administration, class size, [[student–teacher ratio]], services), process (quality of classroom environments, teacher-child interactions, etc.) and alignment (standards, curriculum, assessments) components. Curriculum is designed for differing ages. For example, counting to 10 is generally after the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localwin.com/julie/appropriate-curriculum/ Age Appropriate Curriculum, Developmental Milestones, and Readiness: What My Child Should Be Learning and When]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies dispute the benefits of preschool education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativelearning-center.com/|title=Creative Learning Center Preschool DayCare Child|website=Creative Learning Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that preschool can be detrimental to cognitive and social development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagleforum.org/educate/2005/nov05/542.pdf 542]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=John|first=Martha Tyler|title=Can Preschool Be Detrimental to Cognitive Growth?|date=April 1986|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED269133&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED269133}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[UC Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] on 14,000 preschools revealed that while there is a temporary cognitive boost in [[pre-reading]] and math, preschool holds detrimental effects on social development and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/11/01_pre.shtml |title=University of California - UC Newsroom &amp;#124; New report examines effects nationwide of preschool on kids' development |publisher=Universityofcalifornia.edu |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also shown that the home environment has a greater impact on future outcomes than preschool.&lt;ref name="The Early Years Framework"/&gt;

There is emerging evidence that high-quality preschools are "play based," rather than attempting to provide early formal instruction in academic subjects. "Playing with other children, away from adults, is how children learn to make their own decisions, control their emotions and impulses, see from others' perspectives, negotiate differences with others, and make friends," [http://www.bc.edu/offices/pubaf/news/2013-mar-apr/peter-gray-book.html according to] Dr. Peter Gray, Boston College professor and an expert on the evolution of play and its vital role in child development. "In short, play is how children learn to take control of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter. "Free to Learn," Basic Books 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preschools have adopted various methods of teaching, such as [[Montessori method|Montessori]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]], [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]], [[HighScope]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highscope.org/ High Scope]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reggio Emilia approach]], [[Bank Street College of Education|Bank Street]] and [[Forest kindergarten]]s.

== Funding  ==
While a majority of American preschool programs remain tuition-based, support for some public funding of early childhood education has grown over the years. As of 2008, 38 states and the District of Columbia invested in at least some preschool programs, and many school districts were providing preschool services on their own, using local and federal funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | last = Wat | first = Albert | author2 = Gayl, Chrisanne | title = Beyond the School Yard: Pre-K Collaborations with Community-Based Partners | publisher = Pew Center on the States | date = July 2009 | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = 24 pp. | url = http://rc10.overture.com/d/sr/?xargs=15KPjg1wxSt5auwuf0L%5FiXEbqUkwwBleyw87gcfZJ%2DGKBb93NkJ%5FYuPa7By%5FVINO1l6AbWzPDh%2DNMVOqz2n%5F%2DUFBCMRlSXG%2DL7yt2QwNppa%5Fb%5FAJIDxeJomaj5z9sbfiZVMzChKJH9wb2VcZKgYCBbp9ETjV%5FMvqI2npDq1adbQuaBi0I6rgmSdIv43ygZsNqSfJeiePFFbcEVoxXPLowEk4m9pnmRD2MAODmhcl5T%5FIK6P1hNkcqObplY77jxjN7PZLSiw40dPhXRp6wMsUDFlTvekNU9WTLf1aUI1FMMXfqkbTvL2VEiqLiNgaqfbZxpoS%5FoDovHVySwMhclOBAzDf2tZACdYTB4t12ZLNcRbozupnzvVOTSe3l7NxBZ2tEgCJYz2n%2Ddh2UwXwncHsC424NZCqs%2Dk0794zXQ7Rw%5F1tcHyrDSSIgW%2DYOVyAvPVWUD8QWtsN%2DuW5rzyA%2E%2E | accessdate = 2010-01-31 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States spends .04% of its [[GDP]] or $63 billion on preschool education.&lt;ref name="cintro" /&gt;

The benefits and challenges of a public preschool reflect the available funding. Funding can range from federal, state, local public allocations, private sources, and parental fees.{{sfn|Levin|Schwartz|2007|p=4}} The problem of funding a public preschool occurs not only from limited sources but from the cost per child. As of 2007, the average cost across the lower 48 states was $6,582.{{sfn|Levin|Schwartz|2007}} Four categories determine the costs of public preschools: personnel ratios, personnel qualifications, facilities and transportation, and health and nutrition services. These costs depend heavily on the cost and quality of services provided.{{sfn|Levin|Schwartz|2007|p=14}} The main personnel factor related to cost is teacher qualifications. Another determinant of cost is the length of the school day. Longer sessions cost more.{{sfn|Levin|Schwartz|2007}}

Collaboration has helped fund programs in several districts. Collaborations with area Head Start and other private preschools helped fund a public preschool in one district. "We're very pleased with the interaction. It's really added a dimension to our program that's been very positive".{{sfn|Reeves|2000}} The National Head Start Bureau has been looking for more opportunities to partner with public schools. Torn Schultz of the Bureau states, "We're turning to partnership as much as possible, either in funds or facilities to make sure children get everything necessary to be ready for school".{{sfn|Reeves|2000|p=6}}

==Advocacy==
The [[Universal Preschool]] movement is an international effort to make preschool available to families, as it is for [[primary education]]. Various jurisdictions and advocates have differing priorities for access, availability and funding sources.

In the United States, most preschool advocates support the [[National Association for the Education of Young Children]]'s Developmentally Appropriate Practices.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The [[National Association for the Education of Young Children]] (NAEYC) and the National Association of Child Care Professionals (NACCP) publicize and promote the idea of [[developmentally appropriate practice]], although many institutions have not taken that approach. NAEYC claimed that although 80% of kindergarten classrooms claim to be developmentally appropriate, only 20% actually are.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Curricula ==
{{Main|Curricula in early childhood care and education}}

Curricula for pre-school children have long been a hotbed for debate. Much of this revolves around content and [[pedagogy]]; the extent to which academic content should be included in the curriculum and whether formal instruction or child-initiated exploration, supported by adults, is more effective.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Katz, L. ''Curriculum Disputes in Early Childhood Education''. ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education. EDO-PS-99-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of an academic curriculum are likely to favour a focus on basic skills, especially [[literacy]] and ''numeracy'', and structured pre-determined activities for achieving related goals. Internationally, there is strong opposition to this type of early childhood care and education curriculum and defence of a broad-based curriculum that supports a child's overall development including health and physical development, emotional and spiritual well-being, social competence, intellectual development and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J. 2004. ''Curriculum in early childhood education and care''. UNESCO Policy Brief on Early Childhood. No. 26, September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of document that emerges from this perspective is likely to be more open, offering a framework which teachers and parents can use to develop curricula specific to their contexts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=243–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National variations==
{{see also|Category:Education by country}}
Preschool education, like all other forms of education, is intended by the society that controls it to transmit important cultural values to the participants. As a result, different cultures make different choices about preschool education. Despite the variations, there are a few common themes. Most significantly, preschool is universally expected to increase the young child's ability to perform basic self-care tasks such as dressing, feeding, and toileting.{{sfn|Davidson|Tobin|Wu|1989|pp=188-221}}

===China===
The study of early childhood education (ECE) in [[China]] has been intimately influenced by the reforms and progress of Chinese politics and the economy. Currently, the Chinese government has shown interest in early childhood education, implementing policies in the form of The Guidance for Kindergarten Education (Trial Version) in 2001 and The National Education Reform and Development of Long-Term Planning Programs (2010–2020) in 2010. It has been found that China's kindergarten education has dramatically changed since 1990. In recent years, various Western curricula and pedagogical models have been introduced to China, such as Montessori programs, Reggio Emilia, Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), and the Project Approach. Many kindergartens have faced difficulties and challenges in adapting these models in their programs. Therefore, a heated debate about how the Western curricula can be appropriated in the Chinese cultural context has been initiated between early childhood researchers and practitioners. Research has revealed that the most important aim for promoting curriculum reform is to improve kindergarten teachers' professional knowledge, such as their understanding of the concept of play and pedagogy, and perceptions of inclusion and kindergarten-based curriculum. Furthermore, within the process of reform, family education and family collaborations cannot be ignored in child development.
Early childhood education in China has made dramatic progress since the 1980s. In Tobin, et al. 2009, which studies across three cultures, the continuity and change across the systems of early childhood education are evident. The project report Zhongguo Xueqian Jiaoyu Fazhan Zhanlue Yanjiu Ketizu 2010 reflects upon the development of China's early childhood education and locates the current situation of the development of early childhood education. The historical development of Chinese early childhood education indicates three distinct cultural threads, including traditional culture, communist culture, and Western culture, that have shaped early childhood education in China, as demonstrated in Zhu and Zhang 2008 and Lau 2012. Furthermore, currently, administrative authorities intend to establish an independent budget for the ECE field in order to support early childhood education in rural areas (Zhao and Hu 2008). A higher quality of educational provisions for children living in rural areas will be another goal for the Chinese government. Many researchers have detailed the important issues of early childhood education, especially teacher education. The exploratory study in Hu and Szente 2010 (cited under Early Childhood Inclusive Education) has indicated that Chinese kindergarten teachers hold negative attitudes toward inclusion of children with disabilities, as they do not have enough knowledge and skills for working with this population. This indicates that kindergarten teachers need to improve their perceptions of children with disabilities. Furthermore, Gu 2007 has focused on the issues of new early childhood teachers' professional development and puts forward some feasible suggestions about how new teachers deal with key events in their everyday teaching practices. With regard to families' support of their children's early development at home, family education should be focused and the collaborative partnership between kindergarten and family needs to be enhanced. Teachers' attitudes toward family intervention are a vital aspect of teacher-family collaboration. Therefore, kindergarten teachers should support family members in their role as the child's first teacher and build collaborative partnerships with family, as presented in Ding 2007. Furthermore, kindergarten teachers should be considered as active researchers in children's role play. This supports the co-construction of their teaching knowledge in relation to children's initiation/subjectivity in role play (Liu, et al. 2003).

===Turkey===
Preschool education is starting in [[Turkey]] at the age of 5 while primary level education is starting at the age of 6.

===Japan===
{{POV section|date=September 2015|talk=Japan NPOV issues}}
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
In [[Japan]], development of social skills and a sense of group belonging are major goals. Classes tend to have up to 40 students, to decrease the role of the teacher and increase peer interactions. Participation in group activities is highly valued, leading some schools to, for example, count a child who is standing still near a group exercise session as participating. Children are taught to work harmoniously in large and small groups, and to develop cooperativeness, kindness and social consciousness. The most important goal is to provide a rich social environment that increasingly isolated [[nuclear families]] do not provide; unstructured play time is valued.

Children are allowed to resolve disputes with each other, including physical fighting. Most behavioral problems are attributed to the child's inappropriately expressed emotional dependency. Remedies involve accepting the child, rather than treatment with drugs or punishment. Japanese culture attributes success to effort rather than inborn talent, leading teachers to ignore innate differences between children by encouraging and praising perseverance. They work to ensure that all students meet the standard rather that each reaches his or her own potential. Although preschools exhibit great variety, most target age-appropriate personal development, such as learning empathy, rather than academic programs. Academic programs tend to be more common among Westernized and Christian preschools.{{sfn|Davidson|Tobin|Wu|1989|pp=12–71}}

===United States===
{{see also|Pre-Kindergarten}}
In the [[United States]], nursery school is provided in a variety of settings. In general, pre-school is meant to promote development in children through planned programs. Pre-school is defined as: "center-based programs for four-year olds that are fully or partially funded by state education agencies and that are operated in schools or under the direction of state and local education agencies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpg.unc.edu/~ncedl/pages/pre-k_study.cfm Pre-kindergarten study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401074857/http://www.fpg.unc.edu/~NCEDL/pages/pre-k_study.cfm |date=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pre-schools, both private and school sponsored, are available for children from ages three to five. Many of these programs follow similar curriculum as pre-kindergarten.

In the [[United States]], preschool education emphasizes individuality. Children are frequently permitted to choose from a variety of activities, using a [[Learning centers in American elementary schools|learning center]] approach. During these times, some children draw or paint, some [[House (game)|play house]], some play with puzzles while some listen to the teacher read a story aloud. Activities vary in each session. Each child is assumed to have particular strengths and weaknesses to be encouraged or ameliorated by the teachers. A typical belief is that "children's play is their work" and that allowing them to select the type of play, the child will meet his or her developmental needs. Preschools also adopt American ideas about justice, such as the [[rule of law]] and the idea that everyone is [[innocent until proven guilty]]. Teachers actively intervene in disputes and encourage children to resolve them verbally ("use your words") rather than physically. Children may be punished with a [[Time-out (parenting)|time out]] or required to apologize or make reparations for misbehavior. Teachers assist children to explain what happened, before any decision to punish is made. Self-expressive language skills are emphasized through informal interactions with teachers and through structured group activities such as [[Show and tell (education)|show and tell]] exercises to enable the child to describe an experience to an adult. Resources vary depending on the wealth of the students, but generally are better equipped than other cultures. Most programs are not subsidized by government, making preschools relatively expensive even though the staff is typically poorly compensated. Student-teacher ratios are lower than in other cultures, ideally about 15 students per group. Parents and teachers see teachers as extensions of or partial substitutes for  parents and consequently emphasize personal relationships and consistent expectations at home and at school.{{sfn|Davidson|Tobin|Wu|1989|pp=126–187}}

In the [[United States]], students who may benefit from [[special education]] receive services in preschools. Since the enactment of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) Public Law 101-476 in 1975 and its amendments, PL 102-119 and PL 105-17 in 1997, the educational system has moved away from self-contained special education classrooms to inclusion, leading special education teachers to practice in a wider variety of settings. As with other stages in the life of a child with special needs, the [[Individualized Education Plan]] (IEP) or an [[Individual Family Service Plan]] (IFSP) is an important way for teachers, administrators and parents to set guidelines for a partnership to help the child succeed in preschool.

====Cooperative preschools====

Formally starting in 1916, cooperative preschools are common throughout much of America and focus on providing a preschool environment for children and parents that meet [[Cooperative|cooperative]] ideas.

* Parent involvement
* Parent participation
* Parent education in early childhood education programs&lt;ref name="pcpi_home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parent Cooperative Preschools International|url=https://www.preschools.coop/|accessdate=2018-06-15|publisher=PCPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Head Start ====
{{main|Head Start (program)}}
The goal of [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] and of [[Early Head Start]] is to increase the school readiness of young children in low-income families.  These programs serve children from birth to age five, pregnant women, and their families. Head Start was started by the Federal Government in 1964 to help meet the needs of disadvantaged pre-school children.

The office of Economic Opportunity launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965. It was then transferred to the Office of Child Development in the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1969. Today it is a program within the Administration on Children, Youth and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services. Programs are administered locally by school systems and non-profit organizations.

*Services provided by Head Start
#Disabilities - All programs fully include children with disabilities
#Education - The goal of Head Start is to ensure that those children enrolled in the program are ready to begin school. Activities are geared towards skill and knowledge domains.
#Family and Community Partnerships - both groups are involved in the operation, governance, and evaluation of the program.
#Health - Health is seen as an important factor in a child's ability to thrive and develop.  The program provides screenings to evaluate a child's overall health, regular health check-ups, and good practices in oral health, hygiene, nutrition, personal care, and safety.
#Program Management and Operations - "focus on delivering high-quality child development services to children from low-income families."

However, a rigorous preschool can be developmentally detrimental to children and cause social, emotional, and educational problems later in life. Although an essential based preschool is not focused on academics and kindergarten routines, children learn a lot more valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their life. Research has shown that of the two an essential based preschool is the better option for children, because of their specific ways of learning.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], pre-school education in nursery classes or schools has some local government funding for children aged between two and four. Pre-school education can be provided by childcare centres, playgroups, nursery schools and nursery classes within [[primary schools]]. Private voluntary or independent (PVI sector) nursery education is also available throughout the UK and varies between structured pre-school education and a service offering child-minding facilities.

Nursery in England is also called FS1 which is the first year of foundation before they go into primary or infants.

The curriculum goals of a nursery school are more specific than for childcare but less strenuous than for [[primary school]]. For example, the Scottish Early Years Framework&lt;ref name="earlyyears"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf Early Years Framework], Scottish Government, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Curriculum for Excellence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/curriculumforexcellence/index.asp Curriculum for Excellence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801110701/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/curriculumforexcellence/index.asp |date=1 August 2010 }}, Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt; define expected outcomes even at this age. In some areas, the provision of nursery school services is on a [[user pays]] or limited basis while other governments fund nursery school services.

====England====

A voucher system for nursery provision was introduced in England and Wales under the Major government, providing for 15 hours per week free childcare or education for three and four-year-olds, much of it provided through reception classes in primary schools. This was replaced by the Blair government with direct funding by local education authorities.  Hence every child in [[England]] at the first [[school term]] after their third birthday is now entitled to 15 hours per week free childcare funding. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/childcare/paying_help34.shtml BBC Parenting, Help with Child Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303224517/http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/childcare/paying_help34.shtml |date=3 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-schools in [[England]] follow the [[Early Learning Goals]], set by the [[Early Years Foundation Stage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix 2: early years foundation stage|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-childcare-and-early-education/2010-to-2015-government-policy-childcare-and-early-education#appendix-2-early-years-foundation-stage|publisher=www.gov.uk|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for education produced by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] which carries on into their first year of school at the age of four. This year of school is usually called [[Reception (School)|Reception]]. The Early Learning Goals cover the main areas of education without being subject driven. These areas include&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qca.org.uk/10000.html QCA Foundation Stage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610175806/http://www.qca.org.uk/10000.html |date=10 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Personal, social and emotional development (prime area)
* Communication and Language (prime area)
* Physical education (prime area)
* Literacy (specific area)
* Mathematics (specific area)
* Understanding the World (specific area)
* Expressive Art &amp; Design (specific area)

Until the mid-1980s, nursery schools only admitted pupils in the final year (three terms) leading up to their admission to primary school, but pupils now attend nursery school for four or five terms. It is also common practise for many children to attend nursery much earlier than this. Many nurseries have the facilities to take on babies, using the 'Early Years Foundation Stage', framework as a guide to give each child the best possible start to becoming a competent learner and skilful communicator.

====Wales====

Provision in Wales followed England until devolution and subsequently diverged.  Now early years education in [[Wales]] is provided half-time for children aged 3–4 (Nursery) and full-time for those between the ages of 4 and 5 (Reception). Since 2005 it has been a statutory duty for all Local Education Authorities to secure sufficient nursery education in their area for children from the term following their third birthday.

Currently, the Early Years curriculum in Wales, produced by the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills,is set out in the booklet "Desirable Outcomes for Children's Learning Before Compulsory School Age".&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.accac.org.uk/eng/content.php?cID=3&amp;pID=59 DELLS - Desirable outcomes for children's learning before compulsory school age&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a new 'Foundation Phase' covering 3-7 year olds is being rolled out across Wales from 2008, with a focus on 'learning through play',&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/educationandskills/policy_strategy_and_planning/early-wales/foundation_phase/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government | What is the Foundation Phase?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080912103153/http%3A//new.wales.gov.uk/topics/educationandskills/policy_strategy_and_planning/early%2Dwales/foundation_phase/?lang%3Den |date=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers seven areas of learning:
* Personal and Social Development and Well Being
* Language, Literacy and Communication Skills
* Mathematical Development
* Bilingualism and Multi-cultural Understanding
* Knowledge and Understanding of the World
* Physical Development
* Creative Development

====Northern Ireland====

In Northern Ireland funded Nursery School places can be applied for from ages 3 and up.
Preschool education is delivered also by '''PreSchools''', also referred to as Playschools or Playgroups. A Nursery School is allowed to enrol up to 26 children into a class, with the curriculum being delivered by a qualified teacher and a Nursery Assistant. A preschool, which delivers the same curriculum, is also permitted to admit a maximum of 26 children to any single session. However, the regulations for personnel differ. The Preschool must have a Supervisor with an NVQ 3 qualification in Child Care (or Equivalent). There must be one qualified and vetted adult for every 8 children. Funding is applied for through PEAGs (Preschool Education Advisory Group). Both nursery and preschool settings are inspected by the Education and Training Inspectorate. Preschools are also subject to inspection by local Social Services.

====Scotland====

In [[Scotland]] a voucher system for part-time pre-school provision was introduced in parallel with England and Wales under the Major government, but with a strong emphasis on age-appropriate education rather than simply childcare, and avoiding the use of reception classes in primary schools. Now children are entitled to a place in a nursery class when they reach their third birthday. This gives parents the option of two years of funded pre-school education before beginning primary one, the first year of compulsory education. Nursery children who are three years old are referred to as ante-pre-school whilst children who are four years old are termed pre-school.  Pre-school education in Scotland is planned around the Early Level of the [[Curriculum for Excellence]] which identifies Outcomes &amp; Experiences around the following eight curricular areas:

* Expressive Arts,
* Health &amp; Wellbeing,
* Languages,
* Mathematics,
* Religious &amp; Moral Education,
* Sciences
* Social Studies
* Technologies

Responsibility for the review of care standards in Scottish nurseries rests with the [[Care Commission]].

===Ireland===

Starting in the year of 2010, Ireland passed a law stating that all children of the age 3 years and 2 months and less than 4 years and 7 months are qualified to attend a preschool free of charge. Before this law was passed there was a large number of children who did not attend an Early Childhood Education Program. The programs that were offered operated voluntary and required the parents to pay a steep fee per child. This left many families with no option but to keep the kids at home. The government soon realized that a large number of children were having trouble in their first years of primary school and parents were having to stay home becoming jobless. Once the government issued the free preschool scheme, Ireland's preschool enrollment rate increased to about 93%.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Childhood." Department of Education and Skills. N.p., n.d.

The '''Secret Garden''' is an outdoor nursery school in [[Letham, Fife]], Scotland, for children aged 3–5 years. It is a [[forest kindergarten]] in which children walk to a woodland every day, in almost any weather. They use the natural resources they find there rather than modern toys (although with some additional equipment) to learn according to the government educational framework&lt;ref name="earlyyears"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf Early Years Framework], Scottish Government, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; under the heading "Nature as Teacher".

The Secret Garden was started&lt;ref name="ltsearlyyears15"&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/earlyyearsmatters/issue15/secretgarden.asp Early Years Matters]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} online newsletter&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 by Cathy Bache, a drama and primary teacher and parent of three. Before opening this, she provided childcare to a smaller number of children, and developed her ideas during this time.

[[Forest kindergarten|Forest kindergartens]] were started in the 1950s and became popular in Germany in the 1990s.

==Motivation==
Cathy Bache writes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/roots.htm Roots] of the Secret Garden&lt;/ref&gt; of being a drama teacher, "I believe that this formative training in developing, intuiting and supporting the child’s mind to open in a creative and expressive way to the full realms of the imagination has led me to where I am now: in the woods with pre-school children, supporting the creation of their own magic. We have no toys, limited practical resources of useful tools but plenty of space and opportunity to go where the imagination may take us.

"Within the woodland there is space and freedom, a wildness and variety of landscapes to explore and play, offering the children: mystery, magic and adventure, places to hide in, dens to create, physical and dexterous skills to develop. It is recognised that the senses of a child are stimulated within the natural environment; their desire to look, listen, touch, taste and smell heightened, leading them to develop curiosity, discovery, a graceful learning of what is happening for the individual, the group, the woodland and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/About%20the%20Secret%20Garden.pdf Secret Garden information sheets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008204516/http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/About%20the%20Secret%20Garden.pdf |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and eligibility==
The Secret Garden is funded by government grants and private donors, but does not operate for profit. Children are entitled to use government funding credits in the nursery, and parents can supplement this with tax free childcare vouchers&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt; or ordinary payments.

It has received over £7000 from the National Lottery.

It is open 49 weeks a year, for children aged 3–5. Priority of places is given to children from within the catchment area of Letham Primary School and existing clients. Parents can choose to spend their child's standard government funded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt; nursery hours there, or pay for additional time. Tax free vouchers&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"/&gt; from an employer may be used.

==Awards==
Newspapers and magazines have written articles on the Secret Garden, including the weekly news magazine ''[[Maclean's]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20070122_139722_139722 "Everybody in the vegetable patch!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407073516/http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20070122_139722_139722 |date=2009-04-07 }}, article on the Secret Garden in Scotland, and outdoor education for children in general, in ''[[Macleans]]'' 22 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada, and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/oct/30/childrensservices.earlyyearseducation Pioneer nursery stays outdoors - in all weathers] in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceTEC® was established in 2002 as an NSF National Center of Excellence funded in part by a three-year NSF Advanced Technological Education Program grant and renewed in 2005 for an additional four years. SpaceTEC® was awarded a four-year follow-on grant in 2009 as an NSF National Resource Center, and in April, 2013, it received a four-year renewal of its NSF grant.  The Center is now expanding operations to Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[STEM fields]]) technicians working in technical fields beyond aerospace through its ‘’’CertTEC®’’’ commercial industry credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questionmark.com/us/casestudies/Pages/spacetec.aspx QuestionMark Case Study].

The original consortium of industry, academia, and government representatives was known as the Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer, a not-for-profit Florida corporation founded in 1994 to provide technician education for [[geographic information systems]]. Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer received one of the first [[National Science Foundation]] grants for two-year community and technical colleges. The founding partners were all located near NASA or Department of Defense locations, providing a consortium strongly linked to post-secondary education programs for the nation’s technical workforce in [[aerospace]] and defense.

The '''Sun Language Theory''' ({{lang-tr|Güneş Dil Teorisi}}) was a [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalist]] [[pseudoscientific]] [[linguistics|linguistic]] hypothesis developed in [[Turkey]] in the 1930s that proposed that all human [[language]]s are descendants of one proto-[[Turkic Languages|Turkic]] primal language. The theory proposed that because this primal language had close [[phonemic]] resemblances to Turkish, all other languages can essentially be traced back to Turkic roots. According to the theory, the Central Asian worshippers, who wanted to salute the omnipotence of the sun and its life-giving qualities, had done so by transforming their meaningless blabbering into a coherent set of ritual utterings, and language was born, hence the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aytürk, İlker |date=November 2004 |title=Turkish Linguists against the West: The Origins of Linguistic Nationalism in Atatürk's Turkey |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1–25 |location=London |publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co (Routledge) |doi=10.1080/0026320042000282856 |issn=0026-3206 |oclc=86539631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Influences on the theory included:

* the ideas of the [[France|French]] historian [[Hilaire de Barenton]], expressed in  "L'Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples", that all languages originated from [[hieroglyph]]s and [[cuneiform]] used by [[Sumer]]ians&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

* a paper of the [[Austria]]n linguist Hermann F. Kvergić of [[Vienna]] entitled "La psychologie de quelques éléments des langues Turques" ("The Psychology of Some Elements of the [[Turkic Languages]]")&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Laut, Jens Peter |year=2002 |title=Noch einmal zu Dr. Kvergić |journal=Turkic Languages |url=http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/1830/pdf/Laut_Noch_einmal_zu_Dr_Kvergic.pdf |format=PDF reprinted online |volume=6 |pages=120–133 |location=Wiesbaden, Germany |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |issn=1431-4983 |oclc=37421320 |accessdate=2007-12-05 | language=German}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], not only gave the theory official backing and material support&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Speros Vryonis]]. ''The Turkish State and History: Clio meets the Grey Wolf, 2nd Ed''. Thessaloniki: Institute for Balkan Studies, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; but also was himself a very important contributor to its development, "though clearly he did not do all the donkey work".&lt;ref name=LewisTLRbook/&gt;

==Tenets==
As described in a 1936 ''[[New York Times]]'' article on the curriculum of the newly opened School of Language, History and Geography of [[Ankara University]], the theory&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;claims that the Sumerians, being Turks, originating in Central Asia, all languages also consequently originated there and first used by the Turks. The first language, in fact, came into being in this way: Prehistoric man, i.e., Turks in the most primitive stage, was so struck by the effects of the sun on life that he made of it a deity whence sprang all good and evil. Thence came to him light, darkness, warmth and fire, with it were associated all ideas of time: height, distance, movement, size,  and give expression to his feelings. The sun was thus the first thing to which a name was given. It was "ag" (pronounced agh), and from this syllable all words in use today are derived. This, briefly, is the theory about the "sun language," and with the new conception of Turkish history it will be taught in the new Angora school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In short, based upon a heliocentric view of the origin of civilization and human languages, the theory claimed that the Turkish language was the language which all civilized languages derived from.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar (1996.). ''Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State''. [[University of California Press]]. P. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the words provided with false Turkish etymologies through the practice of ''[[:wikt:goropism|goropism]]'' were ''God'', attributed to the Turkish ''kut'' (blessing); ''Bulletin'' from ''belleten'' (to learn by heart); ''Electric'' from [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''yaltrık'' (shine).&lt;ref name=LewisTLRbook&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey|last=Lewis|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LewisTLRlecture&gt;{{cite web|first=Geoffrey|last=Lewis|url=http://www.turkishlanguage.co.uk/jarring.htm|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|series=Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul: The Jarring Lecture|date=11 February 2002|website=http://www.turkishlanguage.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, "it is possible that the Sun Language Theory was adopted by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] in order to legitimize the Arabic and Persian words which the Turkish language authorities did not manage to uproot. This move compensated for the failure to provide a neologism for every foreignism/loanword."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil’ad (2003), [http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X ‘‘Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew’’], Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formative assessment]]s are informal and formal tests given by teachers during the learning process. These specific assessment modifies the activities done in the classroom, so that there is more student achievement. It identifies strengths and weakness and target areas that needs work.

[[Summative assessment]]s evaluate students learning at the end of an instructional unit such as a chapter or specified topic. Final papers, midterms and final exams allow the teachers to determine if you comprehended the information given correctly.

[[Norm-referenced test]]s compare a student's performance against a national or other "norm" group.

[[Educational assessment|Performance-based assessments]] requires students to solve real world problems or produce something with real world application. These specific assessment allows the educator to distinguish how well the students think critical and analytical as well as .Restricted response is known to be more narrowly defined than extended response task.  Examples would be multiple choice question and answers as opposed to extended response which normally is connected to writing a report.

[[Authentic assessment]] is the measurement of accomplishments that are worth while compared to multiple choice standardized tests.

Selective response assessment is also referred to as objective assessments including [[multiple choice]], [[Extended matching items|matching]], and true and false questions.  It is very effective and efficient methods for measuring students knowledge. It is a very common form of assessing the students in the classroom.

'''''Zero Day''''' is a 2003 American film directed by [[Ben Coccio]] about a [[school shooting]]. It was inspired by the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]].&lt;ref name=NewEnglandFilm&gt;{{cite web|first=Amy |last=Roeder |title=Zero Score |url=http://www.newenglandfilm.com/news/archives/02september/zeroday.htm |publisher=New England Film |date=September 1, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205111318/http://newenglandfilm.com/news/archives/02september/zeroday.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Andre Kriegman (based on [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]]) and Calvin Gabriel (based on [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Dylan Klebold]]) announce their intention to attack their high school, calling their plan "Zero Day". They keep a video diary on the camera, carefully hiding it from their friends and families. The majority of the film is portrayed through their video filming, and shows them planning, preparing, and explaining some of their motives.

Other scenes show the two attending Andre's birthday party, egging the house of someone they dislike, and Cal going to the prom while Andre works at a pizza place. In one video entry, Cal notes the origin of the name "Zero Day": Cal and Andre originally planned to attack on the first day on which the temperature dropped to zero degrees after they had finished their preparations. This plan soon proved impractical, and they set May 1, 2001 as the new date. Wanting their attack to have a memorable name, they agreed to keep the original title.

The second to last scene of the movie shows the boys arriving at school on May 1 and preparing their plan and weapons in Andre's car. Andre says that he could never have carried out Zero Day without Cal's help, a sentiment Cal echoes. They run into the school, armed with three pistols, an [[M1 carbine]], and a 12-gauge [[pump-action shotgun]], all stolen from Andre's father and cousin. The shooting is shown through the viewpoint of security cameras very similar to [[Columbine High School massacre]]'s view. The dialogue is heard via the cellphone of a student who is shot and killed. Shooting at anyone they see, Andre and Cal eventually see law enforcement arriving in force after sixteen minutes of shooting. After arguing over whether to engage the police in gunfire, the pair decide to count to three and shoot themselves.

The next scene is set on May 10, nine days after the shooting. A group of youths film themselves going to a park where memorial crosses are standing. They say that Andre and Cal killed twelve students and themselves. Finding crosses for the pair, they set them on fire and run back to their cars. The last scene shows the two crosses burning.

==Production==
[[Ben Coccio]] recalls that he was in a [[Brooklyn]] pizzeria on the day of the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], and saw coverage of the event on the eatery's television, commenting, "I remember thinking that I was surprised that it hadn't happened sooner." Coccio was also struck by the extent to which [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] planned that shooting, compared to the impromptu crimes of passion that typified other school shootings. Coccio became eager to address the story in a way that was not exploitative, and drew upon his own views of high school as a place of tension where "anything could happen at any time". Coccio's theory of student school shooters is not that they are the most bullied, as such students tend to develop feelings of inferiority and are likely to harm themselves. Coccio feels that shooters tend to be students with feelings of ''superiority'', and that "when other people don’t confirm that, it really gets under their skin."

None of the numerous Connecticut high schools where he sought to film the movie would allow Coccio access, and he ended up using the interior of a building at [[State University of New York at Purchase]] in Purchase, New York. The "appropriately fortress-like" exterior of the High School was [[New Milford High School (Connecticut)|New Milford High School]] in New Milford, Connecticut, where Coccio lived at the time. 

When casting, Coccio inquired at high schools throughout Connecticut looking for teenagers interested in acting who might not have much or any professional experience. Coccio had three days of open auditions. Andre Keuck responded to an ad Coccio placed in Backstage Magazine and brought his classmate and fellow theater enthusiast Cal Robertson along to the audition. Both boys had acted in Shakespeare productions at the Stratford Avon theater in Stratford, Connecticut. They were encouraged to improvise throughout the film's production.&lt;ref name=NewEnglandFilm/&gt;

==Reception==
''Zero Day'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics, currently holding a 68% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], as well as a 74% audience approval rating. Despite the positive reception from critics and audiences, ''Zero Day'' was a box office bomb, gaining only $8,466 against a $20,000 budget.
