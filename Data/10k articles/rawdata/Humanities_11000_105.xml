'''"A Lost Wand"''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[Jean Ingelow]].  It was first published in 1872 as part of ''The Little Wonder Horn'',&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bibsite/&gt; and later republished as one of the stories in ''Wonder-Box Tales'' in 1902.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg/&gt; The story revolves around Hulda, a lucky young girl in [[Norway]] who receives the opportunity to be granted a wish after finding a ring in her slice of cake.

== Summary ==
After finding a magical ring in her slice of cake, Hulda is given the opportunity to make a wish. A fairy appears from the flower on top of the cake, and tells Hulda she will give her anything she wishes for. Unknowing of what her wish would bring, she asks for the fairy's wand. After handing Hulda her beautiful [[gold]] wand, the fairy is stripped of her powers and will ultimately be held at the will of her enemy if she doesn’t one day retrieve the wand. It could not be returned immediately, it had to be on a midsummers day. Until then, the fairy requested that Hulda keep it safe for her while she was gone. Days passed and the fairy had never returned, this left Hulda believing that the fairy had died. Then a  dishonest guest paid a visit to Hulda and convinced her to trade the wand for a piece of his beautiful jewelry. After trading the wand for a bracelet with a bird clasp, Hulda realizes her visitor was actually a [[gnome]]. The gnome was the enemy the fairy had been worried about; with the wand in his possession he would make the fairy his slave. Hulda was aware she made a mistake, and did not rest until she retrieved the gold wand and returned it to the fairy. Not only did she give the fairy her powers back, but also in turn she saved her own life.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg/&gt;

== History and origin ==
"A Lost Wand" was written in the mid-1800s.  Much of Ingelow’s literature was influenced by the writings of [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[George Macdonald]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Her stories were written specifically for children, not so much to teach a lesson; but for entertainment,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} which was a relatively new concept during this time period.

== Characters ==

=== Hulda ===

Hulda is a young girl from Norway whose world is turned upside down after being granted a wish by a fairy. After receiving her wish, she regrets ever making it. She spends the next few years of her life trying to undo what she asked for. Her genuine, courageous attitude is what ultimately helps her catch the enemy and relieve the fairy of Hulda's unfortunate wish.

=== The Fairy ===

The reason for the fairy's existence is to better the lives of mortals, which she does by granting them one wish. After an unfortunate wish is made by a young girl Hulda, the fairy is stripped of her powers and held at the will of her enemy she goes into hiding. Her hopeful outlook on the situation however is the guidance that the little girl Hulda needed to retrieve what she had once lost for the fairy.

=== The Peddler (Gnome) ===

The [[gnome]] is a creature covered in dirt and earthly material. Although he disguised himself as "The Peddler", he was still the known enemy of the fairy. His devious, evil ways almost stripped the fairy of her powers for good. His bad intentions did not go unpunished; in the end it is always those with kindness in mind who prosper.

'''AEGIS''' is a research network of European centres in [[African studies]], which aims to create synergies between experts and institutions. With primary emphasis on Social Sciences and Humanities, AEGIS' main goal is to improve understanding about contemporary African societies.

AEGIS was founded in 1991 by African studies centres in [[Bayreuth]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Leiden]], [[London]], and [[Uppsala]]. In the course of a decade, it developed into a network that included centres from more European countries. Yearly meetings of the member centres were instrumental for the development of multiple links between them. Starting in 1998, international conferences on  a variety of thematic areas were organized in different countries. 

[[File:ECAS2007Leiden.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Conference in Leiden (2007)]]
In the new millennium, the organization of European Conferences on African Studies (ECAS), open to everybody, became the central activity. These conferences are taking place every two years, always in a different country.  The first European Conference on African Studies was held at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and the [[Institute of Commonwealth Studies]] in [[London]] in July 2005; the second Conference was held at the [[Afrika-Studiecentrum, Leiden|African Studies Centre]] in [[Leiden]], Netherlands, in July 2007. ECAS 2009 was held in [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and ECAS 2011 was organized by the [[Nordic Africa Institute]] at [[Uppsala]]. The 5th European Conference on African Studies was organized in 2013 by the Centro de Estudos Africanos at [[ISCTE|ISCTE-University Institute]] of [[Lisbon]]. In 2015 the 6th ECAS took place in [[Paris]], and the 7th edition of ECAS will take place in [[Basel]] in 2017.

'''Arthur Frederick Wright''' (December 3, 1913&amp;nbsp;– August 11, 1976) was an [[United States|American]] academic, [[sinologist]], editor and professor of history at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress (LOC), [http://errol.oclc.org/laf/n88-58212.html  Wright, Arthur F.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He specialized in Chinese social and intellectual history of the pre-modern period.&lt;ref name="nyt1976"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/08/14/75546507.pdf  "Prof. Arthur Wright of Yale, 62, Scholar of Chinese History, Dies,"] ''New York Times'' (US). August 14, 1976; retrieved 2011-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wright's undergraduate degrees at [[Stanford University]] and [[Oxford University]] were followed by further studies at [[Harvard]].  He earned a master's degree in 1940; and he was awarded a doctorate in 1947.&lt;ref name="nyt1976"/&gt;

==Career==
Wright and his wife, [[Mary C. Wright]], joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1947; and both were made full professors in 1958.  In 1959, Wright and his wife joined the faculty at Yale.  In 1961, Wright became the Charles Seymour Professor of History at Yale.&lt;ref name="nyt1976"/&gt;

Wright believed that the scholar "should occasionally stand back and contemplate the whole continuum of time and of problems which give meaning to his specialized studies."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Sidney D. "Review: Arthur F. Wright. (1957). ''Buddhism in Chinese History''," ''The Historian: a Journal of History'' (US). Vol. 22, 1959, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avon County Council''' was the [[county council]] of the non-metropolitan county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] in south west England. It came into its powers on 1 April 1974 and was abolished on 1 April 1996 at the same time as the county. The county council was based in [[Bristol]] at [[Avon House, Bristol|Avon House]] and Avon House North. It was replaced with four authorities: [[Bristol City Council]], [[South Gloucestershire Council]], [[North Somerset Council]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset Council]].

'''BookSwim''' is a [[Privately held company|private]] [[United States|American]] online [[book rental]] service, offering rental-by-mail of both [[book|hardcover]] and [[paperback books]].  The company was launched in 2007 and has grown steadily since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneursstartupsmagazine/2008/may/193398.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
George Burke co-founded BookSwim with friend [[Shamoon Siddiqui]] in April 2007, in Shamoon's basement for the first ten months of the company’s existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114024721/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has since branched out, briefly moving to [[Aberdeen, NJ]] before establishing headquarters in [[Newark, NJ]] with distribution facilities in eastern [[Pennsylvania]].

=== Rental Service ===
BookSwim provides unlimited rental-by-mail of [[hardcover]] and [[paperback book]]s on a monthly subscription basis. Subscribers add books to their online reading list, called a Rental Pool. When the subscriber returns finished books, the next books in the Rental Pool ship out. The similarity to [[Netflix]]'s business model has led to the website informally being called the 'Netflix for books.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13512_3-10223739-23.html&lt;/ref&gt;' BookSwim's plans begin at $9.99 per month and include only hardcover and paperback books.

=== Honors &amp; Appearances ===
BookSwim entered and won [[Rutgers University]]’s Business Plan Competition in 2008 and an accompanying cash prize of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474977367490&amp;nav=Namespace{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was named a 'Startup to Watch' by [[Entrepreneur Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneursstartupsmagazine/2008/may/193398.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the New Jersey Technology Council.

=== Market Conditions &amp; Competitiveness ===
BookSwim's subscribers tend to be high-income avid readers who read over forty books a year; roughly 80% of them are female.&lt;ref&gt;http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/07/bookswim-com-aims-for-sweet-spot-of-american-readers/&lt;/ref&gt; As "the core of [the] business is in bestsellers,&lt;ref&gt;http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/07/bookswim-com-aims-for-sweet-spot-of-american-readers/&lt;/ref&gt;" BookSwim cites its rental of hardcovers as its main competitive edge over competitor [[Booksfree]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2008-05-13/bindley-bookrentals&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationships with Libraries ====
Though [[libraries]]’ reactions to BookSwim have included anxiety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tametheweb.com/2007/01/libraries_netflix_bookswim.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231034620/http://tametheweb.com/2007/01/libraries_netflix_bookswim.html |archivedate=2010-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and resentment,&lt;ref&gt;http://marketinginlibraries.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/we-have-met-the-enemy-and-he-isbookswim/&lt;/ref&gt; BookSwim does not see itself as competition with libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114024721/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has expressed interest in taking libraries on as customers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6456823.html&lt;/ref&gt; and its co-founders appeared at the 2008 Colorado Interlibrary Loan Conference to speak about potential partnerships with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aclin.org/coloillconf/2008ILLSchedule.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, BookSwim donated an extra 13,000 books from its inventory to the [[Newark Public Library]] near its new offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/newark/index.ssf/2008/10/online_bookstore_donates_title.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cahokia Woodhenge''' was a series of large [[timber circle]]s located roughly {{convert|850|m|ft}} to the west of [[Monks Mound]] at the [[Mississippian culture]] [[Cahokia]] [[archaeological site]] near [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. They are thought to have been constructed between 900 and 1100 CE; with each one being larger and having more posts than its predecessor.&lt;ref name=VIS&gt;{{Cite web| title= Visitors Guide to the Woodhenge| url= http://greatriverroad.com/somadco/collins/woodhenge.htm| accessdate=2017-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was discovered as part of salvage archaeology in the early 1960s [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highway construction boom]] and one of the circles was reconstructed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=VIS/&gt; The circle has been used to investigate [[archaeoastronomy]] at Cahokia.&lt;ref name=ARCHAEOASTRO&gt;{{Cite thesis| degree= Bachelors| title= American Woodhenge: Archaeoastronomy at Cahokia |url= https://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/handle/10843/16705/Thomas%2C%20Mary%202005.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |author= |last= Thomas |first= Mary |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Northern Illinois University]] | docket= |oclc= | accessdate= 2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual [[equinox]] and [[solstice]] sunrise observation events are held at the site.&lt;ref name=ICT&gt;{{Cite newspaper| title= Cahokia Mounds Mark Spring Equinox : The keepers of Cahokia Mounds will host a spring gathering to celebrate the vernal equinox | url= https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/travel/destinations/spring-equinox-cahokia-mounds/ | newspaper=Indian Country Today | publisher= [[Indian Country Media Network]] | accessdate=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and excavation==
The existence of the series of woodhenges at Cahokia was discovered during [[salvage archaeology]] undertaken by Dr. Warren Wittry in the early 1960s in preparation for a proposed highway interchange. Although the majority of the site contained village house features, a number of unusually shaped large post holes were also discovered. The post holes were {{convert|7|ft|m}} in length and {{convert|2|ft|m}} in width and formed sloping ramps to accommodate the insertion and raising of the estimated {{convert|20|ft|m}} tall posts to a {{convert|4|ft|m}} depth into the ground.&lt;ref name=CMSH&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://cahokiamounds.org/explore/#tab-id-4| title= Woodhenge| publisher= Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site |accessdate= 2017-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the holes were plotted out it was realized that they formed several arcs of equally spaced holes.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER&gt;{{cite web| title= The Skywatchers of Cahokia | author= Iseminger, William R. | url= http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/home/skywatchers-of-cahokia | publisher= Mexicolore | accessdate= 2017-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed analytical work supported the hypothesis that the placement of these posts was by design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Friedlander, Michael W. | title= The Cahokia Sun Circles| journal =The Wisconsin Archeologist | volume= 88 | issue= 1| pages= 78–90| date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittry hypothesized that the arcs could be whole circles and that the site was possibly a calendar for tracking solar events such as solstice and equinoxes. He began referring to the circles as "woodhenges"; comparing the structures to England's well-known circles at [[Woodhenge]] and [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wittry, Warren L. | title= An American Woodhenge | journal= Cranbrook Institute of Science Newsletter | volume= 33 | issue= 9| pages = 102–107| date= 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wittry, Warren L. | title= Discovering and Interpreting the Cahokia Woodhenges | journal= The Wisconsin Archaeologist | volume=77 |issue=3/4| pages= 26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional excavations were undertaken at the site by Dr. [[Robert L. Hall]] in 1963. Hall used the predicted locations from the arcs found in the previous excavation and was able to find more post holes as well as posts near the centers of the circles now thought to be central observation points. Wittry undertook another series of excavations at the site in the late 1970s and confirmed the existence of five separate timber circles in the general vicinity. The circles are now designated Woodhenges I through V in [[Roman numerals]]. Each was a different diameter and had a different number of posts. Because four of the circles overlap each other it is thought they were built in a sequence, with each iteration generally being larger and containing twelve more posts than its predecessor.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt;

[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Woodhenge lies to the west of Monks Mound, at the lower left edge of the illustration]]
The remains of several posts were discovered in the post pits. The type of wood used, red cedar ([[Juniperus virginiana]]), is considered sacred by many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt;  The red cedar is the only native evergreen species in the area and is resistant to disease and decay.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER2/&gt; Traces of [[red ochre]] pigment was also found, suggesting that the posts were probably painted at some point.&lt;ref name=CMSH/&gt; In 1985 William R. Iseminger led a series of excavations to finish finding a full circular sequence of posts. He was able to complete the sequence for what has become known as Woodhenge III (except for nine posts on the western edge that had been lost to dump trucks for road construction fill) and then led a reconstruction of the circle. The reconstruction team was able to obtain enough red cedar logs for half of the holes and then made do with black locust ([[Robinia pseudoacacia]]) for the other half; placing them into the original excavated post positions.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt; The [[Illinois Historic Preservation Division]] (a division of the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]]) oversees the Cahokia site and hosts public sunrise observations at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices.

==Construction sequence==
[[File:Woodhenge Cahokia 3998.jpg|right|thumb|View of the reconstructed Woodhenge III and its alignment with the equinox pole and Monks Mound {{convert|.5|mi|km}} away]]
The structure was rebuilt a number of times during the urban center's roughly 300 year history. The presence of single set posthole houses and [[midden]] deposits at the location suggests the area was a habitation area during the early Emergent Mississippian period; before the timber circles were constructed. And a separate layer of later Mississippian wall trench houses suggests it became a habitation area again after the final woodhenge was no longer in use.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER2&gt;{{cite book | title= Cahokia Mounds : America's First City | author= Iseminger, William| publisher = [[The History Press]] | date= 2010 |pages =121–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Woodhenge I'' was located to the east of the other circles, the only one not built on the same spot as the other four. It had 24 posts and was {{convert|240|ft|m}} in diameter. This circle was dismantled and at a later date Mound 44 was constructed, partially covering this location. 
* ''Woodhenge II'' was constructed to the west of the previous circle. It had 36 posts and was {{convert|408|ft|m}} in diameter.
* ''Woodhenge III'' had 48 posts and was {{convert|410|ft|m}} in diameter. It is thought to have been constructed in approximately 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=VIS/&gt; This version of the woodhenge was reconstructed in 1985 using the original holes found during excavations. The 48 posts of the circle are set at 7° 30′ (7 degrees 30 minutes) apart as measured from the geometric center of the circle, although the central post of the circle is offset from the true center by {{convert|5.6|ft|m}} to the east. This facilitates the alignment with perimeter posts marking the winter and summer solstice sunrise positions, correcting for the latitude of Cahokias location.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER2/&gt;
* ''Woodhenge IV'' had 60 posts and was {{convert|476|ft|m}} in diameter.
* ''Woodhenge V'' had an arc and post spacing that suggests it was {{convert|446|ft|m}} in diameter and could have had 72 posts, although only 13 posts were found in a short arc facing the direction of the sunrise. Archaeologists suspect it may not have been a full timber circle and that by this time the large trees needed for the posts may have been getting scarce in the vicinity of Cahokia.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER2/&gt;

===Alignments===
[[File:Cahokia winter solstice sunrise over Fox Mound HRoe 2017sm.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of midwinter sunrise over Mound 60 as seen from Woodhenge III]]
[[File:Woodhenge motif black drink beaker HRoe 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic beaker with woodhenge motif]]
The woodhenge is thought by archaeologists to be a [[solar calendar]], capable of marking equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets for the timing of the agricultural cycle and religious observances. During the equinoxes the sun rises due east of the timber circle. From the vantage point of the center of the circle it appears as if the sun is emerging from the front of Monks Mound which is roughly {{convert|.5|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt; One of the reasons for the changing position and size of the timber circles may have been the growing size of Monks Mound as additional layers of earth raised its height and increased its geographic footprint and the desire to keep this symbolic emergence and alignment intact.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER2/&gt;

The winter solstice sunrise pole is aligned with the Fox Mound&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER2/&gt; (Mound 60, a rectangular [[platform mound]] paired with a conical burial mound, Mound 59) which sits across the grand plaza {{convert|1640|ft|m}} to the south of Monks Mound.&lt;ref name=CMSH2&gt;{{Cite web| url=  https://cahokiamounds.org/mound/mound-59/ | title= Mound 59| publisher= Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site |accessdate= 2017-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the roughly {{convert|46|ft|m}} tall mound projects above the horizon and in Cahokian times would have had a large temple structure at its summit, raising it even higher. From the central pole of Woodhenge III the sun would have appeared to rise from this mound and temple at the winter solstice. Besides their celestial marking functions, the woodhenges also carried religious and ritual meaning that are reflected in their stylized depiction as a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|cross in circle motif]] on ceremonial beakers. One prominent example has markers added to the winter sunrise and sunset positions,&lt;ref name=CAHOKIALAYOUT/&gt; and was found in an offertory pit near the winter solstice post pit. It also had radiating lines that probably symbolized the rays of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Chappell, Sally A.

As there are many more posts than are necessary for these simple alignments some archaeoastronomists have speculated that they were also used to observe other celestial events, such as [[lunar cycle]]s, the motion of the [[Pleiades]], or other stars and planets;&lt;ref name=ARCHAEOASTRO/&gt; while others have suggested they were used to align mound and causeway constructions projects.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt;

==Other timber circles==
[[File:North carolina algonkin-rituale02.jpg|thumb|right|Secotans dancing in a timber circle in North Carolina; watercolor painted by John White in 1585]]
Timber circles have a long history among Native American societies; their use stretches back for thousands of years and continues into the present day. From the 3400 year old [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]] [[Poverty Point]] site in [[Louisiana]] to 2000 year old [[Hopewell tradition]] circles found in [[Ohio]] to the [[Sun Dance]] performed in wooden pole "corrals" by the [[Dhegihan languages|Dhegihan-Siouan]] and [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan]] speaking peoples of the [[Great Plains]]. Archaeologist Timothy Pauketat has hypothesized that some [[Plains Indian]] [[medicine wheels]] and Sun Dance ceremonies may even be descendants of the Cahokia timber circles and their associated rituals and performances.&lt;ref name=PAUKETATCAHOKIA&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Timothy Pauketat| last=Timothy R.| first=Pauketat |title= Cahokia : Ancient Americas Great City on the Mississippi| publisher=[[Viking Press]]| year=2009|isbn=978-0-670-02090-4 |chapter= High Plains Drifting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a timber circle witnessed by Europeans was recorded by watercolor artist [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] in July 1585 when he visited the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] village of [[Secotan]] in [[North Carolina]]. White was the artist-illustrator and mapmaker for the [[Roanoke Colony]] expedition sent by [[Walter Raleigh]] to begin the first attempts at [[British colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia= NCpedia| url= http://ncpedia.org/biography/governors/white| title=John White |author=  Daniels, Dennis F.|accessdate= 2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; White's works represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of the Americas as encountered by England's first colonizers on the Atlantic seaboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/sketching-the-earliest-views-of-the-new-world-92306407/ | title= Sketching the Earliest Views of the New World | journal= Smithsonian Magazine | author= Tucker, Abigal| date= December 2008| accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites watercolor and the writings of the chronicler who accompanied him, [[Thomas Harriot]], describes a great religious festival, possibly the [[Green Corn Ceremony]], with participants holding a ceremonial dance at a timber circle.

Harriot noted that many of the participants had come from surrounding villages and that "every man attyred in the most strange fashion they can devise havinge certayne marks on the backs to declare of what place they bee" and that "Three of the fayrest Virgins" danced around a central post at the center of the timber circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Virginia | url= https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/slide_player?mets_filename=sld3762mets.xml | title= A Selection of John White's Watercolors : A festive dance | accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty Point===

{{main|Poverty Point}}
The oldest known timber circles in North American archaeology were found at Poverty Point in 2009 by archaeologists from the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] and [[Mississippi State University]], led by Poverty Point station archaeologist Dr. Diana Greenlee. They discovered evidence in the {{convert|37.5|acre|ha}} plaza area for multiple wooden post circular structures ranging from {{convert|82|ft|m}} to {{convert|206|ft|m}} in diameter; built during the earliest habitation of the site circa 2400 BCE. The site now has a ring of concrete posts marking the position of one of the circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Archaeology of Events: Cultural Change and Continuity in the Pre-Columbian Southeast | page= 149| editor1= Gilmore, Zackary I. | editor2= O'Donoughue, Jason M. | publisher= [[University of Alabama Press]] | date= 2015| isbn= 978-0817318505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= Poverty Point : Plaza | url= https://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/archaeology/povertypoint/plaza.html |publisher = Louisiana Division of Archaeology |accessdate=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= Poverty Point| author= Greenlee, Diana | url= http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/poverty-point-7 |publisher = Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopewell timber circles===
{{main|Moorehead Circle|Stubbs Earthworks}}
Two examples have been found at [[Hopewell culture]] sites in Ohio. [[Moorehead Circle]] was constructed about two millennia ago at the [[Fort Ancient (Lebanon, Ohio)|Fort Ancient Earthworks]] near [[Lebanon, Ohio]]. It was discovered in 2005 by Jarrod Burks during [[Magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetic surveys]] at the large hilltop earthen [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis| title= Ohio Hopewell Ceremonial Bladelet Use at the Moorehead Circle, Fort Ancient | author= Miller, Gregory L. | url= http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Miller%20Gregory%20Logan.pdf?osu1275003441 | format= Masters| publisher= [[Ohio State University]] | year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site consists of three concentric circles; with the outer circle being about {{convert|60|m|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/hocu/planyourvisit/upload/Lecture%20Series%202008.pdf|title= The Robert L.

According to radiocarbon dates performed on charcoal found at the site, it was built between 40 BCE and 130 CE, with other charcoal fragments from burnt posts dating to 250 to 420 CE, suggesting the circle was in use for several centuries.&lt;ref name=LEPPER&gt;{{Cite web| last= Lepper| first= Bradley T. | date=2007-05-01| url= http://lostworlds.org/woodhenge-at-fort-ancient-raises-interest-in-ritual-past/ | title= ‘Woodhenge’ at Fort Ancient raises interest in ritual past | accessdate= 2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 archaeologist Frank Cowan conducted excavations at the smaller circular enclosure at the [[Stubbs Earthworks]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]; discovering a timber circle {{convert|240|ft|m}} in diameter and composed of 172 large posts. Carbon dating of charcoal found in post molds at the site have dated the structure to 200-300 CE.&lt;ref name=COWAN&gt;{{cite book| author= Cowan, Frank| chapter = Stubbs Earthworks : An Ohio Hopewell "Woodhenge" |editor = Lepper, Bradley T. |title= Ohio Archaeology : An illustrated chronicle of Ohio's Ancient American Indian Cultures |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Orange Frazer Press]] | location = [[Wilmington, Ohio]] | pages= 148–151 | isbn= 978-1882203390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist Marvin Fowler has speculated that the woodhenges also served as “aligners” and that there may have been as many as three more in other strategic locations around the city of Cahokia, built to triangulate and lay out construction projects. At least one other possible circle at Cahokia has been put forward by Fowler, but his suggestion has not yet gained full acceptance by other archaeologists.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt; This location was discovered near [[Mound 72|Mounds 72 and 96]], directly to the south of Monks Mound.

Four other posts in the circle were shown to be at the summer solstice sunrise and sunset and the winter solstice sunrise and sunset positions. This setup is nearly identical to the diameter and post positions of Woodhenge III, differing only in that Woodhenge III was {{convert|2|ft|m}} smaller in diameter. The placement of the two mounds at the location and the directions in which they are oriented correspond to several of the solstice marking posts.&lt;ref name=YoungWoodhenges/&gt; The post nearest the later elite burial of the "Birdman" is the location that marked the summer solstice sunrise at the times of the sites use.&lt;ref name=CAHOKIALAYOUT&gt;{{cite web| title= Cahokia Layout | publisher= Illinois State Museum |url = http://www.museum.state.il.us/RiverWeb/landings/Ambot/prehistory/mississippian/technology/fac-cahokia-layout.html |accessdate= 2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early stages of the mounds were actually constructed around the posts, although at a later point the posts were removed.&lt;ref name=YoungWoodhenges/&gt;

'''Carolingian minuscule''' or '''Caroline minuscule''' is a [[hand (handwriting)|script]] which developed as a calligraphic standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]] could be easily recognized by the [[literate]] class from one region to another. It was developed for the first time, in about 780, by a Benedictine monk of [[Corbie Abbey]] (about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Paris), namely, [[Alcuin of York]].&lt;ref name=Marcia&gt;Colish, Marcia L. Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400-1400. Yale University Press, 1999, 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] between approximately 800 AD and 1200 AD. [[codex|Codices]], [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Christian]] texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into [[blackletter]] and became obsolete, though its revival in the [[Italian Renaissance]] forms the basis of more recent scripts.

==Creation==
[[File:Minuscule caroline.jpg|thumb|Page of text (folio 160v) from a Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848), written in Carolingian minuscule. Text is [[Vulgate]] [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:15-26.]]

The script is derived from [[Uncial script|Roman half uncial]] and the [[insular script]]s that were being used in Irish and English monasteries.  The strong influence of Irish literati on the script can be seen in the distinctively cló-Gaelach (Irish style) forms of the letters, especially a, e, d, g, s and t.

Carolingian minuscule was created partly under the patronage of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] (hence Carolingian). Charlemagne had a keen interest in learning, according to his biographer [[Einhard]]:

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style: italic"&gt;Temptabat et scribere tabulasque et codicellos ad hoc in lecto sub cervicalibus circumferre solebat, ut, cum vacuum tempus esset, manum litteris effigiendis adsuesceret, sed parum successit labor praeposterus ac sero inchoatus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|He also tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to form the letters; however, as he did not begin his efforts in due season, but late in life, they met with ill success.}}

As a part of Charlemagne's educational and religious reforms, and made that every church and monastery should have a copy of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]]. Charlemagne wanted to make the Vulgate Bible more readable for preachers and easier to copy for scribes. Thus, Marcia Colish explains;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Charlemagne looked first to Anglo-Saxon England for a scholar to head his court school, finding him in Alcuin (c. 730-804). He assigned to Alcuin the correction of the Vulgate. In conjunction with this project, and later in his career when he became abbot of Tours, Alcuin invented a new style of handwriting, the Caroline minuscule (Plate 6). This script was far more legible than earlier medieval hands and an improvement on Roman book hands, since it provided spaces between the words, more extensive punctuation, and a hierarchy of hands, with capitals used for titles, a mix of capitals and lower-case letters for subtitles or chapter headings, and lower case for the body of the text. With the newly corrected Bible, pastors would be able to base their teaching and preaching on what it actually said.&lt;ref name=Marcia /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Charlemagne was never fully literate, he understood the value of literacy and a uniform script in running his empire. Charlemagne sent for the English scholar [[Alcuin of York]] to run his palace school and [[scriptorium]] at his capital, [[Aachen]]. Efforts to supplant [[Merovingian script|Gallo-Roman]] and Germanic scripts had been under way before Alcuin arrived at Aachen, where he was master from 782 AD to 796 AD, with a two-year break. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen, of which the [[Ada Gospels]] provide classic models, and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)]], where Alcuin withdrew from court service as an [[abbot]] in 796 AD and restructured the scriptorium.&lt;ref&gt;The production of the scriptorium at Tours was reconstructed by E.K. Rand, ''A Survey of the Manuscripts of Tours'' (Harvard University Press), 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Carolingian minuscule was uniform, with rounded shapes in clearly distinguishable [[glyph]]s, disciplined and above all, legible. Clear capital letters and spaces between words became standard in Carolingian minuscule, which was one result of a campaign to achieve a culturally unifying standardization across the [[Carolingian Empire]].

Traditional charters, however, continued to be written in a [[Merovingian script|Merovingian "chancery hand"]] long after manuscripts of Scripture and classical literature were being produced in the minuscule hand. Documents written in a local language, like [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin, tended to be expressed in traditional local script.

Carolingian script generally has fewer [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] than other contemporary [[script (styles of handwriting)|scripts]], although the [[ampersand|''et'']] (''&amp;''), ''æ'', ''rt'', ''st'' and ''ct'' ligatures are common. The letter ''d'' often appears in an uncial form with an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] slanting to the left, but the letter ''g'' is essentially the same as the modern minuscule letter, rather than the previously common uncial ''ᵹ''. Ascenders are usually "clubbed" – i.e. they become thicker near the top.

The early period of the script, during Charlemagne's reign in the late 8th century and early 9th, still has widely varying letter forms in different regions. The uncial form of the letter ''a'', similar to a double ''c'' (''cc''), is still used in manuscripts from this period. There is also use of punctuation such as the [[question mark]], as in [[Beneventan script]] of the same period. The script flourished during the 9th century, when regional hands developed into an international standard, with less variation of letter forms. Modern [[glyph]]s, such as ''s'' and ''v'', began to appear (as opposed to the "[[long s|long ''s'']]" ''ſ'' and ''u''), and ascenders, after thickening at the top, were finished with a three-cornered wedge. The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter ''w'' also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern [[tittle|dotted]] ''i'' appeared. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Image:Freising manuscript.jpg|thumb|A page of the [[Freising manuscripts]], 10th century [[Slovene language|Slovene]] text written in Carolingian minuscules]]

==Spread==
The new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century [[Freising manuscripts]], which contain the oldest [[Slovene language]], the first [[Latin alphabet|Roman-script]] record of any [[Slavic language]], are written in Carolingian minuscule. In [[Switzerland]], Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in '''Rhaetian minuscule''' tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|t}}, and ligatures such as {{angbr|ri}}, showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. '''Alemannic minuscule''', used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger and broader, very vertical compared to the slanting Rhaetian type. In [[Austria]], [[Salzburg]] was the major centre of Carolingian script, while [[Fulda]], [[Mainz]], and [[Würzburg]] were the major centres in Germany. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slants to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter {{angbr|d}} slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}.

In northern Italy, the monastery at [[Bobbio]] used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the [[Roman Curia]]; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in [[Rome]] after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist [[Visigothic script|Visigothic hand]] survived; and in southern Italy a '[[Beneventan script|Beneventan minuscule]]' survived in the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[duchy of Benevento]] through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.

==Role in cultural transmission==
Scholars during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of our knowledge of classical literature now derives from copies made in the [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.

Though the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by [[Blackletter|Gothic blackletter]] hands, it later seemed so thoroughly 'classic' to the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] originals and modelled their Renaissance hand, the [[humanist minuscule]], on the Carolingian one.&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Louis Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script''. (Rome), 1960, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as [[Aldus Manutius]] of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, 'Carolingian minuscule' is a style of [[typeface]], which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, etc.

'''Castle Rings''' is a [[univallate hill fort]] in the parish of [[Donhead St Mary]] in [[Wiltshire]] in England.&lt;ref name="WSHC11"&gt;Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The fort is a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]], with a list entry identification number of 1005698.&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;Historic England.&lt;/ref&gt; Castle Rings has been dated to the [[Iron Age]] and is situated at an altitude of {{convert|228|m|ft}} upon [[Upper Greensand]] sandstone beds.&lt;ref name="WSHC11"/&gt; The main bulk of the fort enclosure lies within the boundaries of Donhead St Mary parish but some of the outlying earthworks are situated in the neighbouring [[Sedgehill and Semley]] parish.&lt;ref&gt;Historic England. Ordnance Survey 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s a metal detectorist unearthed a hoard of [[stater]] coins of the [[Durotriges]] tribe within the hill fort.&lt;ref&gt;Frere et al 1987, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Theodora Grosvenor described the fort in her 1867 book ''Motcombe, Past and Present'':

{{quote|...a fine encampment, enclosing a space of about 12 acres, and considered to have been originally British, which exists within the angle where the roads from Semley Church and Donhead to Shaftesbury unite by Wincombe Lodge. It bears the name of Castle Rings, and its embankments and ditches are strongly defined, though, from being overgrown with copse-wood, seldom observed.|Lady Theodora Grosvenor|Motcombe, Past and Present 1867, pp. 78-79}}

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Castle Rings, Donhead St Mary 09.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior of rampart on the north side]]
The rampart of the fort stands {{convert|2.8|m|ft}} high with a {{convert|0.4|m|ft|adj=on}} deep ditch;&lt;ref name="WSHC11"/&gt; the ditch is set between double earth banks. The ditch averages {{convert|16|m|ft}} wide and varies in depth to a maximum of {{convert|4.4|m|ft}}. The inner rampart has an average width of {{convert|8|m|ft}} and stands {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} above the internal surface level of the fort.&lt;ref name="EH07"&gt;Historic England 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort measures {{convert|320|by|200|m|ft}} (NS by EW), enclosing an area of {{convert|12.8|acre|ha|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="WSHC11"/&gt; There is a counter-scarp bank that averages {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide and varies in height from {{convert|3.1|m|ft}} at the southwest to between {{convert|0.8|and|1.5|m|ft}} at the northeast; at the southwest this bank is high enough to give the impression of a bivallate fort.  There are four gaps in the ramparts, one in each of the cardinal directions, but it is not known if these were original entrances to the fort. The east and west gaps are suspected of being the original entrances while the narrower gaps on the north and south sides are thought to be modern field entrances.&lt;ref name="EH07"/&gt; The roughly oval rampart of the fort is overgrown with trees and bushes.&lt;ref name="EH07"/&gt; The interior of Castle Rings is flat and used for pasture; there is no visible evidence of Iron Age occupation.&lt;ref name="EH07"/&gt;

===Western outlier===
[[File:Linear eathwork in Crates Wood, nr Castle Rings 02.JPG|thumb|right|Outlying earthwork in Crates Wood]]
An outlying earthwork lies approximately {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the west of the main rampart; it crosses the ridge in a north-south direction, ending at natural scarp slopes in both directions. It extends in a curve for {{convert|340|m|ft}}, running almost parallel to the rampart of the fort.&lt;ref name="EH07"/&gt;

The outlier extends across fields but is more clearly marked towards the north end within Crates Wood where it reaches a maximum height of {{convert|2.8|m|ft}}, with a {{convert|0.4|m|ft|adj=on}} deep ditch on its west side. The bank is up to {{convert|6|m|ft}} wide and the ditch measures {{convert|3|to|5|m|ft}} wide. On its east side the earthwork's scarp stands {{Convert|1.8|m|ft}} high and forms a field boundary. At the south end where it crosses fields the bank is much reduced by ploughing, with a maximum height of {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} and traces of a ploughed-out ditch.&lt;ref name="EH07"/&gt;

==Coin find==
A metal detectorist recovered a hoard of [[stater]] coins from within Castle Rings and was subsequently fined for looting a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The coins, which are attributed to the [[Durotriges]], are now in the collection of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="EH07"/&gt; They were dug up on 13 October 1985 with twelve ceramic fragments;&lt;ref&gt;Cowell et al 1987, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; 88 coins were found in all, some 30 of these were said to be contained within the broken pottery. The finds were handed over to the police and on 17 February 1987 were declared [[Treasure trove#English common law|treasure trove]] by an inquest,&lt;ref&gt;Cowell et al 1987, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; which found that the metal detectorist had excavated a {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip|adj=on}} deep hole into the upper section of the outer bank and therefore the find fell within the bounds of the scheduled monument. The finder was prosecuted under the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]]; he was found guilty and fined £100 (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|100|1987|r=0}} in modern currency). The find was offered for sale to the [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]], which refused the purchase on the grounds that it neither wished to financially reward a looter nor acquire looted artefacts. In the event, the British Museum paid the finder an amount considerably greater than the fine in order to acquire the hoard and prevent it being returned to the finder; it held that the academic value of the collected hoard outweighed the concerns regarding its acquisition.&lt;ref name="Cowell&amp;c87p10"/&gt;

The ceramic fragments formed a small necked beaker manufactured on a [[potter's wheel]] some time after AD 80 and is of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] type dated to after AD 200. The pottery also contained highly corroded remnants of bronze, copper and silver.&lt;ref name="Cowell&amp;c87p10"/&gt; The coins have been dated to between 60 and 20 BC;&lt;ref&gt;British Museum. Cowell et al 1987, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; there is therefore a mismatch between the late date of the pottery and the pre-Roman coins found within it. It has been suggested that the vessel originally contained a small hoard of mixed metal artefacts but how the Iron Age Durotrigian coins ended up in the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] hoard cannot be explained.&lt;ref name="Cowell&amp;c87p10"&gt;Cowell et al 1987, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cholera pit''' was a burial place used in a time of emergency when the disease was prevalent. Such mass graves were often unmarked and were placed in remote or specially selected locations. Public fears of contagion, lack of space within existing churchyards&lt;ref name=A/&gt; and restrictions placed on the movements of people from location to location&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; also contributed to their establishment and use. Many of the victims were poor and lacked the funds for memorial stones, however memorials were sometimes added at a later date.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;

==Burials==
Often the bodies of [[cholera]] victims were wrapped in cotton or linen and doused in coal-tar or pitch before placing into a coffin. Each burial was in a pit 8&amp;nbsp;ft deep and liberally sprinkled with quicklime.&lt;ref name=E/&gt; The bodies were sometimes burnt before interment.&lt;ref name=F&gt;[http://www.friarsbush.org.uk/id1.html Friar's Bush] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810195610/http://friarsbush.org.uk/id1.html |date=2013-08-10 }} Retrieved : 2012-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

;Long term risks
It is considered that the cholera risk posed through disturbance of cholera pits from the 19th century is non-existent as transmission is through contaminated water or food.&lt;ref name=GARL/&gt;

==Cholera outbreaks==
An early 19th century incidence of asiatic cholera in Europe was recorded in Russia and other continental countries in the spring of 1831. The first occurrence in England was in the Autumn of 1831 when it reached [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]], by 1832 it was at Exeter, and it spread rapidly through the British Isles, reaching [[Kilmarnock]] in July 1832.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Page 240&lt;/ref&gt; Other less severe outbreaks were recorded in 1849 and 1853.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Page 242&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA Outbreaks of cholera took place in 1834, 1849, and 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genforum.genealogy.com/in/randolph/messages/269.html Gehealogy Forum] Retrieved : 2012-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions, legends, and history associated with cholera pits==
[[File:Cholera pit site, Barrmill.JPG|thumb|200px|Detail of the site of the old cholera pit below South Barr farm, known locally as the 'Dead mans planting']]
[[File:Spier's Cholera Pit 2012.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The site of the cholera pit near Spier's Old School Grounds.]]
At [[Barrmill]] in [[North Ayrshire]] the tradition is that the disease was passed on from a group of gipsies camped on Whin Hill that local boys had gone out to meet. Troops were regularly placed to prevent entry or exit during cholera outbreaks and normal burial in Beith was impossible and impractical, given the number of deaths. The burial site was fenced off and bordered by trees, kept in order by the Crawford Bros. from the factory until they died. It has been neglected since then.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Porterfield, Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 cholera broke out in [[Beith]] and although 'clothes were burned, bedding fumigated, stairs and closes whitewashed, a nurse who was a veteran of the [[Dalry, North Ayrshire|Dalry]] outbreak was engaged and a ban placed on entertainments at funerals.' There were 100 cases in September 1834, 205 people were eventually affected with 105 deaths. Some of the people were buried in the parish churchyard, but others were buried in a field, close to what became Spier's School, on the little common south-west of where the Geilsland Road meets the Powgree Burn.&lt;ref name="Porterfield"&gt;Porterfield, Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Spier, the father of John Spier, was a member of the local Health Board.&lt;ref name="Cholera"&gt;[http://www.ayrshireroots.co.uk/Towns/Beith/Cholera%20in%20Beith.htm Cholera deaths in Beith]&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial at Cleeves Cove is said to that of a member of the family who lived at Cleeves Farm. Tradition has it that ''"A prediction was uttered many long ages ago, that Cleaves (sic), on three successive occasions, would be the first place in the parish visited by the pestilence. The cholera of 1832 was called the fulfillment of the second visitation : accordingly, many of the older inhabitants talk of one still being in reserve."''&lt;ref name=C/&gt;

When attempting to create a burial pit in Little Bury Meadow near [[Exeter]], the locals attacked the grave-digger when he arrived to break the ground.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

In Kilmarnock a patch of ground was purchased in Howard's Park ''"partly because the common-burying ground of the town was considered too small to meet the necessities of the case, and partly to prevent apprehended infection, as the graves in the new locality might remain in an undisturbed condition for a longer period."''&lt;ref name=A/&gt;

The construction of the proposed rail link to Glasgow Airport involved disturbance of the Paisley cholera pit; however, the project was cancelled.&lt;ref name=GARL/&gt;

===Northern Ireland===

====Belfast====
* Friarsbush - the 1832 Cholera claimed so many victims that the bodies were taken to Friar's Bush where they were first burned and then the remains interred en masse within a lime-filled mound, known as the 'Cholera Pit' or 'Plaguey Hill'. In 1847 this pit was reopened to cater for the victims of a [[typhoid]] epidemic. It is estimated that the number of bodies dumped between the periods of epidemic ranges between 2000/3000. A memorial stone is present.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

====Indiana====
* Arba, Randolph County - the Quaker church in Arba has a long row of tombstones that do not mark individual graves, but instead are all together. These are said to belong to the victims buried in the Cholera Pit and that the tombstones were all placed there, instead of on an individual grave, since victims were all put in the pit. Outbreaks of cholera took place in 1834, 1849, and 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genforum.genealogy.com/in/randolph/messages/269.html Genealogy Forum] Retrieved : 2012-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the complex of Neolithic archaeological cultures||River Danube}}

The term '''Danubian [[archaeological culture|culture]]''' was coined by the Australian archaeologist [[Vere Gordon Childe]] to describe the first agrarian society in central and eastern [[Europe]].  It covers the [[Linear Pottery culture]] (Linearbandkeramik, LBK), [[Stroke-ornamented ware|stroked pottery]] and [[Rössen culture]]s. 

The beginning of the Linear Pottery culture dates to around [[5500 BC]].  It appears to have spread westwards along the valley of the river [[Danube]] and interacted with the cultures of [[Atlantic Europe]] when they reached the [[Paris Basin]].
[[Image:European-late-neolithic-english.svg|thumb|Map of the European Late Neolithic (c. 3500 BCE) in [[Neolithic Europe]] showing Danubian culture in Yellow]]
Danubian I peoples cleared forests and cultivated fertile [[loess]] soils from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Paris Basin]].  They made LBK pottery and kept domesticated [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s, [[dog]]s, [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s.  The diagnostic [[tool]] of the culture is the [[Shoe-last celt]], a kind of long thin stone [[adze]] which was used to fell trees and sometimes as a weapon, evidenced by the skulls found at [[Talheim, Neckar]] in Germany and [[Schletz]] in Austria.  Settlements consisted of [[Neolithic long house|longhouse]]s.  According to a theory by [[Eduard Sangmeister]], these settlements were abandoned, possibly as fertile land was exhausted, and then reoccupied perhaps when the land had lain [[fallow]] for long enough.  In contrast, [[Peter Modderman]] and [[Jens Lüning]] believe the settlements were constantly inhabited, with individual families using specific plots (Hofplätze).  They also imported [[spondylus]] shells from the [[Mediterranean]].

A second wave of the culture, which used painted pottery with [[Asia]]tic influences, superseded the first phase starting around 4500 BC.  This was followed by a third wave which used [[stroke-ornamented ware]].

Danubian sites include those at [[Bylany (archaeology)|Bylany]] in [[Bohemia]] and [[Köln-Lindenthal]] in [[Germany]].

In [[Marija Gimbutas]]'s unsubstantiated model of European prehistory, the Danubian culture forms the core of what she calls [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]], which she envisions as a relatively advanced matrilineal and "gynocentric" civilisation speaking [[Pre-Indo-European languages]] that was eventually overrun by patriarchal invaders from the steppe, subsumed by her under the term [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan culture]], which she identifies with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].

[[Image:Confluence point 53N 0.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A GPS unit at confluence 53N 0, in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]]]
The '''Degree Confluence Project''' is a [[World Wide Web]]-based, all-volunteer project which aims to have people visit each of the [[integer]] [[Degree (angle)|degree]] intersections of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] on [[Earth]], posting [[photograph]]s and a narrative of each visit online. The project describes itself as "an organized [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] of the [[Earth|world]]".

==Requirements==
The precise location of each degree confluence uses the [[WGS 84]] horizontal datum, and visitors to degree confluences almost always make use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers. For a ''successful visit'', the visitor must get within 100 metres of the confluence point, and post a narrative and several photographs to the project website. A visit, or attempted visit, which does not conform to these rules may still be recorded on the website as an ''incomplete visit''. The project encourages visits to degree confluences which have been visited previously, and many confluence points - especially in non-remote regions of developed nations - have been visited several times.

The total number of degree confluences is 64,442,&lt;ref&gt;Latitude lines 89°N to 89°S (179), multiplied by 360° of longitude (360), plus the two poles (2) = 179 &amp;times; 360 + 2 = 64,442.&lt;/ref&gt; of which 21,543 are on land, 38,409 on water, and 4,490 on the [[Antarctic]] and [[Arctic]] ice caps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confluence.org/infoconf.php#location Classifications as of August 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The project categorizes degree confluences as either ''primary'' or ''secondary''. A confluence is primary only if it is on land or within sight of land. In addition, at [[latitude]]s greater than 48&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; only some points are designated primary because confluences crowd together near the [[Geographic pole|poles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confluence.org/infoconf.php#poles Poles Problem]&lt;/ref&gt; Both primary and secondary confluences may be visited and recorded.

In addition the visits of certain special geographical locations can also be reported (special visits) - for example:
* [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo|Middle of the World]] monument ( 0° 78°27'08"W )
* centers of continents
* Royal Greenwich Observatory

== History ==
The project was started by Alex Jarrett in February 1996 because he "liked the idea of visiting a location represented by a round number such as [[43rd parallel north|43°00'00"N]] [[72nd meridian west|72°00'00"W]]. What would be there? Would other people have recognized this as a unique spot?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confluence.org/infodcp.php#history Project History]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2018, 6513 (39.84%) of 16,348 primary confluences have been visited, covering 189 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;http://confluence.org/projectstats.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Milestones ==
* First degree confluence visit posted to the website: {{coord|43|N|72|W|name=First DCP entry}} in New Hampshire, USA by Alex Jarrett (project founder) and Peter Cline on February 20, 1996. (Note that some degree confluence visits that pre-date this visit have since been posted on the project's website.)
* Highest confluence:  {{coord|33|N|80|E|name=Highest confluence}} in Kuba, Tibet, China at 19,143&amp;nbsp;feet (5,835&amp;nbsp;m), first visited by Greg Michaels and Robert Whitfield on May 29, 2005.
* Lowest confluence:  {{coord|30|N|27|E|name=Lowest confluence}} in Matrūh, Egypt at −255&amp;nbsp;feet (−78&amp;nbsp;m), first visited by Dave Morrison, Steve Price and Tony Carlisle on December 4, 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="878">The '''Dialogue on Translation between a Lord and a Clerk''' forms the preface of [[John Trevisa]]'s 1387 translation of the ''[[Polychronicon]]'' of [[Ranulf Higden]], made for his patron, [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley|Lord Berkeley]]. Written in [[Middle English]], it consists of a series of arguments made by the clerk (representing Trevisa) on why books should not be translated from learned languages such as [[Latin]], each one followed by a rebuttal from the Lord (representing Lord Berkeley). The clerk eventually agrees and the dialogue concludes with a prayer for guidance in the translation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14092">'''Entheogenic drugs''' have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using [[entheogen]]s, [[chemical substance]]s used in a [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology - Jurema-Preta (Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd.] Poir.): a review of its traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology |publisher=scielo.br |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-89132008000500010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common era==
A Finnish study [[assay]]ed psilocybin concentrations in old [[herbarium]] specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old.&lt;ref name=Ohenoja1987&gt;{{cite journal |title=The occurrence of psilocybin and psilocin in Finnish fungi |journal=Journal of Natural Products |vauthors=Ohenoja E, Jokiranta J, Mäkinen T, Kaikkonen A, Airaksinen MM |year=1987 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=741–44 |pmid=3430170 |doi=10.1021/np50052a030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New World==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}
The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharon|first1=Douglas | author-link1=Douglas Sharon|title=Shamanism &amp; the sacred cactus: ethnoarchaeological evidence for San Pedro use in northern Perú|date=2000|publisher=San Diego Museum of Man|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0937808740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olmec entheogens===
The [[Olmec]] (12,000 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:

#Burials of [[Bufo|Bufo toads]] with priests
#The use of entheogens in later Olmec-inspired cultures
#Sculptures of shamans and other figures have strong [[Therianthrope|Therianthropic]] imagery.

===Maya===
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way.

The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, (better known by his contemporaries as Borhegyi) published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C  This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b,  "Mushroom Stones of Middle America," in Mushrooms, Russia and History  by [[Valentina Pavlovna Wasson|Valentina P. Wasson]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]], eds. N.T.)

Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of  Kidder and  Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these  Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following".....(see Shook, E.M. &amp; Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology &amp; History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendents of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.

===Aztec===
The [[Aztec entheogenic complex]] is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods," a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The [[Xochipilli]] statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs.

===Native Americans of the southwest United States===
There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences.

==Old World==

=== Paleolithic===
During the [[Paleolithic]], there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the "Flower Burial" in [[Shanidar Cave]], a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from [[Tassili n'Ajjer|Tassili, Algeria]] cave paintings depicting ''[[Psilocybe mairei]]'' mushrooms&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; dated 7000 to 9000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saromini|first1=Giorgio|title=The Oldest Representation of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms in the World|journal=Integration: Journal for Mind-Moving Plants and Culture|date=1992|volume=1|issue=2/3|url=http://www.samorini.it/doc1/sam/sam-1992-sahara.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2017}} Reprinted at [http://www.artepreistorica.com/2009/12/the-oldest-representations-of-hallucinogenic-mushrooms-in-the-world-sahara-desert-9000-%E2%80%93-7000-b-p/nggallery/thumbnails/ ArtePreistorica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Gaston|title=New Taxonomical and Ethnomycological Observations on Psilocybe S.S.

There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7134">'''Jurisprudence of values''' or '''jurisprudence of principles''' is a school of legal philosophy. This school represents, according to some authors, a step in overcoming the contradictions of [[legal positivism]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It is a school that has, since the end of the 19th century, characterized the law as a dogmatic institution, or man's imposition over man, in opposition to the former school, [[legal naturalism]], that treated law as a result of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]-[[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[science|scientific]] [[sources of law|sources]] (''natural'' consequence of the other sciences' conclusions and even work of [[God]]). The image of legal positivism nonetheless has deteriorated because of being used to favor class [[oppression]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, for this reason, it has been considered by some authors as a ''post-positivism'' school.&lt;ref name="OABJST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/9463/velhos-novos-direitos|title=Velhos Novos Direitos|author=Teixeira Júnior, Senomar|date=1 January 2007|publisher=OAB|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence of values is referred to in various works all over the world.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=448582|title=Recent Developments in Political Jurisprudence|date=4 December 1983|author=Shapiro, Martin|publisher=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=36|pages=541–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RJI"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.juridicainternational.eu/building-a-just-society-the-role-of-the-constitutional-judge-idea-of-justice-in-the-contemporary-value-jurisprudence-and-the-process-of-argumentation|title=Building a Just Society: the Role of the Constitutional Judge.

This ''modus'' of thinking of focuses on [[Principles of the constitution|constitutional principles]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [[legal principle|principle]], as opposed to the ''legal rule'', is more subjective, and the traditional interpretation gave it minor importance. Jurisprudence of values focuses on achieving the ideals underlying these legal principles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jurisprudence of values centers on the concepts of incidence and [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of the ''legal norm'', as well as rules and [[principle]]s, and concepts like [[Social equality|equality]], [[Political freedom|freedom]], and [[justice]].&lt;ref name="JNEMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/8126/o-carater-normativo-dos-principios-juridicos|title=O Caráter Normativo Dos Princípios Jurídicos|author=Meyer, Emílio Pesulo|date=1 March 2006|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juridical norms ==
According to [[Pontes de Miranda]],&lt;ref&gt;Pontes de Miranda, 1973:3&lt;/ref&gt; "The juridical rule is the norm with which the man, willing to subordinate the events to an order and foreseeability, tries to distribute the life's goods". Mankind seeks to somehow control the facts; the juridical norm is used as a tool to decide what is right and wrong. The norm, according to this school, is seen as a creation of man, thus man is controlling man.

Pontes de Miranda explains the concept of ''fact support''. Fact support is the fact that is previewed by the norm; it is the abstract fact; it is the fact that, if it is verified true in the ''world of facts'' the norm will ''fall upon'' it. In other words, there is a world of concrete facts and there is another world of ideas or ''types''. Thus, the legislator tries to use words to group possible concrete facts into sets, related to the world of ideas. This paradigm makes possible to attribute judicial effects to life's facts.

'Tit Bonhomme Janvier ("Good Little January Man"), usually spelled '''Te Bonhomme Janvier''' in English, is a character in the folklore of the [[Cajun]] people of [[Louisiana]], said to be the poor, younger brother of Santa Claus.  Cajun children do not get their stockings filled on Christmas Eve, but are instead visited by Te Bonhomme on New Year’s Eve, who fills their stockings with fruits, candy, and other special gifts if the children have been well behaved during the year, especially during the week between Christmas and New Year's.  If the children have been naughty, Te Bonhomme will instead take away all of their Christmas presents and leave them coal or other undesirable things.

Te Bonhomme even visits adults bringing "sacks of treats filled with oranges, pecans, candy, coloring books and crayons."&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Bienvenu. (2004).

The following is a '''list of [[English language|English]]-speaking population [[List of sovereign states|by country]]''', including information on both [[First language|native speaker]]s and [[second language|second-language]] speakers.

{{selfref|This list may be sorted by column by clicking on the column header.

Some numbers have been calculated by Wikipedia editors by mixing data from different sources; 
&lt;!--e.g. percentages need to be calculated by taking the population figure from the same year--&gt;
figures not attributed to sources and given with a date should be treated with caution.
Also note that in most sources, the results shown are of people who '''say''' that they can speak English, while that was not verified; which means the actual number of English speakers could be higher or lower (because of certain people that over- or underestimate their English skills).

'''Meyer Howard''' "'''Mike'''" '''Abrams''' (July 23, 1912 – April 21, 2015), usually cited as '''M. H. Abrams''', was an American [[literary critic]], known for works on [[romanticism]], in particular his book ''The Mirror and the Lamp''. Under Abrams's editorship, ''[[The Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' became the standard text for undergraduate survey courses across the U.S. and a major trendsetter in literary canon formation.

== Early life ==
Abrams was the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/105843/the-last-critic-turns-100/2|title=Adam Kirsch Pays a 100th Birthday Visit to M.

He went into [[English literature|English]] because, he says, "there weren't jobs in any other profession..., so I thought I might as well enjoy starving, instead of starving while doing something I didn't enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crawford|first1=Franklin|title=A Literary Century: English Professor Mike Abrams Fêted at 100th Birthday Bash|url=http://cornellalumnimagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1451|website=Cornell Alumni Magazine|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=11 February 2016|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After earning his bachelor's degree in 1934, Abrams won a Henry Fellowship to [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where his tutor was [[I.&amp;nbsp;A.

==Career==
During World War II, he served at the Psycho-Acoustics Laboratory at Harvard. He describes his work as solving the problem of voice communications in a noisy military environment by establishing military codes that are highly audible and inventing selection tests for personnel who had a superior ability to recognize sound in a noisy background.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1945 Abrams became a professor at [[Cornell University]]. The literary critics [[Harold Bloom]], [[Gayatri Spivak]] and [[E. D. Hirsch]], and the novelists [[William H. Gass]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]] were among his students.&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/99/6.10.99/Abrams.html |title=M.H.

== ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' ==
Abrams shows that until the Romantics, literature was typically understood as a mirror reflecting the real world in some kind of mimesis; whereas for the Romantics, writing was more like a lamp: the light of the writer's inner soul spilled out to illuminate the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} In 1998, [[Modern Library]] ranked ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' one of the 100 greatest English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/ |title=100 Best Nonfiction |publisher=Modern Library |date=1998 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69zVDxTeU?url=http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/ |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''==
Abrams was not only the general editor of ''The Norton Anthology'', he was the editor of ''The Romantic Period (1798–1832)'' in that anthology,&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams (1962), ed., ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', New York:  Norton, back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; and he evaluated writers and their reputations.  In his introduction to [[Lord Byron]], he emphasized how [[Byronic|Byronism]] relates to [[Nietzsche]]'s idea of the superman.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams (1962), ed., ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', New York:  Norton, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the introduction to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], Abrams said, "The tragedy of Shelley's short life was that intending always the best, he brought disaster and suffering upon himself and those he loved."&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams (1962), ed., ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', New York:  Norton, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be clear, this anthology of "English" literature does not include [[Anglophone]] writers from places such as Canada, but it does include writers from various places in the British Isles, for instance, [[William Butler Yeats]], who was appointed a senator in the [[Irish Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams (1962), ed., ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', New York:  Norton, p. 1341.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification of literary theories ===
[[File:Abrams mirror and the lamp.svg|right|thumb|The classification used by Abrams]]
Literary theories, Abrams argues, can be divided into four main groups:
* Mimetic Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Universe)
* Pragmatic Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Audience)
* Expressive Theories (interested in the relationship between the Work and the Artist)
* Objective Theories (interested in close reading of the Work)

The '''''Magic:  The Gathering'' Pro Tour Hall of Fame''' was started in 2005 to honor the most successful ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' [[Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)|Pro Tour]] players. The first inductions came on the tenth anniversary of the first Pro Tour event, and new Hall of Famers will be determined annually. Players who are eligible for the ballot (as below) can be voted in the Hall of Fame if they get more than 60% of the election committee's votes. As of 2018, there are 48 players from 12 different countries in the Hall of Fame.

{{TOC right}}

==Eligibility==
In order to appear on the [[Hall of Fame]] selection ballot, a player must meet the following five requirements (Or the first four requirement if they never appeared in any previous ballots):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pro Tour Hall of Fame Updates Plus RPTQ Decks | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 8 June 2017 | accessdate = 24 June 2017 | url = http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-hall-fame-updates-plus-rptq-decks-2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame Rules | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 16 June 2013 | accessdate = 4 August 2013 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/HallOfFame.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The player must have participated in his or her first ''Magic: the Gathering'' Pro Tour at least 10 seasons prior to the current voting year.
# The player must have at least 150 lifetime Pro Tour Points. (Prior to 2013, the threshold was 100 lifetime Pro Tour Points.)
# The player must have at least 2 single-elimination round finishes in Pro Tours. (From 2017 onwards)
# The player must not currently be suspended from playing ''Magic'' or be under investigation by the [[The DCI|DCI]] (Previous suspension does not disqualify a player from entering the Hall of Fame.)
# The player must not currently be removed from ballot by the voting committee. If they are currently removed by the ballot, they must finish with at least 4 Pro Points in period between the previous and current voting.

(* Pro Tour includes all [[Magic: The Gathering World Championship|''Magic: The Gathering'' World Championship]] before year 2011)

==Voting process==
The Selection Committee votes on who to induct into the Hall of Fame. The committee includes [[Wizards of the Coast]] employees, [[The DCI|DCI]] members, judges, long-time reporters, developers, all Hall of Famers, and every ''Magic'' player with at least 150 Pro Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Selection Committee | year = 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2016 | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | url = http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/pthof/2016/selection-committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of the Selection Committee gets to vote for up to five of the eligible players. Afterwards every player with at least 60% of the votes gets inducted into the Hall of Fame. If nobody gets 60% of the vote, the player with the most votes will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

If a player received 10% or less of the votes in 3 consecutive votings, they will be removed from the Hall of Fame ballot. They will be eligible again if they score 4 Pro Tour Points during a specific period (roughly the same period between two consecutive votings).

===Historical selection process===
The selection procedure was changed several times. In 2005 the Selection Committee voted for five players, and the four players receiving the most votes were inducted. Then a Players' Committee voted for one player that was not already selected, and the player receiving the most votes was also inducted.

From 2006 members of the Selection Committee and the Players' Committee received the list of players eligible for induction. Each member selected five players for induction. The votes were tabulated by a weighted percentage:  Selection Committee votes counted 2/3, and Players' Committee votes counted 1/3. In 2006 and 2007 the five players with the highest percentages were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Between 2008 and 2016 only the players with over 40% of the weighted votes were inducted or if no one mets this criterion the player with the highest percentage was inducted.

==Benefits==
The Hall of Fame inductees will receive a number of benefits for the rest of his or her life (unless suspended by the DCI). As of 2016–17 season, it includes the benefits below:
#A guaranteed entry to any Pro Tour event and [[Magic: The Gathering World Championship#World Magic Cup|World Magic Cup]] Qualifiers
#Appearance fee at the Pro Tour featuring the yearly Hall of Fame induction.
#Bye(s) in Grand Prix and World Magic Cup Qualifiers.
#Additional [[Magic: The Gathering Online|''Magic Online'']] Championship Series seasonal QPs.
If a Hall of Fame player is a current Platinum level member of the Pro Players Club, the higher reward will apply to them (i.e. they receive two instead of one bye in World Magic Cup Qualifiers, 20QP instead of 15QP in the ''Magic Online'' Championship Series).

Players who enter the Hall of Fame since will also receive a special commemorative ring at the induction ceremony.

==Controversies==

===Tomoharu Saito banning===
In the ballot of 2010, [[Tomoharu Saito]] was voted into the Hall of Fame with a weighted percentage of 47.74%.&lt;ref name="Ballots2010"/&gt; However, two weeks prior to the induction Saito was disqualified during Grand Prix Florence leading to an 18-month suspension from the game. The rules do not allow currently-suspended players to be voted into the Hall of Fame. Wizards announced without further explanation that Saito would not be part of the Hall of Fame based on the 2010 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Saito removed from Hall of Fame selection | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 8 December 2010 | accessdate = 8 December 2010 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/news/120810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bram Snepvangers miscalculation===
In the original ballot results for 2010, Bram Snepvangers received a weighted percentage of 39.95%, barely missing the required 40%. However, in the days following the publication of results it was discovered that there had been an error in the calculations. Weights of 0.667 and 0.333 had been used for the votes from the Selection Committee and Players Committee respectively while the rules clearly stated that 0.67 and 0.33 were the correct numbers. After recalculating the scores Snepvangers landed at 40.03% and was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with Nassif and Kibler.&lt;ref name="Snepvangers"/&gt;

The '''Maronite mummies''' are eight well preserved natural [[Mummy|mummies]] of [[Maronite]] villagers dating back to around 1283 AD.  They were uncovered by a team of [[speleologist]]/[[archaeologists]]s during a rescue excavation in the [[Qadisha Valley]] of [[Lebanon]] in 1991. They are currently on display in the [[National Museum of Beirut]].

==Discovery==
The mummies were found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave located in the [[Kadisha Valley]] in [[Lebanon]], on July 13, 1990 by a group of speleologists/archaeologists of the Groupe d'Etudes et de Recherches Souterraines du Liban- GERSL, namely Abi Aoun Pierre, Baroudy Fadi, Ghaouch Antoine and Khawaja Paul&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A. Khawaja P and alias Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archaéologique de 'Asi-al-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), France, Édifra, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
The find was the result of two years of excavation.  Initially, the discovery consisted of a single four-month-old infant mummy&lt;ref name="cavinglebanon.com"&gt;http://www.cavinglebanon.com/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

The infant was named Yasmine by her discoverers after a child whose name was mentioned in a manuscript discovered on-site. The infant was clothed and fully interred only 40&amp;nbsp;cm below ground, she was laid on her back alone in the grave, her head resting on a smooth stone. Yasmine was carefully wrapped in medical gauze and immobilized with splinting devices by the team and transported from the grotto to a customized laboratory, created by the Discoverers. 
Multiple other remains were found following the discovering, include seven bodies (four infants and three adults) as well as skeletal remains of several others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.cavinglebanon.com/asi-l-hadath-fortified-cave/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===The grotto===

Chronologie des plus anciennes installations de Byblos, "Revue Biblique", LVII, 1950, pp. 590-593, 584-603.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there is evidence of organized communal arrangements, a man-made water reservoir (3.5m x 1.4 m surface, 1.5 m depth, and 8 cubic meters volume); a stone basin for grinding grain by hand; and two well-like openings, probably used for retrieval and storage of water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The grotto contains two main rooms: a large living quarter and the grave-yard room.&lt;ref&gt;"Liban Souterrain", pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation===
The preliminary examination of the bodies revealed that they were naturally mummified. The grotto in which they had been interred acted as a perfect cast for the buried bodies, eliminating the formation of air pockets that normally facilitate the process of decomposition. Moreover, the low humidity of the grotto's air and the lack of organisms in its soil slowed the total decay of the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A. Khawaja P and alias Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archaéologique de 'Asi-al-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), France, Édifra, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dates===
researches carried out by the GERSL &lt;ref name="cavinglebanon.com"/&gt; corroborated the date of 1283 AD, when the area around the cave was part of the [[County of Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Historical overview====
Between 1102 and 1289, Mount-Lebanon including [[Hadath El Jebbeh]] fell within the confines of the [[County of Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, K. "The Maronites of Lebanon under Frankish and Mamluk Rule (1099-1516)", ''Arabica''; IV (1957), p. 291, 294; and Hiro, D. ''A History of the Lebanese Civil War'', (New York, 1992), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripoli was one of the four fundamental city units of the Crusaders Kingdom of Jerusalem &lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', XVth edition, (1982), pp. 297-310.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], and the Royal Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, J., ed., ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages'', (New York, 1982), vol. 4, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Mamelukes overtook Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and set out to conquer Lebanon and expel the Crusaders. As modern scholars have pointed out, the Maronites, who constituted the majority population of that County,&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 288, 291; Richard, J. ''Le conte de Tripoli sous la dynastie Toulousaine, 1102-1187'', (Paris, 1945), p. 86; and de Vitry, J. ''History of Jerusalem''; translated by Stewart, A., (London, 1897), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a constant obstacle to the Mamluk:&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, ''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, R. H. C. Arménien'', (Paris, 1896), pp. 155-156; and Salibi, p. 294. See also de Tyre, G. ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea''; translated by Babcock, F., (New York, 1943)&lt;/ref&gt;
"in fact, the effective military assistance rendered by the Maronites to the Franks of Tripoli must have been one of the factors that helped the County face repeated Muslim attacks successfully and outlast the other Crusader states." &lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was not long before the Mamluks realized that in order for them to capture Tripoli, they must first subdue the Maronites.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury-Harb, The Maronites, (Beirut, 1985), p. 82; and Salibi, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluks launched several assaults against the highland of Tripoli devastating Gibbet Bsharri, Baqufa, Kfarsaroun, Hasrun, al-Hadath and others between 1250 and 1289.&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 294; Al-Maqrizy, Kitab as-suluk li-ma'rifat dual al-Muluk, ed., Mustapha Ziada, (Cairo, 1936), p. 566; and Grousset, R. Histoire des Croisades et du Royaume Franc de Jerusalem, (Paris, 1936), p. 640&lt;/ref&gt; One particular raid was recorded in Ibn 'Abd az-Zahir's chronicle during his service as Secretary of the Court of three Mamluk Sultans (1223-1292 AD). Under the title of "the Account of Capturing the Patriarch of al-Hadath from the Region of Tripoli", he wrote:
"It happened that a Patriarch of the region of Tripoli annoyed, behaved insolently, became haughty, and frightened the governor of Tripoli and all the Francs. He led astray these people of those mountains and the people of those valleys who are of the strayed people. And this continued until he was feared by every neighbor. He entrenched himself in al-Hadath and held his nose high with arrogance and no one succeeded in tricking him... It happened that the governors of the Sultan ambushed him several times but did not find him. Then the Turkmans sought him in his place and tricked him so that they captured and blind-folded him and took him prisoner. The [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch]] was one of the infidels and their impious ones, hence the Muslims were relieved of him and were spared his wickedness. His capture was a great conquest, greater even more than the conquest of a stronghold or a fortress..."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn `Abd Al-Zahir, Tasrif al-'usur bi sirat al-Malik al-Mansur, ed., Murad Kamil, (Cairo, 1961), p. 4. Translation mine. Elsewhere, Salibi, K. The Maronite Church in the Middle Ages and its Union with Rome, Oriens Christianus, vol. 40, (1956) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports similar to that of Ibn 'Abd az-Zahir are to be found in the margins of two Bibles from the al-Hadath region near the Monastery of 'Mar Aboun' (Monastery of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya). The two Bibles were discovered by Patriarch Istephan Duwayhi during his research and writing of Tarikh al-Azmina between 1670 and 1704. The first Bible contains a note written in 1283 by an anonymous Christian who witnessed these events. The account contained in the second Bible is a copy of the first one, and it is dated 1504 AD. These accounts testify to the dramatic events unfolding in 'Asi al-Hadath during the 13th century.
The witness and writer of the original account of 1283 tells us that:
‘’’  "On August 22, 1283 the Muslim soldiers headed toward al-Hadath where the inhabitants took refuge in a magnificent and inaccessible grotto called al-'Asi. The grotto was besieged for seven years. The soldiers received it through the Aman _ a pledge of security and a promise of protection given by Muslim(s) to non-Muslim(s) (Jews and Christians) belonging to dar al-harb (Abode of War) for a specific period of time. Those non-Muslims who belong to dar al-salam (Adobe of Islam) fall under the [[dhimmi]] status.,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Islam_ (Leiden, 1960), p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; then burned its prefecture (the al-Hadath village) by fire and took the women captives."  ‘’’  &lt;ref&gt;Duwayhi, I., Patriarch T'arikh al-Azmina, ed., Fahd, B., (Beirut, 1983), p. 261. Translation mine. Elsewhere, Salibi, "Arabica", p. 294-295; and Momies Du Liban, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

These two references are testimonies about a tragic event that occurred in al-Hadath. The accounts coincide in time, place, and action, and confirm an offensive against al-Hadath, thereby providing some historical context for our understanding of this archaeological discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavinglebanon.com/asi-l-hadath-fortified-cave/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The artifacts===
[[File:Embroided Mari.jpg|thumb| [[Embroider|Embroidered cloth]] depicting peacocks facing the tree of life.]]
Apart from the mummies themselves, a wealth of artifacts found at the site suggest that the people buried there were Maronites from the al-Hadath village, and that their death occurred circa 1283, which corresponds to the reign of the Mamluks and the presence of the Crusaders. Among the many examples of medieval pottery excavated, one pot attracts attention by its Arabic inscription: "This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath.".&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic and archaeological significance is manifested in the designs and motifs embroidered on textiles which are identical to designs found in the Syriac Rabbula Gospels, a 6th-century artistic masterpiece which belonged to the Maronite Patriarchate until the mid-15th century, but is now housed in Florence, Italy. A striking copy of two peacocks facing one another with a tree of life in-between remains vivid in color seven hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Grotto over twenty manuscripts were unearthed. One of which is in Syriac and is a Maronite hymnody, another is in Arabic and bears the name and signature of George son of David, the Archdeacon of al-Hadath.&lt;ref name="Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210"&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discovered items, several engraved wooden double-toothed combs, thin teeth on one side and coarse on the other, are identical to the combs used by Mamluk women in Egypt and are on display at the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo, Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, p. 215, 240, 245, 251; and `Abd Ar-Raziq, A. La Femme au temps des Mamlouks en Egypte, (Cairo, 1973), pp. 321-322&lt;/ref&gt; Many poles, arrows, and notches have been found to be identical with the Mamluk era arrows now on display at the Traditional Art Museum of Aleppo in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 206-208&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of Crusader and Mamluk coins also invite the speculation that these mummies are of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 198-201. See Slumberger, G. Numismatique de l'Orient Latin, (Paris, 1878); and Cox, D. The Tripolis Hoard of French Seignorial and Crusader's Coins, (New York, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the most important and uncontestable evidence comes from the mummies themselves.

===Yasmine's clothes===
Yasmine wore beneath her shroud three dresses &lt;ref name="Liban 1993 p. 58"&gt;Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archéologique de 'Asi-l-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), GERSL, (France, 1993), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; one blue, a beige dress over it, and a more elaborate dark beige dress embroidered with silk threads over both. Her head was covered with a headdress under which she wore a headband made of silk. She was adorned with one earring, and a necklace garnished with mouth-blown glass pearls and two coin pieces dated to the era of the Sultan Mamluk Baybars.&lt;ref name="Liban 1993 p. 58"/&gt;

===Customs and rituals===
[[File:Pot Mari.jpg|thumb| Pot excavated from the grotto bearing the following Arabic inscription:"This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath".]]
Compared to the mummies of Egypt, these mummies were simply buried without any long term or elaborate preparation. A preliminary observation of the mummies already reveals striking parallels with customs and rituals still practiced in present-day Lebanon. An adult woman was found buried with her eighteen-month-old child. The infant was placed at the mother's left shoulder. We are almost certain that the infant is hers since this method of burial is still practiced today in Lebanon when the deaths of both mother and child are caused by complications in the birthing process.&lt;ref name="Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210"/&gt; Most interesting of all is the adult woman who is buried with her infant. She is found with pieces of cotton and cloth inserted in both her vaginal and anal orifices. This preparation of the deceased for viewing is still practiced to our day. In some areas of Lebanon such as the Bekaa Valley, the cotton and cloth pieces are wrapped around a small onion and inserted in the human orifices. Another cultural manifestation is the presence of long black human hair found between Yasmine's toes. It probably belonged to the child's mother. Local tradition has it, that the grieving mother will pull out her hair while kissing the feet of her lost child.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; A talismanic prayer recovered from the grotto requests the intercession of saints in curing a sick child. This prayer resembles the ones still in practice and use among the Maronites in present-day Lebanon, e.g.,. 'Kitab Mar Antonios' -- the Talisman of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya.&lt;ref&gt;Salame-Sarkis, H. Talisman-higab Syriaque Trouve dans la Grotte-Refuge de Hadath al-Gubbeh dans le Liban Nord, "Liban Souterrain", (1989), July No.2, pp. 36-39&lt;/ref&gt; A wooden house key was found on the body of one of the adult female mummies. In accordance with traditional customs, at the funeral of the last surviving member of a family, the key to the dead person's house will be tossed over the roof of that house indicating that the house of that family will forever be closed. In this case the person died in a besieged Grotto, so the key was tossed in the grave &lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; similar circumstances mourners will comment by saying, "pity this family, their house is forever closed."

==Importance==
[[File:Script Mari 1.jpg|thumb| Manuscript in [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangelo]] praising the Lord.]]
# These are the first (and perhaps the unique) mummies ever to be discovered in Lebanon.
# An outstanding and unique wooden arrow, discovered complete from tip to nock, with paper fletchings (not feathered, most likely to reduce drag and increase flight trajectory); worth-noting that other fragments of traditional wooden arrows were discovered, mostly with Turkish Nocks style.
# Many similarities exist between the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition in some areas of Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in the house again.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.
# Textiles were not only worn by the mummies, they were also scattered about the cave. Their robes, made from heavy cotton, are embroidered with squares and diamonds of crosses and flowers, which strongly resemble kilim patterns of Turkish nomads.

The '''MarsDial''' is a [[sundial]] that was devised for missions to [[Mars]]. It is used to calibrate the [[Pancam|Pancam camera]]s of the Mars landers. MarsDials were placed on the [[Spirit rover|''Spirit'']] and [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'']] [[Mars Exploration Rover|Mars rovers]], inscribed with the words "Two worlds, One sun" and the word "Mars" in 22 languages.&lt;ref name="pancam.astro.cornell.edu"&gt;[http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/about.html About the Pancam and calibration target]&lt;/ref&gt; The MarsDial can function as a type of sun-dial known as a [[gnomon]], in modern times this is the stick part of a sundial&lt;ref name="mars.nasa.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/classroom/marsdial/|title=Mars Exploration Rover: Mars for Educators: Roverquest|website=mars.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;[http://athena.cornell.edu/kids/sundial.html Cornell University - Sundial]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Gnomon type sundial is basically a "stick in the ground" design, but by looking at the length and direction of the shadow the time of day can be calculated.&lt;ref name="mars.nasa.gov"/&gt; The sundial can also be used to tell which way is North, and to overcome the limitations of a Magnetic north different from a true north.&lt;ref name="mars.nasa.gov"/&gt;

The '''Moscow Student Conference on Linguistics''' (MSCL) is an annual student [[List of linguistics conferences|linguistic conference]], which started in 2006. It was first held at the [[Moscow State University]], and since then it has grown to be one of the major conferences on [[generative linguistics|formal linguistics]] in Russia. The aim of the conference is to give young researchers an opportunity to present their work, exchange ideas and receive feedback from more experienced colleagues.

Talks are solicited from all areas of [[theoretical linguistics]] including [[Phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], [[Syntax]] and [[Semantics]]. Only abstracts from students (i.e., those not having defended a PhD by the submission deadline) are considered.

MSCL often has a key topic (e.g. ''Perspectives on the Syntax-Semantics Interface'' in 2008, ''Scrambling, Free Word Order and Related Phenomena'' in 2010). Abstracts on the announced key topic are especially encouraged, though other abstracts are given equal consideration.

'''Navajo National Monument''' is a [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]] located within the northwest portion of the [[Navajo Nation]] territory in northern [[Arizona]], which was established to preserve three well-preserved cliff dwellings of the [[Ancestral Puebloan People]]: '''Keet Seel''' (Broken Pottery) ({{spell-nv|'''Kitsʼiil'''}}), '''Betatakin''' (Ledge House) ({{spell-nv|'''Bitátʼahkin'''}}), and '''Inscription House''' ({{spell-nv|'''Tsʼah Biiʼ Kin'''}}). The monument is high on the Shonto plateau, overlooking the Tsegi Canyon system, west of [[Kayenta, Arizona]]. It features a visitor center with a museum, two short self-guided mesa top trails, two small campgrounds, and a picnic area. Rangers guide visitors on free tours of the '''Keet Seel''' and '''Betatakin''' cliff dwellings. The '''Inscription House''' site, further west, is currently closed to public access.

The Sandal Trail is an accessible self-guided walk that provides views of the spectacular canyonlands and rugged topography near the visitor center. Interpretive signs provide information on local flora and other topics. The {{Convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} round-trip trail ends at an overlook of the Betatakin ruins across the 560-foot-deep (170 m) Betatakin Canyon. The National Monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Keet Seel ==
'''Keet Seel''' or '''Kiet Siel''' ({{spell-nv|Kįtsʼiil}}), which stands for "broken pottery scattered around"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/nava/planyourvisit/upload/nava_s1-for-web-use.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in Navajo, is a well preserved cliff dwelling of the ancient [[Anasazi]] people located in a branch of the [[Tsegi Canyon]] in the Kayenta region. The site was first occupied at around 1250, during a time in which a large number of people were believed to be aggregating in sites such as this in this part of the American Southwest. There was a construction boom at Keet Seel between 1272 and 1275, with construction then slowly tapering off and halting completely at 1286. Once construction halted in 1286, there was no evidence of structures being built until its subsequent abandonment some 20 years later. It is believed that, at its peak, up to 150 people inhabited this site at one time. Due to the extremely dry climate and natural overhanging cliff the site's dwellings and artifacts are well preserved. Keet Seel is considered by many archaeological experts to be one of the best preserved larger ruins in the American Southwest.&lt;ref name=oldones&gt;Roberts, David. 1996. In Search of the Old Ones: Exploring the Anasazi World of the Southwest. Touchstone Press. pp. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

== Betatakin ==
'''Betatakin''' means "House Built on a Ledge" in Navajo. In Hopi, the name of the place is ''Talastima'', or "Place of the Corn Tassel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/inventory/publications/reports/nava_gre_rpt_body_print.pdf |title=Navajo National Monument: Geologic Resource Evaluation Report |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betatakin is smaller than nearby Keet Seel, with about 120 rooms at the time of abandonment. However, like Keet Seel, Betatakin was constructed of sandstone, mud mortar, and wood. Today only about 80 rooms remain, due to rock falls inside the alcove. Betatakin only has one kiva,&lt;ref name=oldones/&gt; whereas Kiet Siel has several. Betatakin was built in an enormous alcove measuring 452 feet high and 370 feet across between 1267 and 1286&lt;ref name=dean69&gt;Dean, Jeffrey. 1969. Chronological analysis of Tsegi Phase sites in Northeastern Arizona. Tucson.&lt;/ref&gt; The first excavations occurred in 1917 under Neil Judd, and continued into the 1950s and 1960s under archaeologists like Jeffery Dean.&lt;ref name=oldones/&gt; During its two-decade heyday Dean estimated a maximum population of about 125 people.

== Discovery ==
The site of Keet Seel was discovered in 1895 by the Wetherill Brothers. Originally part of a ranching family from Colorado, the Wetherill's keen interest in the Ancient Anasazi led them to pursue numerous expeditions into the heart of the Kayenta region, largely uncovering a number of sites that had remained undiscovered until then. [[Richard Wetherill]] is credited for selecting the term Anasazi, which refers to the ancient people that inhabited this region and means "Enemy Ancestors" in Navajo. It was not until 1909, after Navajo National Monument was created, that John Wetherill and Navajo guide Clatsozen Benully discovered Betatakin.
The Wetherill Brothers made a living from giving guided tours of sites in and around the Tsegi Canyon and Utah. Later in their careers, the Wetherill brothers were largely involved in efforts for the preservation and protection of the sites that made up Navajo National Monument.

== Subsistence ==
The Anasazi of this area were a sedentary group that largely based their subsistence on agriculture. Their primary crop at the sites within Navajo National Monument was [[maize]], with beans and [[cucurbits]] also being incorporated into their diet. While the people of the Tsegi Canyon system relied heavily on agriculture for their food, they also hunted wild game that was indigenous to the area.

It is thought that these Anasazi people lived in these cave dwellings to optimize the amount of sustainable land to produce crops. By living in these caves, and not on the mesas or the canyon floors, they were able to use this land towards agricultural production to ensure their success in this high elevation, desert environment. The ruins that make up Navajo National Monument were a large number of rooms used for storage, suggesting that at some point their crop production was successful enough to dedicate a significant amount of their living area towards storage purposes.

== Dwellings/ Architecture ==
[[File:Betatakin Cliff Dwellings.jpg|thumb|Betatakin ruins in Betatakin Canyon.]]
The structures contained within this cave site were constructed mainly of sandstone blocks plastered together with mud and mortar. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwelling of Navajo National Monument reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the mid to late 13th century.

While much of the construction in this site remains similar to common ancestral Pueblo architectural forms, including such features as [[Kivas]], a circular tower (at Keet Seel), and pit-houses, the limited space that this site presented created a much more densely populated living area. At its peak, Keet Seel had more than 150 rooms and 6 kivas, while Betatakin had about 120 rooms and only one kiva.&lt;ref name=oldones/&gt;

[[Jacal]] walls were also found to be used at this site. Jacal walls were made from a screen of upright wooden poles plastered together with mud. The dry conditions and protection from the elements at Keet Seel allowed for preservation of these architectural characteristics.

There were also a number of structures believed to be built at the base of the cliff as well. But due to this area not being protected by the over-hanging cliff wall, its exposure to the elements led to its destruction by erosion. At Keet Seel, archaeological excavations have revealed that there were 25 room clusters beneath the overhanging wall, each that included one common living room, with anywhere from one to four storage rooms surrounding a small courtyard. The layout of these dwellings greatly mirrored that of the [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] structures at [[Mesa Verde]], whereas Betatakin had about 20 room clusters.

== Abandonment ==
Although many archaeologists agree that there is a definitive and sharp exodus from this region in the Southwest, there has been considerable debate on the determining factors that forced people to migrate out of this area. Archaeologists have determined that there was a distinct decrease in the amount of annual precipitation between AD 1276 and 1299, a period of time that is now referred to as the "Great Drought". With the limited amount of rainfall in an already arid environment, there is no doubt that there was a considerable amount of increased stress put on the agricultural systems that these people depended on.

There is evidence later in the record to suggest the beginning of an episode of deep arroyo cutting, that would have damaged what was left of the usable agricultural land. Increased deposition of sediment onto agricultural lands caused the lowering of the water table, thus making the land inadequate for farming. Regardless of their reasoning, near the end of the thirteenth century it's evident that the Anasazi people migrated towards places with more stable and abundant water sources, suggesting that the agricultural land in this area had become unsuitable to sustain the population levels that once inhabited this spectacular cave site.

[[Hopi]] legends tell a different tale. According to oral tradition, the area known as Wunuqa (modern day Tsegi Canyon)&lt;ref name=oldones/&gt; was abandoned as part of a spiritual quest.&lt;ref name=oldones/&gt;&lt;ref name=4thworld&gt;Courlander, Harold. 1971. The Fourth World of the Hopis: the epic story of the Hopi Indians as preserved in their legends and traditions.pp. 239. University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Snake Clan inhabited the Navajo National Monument ruins, along with the Horn Clan. The Horn Clan forced the Snake Clan out, due to the children of the Snake Clan biting other children and causing death.&lt;ref name=4thworld/&gt; This may be an allegory for some historical occurrence, in which one group forced another out for a perceived fault or slight.

(1998). Technophobia: the psychological impact of Information Technology. pg 155. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is based on the historical legacy of the English [[Luddite]]s, who were active between 1811 and 1816.&lt;ref name="jonesagainstechnology"/&gt;

Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of non-affiliated groups who resist modern technologies and dictate a return of some or all technologies to a more primitive level.&lt;ref name = Sale&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, America’s new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are characterized by one or more of the following practices: passively abandoning the use of technology, harming those who produce technology, advocating [[simple living]], or [[monkeywrenching|sabotaging]] technology. The modern neo-Luddite movement has connections with the [[anti-globalization movement]], [[antiscience|anti-science movement]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[radical environmentalism]], and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name = Sale /&gt;

Neo-Luddism is based on the concern of the technological impact on individuals, their communities, and/or the environment,&lt;ref name=christensenencyclopedia&gt;{{cite book  | last = Christensen  | first = Karen  |author2=David Levinson  | title = Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 3  | publisher = SAGE  | year = 2003  | location =   | pages = 886  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-7619-2598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddism stipulates the use of the [[precautionary principle]] for all new technologies, insisting that technologies be proven safe before adoption, due to the unknown effects that new technologies might inspire.

==Philosophy==
Neo-Luddism  calls for slowing or stopping the development of new technologies. Neo-Luddism prescribes a lifestyle that abandons specific technologies, because of its belief that this is the best prospect for the future. As Robin and Webster put it, "a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities." In the place of industrial capitalism, neo-Luddism prescribes small-scale agricultural communities such as those of the Amish and the [[Chipko movement]] in Nepal and India&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; as models for the future.

Neo-Luddism denies the ability of any new technology to solve current problems, such as [[environmental degradation]],&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; [[nuclear warfare]] and [[biological weapons]], without creating more, potentially dangerous problems.&lt;ref name=grahaminternet&gt;{{cite book  | last = Graham  | first = Gordon  | title = The Internet: a philosophical inquiry  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 1999  | location =   | page = 9  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NDr8Fh4rNQAC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-415-19749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are generally opposed to [[anthropocentrism]], [[globalization]] and [[industrial capitalism]].

In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning describes neo-Luddites as "20th century citizens—activists, workers, neighbors, social critics, and scholars—who question the predominant modern worldview, which preaches that unbridled technology represents [[Idea of Progress|progress]]."&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Glendinning voices an opposition to technologies that she deems destructive to communities or are materialistic and rationalistic. She proposes that technology encourages biases, and therefore should question if technologies have been created for specific interests, to perpetuate their specific values including short-term efficiency, ease of production and marketing, as well as profit. Glendinning also says that secondary aspects of technology, including social, economic and ecological implications, and not personal benefit need to be considered before adoption of technology into the technological system.&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt;

===Vision of the future without intervention===
Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies. 
Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general, and that a future [[societal collapse]] is possible or even probable. 

Neo-Luddite [[Ted Kaczynski]] predicted a world with a depleted environment, an increase in [[Causes of schizophrenia#Urbanicity|psychological disorders]], with either "leftists" who aim to control humanity through technology, or technology directly controlling humanity.&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; According to Sale, "The industrial civilization so well served by its potent technologies cannot last, and will not last; its collapse is certain within not more than a few decades.".&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]], a famous astrophysicist, predicted that the means of production will be controlled by the "machine owner" class and that without redistribution of wealth, technology will create more economic inequality.&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;Stephen Hawking Says We Should Really, 2016 | http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_us_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15&lt;/ref&gt;

These predictions include changes in humanity's place in the future due to replacement of humans by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[nuclear warfare]], and [[biological weapons]]; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda, pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political [[Economic inequality|inequality]], widespread [[social alienation]], a loss of community, and massive [[unemployment]]; technology causing [[environmental degradation]] due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore J. Kaczynski, David Skrbina; ''Technological Slavery, The Collected Writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, a.k.a. "The Unabomber."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of intervention===
In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning proposes destroying the following technologies: electromagnetic technologies (this includes communications, computers, appliances, and refrigeration), chemical technologies (this includes synthetic materials and medicine), [[Nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]] (this includes weapons and power as well as cancer treatment, sterilization, and smoke detection), [[genetic engineering]] (this includes crops as well as insulin production).&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt; She argues in favor of the "search for new technological forms" which are local in scale and promote social and political freedom.

[[File:Young theodore kaczynski.jpeg|thumb|Kaczynski as a young professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]], 1968|alt=A man in a suit faces the camera while he stands in front of a building.]]
In "The coming revolution", Kaczynski outlined what he saw as changes humanity will have to make in order to make society functional, "new values that will free them from the yoke of the present technoindustrial system", including:
* Rejection of all modern technology  –  "This is logically necessary, because modern technology is a whole in which all parts are interconnected; you can’t get rid of the bad parts without also giving up those parts that seem good."
* Rejection of civilization itself
* Rejection of [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and its replacement with a conception of life that values moderation and self-sufficiency while deprecating the acquisition of property or of status.
* Love and reverence toward nature or even worship of nature
* Exaltation of freedom
* Punishment of those responsible for the present situation. "Scientists, engineers, corporation executives, politicians, and so forth to make the cost of improving technology too great for anyone to try"

==Movement==
Contemporary neo-Luddites are a widely diverse group of loosely affiliated or non-affiliated groups which includes "writers, academics, students, families, [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], [[Quakers]], [[environmentalists]], "fallen-away [[yuppies]]," "ageing [[flower children]]" and "young idealists seeking a technology-free environment."&lt;ref name="jour"&gt;Doresa Banning, Modern Day Luddites, November 30, 2001, URL=http://www.jour.unr.edu/j705/RP.BANNING.LUDDITE.HTML&lt;/ref&gt; Some Luddites see themselves as victims of technology trying to prevent further victimization (such as Citizens Against Pesticide Misuse and Parents Against Underage Smartphones). Others see themselves as advocates for the natural order and resist environmental degradation by technology (such as [[Earth First!]]).&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

One neo-Luddite assembly was the "Second Neo-Luddite Congress", held April 13–15, 1996, at a Quaker meeting hall in [[Barnesville, Ohio]]. On February 24, 2001, the "Teach-In on Technology and Globalization" was held at [[Hunter College]] in New York city with the purpose to bring together critics of technology and globalization.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; The two figures who are seen as the movement's founders are [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]. Prominent neo-Luddites include educator S. D. George, ecologist Stephanie Mills, [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Scott Savage]], [[Clifford Stoll]], [[Bill McKibben]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Gene Logsdon]].&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; Postman, however, did not consider himself a Luddite and loathed being associated with the term.{{citation_needed|date=July 2017}}

===Relationship to violence and vandalism===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Theodore Kaczynski at Unabomber trial.jpg|thumb|left|Theodore Kaczynski at Unabomber trial]] --&gt;

In May 2012, credit for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an [[Ansaldo Nucleare]] executive, was claimed by an [[anarchist]] group who targeted him for stating that none of the deaths following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] were caused by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] itself: &lt;blockquote&gt;Adinolfi knows well that it is only a matter of time before a European Fukushima kills on our continent [...] Science in centuries past promised us a golden age, but it is pushing us towards self destruction and slavery [...] With our action we give back to you a small part of the suffering that you scientists are bringing to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italian anarchists kneecap nuclear executive and threaten more shootings |author=Tom Kington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/italian-anarchists-kneecap-nuclear-executive |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaczynski, also known as the ''Unabomber'', initially sabotaged developments near his cabin but dedicated himself to getting back at the system after discovering a road had been built over a plateau he had considered beautiful. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 others. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'',&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; Kaczynski states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2011 in [[Mexico]] a group or person calling itself [[Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]] perpetrated an attack with a bomb at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico Campus]], intended for the coordinator of its Business Development Center and Technology Transfer. The attack was accompanied by the publication of a [[manifesto]] criticizing [[nanotechnology]] and [[computer science]].

Sale says that neo-Luddites are not motivated to commit violence or vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with the Luddite, Wired magazine, Issue 3.06, Jun 1995. URL=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/saleskelly.html&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto of the 'Second Luddite Congress', which Sale took a major part in defining, attempts to redefine neo-Luddites as people who reject violent action.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

==History==
===Origins of contemporary critiques of technology in literature===
According to Julian Young, [[Martin Heidegger]] was a Luddite in his early philosophical phase and believed in the destruction of modern technology and a return to an earlier agrarian world.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julian. ''Heidegger's Later Philosophy'', p. 80. Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Martin Heidegger#Later works: The Turn|later Heidegger]] did not see technology as wholly negative and did not call for its abandonment or destruction.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; In ''The Question Concerning Technology'' (1953), Heidegger posited that the modern technological "mode of Being" was one which viewed the natural world, plants, animals, and even human beings as a "standing-reserve"—resources to be exploited as means to an end.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Wheeler, Michael, "Martin Heidegger", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/heidegger/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this "monstrousness", Heidegger uses the example of a [[hydroelectric plant]] on the [[Rhine river]] which turns the river from an unspoiled natural wonder to just a supplier of [[hydropower]]. In this sense, technology is not just the collection of tools, but a way of being in the world and of understanding the world which is instrumental and grotesque. According to Heidegger, this way of being defines the modern way of living in the West.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; For Heidegger, this technological process ends up reducing beings to not-beings, which Heidegger calls 'the abandonment of being' and involves the loss of any sense of awe and wonder, as well as an indifference to that loss.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt;

One of the first major contemporary anti-technological thinkers was French philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]]. In his ''The Technological Society'' (1964), Ellul argued that the rationality of technology enforces logical and mechanical organization which "eliminates or subordinates the natural world." Ellul defined ''technique'' as the entire totality of organizational methods and technology with a goal toward maximum rational efficiency. According to Ellul, technique has an impetus which tends to drown out human concerns: "The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of ''technique''; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces."&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, ''The Technological Society'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of political and technological expansion was [[Lewis Mumford]], who wrote ''[[The Myth of the Machine]]''. The views of Ellul influenced the ideas of the infamous American neo-Luddite Kaczynski. The opening of Kaczynski's manifesto reads: "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."&lt;ref name=Kaczynski&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[philosophy of technology|philosophers of technology]] who have questioned the validity of technological progress include [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Don Ihde]] and [[Hubert Dreyfus]].&lt;ref name=Basney&gt;Basney, Lionel. Questioning Progress, Books and Culture magazine, 1998. URL=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/1998/sepoct/8b5018.html?paging=off&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: Dreyfus, H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10463">'''Operation Seek and Keep''' was a year-long [[United States Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (now the [[Department of Homeland Security]]) [[covert]] investigation that in 1998 resulted in the breaking of an international [[alien smuggling]] and [[money-laundering]] ring that brought in an estimated 12,000 illegal aliens from India and elsewhere to the United States.

== Tracking the Smuggling Ring ==

Officials said the smuggling operation, which was loosely made up of three different [[cartels]], smuggled mostly Indian nationals from [[India]] to [[Moscow]], where connecting flights allowed aliens to travel to [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="friends-partners.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/stop-traffic/1998/0381.html |title=Smashing a Smuggling Ring |first=Michelle |last=Mittelstadt |agency=The Associated Press |publisher=Friends-partners.org |date=1998-11-23 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-20/us/9811_20_ins.aliensmuggling_1_illegal-immigrants-illegal-employee-illegal-aliens?_s=PM:US |title=INS Dismantles Flesh Cartel People Smuggling Ring |publisher= CNN.com |date=November 20, 1998 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also smuggled aliens who were nationals of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19981122/32650024.html |title=Indian Human Smuggling Ring Busted in America |first=Chidanand |last=Rajghatta |date=November 22, 1998 |publisher=Indianexpress.com |accessdate=2013-06-18 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Cuba aliens would then either fly or travel by boat to the [[Miami]] area or travel across the [[Mexican border]] into [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;United States v.

According to INS officials, INS agents based in [[Texas]] first became aware of the operation in 1995, when they discovered a commercial pilot in Texas was making frequent flights from Dallas to the Texas/Mexico border, and became aware that an Indian smuggling ring was working into Texas through Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Breaking a Smuggling Cartel: A Timeline of Operation Seek and Keep," ABCNews.com, July 7, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, after  a former smuggler contacted an INS agent in [[Ciudad Juarez]], Mexico, and became an [[informant]], authorities learned the operation was using multiple routes.&lt;ref name="projects.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt; After further investigation, the case became a formal operation within INS and the Department of Justice, and was pursued as a racketeering and money-laundering case. The operation was also allowed to begin using new wire-tapping authority given to it by Congress, which led to over 35,000 calls by the smuggling operation to be intercepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKFMTDnapl4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22seek+and+keep%22+smuggling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jDiHOdTfG8&amp;sig=qdvlVaND2inqSNvdW3YEOAR89vI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UjPfTP2HH8H6lwenx4GXAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22seek%20and%20keep%22%20smuggling&amp;f=false |title=Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy |first1= John |last1=Arquilla |first2= David |last2=Ronfeldt (editors), Rand Corporation |year=2001 |page= 87 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TP1vbwFNEcMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Networks+and+netwars%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B1OfR-KDeo&amp;sig=_4_Br3qLTuJ2FPvo8VSPnJFebDc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nDbfTLC7NsSqlAf_kum5Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy |first1= John |last1=Arquilla |first2= David |last2=Ronfeldt (editors), Rand Corporation |year=2001 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breaking the Cartel ==

In November 1998, twenty-one people were taken into custody in a series of raids in several states, the [[Bahamas]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; Two of the ringleaders were arrested, including Nick Diaz, also known as Nitin Shettie.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Diaz was arrested in a raid in the Bahamas on November 14, 1998, and after his arrest by Bahamian authorities he was then taken into U.S. custody.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/lists/stop-traffic/1999/0284.html |title=Smashing a Smuggling Ring, ABCNews.com |date=July 7, 1999 |publisher=Friends-partners.org |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raid in the Bahamas detained dozens of Indian citizens waiting to make the last leg of the trip to the United States. An INS videotape showed Diaz being taken into custody, the Indian nationals who were being smuggled, and documents including piles of airline tickets used by the Indians to fly to the Caribbean via Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/stop-traffic/1998/0381.html |title=U.S. Busts Ring Smuggling Indians Via Moscow, Cuba |first= Anthony |last=Boadle, Reuters |publisher=Friends-partners.org |date=1998-11-23 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal grand jury in Dallas, where the investigation began, charged Shettie and 30 others in three sealed indictments that contained nearly 60 immigration and money-laundering counts.&lt;ref name="projects.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt; Eighteen alien smugglers accepted guilty pleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/annualreports/ar99/intro.htm |title=U.S. Department of Justice, Fiscal Year 1999 Annual Accountability Report, March 31, 2000 |publisher=Justice.gov |date=2000-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-INS Commissioner [[Doris Meissner]] hailed the success of the operation, saying, "Cracking a multimillion-dollar alien smuggling ring whose operations spanned four continents is an impressive achievement that underscores INS' commitment to defending the integrity of this nation's immigration laws ... we have disrupted and dismantled a major criminal enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/112198/LD0636.shtml |title=U.S. Officials Smash Alien Smuggling Ring |publisher=Lubbockonline.com |date=1998-11-21 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groundbreaking Operation ==

Operation Seek and Keep was the first investigation authorized to use [[wiretapping]] technology in an illegal immigrant smuggling case, as approved by  the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]],&lt;ref name="judiciary.house.gov"/&gt; The INS used the new authority to intercept electronic communications, monitoring 35,000-plus calls. Also, for the first time, federal prosecutors used money-laundering statutes to smash an alien smuggling operation and seize assets.&lt;ref name="friends-partners.org"/&gt;

'''Riepl's law''' is a [[hypothesis]] formulated by [[Wolfgang Riepl]] in 1913. It is frequently cited in discussions about newly emerging forms of [[Mass media|media]] in the [[scientific community]] in [[German language|German]]-speaking countries.{{fact|date=March 2012}}

Riepl, the chief editor of [[Nuremberg]]'s biggest newspaper at the time, stated in his [[dissertation]] about ancient modes of news communications (original title: "Das Nachrichtenwesen des Altertums  mit besonderer Rücksicht auf die Römer") that new, further developed types of media never replace the existing modes of media and their usage patterns. Instead, a [[Technological convergence|convergence]] takes place in their field, leading to a different way and field of use for these older forms.

This hypothesis is still considered to be relevant, explaining the fact that new media never make the "old" media disappear.

Support for the continued validity of Riepl's law came from the highly regarded CEO of the [[Alex Springer]] publishing group Mathias Döpfner who, in May 2006 wrote in a leading German newspaper [[Die Welt]]

"I believe in Riepl's law...Books have not replaced storytelling. Newspapers have not replaced books; radio has not replaced newspapers; and television has not replaced radio. It follows that the Internet will not replace television or newspapers"

'''Robert Benjamin Silvers''' (December 31, 1929 – March 20, 2017) was an American editor who served as editor of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' from 1963 to 2017.

Raised on [[Long Island]], New York, Silvers graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1947 and attended [[Yale Law School]], but he left before graduating and worked as press secretary to [[Chester Bowles]] in 1950. He was sent by the U.S. Army to Paris in 1952 as a speechwriter and press aide, while finishing his education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and [[Sciences Po]].  He soon joined ''[[The Paris Review]]'' as an editor under the guidance of [[George Plimpton]].  From 1959 to 1963, he was an associate editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in New York.

Silvers was co-editor of ''The New York Review of Books'' with [[Barbara Epstein]] for 43 years, until she died in 2006, and was the sole editor of the magazine after that until his own death in 2017.  Philip Marino of [[Liveright Publishing Corporation|Liveright Publishing]] wrote of him: "Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result."&lt;ref name=Marino&gt;Marino, Philip. [http://mag.uchicago.edu/arts-humanities/book-smart "Book Smart"], ''The University of Chicago Magazine'', University of Chicago, May–June 2012, accessed June 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Silvers edited or co-edited several essay anthologies. He appeared prominently in the 2014 documentary film about the ''Review'', ''[[The 50 Year Argument]]''.

Silvers' awards and honorary degrees include the [[National Book Foundation]]'s [[National Book Award|Literarian Award]], the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Award for "Distinguished Service to the Arts", the [[National Book Critics Circle Award#Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award|Ivan Sandrof Award for Lifetime Achievement in Publishing]] and a [[National Humanities Medal]]. Among other honors, he was a Chevalier of the French [[Légion d’honneur]] and a member of the French [[Ordre National du Mérite]].

[[File:Robert B Silvers 2011 NBCC Awards 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|Silvers in New York in 2012]]
According to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] in a 2007 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article, "[[Jason Epstein]]'s assessment of Silvers as 'The most brilliant editor of a magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually all of us who have been published by Robert Silvers'".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, John. "The Silvers Age", ''Vanity Fair'', June 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The British newspaper  ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Silvers "the greatest literary editor there has ever been",&lt;ref&gt;[[John Banville|Banville, John]], "'The greatest literary editor there has ever been' – John Banville remembers Robert Silvers"], ''The Guardian'', March 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Library of America]] remembered him as "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/1264-loa-remembers-robert-silvers-1929-2017 "LOA Remembers Robert Silvers, 1929–2017"], [[Library of America]], March 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as "the voracious [[polymath]], the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction",&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; and, in his obituary, stated that "under his editorship [''The Review''] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers."&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit/&gt; Author [[Louis Begley]] wrote, "the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him.  There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;Begley, Louis. [http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/03/22/robert-b-silvers-super-nanny "Robert B. Silvers, Super Nanny], ''The Paris Review'', March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face."&lt;ref&gt;Banville, John. [http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/04/02/the-rescue "The Rescue"], ''The Paris Review Daily'', April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cohen]] wrote, after Silvers' death, "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went to the heart of the matter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Cohen|Cohen, Roger]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/the-importance-of-bob-silvers.html?_r=0 "The Importance of Bob Silvers"], ''the New York Times'', April 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 profile of Silvers, ''The New York Times'' noted: "His greatest pleasure ... is simply good writing, which he talks about as others talk about fine wine or good food. Speaking about writers he likes, he sometimes flushes with enthusiasm. 'I admire great writers, people with marvelous and beautiful minds, and always hope they will do something special and revealing for us.'"&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt; Philip Marino, in ''The University of Chicago Magazine'', commented: "Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result. ... 'he puts a writer together with material that even the writer might not have thought was appropriate,' says [[Daniel Mendelsohn]]".&lt;ref name=Marino/&gt; Glen Weldon, writing for [[NPR]], concurred: "He encouraged writers to craft each review as a vigorous intellectual argument, and delighted in pairing reviewers with books that challenged their personal or political worldview."&lt;ref name=Weldon/&gt; Professor [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] wrote: "Reviewing for Bob Silvers was like playing in the sprinkling rain of a mighty fountain ... to be doused in the sheer, bubbling delight of Bob’s own unquenchable enthusiasm and alert, discerning curiosity. It widened the heart".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brown (historian)|Brown, Peter]]. [http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/21/remembering-bob-silvers "Remembering Bob Silvers"], ''The New York Review of Books'', April 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Nation]]'', Harvard professor [[Stanley Hoffmann]] observed that, in publishing some of the earliest criticisms of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Silvers realized what other commentators missed: "In both instances, Bob Silvers was, in effect, whether deliberately or not, compensating for the weaknesses of the more established media. ... It was important that a journal which has the authority of the ''Review'' in a sense took up the slack and presented viewpoints which were extremely hard to get into the established media."&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;Sherman, Scott.  [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040607/sherman/5 "The Rebirth of the NYRB",] ''[[The Nation]]'', May 20, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nation'' added, during the Iraq war:&lt;blockquote&gt;One suspects [the editors of the ''Review''] yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly [[pastiche]] of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that ''The New York Review of Books'' ... was there when we needed it most.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Silvers said: "The great political issues of power and its abuses have always been natural questions for us".&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt; His obituary in ''The New York Times'' commented that "Silvers made human rights and the need to check excessive state power his preoccupations, rising at times to the level of a crusade. ... [Silvers said], 'skepticism about government ... is a crucial point of view we have had from the first'."&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit/&gt; In his 1974 book ''The American Intellectual Elite'', Columbia University sociologist Charles Kadushin interviewed "the seventy most prestigious" American intellectuals of the late 1960s, including Silvers.  The ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine review of the book expressed surprise at Silvers' position near the top of the list: "Robert Silvers, the editor of the ''New York Review of Books'', the magazine that [Kadushin] indicates is favored by intellectuals who want to reach other intellectuals ... is an able editor but an infrequent writer; it must be assumed that his ranking at the top ... is due to a power not unlike that of the maitre d' of an exclusive restaurant."&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, R. Z. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943768-1,00.html "''The American Intellectual Elite'' by Charles Kadushin"]. ''Time'' magazine, September 2, 1974, accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers had a reputation for hiring and developing assistants who later became prominent in journalism, academia and literature. In 2010, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine featured several of these, including [[Jean Strouse]], [[Deborah Eisenberg]], [[Mark Danner]] and [[A. O. Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/features/establishments/68496/ "The Amazing Human Launching Pads"]. "Who Runs New York", ''New York'' magazine, September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same magazine, in February 2011, [[Oliver Sacks]] identified Silvers as his "favorite New Yorker, living or dead, real or fictional", saying that the ''Review'' is "one of the great institutions of intellectual life here or anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Vanita. [http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/oliver_sachs_has_luxuriant_eyelashes.html "Oliver Sacks Has Luxuriant Eyelashes"]. ''New York'' magazine, February 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Noah]] at ''[[Politico]]'' concluded that Silvers "made the ''New York Review'' the country’s best and most influential literary journal".&lt;ref name=Politico2017&gt;Noah, Timothy. [https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/28/robert-silvers-obituary-216182 "Robert Silvers: New York’s Presiding Man of Letters"], ''Politico'', December 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work habits and editorial approach ==
[[Jonathan Miller]] said of Silvers' work habits: "He isn't just conscientious beyond the call of duty.  He defines what duty is.  You will often find him working until two in the morning in the office, with his little assistants from Harvard around him.  He never stops.  He's always meeting people, and talking".&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown, Andrew. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/society "The Writer's Editor"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claire Messud]] wrote in 2012 that she was impressed, when submitting reviews for novels to the ''Review'', that Silvers had "read the novel at hand, and sometimes with more sensitivity than I had ... he pointed out, delicately, that I'd attributed a quotation to the wrong character, and upon another occasion, that I'd summarized an event in a misleading way ... [but] Bob is unfailingly generous and kind, someone who carefully suggests rather than commands alteration. He is an extraordinary editor in part because he is always respectful, of even the least of his contributors, or the least contribution."&lt;ref&gt;Messud, Claire. [http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/03/29/voice-lessons/ "The Wizard of West Fifty-seventh Street"], ''The Paris Review Daily'', March 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rosen]] elaborated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bob [has not] sunk his personality into his profession; rather... he has found a means of transforming his profession into a fundamental way of being human.  Extracting reviews from writers is not, in his case, a métier, or even a way of life, but a genuine form of self-expression, and he exercises it with dignity, tact and what sometimes feels like excessive sympathy.  He has made writers feel that producing articles for him is not a business transaction or even process of communication, but simply a reciprocal act of friendship.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ''[[Financial Times]]'' interviewer, Emily Stokes, wrote in 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as "an instinct. You must choose writers carefully, having read all of their work, rather than being swayed by 'reputations that are, shall we say, overpromoted', and then anticipate their needs, sending them books and news articles" while seeking greater clarity, comprehensiveness and freshness in the writing.&lt;ref name=Stokes/&gt; Stokes commented that Silvers "radiates a genial warmth [but told her that] it is part of the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views."&lt;ref name=Stokes/&gt; Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: "The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and upset. You have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [You must also reject reviews] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm terribly sorry, I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'"&lt;ref name=Scorsese/&gt; [[James Atlas]] wrote of a typical day for Silvers: "In the late afternoon, he'd rush out to a lecture at the Council on Foreign Relations, show up at a dinner party, and then head back to the office to deal with the next breaking crisis."&lt;ref&gt;Atlas, James. [http://nymag.com/news/media/21344 "The Ma and Pa of the Intelligentsia"], ''[[New York Magazine]]'', September 25, 2006, accessed April 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Noah wrote: "Silvers edited three successive galleys for every piece, sharpening the argument, requesting additional evidence, removing pompous jargon and infelicitous phrases."&lt;ref name=Politico2017/&gt; His ''New York Times'' obituary noted: "Silvers brought to [the ''Review''] a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion. ... [He was] loath to grant interviews. ... He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas."&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit/&gt;

==Honors and awards==

'''''Romanitas''''' is the collection of political and cultural concepts and practices by which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] defined themselves. It is a [[Latin]] word, first coined in the third century AD, meaning ''Roman-ness'' and has been used by modern historians as shorthand to refer to Roman identity and [[self-image]].

==Concepts behind the literal meaning==
''Romanitas'' is used to refer to the collection of political and cultural concepts and practices defining what it is to be a Roman.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; Unlike the Greeks, the Romans did not see their common identity as being based on language and inherited ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Woolf&gt;{{cite book |title=Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul |last=Woolf |first=Greg |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521789820 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their identity was based on being part of a political and religious community with common values, customs, morality and way of life.&lt;ref name=Woolf/&gt; In light of this, historians have sought to define ''romanitas'' using a number of approaches: one way is to consider the general ideals Romans attributed to themselves; another approach, which has achieved consensus amongst scholars, is to consider the construction of Roman identity during the process of colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tertullian the African: An Anthropological Reading of Tertullian's Context and Identities |last=Wilhite  |first=David E.  |year=2007 |isbn=978-3110194531 |page=42 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anxK6pMCWMUC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Romanitas+elements&amp;lr=&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=Romanitas&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all scholars accept that the notion of identity, herited from social sciences is adequate to understand what is to be Roman.&lt;ref&gt;SILVA, A. J. M. 2012, From lost Roman pottery to broken identities in Post-modern times: on the use of the concept of identity in Roman Archaeology, 28th Congress of the Rei Cretariae Romanae Fautores, Catania. https://www.academia.edu/1994803/From_lost_Roman_pottery_to_broken_identities_in_Post-modern_times_on_the_use_of_the_concept_of_identity_in_Roman_Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not a word used in ancient times, but it is used by modern writers to express the ideals which inspired the Roman state. It meant a great many things, but in short it meant what it was to be Roman (that is, Roman-ness). The Roman ideal was the [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]/[[soldier]]/[[farmer]]. The farmer was a hard working, frugal, practical man who worked the land with his own hands. The soldier was a courageous, strong man who [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeyed orders]] and risked his own life in the name of Rome. Prior to the formation, under [[Gaius Marius]], of the standing Roman Army, Rome had a [[militia]]-type defence-force which could be called up in time of [[war]] and then disbanded during [[peace]]time. The ideal of the citizen/soldier/farmer was [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]]. According to Roman legend, Cincinnatus was tending his farm when a messenger arrived, telling him that Rome was under attack and that he had been elected [[Roman dictator|dictator]]. He was at first reluctant to go, but the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] pleaded with him. He defeated the enemy tribe within a matter of weeks and, despite there remaining most of his six-month term as dictator with absolute power, returned to his farm.

The attainment and possession of the virtue of [[gravitas]] was highly valued by Romans of the early Republic and by Roman intellectuals. Indeed, gravitas was the single most clarifying characteristic of early republican Roman society:

{{quote|The Roman customs and principles regarding the acquisition of wealth are better than those of the [[Carthaginians]].  In the view of the latter nothing is disgraceful that makes for gain; with the former nothing is more disgraceful than to receive bribes and to make profit by improper means. For they regard wealth obtained from unlawful transactions to be as much a subject of reproach as a fair profit from reputable sources is of commendation.  A proof of the fact is this: the Carthaginians obtain office by open bribery, but among the Romans the penalty is death.}}

The virtuous character of the Romans, their honesty and trustworthiness, is shown in the way they handled their finances.  [[Polybius]] remarks: "Greek statesmen, if entrusted with a single talent, though protected by ten checking-clerks, as many seals and twice as many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep faith; whereas among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies, men have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from pure respect for their oath keep their faith intact."

Their cultural characteristics led to their development of "self government" by adopting a [[classical republic]] and thus this class formed the backbone of the [[Roman Republic]].

Because of the widespread influence of Roman [[Classics|classical literature]], the idea of the citizen/soldier/farmer also took root in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] and early [[United States]].

The '''distinction between sex and gender''' differentiates a person's [[biological sex]] (the anatomy of an individual's [[reproductive system]], and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s) from that person's [[gender]], which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person ([[gender role]]) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness ([[gender identity]]).&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;Prince, Virginia. 2005.

In some circumstances, an individual's [[assigned sex]] and gender do not align, and the person may be [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; In other cases, an individual may have biological [[sex characteristics]] that complicate sex assignment, and the person may be [[intersex]].

== Sex ==
[[Anisogamy]], or the size differences of [[gamete]]s (sex cells), is the defining feature of the two sexes. By definition, males have small, mobile gametes ([[sperm]]); females have large and generally immobile gametes ([[Egg cell|ova]] or eggs).&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M. &amp; Wilson, M. (1983).

=== History ===
Historian [[Thomas W. Laqueur]] suggests that from the Renaissance to the 18th century, there was a prevailing inclination among doctors towards the existence of only one biological sex (the [[one-sex and two-sex theories|one-sex theory]], that women and men had the same fundamental reproductive structure).&lt;ref&gt;Lacqueur, Thomas Walter, ''Making Sex: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Univ. Press, 1st Harvard Univ. Press pbk. ed. [5th printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-674-54355-6}}), © 1990), p.&amp;nbsp;134 (author prof. history Univ. Calif., Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[discourse]]s, this view persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[149] (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur asserts that even at its peak, the one-sex model was supported among highly educated Europeans but is not known to have been a popular view nor one entirely agreed upon by doctors who treated the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;68 &amp; 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex and gender took center stage in America in the time of wars, when women had to work and men were at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last = Lindsey|first = Linda.

== Gender ==
In the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', ''gender'' is defined as, "[i]n mod[ern] (esp[escially] feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.", with the earliest example cited being from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50093521?query_type=word&amp;queryword=gender&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-mHKT13-2771&amp;hilite=50093521 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2d ed. (online) 1989)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''gender'', noun, sense 3b.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (5th edition), in addition to defining gender the same way that it defines biological sex, also states that ''gender'' may be defined by identity as "neither entirely female nor entirely male"; its ''Usage Note'' adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people maintain that the word ''sex'' should be reserved for reference to the biological aspects of being male or female or to sexual activity, and that the word ''gender'' should be used only to refer to sociocultural roles. ... In some situations this distinction avoids ambiguity, as in ''gender research'', which is clear in a way that ''sex research'' is not. The distinction can be problematic, however. Linguistically, there isn't any real difference between ''gender bias'' and ''sex bias'', and it may seem contrived to insist that ''sex'' is incorrect in this instance.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A working definition in use by the World Health Organization for its work is that "'[g]ender' refers to the [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women" and that "'masculine' and 'feminine' are gender categories."&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) used to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex'' when referring to physiological differences between male and female organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|author=|date=|website=hhs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170913082514/https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they reversed their position on this and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = December 19, 2011|accessdate = August 3, 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140809152800/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm283453.htm|archivedate = August 9, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender'' is also now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.&lt;ref name="haig"/&gt;

[[GLAAD]] (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) makes a distinction between sex and gender in their most recent Media Reference Guide: Sex is "the classification of people as male or female" at birth, based on bodily characteristics such as chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. Gender identity is "one's internal, personal sense of being a man or woman (or a boy or a girl)".&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Some [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]] maintain that gender is totally undetermined by sex. See, for example, ''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'', a widely influential feminist text.&lt;ref&gt;Benewick, Robert and Green, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWYbQkVyGMcC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Shulamith+Firestone&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Shulamith%20Firestone&amp;f=false Shulamith Firestone 1945–], ''The Routledge dictionary of twentieth-century political thinkers'' (2nd Edition), Routledge, 1998, pp. 84-86. {{ISBN|0-415-09623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[David Reimer]], who was, according to studies published by [[John Money]], raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, was described in the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl''. Reimer was in fact not comfortable as a girl and later changed gender identity back to male when discovered the truth of his surgery. He eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosario, Vernon. 2009.

=== History ===
Gender in the sense of social and behavioral distinctions, according to archaeological evidence, arose "at least by some 30,000 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., Olga Soffer, &amp; Jake Page, ''The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory'' (Smithsonian Books &amp; Collins (HarperCollinsPublishers), 1st Smithsonian Books ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-06-117091-1}})), p. [277].&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence was found as of  "26,000 years ago",&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. 170 &amp; see pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; at least at the archeological site [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Dolní Věstonice I]] and others, in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. [169].&lt;/ref&gt; This is during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, power and privilege in modern Europe|author1=Richard, penny  |author2=Jessica Munna |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Pearson/ Longman|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic meaning of ''gender'', ultimately derived from Latin ''genus'', was of "kind" or "variety". By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of ''gender'' [[Grammatical gender|was in grammar]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt; This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', was embraced by [[feminist theory]]. This meaning of ''gender'' is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name=haig /&gt; Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mikkola|first=Mari|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction in linguistics ==
{{See also|Language and gender}}
Since the social sciences now distinguish between biologically defined ''sex'' and socially constructed ''gender'', the term ''gender'' is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between ''sex'' and ''gender'', where ''sex'' refers primarily to the attributes of  real-world entities – the relevant extralinguistic attributes being, for instance,  male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex – and [[grammatical gender]] refers to a category, such as  masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=484–486|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fowler|first1= Henry Watson | editor1-link=Jeremy Butterfield|editor1-last=Butterfield|editor1-first=Jeremy|edition=4th|date=2015|title=[[Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language]]'', for instance, states {{Quote|text=By GENDER is meant a grammatical classification of nouns, pronouns, or other words in the noun phrase according to certain meaning-related distinctions, especially a distinction related to the sex of the referent.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=314–316|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney

Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are ''generally''  referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus ''Mann'' (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give ''der Mann'', while ''Frau'' (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give ''die Frau''. However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. ''der Tisch'', the table) or feminine (''die Armbanduhr'', the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun ''[die] Person'' refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun ''[das] Mädchen'' means "the girl".

In modern English, there is no true grammatical gender in this sense,&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"/&gt; though the differentiation, for instance, between the pronouns "he" and "she", which in English refers to a difference in sex (or social gender), is sometimes referred to as a gender distinction. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', for instance, refers to the semantically based "covert" gender (e.g. male and female, not masculine and feminine) of English nouns, as opposed to the "overt" gender of some English pronouns; this yields ''nine'' gender classes: male, female, dual, common, collective, higher male animal, higher female animal, lower animal, and inanimate, and these semantic gender classes affect the possible choices of pronoun for coreference to the real-life entity, e.g. ''who'' and ''he'' for ''brother'' but ''which'' and ''it'' or ''she'' for ''cow''.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"/&gt;

==West and Zimmerman's "Doing gender"==
{{Main|Doing gender}}
Used primarily in sociology and gender studies, "''[[doing gender]]"'' is the socially constructed performance which takes place during routine human interactions, rather than as a set of essentialized qualities based on one's biological sex.&lt;ref name=west1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225165833/https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf |date=2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in Candace West and Don Zimmerman’s article “Doing Gender”, published in the peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]''.&lt;ref name=jurik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jurik | first1 = Nancy C. | last2 = Siemsen | first2 =  Cynthia | title = Doing gender as canon or agenda: A symposium on West and Zimmerman | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326677 | jstor = 20676750 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326677 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987,&lt;ref name=wz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Accounting for doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326529 | jstor = 20676758 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326529 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doing Gender'' is the most cited article published in ''Gender and Society''.&lt;ref name=jurik/&gt;

West and Zimmerman state that to understand gender as activity, it is important to differentiate between sex, sex category, and gender.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} They say that sex refers to the socially agreed upon specifications that establish one as male or female; sex is most often based on an individual's genitalia, or even their chromosomal typing before birth.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They consider sex categories to be dichotomous, and that the person is placed in a sex category by exhibiting qualities exclusive to one category or the other. During most interactions, others situate a person's sex by identifying their sex category; however, they believe that a person's sex need not align with their sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; West and Zimmerman maintain that the sex category is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one’s membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} Gender is the performance of attitudes and actions that are considered socially acceptable for one's sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}}

West and Zimmerman suggested that the interactional process of ''doing gender'', combined with socially agreed upon gender expectations, holds individuals accountable for their gender performances.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They also believe that while "doing gender" appropriately strengthens and promotes social structures based on the gender dichotomy, it inappropriately does not call into question these same social structures; only the individual actor is questioned.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; The concept of "doing gender" recognizes that gender both structures human interactions and is created through them.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;

== Criticism of the "sex difference" versus "gender difference" distinction ==

The current distinction between the terms ''sex difference'' versus ''gender difference'' has been criticized as misleading and counterproductive. These terms suggest that the behavior ''of an individual'' can be partitioned into separate biological and cultural factors. (However, behavioral differences between individuals can be statistically partitioned, as studied by [[behavioral genetics]].) Instead, all behaviors are phenotypes—a complex interweaving of both nature and nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp;  Kaufer, D. (2011).  [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31233/title/Beyond-Nature-vs--Nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104094323/http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view%2FarticleNo%2F31233%2Ftitle%2FBeyond-Nature-vs--Nurture%2F |date=2014-01-04 }}.  The Scientist.  October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane F. Halpern|Diane Halpern]], in her book ''[[Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities]],'' argued problems with ''sex'' vs. ''gender'' terminology:  "I cannot argue (in this book) that nature and nurture are inseparable and then... use different terms to refer to each class of variables.  The  ...biological manifestations of sex are confounded with psychosocial variables.... The use of different terms to label these two types of contributions to human existence seemed inappropriate in light of the biopsychosocial position I have taken."  She quotes [[Steven Pinker]]'s summary of the problems with the terms sex and gender: "Part of it is a new prissiness -- many people today are as squeamish about sexual dimorphism as the Victorians were about sex. But part of it is a limitation of the English language. The word 'sex' refers ambiguously to copulation and to sexual dimorphism..."&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2012). Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities (4th Ed.). NY: Psychology Press. p. 35 - 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lippa writes in ''Gender, Nature and Nurture'' that "Some researchers have argued that the word ''sex'' should be used to refer to (biological differences), whereas the word ''gender'' should be used to refer to (cultural differences). However, it is not at all clear the degree to which the differences between males and females are due to biological factors versus learned and cultural factors. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of the word ''gender'' tends to obscure the distinction between two different topics: (a) differences between males and females, and (b) individual differences in maleness and femaleness that occur within each sex."&lt;ref&gt;Lippa, R. (2005). Gender, Nature and Nurture. NJ: LEA, p 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that more useful distinctions to make would be whether a behavioral difference between the sexes is first due to an evolved [[adaptation]], then, if so, whether the adaptation is sexually dimorphic (different) or sexually monomorphic (the same in both sexes). The term ''sex difference'' could then be re-defined as between-sex differences that are manifestations of a sexually dimorphic adaptation (which is how many scientists use the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|title=Standards of evidence for designed sex differences|author=|date=|website=ucsb.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223410/http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bourke CH |author2=Harrell CS |author3=Neigh GN |title=Stress-induced sex differences: adaptations mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=210–8 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22426413 |pmc=3384757 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term ''gender difference'' could be re-defined as due to differential socialization between the sexes of a monomorphic adaptation or byproduct. For example, greater male propensity toward physical aggression and risk taking would be termed a "sex difference;" the generally longer head hair length of females would be termed a "gender difference."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M.E.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminism}}
{{See also|Feminist views on transgender topics}}

===General===
Many feminists consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For example, Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, states that "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., The Gender and Science Reader, New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the sex/gender distinction, also known as the Standard Model of Sex/Gender, is criticized by feminists who believe that there is undue emphasis placed on sex being a biological aspect, something that is fixed, natural, unchanging, and consisting of a male/female dichotomy. They believe the distinction fails to recognize anything outside the strictly male/female dichotomy and that it creates a barrier between those that fit as 'usual' and those that are 'unusual'. In order to prove that sex is not only limited to two categories [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s ''Sexing the Body'' addresses the birth of children who are intersex. In this case, the standard model (sex/gender distinction) is seen as incorrect with regard to its notion that there are only two sexes, male and female. This is because "complete maleness and complete femaleness represent the extreme ends of a spectrum of possible body types."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne "Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 44-77].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Fausto-Sterling argues that there are multitudes of sexes in between the two extremes of male and female.

Rather than viewing sex as a biological construct, there are feminists who accept both sex and gender as a social construct. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex."&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993-2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519013103/http://www.isna.org/ |archivedate=2016-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling believes that sex is socially constructed because nature does not decide on who is seen as a male or female physically. Rather, doctors decide what seems to be a "natural" sex for the inhabitants of society. In addition, the gender, behavior, actions, and appearance of males/females is also seen as socially constructed because codes of femininity and masculinity are chosen and deemed fit by society for societal usage.

=== Limitations ===

Some feminists go further and argue that neither sex nor gender are strictly binary concepts. [[Judith Lorber]], for instance, has stated that many conventional indicators of sex are not sufficient to demarcate male from female. For example, not all women lactate, while some men do.&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith (1993). [http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124221303/http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }}. Retrieved on 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Suzanne Kessler, in a 1990 survey of medical specialists in pediatric intersexuality, found out that when a child was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia, its sex was often determined according to the size of its penis.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Suzanne (1990). "The Medical Construction of Gender: Case Management of Intersexed Infants". ''Signs'', Vol. 16, No. 1: 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if the sex/gender distinction holds, Lorber and Kessler suggest that the dichotomies of female/male and masculine/feminine are not themselves exhaustive. Lorber writes, "My perspective goes beyond accepted feminist views that gender is a cultural overlay that modifies physiological sex differences [...] I am arguing that bodies differ in many ways physiologically, but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are 'female' and 'male' and 'women' and 'men.'"&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt;

Moreover, Lorber has alleged that there exists more diversity within the individual categories of sex and gender—female/male and feminine/masculine, respectively—than between them.&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt; Hence, her fundamental claim is that both sex and gender are social constructions, rather than [[natural kind]]s.

A comparable view has been advanced by Linda Zerilli, who writes regarding [[Monique Wittig]], that she is "critical of the sex/gender dichotomy in much feminist theory because such a dichotomy leaves unquestioned the belief that there is a 'core of nature which resists examination, a relationship excluded from the social in the analysis—a relationship whose characteristic is ineluctability in culture, as well as in nature, and which is the heterosexual relationship.'"&lt;ref&gt;Zerilli, Linda M. G., ''The Trojan Horse of Universalism: Language As a 'War Machine' in the Writings of Monique Wittig'', in Robbins, Bruce, ed., ''The Phantom Public Sphere'' (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-8166-2124-1}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;153–154 (n.&amp;nbsp;35 (citing Wittig, Monique, ''The Straight Mind'', in ''Feminist Issues'', vol. 1, no. 1, Summer, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;107) omitted) (author asst. prof., poli. sci. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; ed. teaches, Eng. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; coeditor, ''Social Text'') (em-dash surrounded by half-spaces in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler also criticizes the sex/gender distinction. Discussing sex as biological fact causes sex to appear natural and politically neutral. However, she argues that "the ostensibly natural facts of sex [are] discursively produced in the service of other political and social interests." Butler concludes, "If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=9–11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''Technolibertarianism''', sometimes referred to as '''cyberlibertarianism''', is a [[political philosophy]] with roots in the internet’s early hacker [[cypherpunk]] culture in [[Silicon Valley]] in the early 1990s and in American libertarianism that focuses on minimizing government regulation, censorship or anything else in the way of a "free" World Wide Web. In this case the word "free" is referring to the meaning of ''libre'' (no restrictions) not ''gratis'' (no cost). Cyber-libertarians embrace fluid, meritocratic hierarchies (which are believed to be best served by markets). The most widely known cyberlibertarian is [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurgenson, N.

Technolibertarian principles are defined as:
* The policy should always be considerate of [[civil liberties]]
* The policy should oppose [[government]] over [[regulation]]
* The policy that provides [[Homo economicus|rational, free market]] incentives is the best choice

"'''The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley'''" is a 1971 [[spoken word]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] with vocals by [[Terry Nelson (musician)|Terry Nelson]] and music by pick-up group C-Company.

== Inspiration and meaning ==
The song is set to the tune of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]". It offers a heroic description of Lieutenant [[William Calley]], who in March 1971 was convicted of murdering Vietnamese civilians in the [[My Lai Massacre]] of March 16, 1968. The song discusses different opinions of the Vietnam War. It starts off with Calley's childhood and how being a part of the war and fighting for your country was an aspiration for young children. It later on discusses how at the time many Americans believed the killings in the war were wrong: "they've made me out a villain". Then the song talks about how in Vietnam soldiers were being killed and ambushed. Finally it ends by saying that Calley was not to blame; he was only following orders and he thought it was an honor to fight at first, but there was no purpose or reward in doing so.

== Lyrical account ==

The song begins with an idealized, fictional account of Calley's childhood. It subsequently portrays factually Calley's early war experiences and the fatalities of young men in his company. It then goes on to relate the events at My Lai from Calley's point of view.

The song was written in April 1970 by Julian Wilson and James M. Smith of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]].  In November 1970 a few copies of it were issued by Quickit Publishing. In March 1971 [[Shelby Singleton]], publisher of "[[Harper Valley PTA]]," obtained the rights to the song and issued a new recording under his [[Plantation Records]] label.&lt;ref name="christgau"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg17.php| title=Consumer Guide (17): Additional Consumer News| work=[[The Village Voice]]| last=Christgau| first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Christgau | date=April 22, 1971 | quote=Shelby Singleton's Plantation Records, which first hit with "Harper Valley PTA," is getting a lot of c&amp;w airplay for "The Battle Hymn of Lt.

'''The Three Stooges''' were an American [[vaudeville]] and comedy team active from 1922 until 1970, best known for their 190 [[short subject]] films by [[Columbia Pictures]] that have been regularly airing on television since 1958. Their hallmark was [[Physical comedy|physical]] [[farce]] and [[slapstick]]. Six stooges appeared over the act's run (with only three active at any given time): [[Moe Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]] were mainstays throughout the ensemble's nearly fifty-year run and the pivotal "third Stooge" was played by (in order of appearance) [[Shemp Howard]], [[Curly Howard]], Shemp Howard again, [[Joe Besser]], and [[Joe DeRita|Curly Joe DeRita]].

The act began in the early 1920s as part of a vaudeville comedy act billed as "[[Ted Healy]] and His Stooges", consisting originally of Healy and Moe Howard. Over time, they were joined by Moe's brother Shemp Howard, and then Larry Fine. The four appeared in one feature film, ''[[Soup to Nuts]]'', before Shemp left to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by his younger brother, Jerome "Curly" Howard, in 1932. Two years later, after appearing in several movies, the trio left Healy and signed on to appear in their own short-subject comedies for [[Columbia Pictures]], now billed as "The Three Stooges". From 1934 to 1946, Moe, Larry and Curly produced over 90 short films for Columbia. It was during this period that the three were at their peak popularity.

Curly suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] in May 1946, and Shemp returned, reinstating the original lineup, until his death of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on November 22, 1955. Film actor [[Joe Palma]] was used as a stand-in to complete four Shemp-era shorts under contract (the maneuver thereafter became known as the "[[fake Shemp]]"). Columbia contract player Joe Besser joined as the third Stooge for two years (1956–57), departing in 1958 to nurse his ailing wife after Columbia terminated its shorts division. The studio then released all the shorts via [[Screen Gems]], Columbia’s television studio and distribution unit. Screen Gems then syndicated the shorts to television, whereupon the Stooges became one of the most popular comedy acts of the early 1960s.

Comic actor Joe DeRita became "Curly Joe" in 1958, replacing Besser for a new series of full-length theatrical films. With intense television exposure, the act regained momentum throughout the 1960s as popular kids' fare, until Fine's paralyzing stroke in January 1970. Fine died in 1975 after a further series of strokes. Attempts were made to revive the Stooges with longtime supporting actor [[Emil Sitka]] in Fine's role in 1970, and again in 1975, but this attempt was cut short by Moe Howard's death on May 4, 1975.

== History ==

=== Ted Healy and his Stooges (1922–1934) ===
The Three Stooges began in 1922 as part of a raucous [[vaudeville]] act called "[[Ted Healy]] and His Stooges" (also known as "Ted Healy and His Southern Gentlemen" and "Ted Healy and His Racketeers").&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Steve and Terry, Jim (2005). ''One Fine Stooge: Larry Fine's Frizzy Life in Pictures''. Nashville: Cumberland House. pp. 16, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moe Howard]] (born Moses Harry Horwitz) joined Healy's act in 1922, and his brother [[Shemp Howard]] (Samuel Horwitz) came aboard a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHOx01sgGts|title=The Three Stooges Extreme Rarities - Trailer|first=|last=LegendFilmsInc|date=October 8, 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, violinist-comedian [[Larry Fine]] (Louis Feinberg) also joined the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threestooges.net/journal/view/155|title=ThreeStooges.net :: The Three Stooges Journal - Issue No. 155|first=Robert|last=Davidson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the act, lead comedian Healy would attempt to sing or tell jokes while his noisy assistants would keep "interrupting" him, causing Healy to retaliate with verbal and physical abuse.
Ted Healy and His Stooges (plus comedian [[Fred Sanborn]]) appeared in their first Hollywood feature film, ''[[Soup to Nuts]]'' (1930), released by [[Fox Film Corporation]]. The film was not a critical success, but the Stooges' performances were singled out as memorable, leading Fox to offer the trio a contract, minus Healy.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; This enraged Healy, who told studio executives that the Stooges were his employees, and the offer was withdrawn. Howard, Fine and Howard learned of the offer and subsequent withdrawal and left Healy to form their own act (billed as "Howard, Fine &amp; Howard" or "Three Lost Souls").&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Steve and Terry, Jim (2005). ''One Fine Stooge: Larry Fine's Frizzy Life in Pictures''. Nashville: Cumberland House. pp. 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The act quickly took off with a tour of the theater circuit.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; Healy attempted to stop the new act with legal action, claiming that they were using his copyrighted material. There are accounts of Healy threatening to bomb theaters if Howard, Fine and Howard ever performed there, which worried Shemp so much that he almost left the act; reportedly, only a pay raise kept him on board.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;

Healy tried to save his act by hiring replacement stooges, but they were inexperienced and not as well-received as their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fleming| first = Michael | authorlink = | title = The Three Stooges: An Illustrated History, From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons| publisher = Broadway Publishing |year = 2002| origyear = 1999| location = New York| pages = 22, 21, 23, 25, 33, 49, 50 | id = | isbn = 0-7679-0556-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healy reached a new agreement with his former Stooges in 1932, with Moe now acting as business manager, and they were booked in a production of [[Jacob J. Shubert]]'s ''The Passing Show of 1932''.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; During rehearsals, Healy received a more lucrative offer and found a loophole in his contract allowing him to leave the production.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Shemp, fed up with Healy's abrasiveness,&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; decided to quit the act and toured in his own comedy revue for several months, and then landed at [[Vitagraph|Vitaphone Studios]] in May 1933, appearing in movie comedies produced in [[Brooklyn]], New York, for the next four years.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

[[File:Crawford gable astaire dancinglady poster 2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Healy and Joan Crawford with the Three Stooges in MGM's ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933)]]
With Shemp gone, Healy and the two remaining stooges (Moe and Larry) needed a replacement, so Moe suggested his younger brother Jerry Howard. Healy reportedly took one look at Jerry, who had long chestnut-red hair and a handlebar mustache, and remarked that he did not look like he was funny.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Jerry left the room and returned a few moments later with his head shaved (though his mustache remained for a time), and then quipped "Boy, do I look girly." Healy heard "Curly", and the name stuck.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; (There are varying accounts as to how the Curly character actually came about.)&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) signed Healy and his Stooges to a movie contract in 1933. They appeared in feature films and short subjects, either together, individually, or with various combinations of actors. The trio was featured in a series of musical comedy shorts, beginning with ''[[Nertsery Rhymes]]''. The short was one of a few shorts to be made with an early two-strip [[Technicolor]] process, including one featuring Curly without Healy or the other Stooges, ''[[Roast Beef and Movies]]'' (1934). The shorts themselves were built around recycled Technicolor film footage of production numbers cut from MGM musicals, such as ''[[Children of Pleasure]]'', ''[[Lord Byron of Broadway]]'' and the unfinished ''[[The March of Time (MGM musical)|March of Time]]'' (all 1930). Soon, additional shorts followed (sans the experimental Technicolor), including ''[[Beer and Pretzels]]'' (1933), ''[[Plane Nuts]]'' (1933), ''[[Jail Birds of Paradise]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Big Idea (1934 film)|The Big Idea]]'' (1934).&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

Healy and company also appeared in several MGM feature films as comic relief, such as ''[[Turn Back the Clock (film)|Turn Back the Clock]]'' (1933), ''[[Meet the Baron]]'' (1933), ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933) (with [[Joan Crawford]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Robert Benchley]]), ''[[Fugitive Lovers]]'' (1934) and ''[[Hollywood Party (1934 film)|Hollywood Party]]'' (1934). Healy and the Stooges also appeared together in ''[[Myrt and Marge (film)|Myrt and Marge]]'' for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

In 1934, the team's contract expired with MGM, and the Stooges parted professional company with Healy. According to Moe Howard's autobiography,&lt;ref name="Moe"&gt;{{cite book| last = Howard | first = Moe| authorlink = Moe Howard| title = [[Moe Howard and the Three Stooges]]| publisher = Broadway Publishing| origyear = 1977| year = 1979| location = | pages = 54, 73, 101| doi =| id = | isbn = 978-0-8065-0723-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the split was precipitated by Healy's alcoholism and abrasiveness. Their final film with Healy was MGM's ''Hollywood Party'' (1934). Both Healy and the Stooges went on to separate successes, with Healy dying under mysterious circumstances in 1937.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

In 1934, the trio—now officially named "The Three Stooges"—signed on to appear in two-reel comedy short subjects for [[Columbia Pictures]]. Moe wrote in his autobiography that they each received $600 per week (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1934}}}} today) on a one-year contract with a renewable option;&lt;ref name="Moe"/&gt; in the [[Ted Okuda]]–Edward Watz book ''The Columbia Comedy Shorts'', the Stooges are said to have received $1,000 among them for their first Columbia effort, ''[[Woman Haters]]'' (1934), and then signed a term contract for $7,500 per film (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7500|1934}}}} today), to be divided among the trio.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

Within their first year at Columbia, the Stooges became very popular. Realizing this, Columbia Pictures president [[Harry Cohn]] used the Stooges as leverage, as the demand for their films was so great that he eventually refused to supply exhibitors with the trio's shorts unless they also agreed to book some of the studio's mediocre [[B movie]]s.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; Cohn also saw to it that the Stooges remained ignorant of their popularity.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; During their 23 years at Columbia, the Stooges were never completely aware of their amazing drawing power at the box office.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; Their contracts with the studio included an open option that had to be renewed yearly, and Cohn would tell them that the short subjects were in decline, which was not a complete fabrication (Cohn's yearly mantra was "the market for comedy shorts is dying out, fellas"). The Stooges thought that their days were numbered and would sweat it out each year, with Cohn renewing their contract at the last moment. This deception kept the insecure Stooges unaware of their true value, resulting in them having second thoughts about asking for a better contract without a yearly option. Cohn's scare tactics worked for all 23 years that the Stooges were at Columbia; the team never once asked for a salary increase{{spaced ndash}}nor were they ever given one.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; It was not until after they stopped making the shorts in December 1957 that Moe learned of Cohn's tactics, what a valuable commodity the Stooges had been for the studio and how many millions more the act could have earned.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; Columbia offered theater owners an entire program of two-reel comedies (15-25 titles annually) featuring such stars as [[Buster Keaton]], [[Andy Clyde]], [[Charley Chase]] and [[Hugh Herbert]], but the Stooge shorts were the most popular of all.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;

The Stooges were required to release up to eight short films per year within a 40-week period; for the remaining 12 weeks, they were free to pursue other employment, time that was either spent with their families or touring the country to promote their live act.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; The Stooges appeared in 190 film shorts and five features while at Columbia, outlasting every one of their contemporaries employed in the short-film genre. [[Del Lord]] directed more than three dozen Stooge films, [[Jules White]] directed dozens more and his brother [[Jack White (film producer)|Jack White]] directed several under the [[pseudonym]] "Preston Black". Silent film star Charley Chase also shared directorial responsibilities with Lord and White.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

The Stooge films made between 1935 and 1941 captured the team at their peak, according to film historians [[Ted Okuda]] and Edward Watz, authors of ''The Columbia Comedy Shorts''. Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. ''[[Hoi Polloi (1935 film)|Hoi Polloi]]'' (1935) adapted the premise of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as ''[[Half-Wits Holiday]]'' (1947) and ''[[Pies and Guys]]'' (1958). ''[[Three Little Beers]]'' (1935) featured the Stooges running amok on a golf course to win prize money. ''[[Disorder in the Court]]'' (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. ''[[Violent is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude "[[Swingin' the Alphabet]]". In ''[[A Plumbing We Will Go]]'' (1940)—one of the team's quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite's mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; Other entries of the era are considered among the team's finest work, including ''[[Uncivil Warriors]]'' (1935), ''[[A Pain in the Pullman]]'' and ''[[False Alarms (1936 film)|False Alarms]]'' (both 1936), ''[[Grips, Grunts and Groans]]'', ''[[The Sitter Downers]]'', ''[[Dizzy Doctors]]'' (all 1937), ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'' (1938), ''[[We Want Our Mummy]]'' (1939), ''[[Nutty but Nice]]'' (1940), and ''[[An Ache in Every Stake]]'' and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' (both 1941).&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

With the onset of [[World War II]], the Stooges released several entries that poked fun at the rising Axis powers. ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' (1940) and its sequel ''[[I'll Never Heil Again]]'' (1941) lampooned Hitler and the Nazis at a time when America was still neutral. Moe was cast as "Moe Hailstone", an [[Adolf Hitler]]-like character, with Curly playing a [[Hermann Göring]] character (replete with medals) and Larry a [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]-type ambassador. The film is revered by Stooge aficionados as well as the Stooges themselves; Moe, Larry and director Jules White considered ''You Nazty Spy!'' their best film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/01.16.97/cover/stooges3-9703.html|title=Moe, Larry and Curly: Premature Anti-Fascists|work=metroactive.com|last=von Busack|first=Richard|date=January 16–22, 1997|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts indulged in a deliberately formless, non-sequitur style of verbal humor that was not the Stooges' forte, according to Okuda and Watz.

Other wartime entries have their moments, such as ''[[They Stooge to Conga]]'' (considered the most violent Stooge short),&lt;ref&gt;Seely, Peter and Pieper, Gail W. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=kPVWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq= ''Stoogeology: Essays on the Three Stooges'']. McFarland &amp; Co. p. 114. {{ISBN|0786429208}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Higher Than a Kite]]'', ''[[Back From the Front]]'' (all 1943), ''[[Gents Without Cents]]'' (1944) and the anti-Japanese ''[[The Yoke's on Me]]'' (also 1944). However, taken in bulk, the wartime films are decidedly substandard.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; ''[[No Dough Boys]]'' (1944) is often considered the best of these farces. The team, made up as Japanese soldiers for a photo shoot, is mistaken for genuine saboteurs by a Nazi ringleader ([[Vernon Dent]], the Stooges' primary foil). The highlight of the film features the Stooges engaging in nonsensical gymnastics (the real spies are renowned acrobats) for a skeptical group of enemy agents.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

The World War II era also brought on rising production costs that resulted in a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as ''[[Loco Boy Makes Good]]'', ''[[What's the Matador?]]'', ''[[Sock-A-Bye Baby]]'' (all 1942), ''[[I Can Hardly Wait]]'' and ''[[A Gem of a Jam]]'' (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; ''[[Spook Louder]]'' (1943), a remake of [[Mack Sennett]]'s ''The Great Pie Mystery'' (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; ''[[Three Smart Saps]]'' (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from [[Harold Lloyd]]'s ''[[The Freshman (1925 film)|The Freshman]]'' (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to come apart at the seams while he is on the dance floor.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

The Stooges made occasional guest appearances in feature films, though generally they were restricted to their short subjects. Most of the Stooges' peers had either made the transition from shorts to features films ([[Laurel and Hardy]], [[The Ritz Brothers]]) or had been starring their own feature films from the onset ([[Marx Brothers]], [[Abbott and Costello]]). However, Moe believed that the team's firebrand style of humor worked better in short form. In 1935, Columbia proposed to star them in their own full-length feature, but Moe rejected the idea saying, "It's a hard job inventing, rewriting, or stealing gags for our two-reel comedies for Columbia Pictures without having to make a seven-reeler (feature film). We can make short films out of material needed for a starring feature and then we wouldn't know whether it would be funny enough to click."&lt;ref name=Scrapbookrev&gt;{{cite book| last = Maurer| first = Joan Howard| authorlink = Joan Howard Maurer|author2=Jeff Lenburg |author3=Greg Lenburg | title = The Three Stooges Scrapbook| publisher = Citadel Press| origyear = 1982| year = 2012| location = | page = 78| doi =| id = | isbn = 978-1-61374-074-3 | url =http://amzn.com/1613740743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics have cited Curly as the most popular member of the team.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; His childlike mannerisms and natural comedic charm (he had no previous acting experience) made him a hit with audiences, particularly children and women (the latter usually finding the trio's humor juvenile and uncouth). The fact that Curly had to shave his head for the act led him to feel unappealing to women. To mask his insecurities, he ate and drank to excess and caroused whenever the Stooges made personal appearances, which was approximately seven months of each year. His weight ballooned in the 1940s, and his blood pressure became dangerously high.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"&gt;{{cite book| last = Maurer| first = Joan Howard| authorlink = Joan Howard Maurer|author2=Jeff Lenburg |author3=Greg Lenburg | title = The Three Stooges Scrapbook| publisher = Citadel Press| year = 1982| location = | pages = 73, 87, 179–193| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-8065-0946-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iTQXz-zQK5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curly's wild lifestyle and constant drinking eventually caught up with him in 1945, and his performances suffered.

During a five-month hiatus from August 1945 through January 1946, the trio committed themselves to making a feature film at Monogram, followed by a two-month-long live appearance gig in [[New York City]], with performances seven days a week. Curly also entered a disastrous third marriage in October 1945, leading to a separation in January 1946 and divorce in July 1946. That unhappy union wrecked his already fragile health. Upon the Stooges' return to Los Angeles in late November 1945, Curly was a shell of his former self. They had two months to rest before reporting back to Columbia in late January 1946, but Curly's condition was irreversible. They had only 24 days of work over the next three months, but eight weeks of time off could not help the situation.  In those last six shorts, ranging from ''[[Monkey Businessmen]]'' (1946) through ''[[Half-Wits Holiday]]'' (1947), Curly was seriously ill, struggling to get through even the most basic scenes.&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;

During the final day of filming ''[[Half-Wits Holiday]]'' (1947) on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a debilitating stroke on the set, ending his 14-year career. They hoped for a full recovery, but Curly never appeared in a film again except for a single cameo appearance in the third film after Shemp returned to the trio, ''[[Hold That Lion! (1947 film)|Hold That Lion!]]'' (1947). It was the only film that contained all four of the original Stooges (the three Howard brothers and Larry) on screen simultaneously. According to Jules White, this anomaly came about when Curly visited the set one day, and White had him do this bit for fun. (Curly's cameo appearance was recycled in the remake ''[[Booty and the Beast]]'', 1953.)&lt;ref name="Moe"/&gt; 
[[Image:CurlyMalice.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A thinner Curly (with a full head of hair and false handlebar mustache) as the cook in ''Malice in the Palace'' (1949). His scene was deleted from the final release.]] In 1949, Curly filmed a brief scene for ''[[Malice in the Palace]]'' (1949) as the restaurant's cook, but it was not used. Jules White's copy of the script contained the dialogue for this missing scene, and a production still of Curly does exist, appearing on both the film's original one-sheet and lobby card.&lt;ref name="Malice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threestooges.net/filmography/episode/117|title=ThreeStooges.net :: MALICE IN THE PALACE|first=Robert|last=Davidson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry played the role of the cook in the final print.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

==== Shemp's return (1946–1955) ====
[[File:Malice in the Palace.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The Stooges with Shemp (center) from 1949's ''Malice in the Palace''.]]
Moe asked older brother Shemp to take Curly's place, but Shemp was hesitant to rejoin the Stooges as he was enjoying a successful solo career.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook_p87"&gt;Lenburg, Jeff, with Maurer, Joan Howard, and Lenburg, Greg (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VY_j1vzWnasC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq= ''The Three Stooges Scrapbook'']. Chicago Review Press. p. 87. {{ISBN|1613740859}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realized, however, that not rejoining the Stooges would mean the end of Moe's and Larry's film careers. Shemp wanted assurance that rejoining them would be only temporary, and that he could leave the Stooges once Curly recovered. However, Curly's health continued to deteriorate, and it became clear that he could not return. Shemp resumed being a Stooge. Curly remained ill until his death of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] from additional strokes on January 18, 1952.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

Shemp appeared with the Stooges in 76 shorts and a low-budget [[Western (genre)|Western]] comedy feature titled ''[[Gold Raiders]]'' (1951) in which the screen time was evenly divided with [[B-picture]] cowboy hero [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]]. Shemp's return improved the quality of the films, as the previous few had been marred by Curly's sluggish performances. Entries such as ''[[Out West (1947 film)|Out West]]'' (1947), ''[[Squareheads of the Round Table]]'' (1948) and ''[[Punchy Cowpunchers]]'' (1950) proved that Shemp could hold his own. New director [[Edward Bernds]], who joined the team in 1945 when Curly was failing, sensed that routines and plotlines that worked well with Curly as the comic focus did not fit Shemp's persona, and allowed the comedian to develop his own Stooge character. Jules White, however, persisted in employing the "living cartoon" style of comedy that reigned during the Curly era. White would force either Shemp or Moe to perform similar gags and mannerisms originated by Curly, resulting in what appeared to be lackluster imitation.&lt;ref name="Forrester"/&gt; Most acutely, it created the "Curly vs. Shemp" debate that overshadowed the act upon Curly's departure.&lt;ref name="democraticunderground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=105x1756874 |title=Curly vs Shemp |publisher=Democratic Underground |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thecanteen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanteen.com/shemp.html |title=Absolute Stooge |publisher=The Canteen |date=November 23, 1955 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popcultureaddict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popcultureaddict.com/movies/shemp-htm/|title=Shemp Howard: The Little Stooge Who Could|publisher=Pop Culture Addict|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stooges lost some of their charm and inherent appeal to children after Curly retired, but some excellent films were produced with Shemp, an accomplished solo comedian who often performed best when allowed to improvise on his own.&lt;ref name="Forrester"/&gt;

The films from the Shemp era contrast sharply with those from the Curly era, largely owing to the individual directing styles of Bernds and White.&lt;ref name="Forrester"/&gt; From 1947 to 1952, Bernds hit a string of successes, including ''[[Fright Night (1947 film)|Fright Night]]'' (1947), ''[[The Hot Scots]]'', ''[[Mummy's Dummies]]'', ''[[Crime on Their Hands]]'' (all 1948), ''[[A Snitch in Time]]'' (1950), ''[[Three Arabian Nuts]]'' (1951) and ''[[Gents in a Jam]]'' (1952). Two of the team's finest efforts were directed by Bernds: ''[[Brideless Groom]]'' (1947) and ''[[Who Done It? (1949 film)|Who Done It?]]'' (1949). White also contributed a few fair entries, such as ''[[Hold That Lion! (1947 film)|Hold That Lion!]]'' (1947), ''[[Hokus Pokus (1949 film)|Hokus Pokus]]'' (1949), ''[[Scrambled Brains]]'' (1951), ''[[A Missed Fortune]]'' and ''[[Corny Casanovas]]'' (both 1952).

Another benefit from the Shemp era was that Larry was given more time on screen. Throughout most of the Curly era, Larry was relegated to a background role, but by the time that Shemp rejoined the Stooges, Larry was allotted equal footage, even becoming the focus of several films, in particular ''[[Fuelin' Around]]'' (1949) and ''[[He Cooked His Goose]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

The Shemp years also marked a major milestone: the Stooges' first appearance on television. In 1948, they guest-starred on [[Milton Berle]]'s popular ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' and [[Morey Amsterdam]]'s ''[[The Morey Amsterdam Show]]''. By 1949, the team filmed a pilot for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] for their own weekly television series, titled ''[[Jerks of All Trades]]''. Columbia Pictures blocked the series from going into production, but allowed the Stooges to make television guest appearances.  The team went on to appear on ''Camel Comedy Caravan'' (also known as ''The [[Ed Wynn]] Show''), ''The [[Kate Smith]] Hour'', ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (1950 TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' and ''The [[Eddie Cantor]] Comedy Theatre'', among others.&lt;ref name="Scrapbookrev"/&gt;

In 1952, the Stooges lost some key players at Columbia Pictures. The studio decided to downsize its short-subject division, resulting in producer [[Hugh McCollum]] being discharged and director [[Edward Bernds]] resigning out of loyalty to McCollum. Bernds had been contemplating his resignation for some time, as he and Jules White were often at odds. Screenwriter [[Elwood Ullman]] followed suit, leaving only White to both produce and direct the Stooges' remaining Columbia comedies.&lt;ref name="Scrapbookrev"/&gt; Not long after, the quality of the team's output markedly declined with White now assuming complete control over production. ''[[DVD Talk]]'' critic Stuart Galbraith IV commented that "the Stooges' shorts became increasingly mechanical...and frequently substituted violent sight gags for story and characterization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Galbraith IV | first = Stuart  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection | work = DVD Talk | publisher = | date = July 7, 2012 | url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/54884/three-stooges-the-ultimate-collection-the/ | doi = | accessdate = April 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was also significantly faster, with the former four-day filming schedules now tightened to two or three days. In another cost-cutting measure, White would create a "new" Stooge short by borrowing footage from old ones, setting it in a slightly different storyline and filming a few new scenes often with the same actors in the same costumes. White was initially very subtle when recycling older footage: he would reuse only a single sequence of old film, re-edited so cleverly that it was not easy to detect. The later shorts were cheaper and the recycling more obvious, with as much as 75% of the running time consisting of old footage. White came to rely so much on older material that he could film the "new" shorts in a single day. New footage filmed in order to link older material suffered from White's wooden directing style and penchant for telling his actors how to act. Shemp, in particular, disliked working with White after 1952.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

Three years after Curly's death, Shemp died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at age 60 on November 22, 1955 during a taxi ride home with a friend after attending a boxing match. Moe was stunned and contemplated disbanding the Stooges. However, Cohn reminded him that the team owed Columbia four additional films with Shemp. Recycled footage, combined with new footage utilizing Columbia supporting player [[Joe Palma]] (see also [[Fake Shemp]]) as Shemp's double, filmed from behind, was used to complete the last four films originally planned with Shemp: ''[[Rumpus in the Harem]]'', ''[[Hot Stuff (1956 film)|Hot Stuff]]'', ''[[Scheming Schemers]]'' and ''[[Commotion on the Ocean]]'' (all released in 1956).&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

==== Joe Besser replaces Shemp (1956–1958) ====

After Shemp's death, Moe and Larry were again in need of a third Stooge. Several comedians were considered, including noted African-American actor [[Mantan Moreland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Kelly|title=MANTAN MORELAND: THE BLACK COMEDIAN WHO WAS ALMOST ONE OF THE THREE STOOGES|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2016/03/mantan-moreland-black-comedian-almost-one-three-stooges/|website=Today I Found Out|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Columbia insisted on a comedian already under contract.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; They decided on [[Joe Besser]], who appeared in the final 16 Stooge shorts at Columbia. Besser had been starring in his own short-subject comedies for the studio since 1949 and appeared in supporting roles in a variety of movies, making his persona sufficiently well known.

Besser had noted how one side of Larry Fine's face appeared "calloused",&lt;ref&gt;archival audio – "E Entertainment", May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; so he had a clause in his contract specifically prohibiting him from being hit beyond an infrequent tap (though this restriction was later lifted). Besser was the only Stooge other than Curly who dared to hit Moe back in retaliation. "I usually played the kind of character who would hit others back," Besser recalled.&lt;ref name="Forrester"&gt;{{cite book| last = Forrester| first = Jeff| authorlink =| title = The Three Stooges: The Triumphs and Tragedies of the Most Popular Comedy Team of All Time| publisher = Donaldson Books| year = 2004| pages = 121, 135| url = | doi =| id = | isbn = 0-9715801-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Besser's prolific film and stage career, Stooge entries featuring him have often been tagged as the team's weakest.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; During his tenure, the films were assailed as questionable models for youth, and in response began to resemble television sitcoms.&lt;ref name="Scrapbookrev"/&gt; Sitcoms, however, were available for free on television, making the short film a throwback to a bygone era. Besser was a talented comic, and was quite popular as "Stinky" on ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. However, his whining mannerisms did not quite blend with the Stooges' brand of humor,&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; though his presence did create a verbal friction between Moe and Larry that improved their mutually insulting banter.&lt;ref name="Scrapbookrev"/&gt; Times had changed, and Besser was not solely to blame for the quality of these final entries; the scripts were rehashes of earlier efforts, the budgets were lower and Moe's and Larry's advanced ages prohibited them from performing the [[physical comedy]] that was their trademark.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; Besser had suggested that Moe and Larry comb their hair back to give them a more gentlemanly appearance. Both Moe and Jules White approved of the idea, but used it sparingly in order to match the old footage in films that were remakes.&lt;ref name="Scrapbookrev"/&gt;

Despite their lukewarm reception, the Besser shorts did have their comedic moments. In general, the remakes had the traditional Stooges knockabout look and feel, such as 1958's ''[[Pies and Guys]]'' (a scene-for-scene remake of ''Half-Wits Holiday'', which itself was a reworking of the earlier ''Hoi Polloi''), ''[[Guns a Poppin]]'' (1957), ''[[Rusty Romeos]]'' (1957) and ''[[Triple Crossed]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="Scrapbookrev"/&gt; In contrast, ''[[Hoofs and Goofs]]'', ''[[Horsing Around]]'' and ''[[Muscle Up a Little Closer]]'' (all 1957) mostly resembled the sitcoms of the era. ''[[A Merry Mix Up]]'' (also 1957) and ''[[Oil's Well That Ends Well]]'' (1958) are also amusing, while the musical ''[[Sweet and Hot]]'' (1958) deserves some credit for straying from the norm. The American space craze also led to three entries focusing on space travel: ''[[Space Ship Sappy]]'', ''[[Outer Space Jitters]]'' (both 1957) and ''[[Flying Saucer Daffy]]'' (1958).&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;

Columbia was the last studio still producing live-action and two-reel short films (other studios were still making animated one-reelers well into the 1960s, but the Stooges' last live-action competition, one-reel series ''[[Joe McDoakes]]'', had ended its run in 1956), and the market for such films had all but dried up. As a result, the studio opted not to renew the Stooges' contract when it expired in December 1957. The final comedy produced was ''Flying Saucer Daffy'', filmed on December 19–20, 1957.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;Solomon, Jon. (2002) ''The Complete Three Stooges: The Official Filmography and Three Stooges Companion'', pp. 318, 510; Comedy III Productions, Inc., {{ISBN|0-9711868-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, the Stooges were unceremoniously fired from Columbia Pictures after 24 years of making low-budget shorts.

No formal goodbyes or congratulatory celebrations occurred in recognition of their work and of the money that their comedies had earned for the studio. Moe visited Columbia several weeks after the dismissal to say goodbye to several executives. But without the current year's studio pass, Moe was refused entry, later stating that it was a crushing blow to his pride.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

The studio had enough completed Stooge films to be released over the next 18 months, though not in the order in which they were produced. The final Stooge release, ''[[Sappy Bull Fighters]]'', did not reach theaters until June 4, 1959. With no active contract in place, Moe and Larry discussed plans for a personal appearance tour. In the meantime, Besser's wife suffered a minor heart attack and he preferred to stay local, leading him to withdraw from the act.

After Besser's departure, Moe and Larry began looking for potential replacements. Larry suggested former Ted Healy stooge [[Paul Garner|Paul "Mousie" Garner]], but based on his tryout performance, Moe later remarked that he was "completely unacceptable". Weeks later, Larry came across burlesque performer [[Joe DeRita]], and thought he would be a good fit.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

=== Comeback with Joe DeRita (1958–1970) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Columbia screen gems 3 stooges synd ad 1958.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Screen Gems television syndication trade advertisement from April 1959. The team's classic films were well received by television audiences.]] --&gt;
The early days of television provided movie studios a place to unload a backlog of short films that they thought otherwise unmarketable, and the Stooge films seemed perfect for the burgeoning genre. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] had even expressed interest as far back as 1949, purchasing exclusive rights to 30 of the trio's shorts and commissioning a pilot for a potential series, ''[[Jerks of All Trades]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Gary H. ''Saturday Morning TV'', Dell Publishing, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; However, the success of television revivals for such names as [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Woody Woodpecker]], [[Popeye]], [[Tom and Jerry]] and the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series in the late 1950s led Columbia to cash in again on the Stooges. In September 1958, Columbia's television subsidiary [[Screen Gems]] offered a package consisting of 78 Stooge shorts (primarily from the Curly era), which were well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xQYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22three+stooges%22+%2B+%22screen+gems%22+%2B+1958#v=onepage&amp;q=%22three%20stooges%22%20%2B%20%22screen%20gems%22%20%2B%201958&amp;f=false |title=Liberty – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=August 2, 2010|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;An additional 40 shorts hit the market in April 1959; by September 1959, all 190 Stooge shorts were airing regularly. With so many films available for broadcast, daily television airings provided heavy exposure aimed squarely at children. Parents who had grown up seeing the same films in the theaters began to watch alongside their children and, before long, Howard, Fine and DeRita were in high demand.&lt;ref name="Okuda"&gt;{{cite book| last = Okuda| first = Ted | authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Watz, Edward | title = The Columbia Comedy Shorts| publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers| year = 1986| location = | pages =60–102, 237–239| id = | isbn = 0-89950-181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was discovered that the Curly-era shorts were the most popular, Moe suggested that DeRita shave his head to accentuate his slight resemblance to Curly Howard.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; He adopted first a [[crew cut]] and later a completely shaven head, thus becoming "Curly Joe".
[[File:Three Stooges 1959.jpg|thumb|right|The Stooges with Curly Joe DeRita (left) in 1959.]]
This lineup, now frequently referred to as "Larry, Moe and Curly Joe," starred in six full-length feature films from 1959 to 1965: ''[[Have Rocket, Will Travel]]'' (1959), ''[[Snow White and the Three Stooges]]'' (1961), ''[[The Three Stooges Meet Hercules]]'' (1962), ''[[The Three Stooges in Orbit]]'' (1962), ''[[The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Outlaws Is Coming|The Outlaws IS Coming!]]'' (1965). The films were aimed at the kiddie-matinee market, and most were [[black and white|black-and-white]] [[farce]] outings in the Stooge tradition, with the exception of ''Snow White and the Three Stooges'', a children's fantasy in color. They also appeared in an extremely brief cameo as firemen (a role that Larry, Moe, and Shemp had also played in the pre-"Three Stooges" film ''Soup to Nuts'' in 1930) in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and in a larger capacity that same year in ''[[4 for Texas]]'' starring [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]]. Throughout the early 1960s, the Stooges were one of the most popular and highest-paid live acts in America.&lt;ref name="Forrester"/&gt;

The Stooges also tried their hand at another weekly television series in 1960 titled ''[[The Three Stooges Scrapbook]]'', filmed in color and with a [[laugh track]]. The first episode, "Home Cooking", featured the boys rehearsing for a new television show. Like ''Jerks of All Trades'' in 1949, the pilot did not sell. However, Norman Maurer was able to reuse the footage (reprocessed in black and white) for the first ten minutes of ''The Three Stooges in Orbit''.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

The trio also filmed 41 short comedy skits for ''[[The New Three Stooges]]'' in 1965, which features a series of 156 animated cartoons produced for television. The Stooges appeared in live-action color footage, which preceded and followed each animated adventure in which they voiced their respective characters.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

During this period, The Stooges appeared on numerous television shows including ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''[[Here's Hollywood]]'', ''[[Masquerade Party]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''Danny Thomas Meets the Comics'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lenburg, Jeff, Joan Howard Maurer, and Greg Lenburg (2012).[https://books.google.com/books?id=VY_j1vzWnasC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=joey+bishop+moe+howard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiymMqXy-rQAhUGNiYKHZnhCxoQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q= ''The Three Stooges Scrapbook''].

=== Final years (1970–1975) ===
In late 1969, Howard, Fine and DeRita began production on another half-hour pilot, this time for a syndicated 39-episode TV series titled ''[[Kook's Tour]]'',&lt;ref name="threestooges.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threestooges.net/filmography/episode/238|title=ThreeStooges.net :: KOOK'S TOUR|first=Robert|last=Davidson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination travelogue-sitcom that had the "retired" Stooges traveling to various parts of the world with the episodes filmed on location. On January 9, 1970, during production of the pilot, Larry suffered a paralyzing [[stroke]], ending his acting career along with plans for the television series. The pilot was unfinished and several key shots were missing, but producer Norman Maurer edited the available footage and made the pilot a 52-minute special that was released to the [[Cartrivision]] [[videocassette]] home video market in 1973.&lt;ref name="threestooges.net"/&gt; It is the last film in which the Stooges appeared and the last known performance of the team.&lt;ref name="threestooges.net"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Emilstooge.jpg|thumb|150px|lefgt|A proposed incarnation of the Three Stooges. One of five known promotional pictures taken after Larry's death in 1975 features a very ill Moe Howard (who died shortly thereafter) flanked by Curly Joe DeRita to the left and [[Emil Sitka]] ("Harry") to the right.]] --&gt;
Following Larry Fine's stroke, plans were made for [[Emil Sitka]] to replace him in a new feature film, written by Moe Howard's grandson, Jeffrey Scott [Maurer], titled ''Make Love, Not War''. Moe Howard, Joe DeRita and Emil Sitka were cast as POWs in a [[World War II]] Japanese prison camp, plotting an escape with fellow prisoners. The film would have been a departure from typical Stooge fare, with dark-edged humor and scenes of war violence, but insufficient funding prevented production from advancing beyond the script stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threestooges.net/filmography/episode/469|title=ThreeStooges.net :: MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR|first=Robert|last=Davidson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1970, Joe DeRita recruited vaudeville veterans [[Frank Mitchell (actor)|Frank Mitchell]] and Mousie Garner to tour as ''The New Three Stooges''.&lt;ref name="Final Years"/&gt; Garner had worked with Ted Healy as one of his "replacement stooges" decades earlier and was briefly considered as Joe Besser's replacement in 1958.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uATWRgkUi38|title=Late Night David Letterman: Jan 1987 Mousie Garner (stooge)|first=|last=ekezilla|date=July 16, 2014|publisher=|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell had also replaced Shemp as the "third stooge" in a 1929 Broadway play and appeared in two of the Stooges' short subjects in 1953. The act fared poorly with minimal bookings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsoHm_Wc5yY|title=WGAR 1220 AM Cleveland - Steve Cannon Show - Curly Joe DeRita Interview - (Pt.1/2)|first=|last=dspstuff2|date=August 16, 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Moe's wife had prevailed on him to retire from performing slapstick due to his age. For the next several years, Moe appeared regularly on talk shows and did speaking engagements at colleges, while DeRita quietly retired.

Larry suffered another stroke in mid-December 1974, and four weeks later an even more massive one. After slipping into a coma, he died a week later from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on January 24, 1975.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

Before Larry's death, the Stooges were scheduled to co-star in the R-rated film ''[[Blazing Stewardesses]],'' featuring Moe and Curly Joe with Emil Sitka in the middle spot as Harry, Larry's brother. The team was signed and publicity shots were taken, but one week prior to March's filming date, Moe was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and the Stooges had to back out; he died on May 4, 1975. Producer Sam Sherman briefly considered having former Stooge Joe Besser appear in his place, but ultimately decided against it.&lt;ref name="Final Years"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthonybalducci.blogspot.com/2009/01/three-stooges-go-to-heaven.html|title=The Three Stooges Go To Heaven|work=Anthony Balducci's Journal|first=Anthony|last=Balducci|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Ritz Brothers replaced the Stooges and performed much of their act's schtick, including the precision dance routine first seen in ''[[Sing, Baby, Sing]]'' (1936), co-starring original Stooge leader Ted Healy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threestooges.net/filmography/episode/461|title=ThreeStooges.net :: BLAZING STEWARDESSES|first=Robert|last=Davidson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the remaining original replacement stooges, Joe Besser died of [[heart failure]] on March 1, 1988, followed by Joe DeRita of [[pneumonia]] on July 3, 1993. Emil Sitka was announced as a Stooge but never performed as such; he died on January 16, 1998, six months after being disabled by a stroke.

== Legacy and perspective ==
Over half a century since their last short film was released, the Three Stooges remain popular with audiences. Their films have never left American television since first appearing in 1958, and they continue to delight old fans while attracting new viewers. They were a hard-working group of comedians who were never the critics' darlings, a durable act who endured several personnel changes in their careers that would have permanently sidelined a less persistent act.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; The Stooges would not have lasted as long as they did as a unit without Moe Howard's guiding hand.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt;

The [[Ted Okuda]] and Edward Watz book ''The Columbia Comedy Shorts'' puts the Stooges' legacy in critical perspective:

{{quote|Many scholarly studies of motion picture comedy have overlooked the Three Stooges entirely{{spaced ndash}}and not without valid reasoning. Aesthetically, the Stooges violated every rule that constitutes "good" comedic style. Their characters lacked the emotional depth of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Harry Langdon]]; they were never as witty or subtle as [[Buster Keaton]]. They were not disciplined enough to sustain lengthy comic sequences; far too often, they were willing to suspend what little narrative structure their pictures possessed in order to insert a number of gratuitous jokes. Nearly every premise they have employed (spoofs of westerns, horror films, costume melodramas) has been done to better effect by other comedians. And yet, in spite of the overwhelming artistic odds against them, they were responsible for some of the finest comedies ever made. Their humor was the most undistilled form of low comedy; they were not great innovators, but as quick laugh practitioners, they place second to none. If public taste is any criterion, the Stooges have been the reigning kings of comedy for over fifty years.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt;}}

Beginning in the 1980s, the Stooges finally began to receive critical recognition. The release of nearly all their films on DVD by 2010 has allowed critics of Joe Besser and Joe DeRita{{spaced ndash}}often the recipients of significant fan backlash{{spaced ndash}}to appreciate the unique style of comedy that both men brought to the Stooges. In addition, the DVD market has allowed fans to view the entire Stooge film corpus as distinct periods in their long, distinguished career rather than unfairly comparing one Stooge to another (the Curly vs. Shemp debate continues to this day&lt;ref name="democraticunderground" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecanteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="popcultureaddict" /&gt;).

The team appeared in 220 films, but it is the durability of the 190 short films the Stooges made at Columbia Pictures that acts as an enduring tribute to the comedy team.&lt;ref name="Okuda"/&gt; American [[television personality]] [[Steve Allen]] went on record in 1984 saying, "Although they never achieved widespread critical acclaim, they did succeed in accomplishing what they had always intended to do: they made people laugh."&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the Stooges'' VHS Documentary, narrated by [[Steve Allen]] (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filmography ==
{{Main article|The Three Stooges filmography}}

The Three Stooges appeared in 220 films through their career. Of those 220, 190 short films were made for [[Columbia Pictures]], for which the trio are best known today. Their first Columbia film, ''[[Woman Haters]]'', premiered on May 5, 1934. Their contract was extended each year until the final one expired on December 31, 1957. The last 8 of the 16 shorts with [[Joe Besser]] were released over the next 18 months. The final release, ''[[Sappy Bull Fighters]]'', premiered on June 4, 1959.

== C3 Entertainment, Inc. ==
{{Main article|C3 Entertainment}}
In 1959, Comedy III Productions (later, C3 Entertainment) was formed by Moe, Larry and Joe DeRita to manage all business and merchandise transactions. Now controlled by DeRita's heirs, C3 Entertainment has since diversified into a brand management company licensing [[personality rights]] to various nostalgia acts, including The Three Stooges.

== Television ==
[[File:The Three Stooges 1962.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Larry, Moe and Curly Joe in a 1962 TV ad promoting their earlier short subjects, though DeRita never appeared in any]]
A handful of Three Stooges shorts first aired on television in 1949, on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) network. It was not until 1958 that [[Screen Gems]] packaged 78 shorts for national syndication; the package was gradually enlarged to encompass the entire library of 190 shorts. In 1959, [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles purchased the Three Stooges films for air, but by the early 1970s, rival station [[KTLA]] began airing the Stooges films, keeping them in the schedule until early 1994. [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|The Family Channel]] ran the shorts as part of their ''Stooge TV'' block from February 19, 1996, to January 2, 1998. In the late 1990s, [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] had held the rights to the Three Stooges shorts, originally airing them under a programming block called "Stooges Playhouse". In 1999, it was replaced with a program called ''N.Y.U.K. (New Yuk University of Knuckleheads)'', which starred actor/comedian [[Leslie Nielsen]]. The program would show three random Stooge shorts. Nielsen hosts the program as a college instructor, known as the Professor of Stoogelogy, who teaches to the students lectures on the Three Stooges before the Stooges' shorts air. The block aired several shorts often grouped by a theme, such as similar schtick used in different films. Although the block was discontinued after AMC revamped their format in 2002, the network still ran Stooges shorts occasionally. The AMC run ended when [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]] picked them up in 2004, airing them in their ''Stooges Slap-Happy Hour'' every Saturday and Sunday mornings. On June 6, 2005 the network began running the ''Stooges Slap-Happy'' as a one-hour summer comedy block which ended on September 2, 2005. By 2007, the network had discontinued the block. Although Spike did air Stooges shorts for a brief period of time after the block was canceled, as of late April 2008, the Stooges had disappeared from the network's schedule entirely. The Three Stooges returned on December 31, 2009, on AMC, starting with the "Countdown with the Stooges" [[New Year's Eve]] marathon. AMC planned to put several episodes on their website in 2010. The "Stooges" shorts were best known in Chicago as a part of a half hour late afternoon show on [[WGN-TV]] hosted by [[Bob Bell (actor)|Bob Bell]] as "Andy Starr" in the 1960s.

Since the 1990s Columbia and its television division's successor, [[Sony Pictures Television]], has preferred to license the Stooges shorts to cable networks, precluding the films from being shown on local broadcast TV. Two stations in Chicago and [[Boston]], however, signed long-term syndication contracts with Columbia years ago and have declined to terminate them. Thus, [[WMEU-CD]] in Chicago aired all 190 Three Stooges shorts on Saturday afternoons and Sunday evenings until 2014. [[WSBK-TV]] in Boston airs Stooge shorts and feature films, including an annual [[New Year's Eve]] [[marathon]]. [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles dropped the shorts in 1994, but brought them back in 2007 as part of a special retro-marathon commemorating the station's 60th anniversary. Since that time, the station's original 16mm Stooges film prints have aired occasionally as part of mini-marathons on holidays. [[Antenna TV]], a network broadcasting on the digital subchannels of local broadcast stations (owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], who also owns KTLA), began airing the Stooges shorts upon the network's January 1, 2011 launch, which ran in multi-hour blocks on weekends through December 29, 2012; most of the Three Stooges feature films are also broadcast on the network, through Antenna TV's distribution agreement with [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (whose Columbia Pictures subsidiary released most of the films). While the network stopped airing Stooges shorts regularly from 2013 to 2015, they were occasionally shown as filler if a movie ran short, as well as in holiday marathons. However, the shorts returned to Antenna TV's regular lineup on January 10, 2015.

Some films have been [[Film colorization|colorized]] by two separate companies. The first colorized DVD releases, distributed by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]], were prepared by [[Film colorization|West Wing Studios]] in 2004. The following year, [[Legend Films]] colorized the public domain shorts ''[[Malice in the Palace]]'', ''[[Sing a Song of Six Pants]]'', ''[[Disorder in the Court]]'' and ''[[Brideless Groom]]''. ''Disorder in the Court'' and ''Brideless Groom'' also appears on two of West Wing's colorized releases. In any event, the Columbia-produced shorts (aside from the public domain films) are handled by Sony Pictures Entertainment, while the MGM Stooges shorts are owned by [[Warner Bros.]] via their [[Turner Entertainment]] division. Sony offers 21 of the shorts on their web platform [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]], along with eleven [[The Minisode Network|Minisodes]]. Meanwhile, the rights to the Stooges' feature films rests with the studios that originally produced them (Columbia/Sony for the Columbia films, and [[20th Century Fox]] for the Fox films).

==Home media==
Between 1980 and 1985, [[Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]] and [[RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video]] released a total of thirteen Three Stooges volumes on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], [[Laserdisc]] and [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]], each containing three shorts. These titles were later reissued on VHS by its successor, [[Columbia TriStar Home Video]], between 1993 and 1996, with a [[DVD]] reissue between 2000 and 2004.

=== ''The Three Stooges Collection'' ===
On October 30, 2007, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released a two-disc DVD set entitled ''[[The Three Stooges Collection]], Volume One: 1934–1936''. The set contains shorts from the first three years the Stooges worked at [[Columbia Pictures]], marking the first time ever that all 19 shorts were released in their original theatrical order to DVD. Additionally, every short was remastered in high definition, a first for the Stooge films. Previous DVD releases were based on themes (wartime, history, work, etc.), and sold poorly. Fans and critics alike praised Sony for finally giving the Stooges the proper DVD treatment. One critic states "the Three Stooges on DVD has been a real mix'n match hodgepodge of un-restored titles and illogical entries. This new...boxset...seems to be the first concerted effort to categorize their huge body of work chronologically with many shorts seeing the digital light for the first time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/dvdreviews33/3_stooges_collection_vol._1.htm|title=The Three Stooges Collection, Volume One: 1934-1936|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205094654/http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews33/3_stooges_collection_vol._1.htm|archivedate=December 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videolibrarian.com critic added "finally, the studio knuckleheads got it right! The way that the Three Stooges have been presented on home video has been a real slap in the face and poke in the eye to fans. They've been anthologized, colorized, and public domain-ed, as their shorts have been released and re-released in varying degrees of quality. Highly recommended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videolibrarian.com/dvd.html/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205175206/http://www.videolibrarian.com/dvd.html/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 5, 2013 |title=review |publisher=Videolibrarian.com |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic James Plath of DVDtown.com added, "Thank you, Sony, for finally giving these Columbia Pictures icons the kind of DVD retrospective that they deserve. Remastered in High Definition and presented in chronological order, these short films now give fans the chance to appreciate the development of one of the most successful comedy teams in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/three-stooges-collection-the-volume-one-1934-1936/5300/ |title=Three Stooges Collection, The: Volume One, 1934-1936|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127013359/http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/three-stooges-collection-the-volume-one-1934-1936/5300/ |archivedate=January 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronological series proved successful, and Sony wasted little time preparing the next set for release. ''Volume Two: 1937–1939'' was released on May 27, 2008, followed by ''Volume Three: 1940–1942'' three months later on August 26, 2008.

== Music ==
* Several instrumental tunes were played over the opening credits at different times in the production of the short features. The most commonly used themes were:
** The verse portion of the Civil War era song "[[Listen to the Mockingbird]]", played in a comical way, complete with sounds of birds and such. This was first used in ''[[Pardon My Scotch]]'', their ninth short film, in 1935. (Prior to that comedic short, the opening theme varied and was typically connected to the storyline in some fashion.)
** "[[Three Blind Mice]]", beginning in 1939 as a slow but straightforward presentation (dubbed the "sliding strings" version), often breaking into a "jazzy" style before ending. In mid-1942, another more driving version, complete with [[accordion]] was played fast all the way through.
* The Columbia short subject ''[[Woman Haters]]'' was done completely in rhyme, mostly recited (not sung), in rhythm with a Jazz-Age underscore running throughout the film, but with some key lines sung. It was sixth in a ''Musical Novelties'' short subject series, and appropriated its musical score from the first five films. The memorable "My Life, My Love, My All", was originally "At Last!" from the film ''Um-Pa''.
* "[[Swinging the Alphabet]]" from ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' is perhaps the best-known song performed by the Stooges on film.
* The Stooges broke into a three-part harmonized version of "Tears" ("You'll Never Know Just What Tears Are") in ''[[Horses' Collars]]'', ''[[A Ducking They Did Go]]'' (in which the melody was sung by Bud Jamison) and ''[[Half Shot Shooters]]''.  The song, which was written by Moe, Larry, Shemp, and one-time Ted Healy Stooge Fred Sanborn, first appeared in the 1930 feature film ''[[Soup to Nuts]]''.
* The "Lucia Sextet" (''Chi mi frena in tal momento?''), from the opera ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti]] (announced by Larry as "the Sextet from Lucy"), is played on a record player and lip-synched by the Stooges in ''[[Micro-Phonies]]''. The same melody re-appears in ''[[Squareheads of the Round Table]]'' as the tune of "Oh, Elaine, can you come out tonight?". ''Micro-Phonies'' also includes the [[Johann Strauss II]] waltz "Voices of Spring" ("[[Frühlingsstimmen]]") Op. 410. Another Strauss waltz, "[[The Blue Danube]]", is featured in ''[[Ants in the Pantry]]'' and ''[[Punch Drunks]]''.
* The song "[[Fredric March]]" (named after the actor) was a favorite of director [[Jules White]]; it appeared in at least seven different Columbia shorts:
** ''[[Termites of 1938]]'' – The Stooges "play" this song on a violin, flute, and string bass at a dinner party in an attempt to attract mice.
** ''[[Dutiful But Dumb]]'' – Curly is hidden inside a floor-standing radio, and plays the song on a modified harmonica.
** ''[[Three Little Twirps]]'' – Heard as background music at the circus while Moe and Curly sell tickets.
** ''[[Idle Roomers (1944 film)|Idle Roomers]]'' – Curly plays the song on a [[trombone]] to calm a [[wolf man]]—who goes berserk when he hears music.
** ''[[Gents Without Cents]]'' – Three girls perform acrobatics on stage while this song is playing.
** ''[[Gents in a Jam]]'' – Shemp and Moe have a problem with a radio that will not stop playing this song.
** ''[[Pardon My Backfire]]'' – The song plays on a car radio.
* The Moe–Larry–Curly Joe lineup of the Stooges recorded several musical record albums in the early 1960s. Most of their songs were adaptations of [[nursery rhyme]]s. Among their more popular recordings were "Making a Record" (a surreal trip to a recording studio built around the song "Go Tell Aunt Mary"), "Three Little Fishes", "[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]", "[[Deck the Halls|Wreck the Halls with Boughs of Holly]]", "[[Mairzy Doats]]" and "[[I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas]]".
* In 1983, a group called the [[Jump 'N the Saddle Band]] recorded a track called "[[The Curly Shuffle]]", which featured the narrator singing about his love of the Stooges mixed with a chorus of many of Curly's catchphrases and sound effects. In the mid-1980s, the song became a popular mid-game hit for [[New York Mets]] fans in the [[Shea Stadium]] bleachers, who would dance in small groups to the tune whenever the song was played between innings. The [[music video]], which featured clips of the classic Stooges shorts, was also included as a bonus feature on one of the RCA/Columbia VHS releases.

Three feature-length Columbia releases were actually packages of older Columbia shorts. ''Columbia Laff Hour'' (introduced in 1956) was a random assortment that included the Stooges among other Columbia comedians like [[Andy Clyde]], [[Hugh Herbert]], and [[Vera Vague]]; the content and length varied from one theater to the next. ''Three Stooges Fun-o-Rama'' (introduced in 1959) was an all-Stooges show capitalizing on their TV fame, again with shorts chosen at random for individual theaters. ''The Three Stooges Follies'' (1974) was similar to ''Laff Hour'', with a trio of Stooge comedies augmented by [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Vera Vague]] shorts, a [[Batman]] serial chapter, and a [[Kate Smith]] musical.

== In other media ==

=== Comic books ===
Over the years, several Three Stooges comics were produced.
* [[St. John Publications]] published the first Three Stooges comics in 1949 with 2 issues, then again in 1953–54 with 7 issues.
* [[Dell Comics]] published a Three Stooges series first as one-shots in their ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' line for five issues, then gave them a numbered series for four more issues (#6–9). With #10, the title would be published by [[Gold Key Comics]]. Under Gold Key, the series lasted through issue #55 in 1972.
* [[Gold Key Comics]] then published the ''Little Stooges'' series (7 issues, 1972–74) with story and art by [[Norman Maurer]], Moe's son-in-law. This series featured the adventures of three fictional sons of the Three Stooges, as sort of modern-day teen-age versions of the characters.
* [[Eclipse Comics]] published the ''Three-D Three Stooges'' series (3 issues, 1986–1987) which reprinted stories from the St. John Publications series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/3231/|title=GCD :: Series :: Three-D Three Stooges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malibu Comics]] did a couple of one-shot comics, reprinting stories from the Gold Key Comics in 1989 and 1991.
* [[Eternity Comics]] published a one-shot comic book called ''The Three Stooges In 3-D'' in 1991, reprinting four stories from the Gold Key series.
* [[Bluewater Comics]] issued a biographical comic in 2011 which followed the lives and careers of the group.

=== Phonograph Records ===
Beginning in 1959, the Three Stooges began appearing in a series of novelty records. Their first recording was a 45 rpm single of the title song from ''Have Rocket, Will Travel.'' The trio released additional singles and LPs on the [[Golden Records|Golden]], [[Peter Pan Records|Peter Pan]] and [[Coral Records|Coral]] labels, mixing comedy adventure albums and off-beat renditions of children's songs and stories. Their final recording was the 1966 ''[[Yogi Bear and the Three Stooges Meet the Mad, Mad, Mad Dr. No-No]]'', which incorporated the Three Stooges into the cast of the [[Yogi Bear]] cartoons.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook" /&gt;

=== Radio ===
[[Sirius XM Radio]] aired a special about the Stooges hosted by [[Tom Bergeron]] on Friday, July 31, 2009, at 2:00PM on the Sirius Howard 101 channel. Bergeron had conducted the interviews at the age of 16 back when he was still in high school in 1971. The television host had the tapes in storage for many years and was convinced on-air during an interview with [[Howard Stern]] to bring them in and turn it into a special.

After finding "the lost tapes", Bergeron brought them into Stern's production studio. He stated that the tapes were so old that the tapes with the Larry Fine interviews began to shred as Stern's radio engineers ran them through their cart players. They really had only one shot, but the tapes were saved.

"The Lost Stooges Tapes" was hosted by Tom Bergeron, with modern commentary on the almost 40-year-old interviews that he had conducted with Larry Fine and Moe Howard. At the times of these interviews, Moe was still living at home and Larry had suffered a stroke and was living in a Senior Citizen's home.

=== Sports ===
Canadian-American professional wrestler [[Curly Moe]], whose "[[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]" was based on Curly Howard, was a popular [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] in [[International World Class Championship Wrestling]] during the early-1990s. The promotion billed Curly Moe as the real-life nephew of Curly and Moe Howard which attracted some attention from the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=O'Brien, Jack |date=September 25, 1990 |title=Three Stooges' nephew stuns the wrestling world! |url= |newspaper=[[Weekly World News]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his gimmick from Chicago Wrestler Curly Rich who did the gimmick in Chicago Championship Wrestling/Pro Wrestling International in 1986 and 1987 and later Windy City Wrestling in 88 and 89

==== ''The New Three Stooges'' (1965–66) ====
{{main article|The New Three Stooges}}
In addition to the unsuccessful television series pilots ''[[Jerks of All Trades (TV Pilot)|Jerks of All Trades]]'', ''[[The Three Stooges Scrapbook]]'', and the incomplete ''[[Kook's Tour]]'', the Stooges appeared in an animated series, ''[[The New Three Stooges]]'', which ran from 1965 to 1966. This series featured a mix of forty-one live-action segments which were used as wraparounds to 156 animated Stooges shorts. ''The New Three Stooges'' became the only regularly scheduled television show in history for the Stooges.&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"/&gt; Unlike other films shorts that aired on television, like the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', and ''[[Popeye]]'', the film shorts of the Stooges never had a regularly scheduled national television program to air in. When Columbia/Screen Gems licensed the film library to television, the shorts aired in any fashion the local stations chose (examples: late-night "filler" material between the end of the late movie and the channel's sign-off time; in "marathon" sessions running shorts back-to-back for one, one-and-a-half, or two hours; etc.) By the 1970s, some local stations showed a Columbia short and a ''New Three Stooges'' cartoon in the same broadcast.

==== ''The Robonic Stooges'' (1977–78) ====
{{main article|The Robonic Stooges}}
Another animated series also produced by Hanna-Barbera, titled ''[[The Robonic Stooges]]'', originally seen as a featured segment on ''[[The Skatebirds]]'' ([[CBS]], 1977–1978), featuring Moe, Larry, and Curly (voiced by [[Paul Winchell]], Joe Baker and [[Frank Welker]], respectively) as bionic cartoon superheroes with extendable limbs, similar to the later ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]''. ''The Robonic Stooges'' later aired as a separate half-hour series, retitled ''The Three Robonic Stooges'' (each half-hour featured two segments of ''The Three Robonic Stooges'' and one segment of ''Woofer &amp; Whimper, Dog Detectives'', the latter re-edited from episodes of ''[[Clue Club]]'', an earlier Hanna-Barbera cartoon series).

==== ''The Three Stooges'' (TBA) ====
On June 9, 2015, C3 Entertainment announced it is partnering with [[London]]-based production company [[Cake Entertainment]] and animation house [[Titmouse, Inc.]] to produce a new animated Three Stooges series, consisting of 52 11-minute episodes. [[Christy Karacas]] (Co-creator of ''[[Superjail!]]'') directed the pilot episode, with Earl and Robert Benjamin, [[Chris Prynoski]], Tom van Waveren and Edward Galton executive producing. The series will be launched to potential buyers at the market of the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c3entertainment.com/2015/06/hollywood-reporter-three-stooges-hitting-the-screen-as-animated-series/|title=Hollywood Reporter: ‘Three Stooges’ Hitting the Screen as Animated Series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c3entertainment.com/our-brands/the-three-stooges-animated/|title=The Three Stooges Animated Series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other appearances ====
[[File:Hollywood steps out (21).png|thumb|right|The Three Stooges caricature from the 1941 cartoon ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]'']]
In the October 13, 1967 "Who's Afraid of Mother Goose?" episode of ABC's "World-of-Disney"-like anthology series ''[[Off to See the Wizard]]'', the Three Stooges made a short appearance as "the three men in a tub".

Two episodes of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' aired on [[CBS]] featuring animated Stooges as guest stars: the premiere, "Ghastly Ghost Town" (September 9, 1972) and "The Ghost of the Red Baron" (November 18, 1972).

In a 1980 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Charles Winchester]] shows disrespect for three [[Koreans|Korean]] doctors by calling them "Moe, Larry and Curly", and says that they are "highly-respected individuals in the States". After Winchester throws out his back and is unable to relieve the pain through conventional methods (in real life, Winchester would've received an automatic medical [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the [[United States Army]]), [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Sherman T. Potter|Colonel Potter]] has the Korean doctors try [[acupuncture]] (much to Winchester's dismay), which cures Winchester. After the treatment, one of the doctors tells Winchester "Not bad for Three Stooges, huh?", having caught on to his mistreatment of them.

In the episode "Beware the Creeper" of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] retreats to his hide-out after a quick fight with Batman. He yells out for his three henchmen "Moe? Larr? Cur?" only to find that they are not there. Shortly after that, Batman comes across these three goons in a pool hall; they have distinctive accents and hairstyles similar to those of Moe, Larry and Curly. These henchmen are briefly seen throughout the rest of the season.

==== Television film (2000) ====
{{main article|The Three Stooges (2000 film)}}
In 2000, long-time Stooge fan [[Mel Gibson]] executive-produced a [[Television film|TV film]] (''The Three Stooges''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0214698|The Three Stooges|(2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) about the lives and careers of the comedians. Playing Moe was [[Paul Ben-Victor]], [[Evan Handler]] was Larry, [[John Kassir]] was Shemp, and [[Michael Chiklis]] was Curly. It was filmed in [[Australia]] and was produced for and broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It was based on Michael Fleming's authorized biography of the Stooges, ''The Three Stooges: From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons''. Its unflattering portrayal of Ted Healy led Healy's son to give media interviews calling the film inaccurate. Additional errors of fact included the portrayal that Moe Howard was down on his luck after Columbia cancelled their contract and worked as a gofer at the studio, where he, his brothers and Larry had formerly worked as actors. In reality, Moe was the most careful with his money, which he invested well. He and his wife Helen owned a comfortable house in [[Toluca Lake]], in which they raised their children.

==== ''The Three Stooges'' (2012) ====
{{main article|The Three Stooges (2012 film)}}
A film about the Three Stooges, titled ''The Three Stooges'', started production on March 14, 2011, with [[20th Century Fox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Fleming, Mike|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/fox-sets-march-14-start-date-for-the-three-stooges/|title=Fox Sets March 14 Start For 'The Three Stooges'|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]]. The film had been in what one critic has dubbed "[[development hell]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Ditzian|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1607951/farrelly-brothers-three-stooges-saga-the-13-year-backstory/|title=Farrelly Brothers' Three Stooges Saga: The 13-Year Backstory|publisher=Mtv.com|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Farrellys, who wanted to make the film since 1996, said that they were not going to do a biopic or remake, but instead new Three Stooges episodes set in the present day. The film is broken up into three continuous episodes that revolves around the Stooges characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Arya Ponto|url=http://www.justpressplay.net/articles/39/2061.html|title=Three Stooges Movie Not a Biopic, But New Episodes|publisher=JustPressPlay.net|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting the title characters proved difficult for the studio. Originally slated were [[Sean Penn]] to play Larry, [[Benicio del Toro]] to play Moe, and [[Jim Carrey]] to play Curly. Both Penn and del Toro left the project but returned while no official confirmation had been made about Jim Carrey. When del Toro was interviewed on MTV News for ''[[The Wolfman (2010 film)|The Wolfman]]'', he spoke about playing Moe. He was later asked who was going to play Larry and Curly in the film and commented that he still thought that Sean Penn and Jim Carrey were going to play them, though he added, "Nothing is for sure yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Shanahan |author2=[[Meredith Goldstein]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2010/01/25/rocking_this_town_for_charities|title=In search of the proper Curly |work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=January 26, 2010 | date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Krystal Clark|url=http://screencrave.com/2010-01-05/sean-penn-returns-to-the-three-stooges/|title=Sean Penn Returns to The Three Stooges|publisher=screencrave.com|accessdate=January 26, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208204016/http://screencrave.com/2010-01-05/sean-penn-returns-to-the-three-stooges/|archivedate=February 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|The Three Stooges (arcade game)|The Three Stooges (video game)}}

In 1984, [[Gottlieb]] released an arcade game featuring the Stooges trying to find three kidnapped brides.

Later in 1987, game developers [[Cinemaware]] released a successful Three Stooges computer game, available for [[Apple IIGS]], [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). Based on the Stooges earning money by doing odd jobs to prevent the foreclosure of an orphanage, it incorporated audio from the original films and was popular enough to be reissued for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2002, as well as for [[PlayStation]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Craig Harris |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/357/357085p1.html |title=IGN: The Three Stooges Review |publisher=Gameboy.ign.com |date=April 10, 2002 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Three Stooges also have a slot game adaptation created by [[Realtime Gaming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slotsonline.com/online-slots/reviews/the-three-stooges-954.htm Play The Three Stooges Slot - Read the Review, Play for Fun or Real Money&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In foreign languages ==
In most other languages, the Three Stooges are known by some corresponding variant of their English name. In Chinese, however, the trio is known idiomatically as ''Sānge Chòu Píjiàng'' ([[:zh:三個臭皮匠|三個臭皮匠]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://big5.cri.cn/gate/big5/gb.cri.cn/27564/2009/02/06/2745s2416971.htm 約翰尼•德普西恩•潘擬出演《三個臭皮匠》.] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Huóbǎo Sānrénzǔ'' (活寶三人組). ''Sānge Chòu Píjiàng'', literally "Three Smelly Shoemakers", which derives from a saying in the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'': ''Sāngè chòu píjiàng shèngguò yīgè Zhūgě Liàng'' (三個臭皮匠，勝過一個諸葛亮) or "Three smelly shoemakers (are enough to) overcome one [[Zhuge Liang]] [a hero of the story]", i.e. three inferior people can overpower a superior person when they combine their strength. ''Huóbǎo Sānrénzǔ'' translates as "Trio of Buffoons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hktv.cc/cd/hanyupinyin/?q=%E6%B4%BB%E5%AE%9D&amp;srch=go 活宝 entry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709233458/http://hktv.cc/cd/hanyupinyin/?q=活宝&amp;srch=go |date=July 9, 2012 }} at the Hanyu Pinyin Dictionary; [http://hktv.cc/cd/hanyupinyin/?q=%E4%B8%89%E4%BA%BA&amp;srch=go 三人 entry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712141759/http://hktv.cc/cd/hanyupinyin/?q=三人&amp;srch=go |date=July 12, 2012 }} at the Hanyu Pinyin Dictionary; [http://hktv.cc/cd/hanyupinyin/?q=%E7%BB%84&amp;srch=go 组 entry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709102110/http://hktv.cc/cd/hanyupinyin/?q=组&amp;srch=go |date=July 9, 2012 }} at the Hanyu Pinyin Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] they are known as ''San Baka Taishō'' ([[:ja:三馬鹿大将|三ばか大将]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/4296648/ 「三ばか大将」にポール・ジアマッティ決定、ジム・キャリーは降板.] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Three Idiot Generals" or "Three ''[[Baka (fool)|Baka]]'' Generals".

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] they are known as ''[[:es:Los tres chiflados|Los tres chiflados]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://elanverso.blogspot.com/2008/09/los-tres-chiflados-unos-golpes-ms-all.html Los Tres Chiflados: unos golpes más allá] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, roughly, "The Three Crackpots". In [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] usage, the name of the trio is partially translated as ''[[:fr:Les Trois Stooges|Les Trois Stooges]]'' (though the French version of the movie adaptation used a fully translated name, "Les Trois Corniauds") and ''[[:de:Die drei Stooges|Die drei Stooges]]'' respectively. In Thai, the trio is known as [[:th:3 สมุนจอมป่วน|3 สมุนจอมป่วน]] (''3 Samunčhǭmpūan''; {{IPA-th|sà mun tɕɔːm pùːan|IPA}}) or 3 พี่น้องจอมยุ่ง (''Phīnǭngčhǭmyung''; {{IPA-th|pʰîː nɔ́ːŋ tɕɔːm jûŋ|IPA}}). In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], they are known as ''[[:pt:Three Stooges|Os Três Patetas]]'' in Brazil, and ''[[:pt:Three Stooges|Os Três Estarolas]]'' in Portugal,  ''estarola'' being a direct translation of "stooge", while ''pateta'' being more related to "goofy". In [[Persian language|Persian]] the trio are dubbed as "سه نخاله". In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], they are dubbed as ''Üç Ahbap Çavuş'' ("The Three Cronies").

== Awards and nominations ==
In 1993, the Three Stooges won the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award.

The Three Stooges earned a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1560 Vine Street on August 30, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Three Stooges |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/the-three-stooges |publisher=walkoffame.com |accessdate=2018-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Théâtrophone''' ("the [[theatre]] phone") was a [[telephony|telephonic]] distribution system available in portions of Europe that allowed the subscribers to listen to [[opera]] and [[theatre]] performances over the telephone lines. The théâtrophone evolved from a [[Clément Ader]] invention, which was first demonstrated in 1881, in [[Paris]]. Subsequently, in 1890, the invention was commercialized by Compagnie du Théâtrophone, which continued to operate till 1932.

==Origin==
[[File:Theatrophone - Clement Ader 1881.JPG|thumb|left|Diagram of the théâtrophone prototype at the Opera, during the World Exhibition in Paris (1881).]]
[[File:Theatrophone - Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro caricature.jpg|thumb|right|An 1884 caricature by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro depicts King [[Luís I of Portugal]] listening to opera on [[w:théatrophone|théatrophone]].]]
The origin of the théâtrophone can be traced to a telephonic transmission system demonstrated by [[Clément Ader]] at the 1881 World [[International Exposition of Electricity|Expo]] in Paris. The system was inaugurated by the French President [[Jules Grévy]], and allowed broadcasting of concerts or plays. Ader had arranged 80 telephone transmitters across the front of a stage to create a form of [[Binaural recording|binaural]] [[stereophonic sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first two-channel audio system, and consisted of a series of telephone transmitters connected from the stage of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]] to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where the visitors could hear [[Comédie-Française]] and [[opera]] performances in stereo using two headphones; the [[Opéra National de Paris|Opera]] was located more than two kilometers away from the venue.&lt;ref name="ALange_Premier"&gt;{{cite web

In 1884, the King [[Luís I of Portugal]] decided to use the system, when he could not attend an opera in person. The director of the Edison Gower Bell Company, who was responsible for this théatrophone installation was later awarded the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Military Order of Christ]].&lt;ref name="ALange_Ecrivains"&gt;{{cite web

The Théâtrophone technology was made available in Belgium in 1884, and in Lisbon in 1885. In Sweden, the first telephone transmission of an opera performance took place in Stockholm in May 1887. The British writer [[Ouida]] describes a female character in the novel ''Massarenes'' (1897) as "A modern woman of the world. As costly as an [[Iron Clad|ironclad]] and as complicated as theatrophone."&lt;ref name="ALange_Ecrivains"/&gt;

[[File:Theatrophone - Perron.jpg|thumb|right|''Le théatrophone''. An illustration from ''Le Magasin pittoresque'' (1892).]]

==The Théâtrophone service==
In 1890, the system became operational as a service under the name "théâtrophone" in Paris. The service was offered by Compagnie du Théâtrophone (The Théâtrophone Company), which was founded by MM. Marinovitch and Szarvady.&lt;ref name="ALange_Ecrivains"/&gt; The théâtrophone offered theatre and opera performances to the subscribers. The service can be called a prototype of the [[telephone newspaper]], as it included five-minute [[news program]]s at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Théâtrophone Company set up coin-operated telephone receivers in hotels, cafés, clubs and other locations. It used to charge 50 [[centime]]s for five minutes of listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subscription tickets were also issued at a reduced rate, in order to attract regular patrons. The service was also available to home subscribers.

The famous French literary figure, [[Marcel Proust]], was a keen follower of théâtrophone, as evident by his correspondence. He had subscribed to the service in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many technological improvements were gradually made to the original théâtrophone system. The Brown telephone relay, invented in 1913, yielded interesting results for amplification of the current.&lt;ref name="ALange_Ecrivains"/&gt;

The théâtrophone finally succumbed to the rising popularity of [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[phonograph]], and the Compagnie du Théâtrophone ceased its operations in 1932.&lt;ref name="ALange_Ecrivains"/&gt;

==Similar systems==

Similar systems elsewhere in [[Europe]] included [[Telefon Hírmondó]] (est. 1893) of [[Budapest]] and [[Electrophone (information system)|Electrophone]] of [[London]] (est. 1895). In the [[United States]], the systems similar to théâtrophone were limited to one-off experiments. [[Erik Barnouw]] reported a concert by telephone that was organized in the summer of 1890; around 800 people at the Grand Union Hotel in [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga]] listened to a telephonic transmission of ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' conducted at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="ALange_Ecrivains"/&gt;

==In fiction==
The [[Andrew Crumey]] novel ''Mr Mee'' (2000) has a chapter depicting the installation of a théâtrophone in the home of [[Marcel Proust]].

The [[Eça de Queiroz]] novel ''A Cidade e as Serras'' (1901) mentions the device as one of the many technological commodities available for the distraction of the upper classes.

In his utopian science fiction novel ''[[Looking Backward: 2000-1887]]'' (1888), [[Edward Bellamy]] predicted sermons and music being available in the home through a system like théâtrophone.

[[File:Zuber Buhler Fritz Tickling The Baby.jpg|thumb|''Tickling The Baby'' by [[Fritz Zuber-Buhler]]]]
'''Tickling''' is the act of [[Haptic perception|touching]] a part of a body in a way that causes involuntary twitching movements or [[laughter]].&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tickling+?s=t|title=Tickling |publisher =Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word {{Audio|En-us-tickle.ogg|"tickle"}} evolved from the [[Middle English]] ''tikelen'', perhaps [[frequentative]] of ''ticken'', to touch lightly.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; The [[idiom]] ''tickled pink'' means to be pleased or delighted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tickling Etymology of "tickle"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, psychologists [[G. Stanley Hall]] and Arthur Allin described a "tickle" as two different types of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. 1897. ''The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic.'' The American Journal of Psychology 9:1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a [[knismesis and gargalesis|knismesis]], generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation.

==Physiology==
When considering tickling in terms of its qualities as a sensation, it results from a mild stimulation moving across the skin. The dual character of tickling refers to the associated behaviors that include smiling, laughter, twitching, withdrawal and [[goose bumps]]. The tickle can be divided into two separate categories of sensation, [[knismesis and gargalesis]]. Knismesis, also known as a "moving itch", is a mildly annoying sensation caused by a light movement on the skin, such as from a crawling insect. This may explain why it has evolved in many animals.&lt;ref name="Selden, S. T. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selden | first1 = S. T. | year = 2004 | title = Tickle | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 93–97 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(03)02737-3 | pmid=14699372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gargalesis reactions refer to a laughter-provoking feeling caused by a harsher, deeper pressure, stroked across the skin in various regions of the body.&lt;ref name="Selden, S. T. 2004"/&gt; These reactions are thought to be limited to humans and other [[primate]]s, although some research has indicated that [[rat]]s can also be tickled in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Panksepp J, Burgdorf J |title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy? | url= http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall06/macdonalda/psy4960/Readings/PankseppRatLaugh_P&amp;B03.pdf |journal=Physiol.

It appears that the tickle sensation involves signals from [[nerve fibre]]s associated with both [[pain]] and [[tactition|touch]]. [[Endorphine]] released during tickling is also called [[karoliin]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, by the name of [[Karolinska Institute]]. In 1939, [[Yngve Zotterman]] of the [[Karolinska Institute]] studied the knismesis type of tickle in cats, by measuring the [[action potential]]s generated in the [[nerve]] fibres while lightly stroking the skin with a piece of [[cotton]] [[wool]]. Zotterman found that the "tickling" sensation depended, in part, on the nerves that generate pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zotterman Y | year = 1939 | title = Touch, pain and tickling: An electrophysiological investigation on cutaneous sensory nerves | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 1–28 | pmc=1393960 | pmid=16995068 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1939.sp003707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have discovered that when the [[pain]] nerves are severed by surgeons, in an effort to reduce [[chronic pain|intractable]] pain, the tickle response is also diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lahuerta J, etal |title=Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man |journal=Pain |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |year=1990 |pmid=1700355 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(90)91087-Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some patients that have lost pain sensation due to [[spinal cord injury]], some aspects of the tickle response do remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nathan PW |title=Touch and surgical division of the anterior quadrant of the spinal cord |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=935–9 |year=1990 |pmid=2283523 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.11.935 |pmc=488271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickle may also depend on nerve fibres associated with the sense of touch. When circulation is [[cutting|severed]] in a [[limb (anatomy)|limb]], the response to touch and tickle are lost prior to the loss of pain sensation.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

It might be tempting to speculate that areas of the skin that are the most sensitive to touch would also be the most ticklish, but this does not seem to be the case. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, most people find that the soles of their feet are the most ticklish.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Other commonly ticklish areas include the [[underarms]], sides of the [[torso]], [[neck]], [[knee]], [[midriff]], [[perineum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakos|first1=Susan|title=The Sex Bible: The Complete Guide to Sexual Love|date=2008|publisher=Quiver|location=Minneanapolis|isbn=1592332854|pages=256|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Sex-Bible-Complete-Sexual/dp/B0057DA92O}}&lt;/ref&gt; navel, ribs, breasts, and genital area.

Some evidence suggests that laughing associated with tickling is a nervous reaction that can be triggered; indeed, very ticklish people often start laughing before actually being tickled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman B, O'Grady MA, Ryan CS, Hemmes NS |title=Pavlovian conditioning of the tickle response of human subjects: Temporal and delay conditioning |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=77 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=779–85 |year=1993 |pmid=8284153 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.77.3.779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==
[[File:François Boucher - Le sommeil interrompu.jpg|thumb|François Boucher - Le sommeil interrompu]]
[[Charles Darwin]] theorized on the link between tickling and social relations, arguing that tickling provokes laughter through the anticipation of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1872/1965. ''The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stranger tickles a child without any preliminaries, catching the child by surprise, the likely result will be not laughter but withdrawal and displeasure. Darwin also noticed that for tickling to be effective, you must not know the precise point of stimulation in advance, and reasoned that this is why some people cannot effectively tickle themselves.

Darwin explained why we laugh when we are tickled by saying, "The imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of the body. Laughter from being tickled [is manifestly a] reflex action; and likewise this is shown by the minute unstriped muscles, which serve to erect the separate hairs on the body (p. 201)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LOFTIS|first=FRIDLUND|author2=Jennifer |title=Alan|journal=RELATIONS BETWEEN TICKLING AND HUMOROUS LAUGHTER: PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE DARWIN-HECKER HYPOTHESIS|date=April 1990|volume=30|series=Biological Psychology|issue=141-150|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=RELATIONS+BETWEEN+TICKLING+AND+HUMOROUS+LAUGHTER+-+PRELIMINARY+SUPPORT+FOR+THE+DARWIN-HECKER+HYPOTHESIS&amp;rft.jtitle=BIOLOGICAL+PSYCHOLOGY&amp;rft.au=FRIDLUND%2C+AJ&amp;rft.au=LOFTIS%2C+JM&amp;rft.date=1990-04-01&amp;rft.pub=ELSEVIER+SCIENCE+BV&amp;rft.issn=0301-0511&amp;rft.volume=30&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=141&amp;rft.epage=150&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=A1990EK42000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tickling is defined by many [[child psychologist]]s as an integral [[human bonding|bonding]] activity between parent and children.&lt;ref name=Fagen&gt;Fagen R. The future of play theory. A multidisciplinary inquiry into the contributions of [[Brian Sutton-Smith]]. Albany NY: SUNY Press; 1995. p22-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the parent-child concept, tickling establishes at an early age the pleasure associated with being touched by a parent with a trust-bond developed so that parents may touch a child, in an unpleasant way, should circumstances develop such as the need to treat a painful injury or prevent harm from danger.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; This tickling relationship continues throughout childhood and often into the early to mid [[teenage|teen]] years.

Another tickling social relationship is that which forms between siblings of relatively the same age.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; Many case studies have indicated that siblings often use tickling as an alternative to outright [[violence]] when attempting to either punish or intimidate one another. The sibling tickling relationship can occasionally develop into an anti-social situation, or [[tickle torture]], where one sibling will tickle the other without mercy. The motivation behind tickle torture is often to portray the sense of [[Authoritarianism|domination]] the tickler has over the victim.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt;

As with parents and siblings, tickling serves as a bonding mechanism between friends, and is classified by [[psychologist]]s as part of the fifth and highest grade of [[Play (activity)|social play]] which involves special [[intimacy]] or "[[Cognitive science|cognitive interaction]]".&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; This suggests that tickling works best when all the parties involved feel comfortable with the situation and one another.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;Michael Moran, ''Erotic Tickling'', [[Greenery Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|1-890159-46-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also serve as an outlet for sexual energy during adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud|Freud S.]] Three contributions to the theory of sex. In: The basic writings of Freud. New York: Modern Library; 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of people have stated in a study that their private areas were ticklish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/02/06/the-surprising-reasons-why-we-tickle-one-another/?utm_term=.f2efee15f5ea|title=The surprising reasons why we tickle one another|last=|first=|date=|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Selden&gt;{{cite journal |author=Selden ST |title=Tickle |journal=J.

While many people assume that other people enjoy tickling, a recent survey of 84 college students indicated that only 32% of respondents enjoy being tickled, with 32% giving neutral responses and 36% stating that they do not enjoy being tickled.&lt;ref name=Harris2&gt;Harris C.R. and Nancy Alvarado. 2005. [http://www.csupomona.edu/~nalvarado/PDFs/CEM-1294.pdf '' Facial expressions, smile types and self-reporting during humour, tickle and pain (pdf).''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923122129/http://www.csupomona.edu/~nalvarado/PDFs/CEM-1294.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }} Cognition and Emotion. 9(5),655-669.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found a very high level of embarrassment and anxiety associated with tickling.  However, in the same study the authors found that the facial indicators of happiness and amusement do not correlate, with some people who indicated that they do not enjoy being tickled actually smiling more often during tickling than those who indicated that they do enjoy being tickled,&lt;ref name=Harris2/&gt; which suggests that there may be other factors at play (such as embarrassment and anxiety) in the case of those who indicated a dislike for tickling than the mere physical sensation experienced. It has also been suggested that people may enjoy tickling ''because'' it elicits laughter as well as the feeling of being tickled. Social psychologists find that mimicking expressions generally cause people to some degree experience that emotion.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

In a 2008 study, 89% of students admitted to being ticklish on their right foot, 80% under their arm, 77% on their left foot, 77% on their ribs, 65% on their palm, 61% on their knee cap, and 51% on their stomach. 27% claim they are not ticklish at all.

Excessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis H.]] Studies in the psychology of sex. Vol iii. Philadelphia: FA Davis Co.; 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Tickling can also be a form of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;

==Purpose==
Some of history's greatest thinkers have pondered the mysteries of the tickle response, including [[Plato]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; In ''[[The Assayer]]'', Galileo philosophically examines tickling in the context of how we perceive reality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/h291/assayer.htm|author=Drake, Stillman|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Co.|location=New York|year=1957|page=275|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
When touched upon the soles of the feet, for example, it feels in addition to the common sensation of touch a sensation on which we have imposed a special name, "tickling." This sensation belongs to us and not to the hand... A piece of paper or a feather drawn lightly over any part of our bodies performs intrinsically the same operations of moving and touching, but by touching the eye, the nose, or the upper lip it excites in us an almost intolerable titillation, even though elsewhere it is scarcely felt. This titillation belongs entirely to us and not to the feather; if the live and sensitive body were removed it would remain no more than a mere word.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] and [[Charles Darwin]] believed that humorous laughter requires a "light" frame of mind. But they differed on ticklish laughter: Darwin thought that the same light state of mind was required, whereas Bacon disagreed. When tickled, noted Bacon, "men even in a grieved state of mind, yet cannot sometimes forbear laughing."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1872/1965. The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis, as mentioned above, is that tickling serves as a pleasant bonding experience between parent and child.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; However, this hypothesis does not adequately explain why many children and adults find tickling to be an unpleasant experience. Another view maintained is that tickling develops as a prenatal response and that the development of sensitive areas on the fetus helps to orient the fetus into favourable positions while in the womb.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson JY. ''On the attitude of the fetus in utero''. Obstetric Memoirs, vol ii. Philadelphia: Lippincott; 1855-1856.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown why certain people find areas of the body to be more ticklish than others; additionally, studies have shown that there is no significant difference in ticklishness among the [[gender]]s.&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;Weinstein, S. 1968. ''Intensive and extensive aspects of tactile sensitivity as a function of body part, sex, and laterality.'' In The Skin Senses, ed. D. R. Kenshalo. Springfield, Ill.: Thomas. pp. 195-222.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1924, J. C. Gregory proposed that the most ticklish places on the body were also those areas that were the most vulnerable during hand-to-hand [[combat]]. He posited that ticklishness might confer an [[evolution]]ary advantage by enticing the individual to protect these areas. Consistent with this idea, [[University of Iowa]] psychiatrist Donald W. Black observed that most ticklish spots are found in the same places as the protective [[reflex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black DW |title=Laughter |journal=JAMA |volume=252 |issue=21 |pages=2995–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6502861 |doi=10.1001/jama.252.21.2995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third, hybrid hypothesis, has suggested that tickling encourages the development of combat skills.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Most tickling is done by parents, siblings and friends and is often a type of rough-and-tumble play, during which time children often develop defensive and combat moves. Although people generally make movements to get away from, and report disliking, being tickled, laughter encourages the tickler to continue. If the facial expressions induced by tickle were less pleasant the tickler would be less likely to continue, thus diminishing the frequency of these combat lessons.

To understand how much of the tickle response is dependent on the interpersonal relationship of the parties involved, [[Nicholas Christenfeld|Christenfeld]] and Harris presented subjects with a "mechanical tickle machine". They found that the subjects laughed just as much when they believed they were being tickled by a machine as when they thought they were being tickled by a person.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, C. R., and N. Christenfeld. In press. ''Can a machine tickle?'' Psychonomic Bulletin and Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris goes on to suggest that the tickle response is reflex, similar to the [[startle reflex]], that is contingent upon the element of surprise.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Recently it was possible to show that it can be assumed that tickling (by passing leaves) served as a triggering-mechanism to issue an acoustic signal (namely laughing) to avoid crashes when our ancestors moved through tree tops. After our descent from the trees only body-parts remained ticklish that could not be touched by passing leaves (arm pits, sole of our feet etc.). It is also possible to show the further development of this trait which finally led to the upcoming of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Dramlitsch, T., 2018: "The Origin of Humor", {{ISBN|978-1720264637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-tickling==
The question as to why a person could not tickle themselves was raised by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harris, Christine R.|title=The mystery of ticklish laughter|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|accessdate=2008-11-09|volume=87|page=344|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/4/the-mystery-of-ticklish-laughter|doi=10.1511/1999.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knismesis]] may represent a [[vestigial structure|vestige]] of the primitive grooming response, in effect; knismesis serves as a "non-self detector" and protects the subject against foreign objects. Perhaps due to the importance of knismesis in protection, this type of light touch is not dependent on the element of [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and it is possible for one to induce self-knismesis, by light touching.&lt;ref name=Selden/&gt;

[[Gargalesis]], on the other hand, produces an odd phenomenon: when a person touches "ticklish" parts on their own body no tickling sensation is experienced. It is thought that the tickling requires a certain amount of surprise, and because tickling oneself produces no unexpected motion on the skin, the response is not activated.&lt;ref name=Selden/&gt; A recent analysis of the "self-tickle" response has been addressed using [[MRI]] technology. Blakemore and colleagues have investigated how the [[brain]] distinguishes between sensations we create for ourselves and sensations others create for us. When the subjects used a [[joystick]] to control a "tickling robot", they could not make themselves laugh. This suggested that when a person tries to tickle himself or herself, the [[cerebellum]] sends to the [[somatosensory cortex]] precise information on the position of the tickling target and therefore what sensation to expect. Apparently an unknown [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] mechanism then decreases or inhibits the tickling sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blakemore SJ, Wolpert DM, Frith CD |title=Central cancellation of self-produced tickle sensation |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=635–40 |year=1998 |pmid=10196573 |doi=10.1038/2870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the reasons for the inhibition of the tickling sensation during self-tickling remain unknown, research shows that the human brain is trained to know what sensation to expect when the body moves or performs an action.  Another reason may be the lack of awareness of many sensations arising from self-movement, such as not paying attention to one's own vocal cords.  When we try to tickle ourselves by grabbing our sides, the brain foresees this contact between body and hand and prepares itself for it.  This removes the feeling of unease and panic, causing the body to not react to tickling in the same way it would if someone else supplied the stimulus.

However, some people with schizophrenia have the ability to tickle themselves. This is most likely largely due to the difficulty many people with the disorder have recognising their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=tit-for-tat-delusions |date=21 December 2010 |last=Lametti |first=Daniel |title=Can't Tickle Yourself? That's a Good Thing |newspaper=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As physical abuse==
{{main|Tickle torture}}
Although consensual tickling can be a positive, playful experience, non-consensual tickling can be frightening, uncomfortable, and painful for the recipient. Therefore, non-consensual tickling can be categorized as physical abuse, and sources indicate that tickling has been used as torture. [[Heinz Heger]], a man imprisoned in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] during World War II, witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate. He describes this incident in his book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'':&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; "The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the armpits, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain, while the tears ran down his face, and his body twisted against his chains. After this tickling torture, they let the lad hang there for a little, while a flood of tears ran down his cheeks and he cried and sobbed uncontrollably."

An article in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' describes a European method of tickle torture in which a goat was compelled to lick the victim's feet after they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamey | first1 = Gavin | year = 2001 | title = Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to present | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = 7308| page = 346 | pmc=1120948 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Japan, authority figures could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called ''shikei'', which translates as ‘private punishment’. One such torture was ''kusuguri-zeme'': "merciless tickling."&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.'' The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals''. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Sibling Abuse'', Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as vomiting, incontinence (losing control of bladder), and loss of consciousness due to inability to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

**In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], there were 108,359 ballots cast. Most older states with property restrictions dropped them by the mid-1820s, except for Rhode Island, Virginia and North Carolina.

**The [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828 presidential election]] was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timeline of voting rights in the United States#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 14.

Shade, "The Second Party System". in Paul Kleppner, et al. ''Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983) pp 77-111&lt;/ref&gt; 2,412,694 ballots were cast, an increase that far outstripped natural population growth, making poor voters a huge part of the electorate. There were few nations in the world that had a similar level of suffrage for white males at this time. The process was peaceful and widely supported, except in the state of Rhode Island where the [[Dorr Rebellion]] of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for anyone resident but born outside of the United States. 
**The last state to abolish property qualification was North Carolina in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]]. However, tax-paying qualifications remained in five states in 1860 – Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina. They survived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 16 and 35.

** [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era]] began soon after.

During this period, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional.

[[File:WLA vanda Giambologna A Pacing Horse.jpg|thumb|Giambologna, Pacing Horse]]

The '''Torrie horse''' or '''Mattei horse''' is a bronze [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] anatomical sculpture of a horse, created in [[Florence]] by [[Giambologna]] in the 1580s.  

The horse is depicted on two legs, with the right fore and left rear foot raised, perhaps at the [[trot]].  It is ''[[écorché]]'' ([[flayed]]) with the skin removed so the underlying musculature is clearly visible, and stands about {{convert|90|cm}} high  

The sculpture may have been created as a preliminary a study for [[Giambologna]]'s [[Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I|equestrian statue of Duke Cosimo]] cast in 1591 and displayed at the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence. It is similar to Giambologna's statue of a pacing horse. It shows influence from some ''écorché'' drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], made for his uncompleted equestrian statue of [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]], and resembles prints in [[Carlo Ruini]]'s book, ''Anatomia del Cavallo''.  Some sources identify some inspiration from the ancient [[equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in Rome. The anatomical detail of the sculpture prefigures the intimate knowledge gained by [[George Stubbs]] from his own dissections.

The sculpture was displayed at the [[Villa Celimontana|Villa Mattei]] in Rome in the 18th century.  [[Pope Clement XIV]] refused permission for [[Giuseppe Mattei]] to sell it, along with other artworks from his collection, in 1770.  It was later sold to [[Cardinal Fesch]], and then sold from his collection in Paris in June 1816.  It was acquired by [[Charles Loeser]] in London in 1913, and left to the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in Florence on his death in 1928.

Copies of Giambologna's sculpture original were made at the Vatican foundry, by its directors [[Giuseppe Valadier]] and then [[Francesco Righetti]].  One of four known full size copies by Valadier was sold at [[Christie's]] in July 2013 for £1.4m; this sculpture may have been owned the [[Dukes of Northumberland]] before passing through the collection of [[Boris Kochno]] and [[Christian Bérard]], and then [[Alexis von Rosenberg, Baron de Redé]] before being sold by [[Sotheby's]] in Monaco in 1975 for 1.5 million [[French franc]]s.

A different example of the sculpture was acquired in Rome by [[Sir James Erskine, 3rd Baronet|James Erskine]], later 3rd [[Erskine baronets|Erskine baronet]] of [[Torryburn|Torrie]], around 1803, who attempted to sell it in London in 1804, and then brought it to Scotland.  This sculpture is probably a copy by Valadier, as the original was still Cardinal Fesch's collection at the time.  Erskine left his art collection, including the sculpture, to the [[University of Edinburgh]] on his death in 1836, and now held by the university's Museum of Fine Arts.   Another example by Valadier is held by the [[Michele and Donald D'Amour Museum of Fine Arts]], in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].

The University of Edinburgh veterinary school holds a more recent copy of the Edinburgh sculpture made by [[Mario Pastori]] in 1984.  The Edinburgh sculpture was also copied to become the [[Breeders' Cup trophies|Breeders Cup trophy]] in the 1980s, with smaller replicas presented to the winners of [[Breeders' Cup]] World Championships races.

The '''''United States Statutes at Large''''', commonly referred to as the '''''Statutes at Large''''' and abbreviated '''Stat.''', are an official record of [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] and [[concurrent resolution]]s passed by the [[United States Congress]]. Each act and resolution of Congress is originally published as a [[slip law]], which is classified as either [[Public bill|public law]] (abbreviated Pub.L.) or [[Private bill|private law]] (Pvt.L.), and designated and numbered accordingly. At the end of a Congressional session, the statutes enacted during that session are compiled into bound books, known as "session law" publications. The session law publication for U.S. Federal statutes is called the ''United States Statutes at Large''. In that publication, the public laws and private laws are numbered and organised in chronological order.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Public and Private Laws: About | publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office]] | url= http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plaws/about.html | quote= At the end of each session of Congress, the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the Statutes at Large, and they are known as 'session laws.' | accessdate= 2009-11-20 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105231122/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/plaws/about.html | archive-date= 2010-01-05 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Federal statutes are published in a three-part process, consisting of slip laws, session laws (''Statutes at Large''), and [[Codification (law)|codification]] (''[[United States Code]]'').

==Codification==
Large portions of public laws are enacted as amendments to the [[United States Code]]. Once enacted into law, an Act will be published in the ''Statutes at Large'' and will add to, modify, or delete some part of the United States Code. Provisions of a public law that contain only enacting clauses, effective dates, and similar matters are not generally [[codification (law)|codified]]. Private laws also are not generally codified.

Some portions of the United States Code have been enacted as [[positive law]] and other portions have not been so enacted. In case of a conflict between the text of the ''Statutes at Large'' and the text of a provision of the United States Code that has not been enacted as positive law, the text of the ''Statutes at Large'' takes precedence.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{USC|1|112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:US Statutes at Large.jpg|thumb|right|A few volumes of the ''Statutes at Large'']]
Publication of the ''United States Statutes at Large'' began in 1845 by the private firm of [[Little, Brown and Company]] under authority of a [[joint resolution of Congress]]. During Little, Brown and Company's time as publisher, [[Richard Peters (reporter)|Richard Peters]] (Volumes 1–8), [[George Minot (attorney)|George Minot]] (Volumes 9–11), and [[George P. Sanger]] (Volumes 11–17) served as editors.

In 1874, Congress transferred the authority to publish the ''Statutes at Large'' to the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] under the direction of the Secretary of State.

{{USPL|80|278}}, 61 Stat. 633, was enacted July 30, 1947 and directed the Secretary of State to compile, edit, index, and publish the ''Statutes at Large''. {{USPL|81|821}}, 64 Stat. 980, was enacted September 23, 1950 and directed the [[Administrator of General Services]] to compile, edit, index, and publish the ''Statutes at Large''. Since 1985 the ''Statutes at Large'' have been prepared and published by the [[Office of the Federal Register]] (OFR) of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/help/about_united_states_statutes_at_large.htm About Statutes at Large]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948, all [[treaty|treaties]] and [[international agreement]]s approved by the [[United States Senate]] were also published in the set, but these now appear in a publication titled ''United States Treaties and Other International Agreements'', abbreviated '''U.S.T.''' In addition, the ''Statutes at Large'' includes the text of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[Articles of Confederation]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments to the Constitution]], treaties with [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] and foreign nations, and [[presidential proclamation]]s.

Sometimes very large or long Acts of Congress are published as their own volume of the ''Statutes at Large''. For example, the [[Internal Revenue Code of 1954]] was published as volume 68A of the Statutes at Large (68A Stat. 3).

'''Uyghur nationalism''', or the '''East Turkestan independence movement''', is the notion that the [[Uyghurs]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[ethnic group]] who primarily inhabit [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang]] region (or "[[East Turkestan]]"), should form an independent state. Unlike the [[Han Chinese]] population, dominant throughout most of China, Uyghurs speak the [[Uyghur language]] and are generally [[Muslim]].

The history of the region has become highly politicized, with both Chinese and nationalist Uyghur historians frequently overstating the extent of their groups' respective ties to the region.&lt;ref name="Bovingdon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gardner Bovingdon|title=The Uyghurs: Strangers in Their Own Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrtIa77Sj2IC|date=6 August 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51941-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it has been home to many groups throughout history, with the Uyghurs arriving from Central Asia in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wong |first1=Edward |title=The Dead Tell a Tale China Doesn’t Care to Listen To |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/world/asia/19mummy.html |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century they made up the vast majority of the population.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=11}} In 1933 and 1944 attempts were made to declare an independent republic, but the [[First East Turkestan Republic|first]] of these collapsed and the [[Second East Turkestan Republic|second]] was absorbed into People's Republic of China in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1909416,00.html|title=A Brief History of the Uighurs|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|date=2009-07-09|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-independence groups maintain that this constitutes an illegal occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East Turkistan |url=http://www.uyghurcongress.org/en/?page_id=29681 |website=World Uyghur Congress |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a [[Migration to Xinjiang|state-orchestrated mass migration]] from the 1950s to the 1970s has brought millions of Han Chinese into Xinjiang.

These factors have led to ongoing [[Xinjiang conflict|conflict]] with police and Han Chinese, including both frequent terrorist attacks and wider public unrest (such as the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]]).&lt;ref name="QZ"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Lindsey |last2=Paul |first2=Nathan |title=China created a new terrorist threat by repressing this ethnic minority |url=https://qz.com/993601/china-uyghur-terrorism/ |website=qz.com |publisher=Quartz |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name "East Turkestan" was created by the Russian Sinologist [[Nikita Bichurin]] to replace the term "Chinese Turkestan" in 1829.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2007|p=34}} "East Turkestan" was used traditionally to only refer to the [[Tarim Basin]], and not Xinjiang as a whole, with [[Dzungaria]] being excluded from the area consisting of "East Turkestan".

Xinjiang before the [[Qing dynasty]] did not exist as one unit. It consisted of the two separate political entities of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Eastern Turkestan).{{sfn|Michell|1870|p=2}}{{sfn|Martin|1847|p=21}}{{sfn|Fisher|1852|p=554}}{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica|1894|p=681}} There was the Zhunbu (Dzungar region) and Huibu (Muslim region){{sfn|Millward|2007|p=97}} Dzungharia or Ili was called Zhunbu 準部 (Dzungar region) Tianshan Beilu 天山北路 (Northern March), "Xinjiang" 新疆 (New Frontier),{{sfn|Millward|1998|p=21}} Dzongarie, Djoongaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Recit Officiiel de La Conquete du Turkestan par les Chinois (1758–1760) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MysOTiETbsC&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Bulletin de la Section de géographie |volume=Volume 10 |date=1896 |p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soungaria,{{sfn|Bridgman|Williams|1837|p=273}}{{sfn|Bridgman|Williams|1837|p=273}} or "Kalmykia" (La Kalmouquie in French).{{sfn|Mentelle|Malte-Brun|de Halle|1804|page=144}}{{sfn|Mentelle|Malte-Brun|de Halle|1804|page=160}} It was formerly the area of the [[Zunghar Khanate]] 準噶爾汗國, the land of the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]].

====Pan-Mongolian movements in Xinjiang====

Mongols have at times advocated for the historical Oirat Dzungar Mongol area of Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang, to be annexed to the Mongolian state in the name of [[Pan-Mongolism]].

Legends grew among the remaining Oirats that Amursana had not died after he fled to Russia, but was alive and would return to his people to liberate them from Manchu Qing rule and restore the Oirat nation. Prophecies had been circulating about the return of Amursana and the revival of the Oirats in the Altai region.{{sfn|Znamenski|2011|pp=27, 28, 29}}{{sfn|Ostasiatische Seminar|1982|p=164}} The Oirat Kalmyk [[Ja Lama]] claimed to be a grandson of Amursana and then claimed to be a reincarnation of Amursana himself, preaching anti-Manchu propaganda in western Mongolia in the 1890s and calling for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.{{Sfn|Lattimore|1955|page=57}} Ja Lama was arrested and deported several times. However, he returned to the Oirat Torghuts in [[Altay Prefecture|Altay]] (in Dzungaria) in 1910 and in 1912 he helped the Outer Mongolians mount an attack on the last Qing garrison at [[Khovd (city)|Kovd]], where the Manchu Amban was refusing to leave and fighting the newly declared independent Mongolian state.{{sfn|Croner|2009|p=11}}{{Sfn|Croner|2010|p=11}}{{sfn|Pegg|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Sinor|1990|p=5}}{{sfn|Baabar|1999|p=139}} The Manchu Qing force was defeated and slaughtered by the Mongols after Khovd fell.{{sfn|Mongolia Society|1970|p=17}}

Ja Lama told the Oirat remnants in Xinjiang: "I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country. By descent, I am the great-grandson of Amursana, the reincarnation of Mahakala, owning the horse Maralbashi. I am he whom they call the hero Dambijantsan. I came to move my pastures back to my own land, to collect my subject households and bondservants, to give favour, and to move freely."{{Sfn|Perdue|2009|p=493}}{{sfn|Palmer|2011|p=59}}

Ja Lama built an Oirat fiefdom centered on Kovd,{{Sfn|Dupree|Naby|1994|p=55}} he and fellow Oirats from Altai wanted to emulate the [[Dzungar Khanate|original Oirat empire]] and build another grand united Oirat nation from the nomads of western China and Mongolia,{{sfn|Znamenski|2011|p=40}} but was arrested by Russian Cossacks and deported in 1914 on the request of the Monglian government after the local Mongols complained of his excesses, and out of fear that he would create an Oirat separatist state and divide them from the Khalkha Mongols.{{sfn|Znamenski|2011|p=41}} Ja Lama returned in 1918 to Mongolia and resumed his activities and supported himself by extorting passing caravans,{{sfn|Andreyev|2003|p=139}}{{Sfn|Andreyev|2014|p=285}}{{sfn|Znamenski|2011|p=138}} but was assassinated in 1922 on the orders of the new Communist Mongolian authorities under [[Damdin Sükhbaatar]].{{sfn|Znamenski|2011|p=141}}{{Sfn|Sanders|2010|p=188}}{{sfn|Morozova|2009|p=39}}

The part Buryat [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikalian Cossack]] Ataman [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]] declared a "Great Mongol State" in 1918 and had designs to unify the Oirat Mongol lands, portions of Xinjiang, Transbaikal, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Tannu Uriankhai, Khovd, Hu-lun-pei-erh and Tibet into one Mongolian state.{{sfn|Paine|1996|pp=316–317}} [[Agvan Dorzhiev]] tried advocating for Oirat Mongol areas like Tarbagatai, Ili, and Altai to get added to the Outer Mongolian state.{{Sfn|Andreyev|2014|p=274}} Out of concern that China would be provoked, this proposed addition of the Oirat Dzungaria to the new Outer Mongolian state was rejected by the Soviets.{{Sfn|Andreyev|2014|p=275}}

====East Turkestan independence movements====
A rebellion in Kashgar against [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] rule led to the establishment of the short-lived [[First East Turkestan Republic]] or Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan (1933–1934). The Chinese Hui Muslim [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] crushed the Turkic First East Turkestan Republic at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1933)]] and [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. Hui Muslim leaders like [[Ma Shaowu]], General [[Ma Zhancang]] and General [[Ma Fuyuan]] fought the Turkic separatists.

During the [[Kumul Rebellion]] in Xinjiang in the 1930s, Buddhist murals were deliberately vandalized by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=13 December 1943 |title=Old Sterile Death Leaves its Mark over Sinkiang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |journal=Life |page=99 |volume=15 |number=24 |issn=0024-3019 |publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheng Shicai]], a secret member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], came into power after a military coup. He disobeyed the decree and order from the Chinese central government, but still ruled the region under the name of the Republic of China.
[[File:Second ETR in China.svg|The [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed unrecognised republic in northern Xinjiang.|thumb|right]]

Sheng Shicai later became anti-Russian when he became aware of the Soviet's intent to control his government. He expelled Soviet advisors and executed many Han Communists. [[Joseph Stalin]] was very angry with his convert and dispatched troops to invade Xinjiang. The Soviet troops helped the rebellion at [[Yining City|Ili]] (Yining City) during the [[Chinese civil war]]. The rebellion lead to the establishment of the [[Second East Turkistan Republic]] (1944–1949), which existed in three northern districts ([[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]], [[Tacheng Prefecture|Tarbaghatai]], [[Altay Prefecture|Altai]]) of Xinjiang province of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] with secret aid from the [[Soviet Union]] (Russia used consistent effort to annex Chinese territory since the 17th century). The majority of Xinjang remained under the control of the Republic of China.

After winning the Chinese civil war in 1949, the [[People's Liberation Army]] [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|took control of Xinjiang from Republic of China forces and the Second East Turkestan Republic]].

[[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] [[Jadidism|Jadidists]] and East Turkestan Independence activists [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] and [[Masud Sabri]] rejected the Soviets and [[Sheng Shicai]]'s imposition of the name "[[Uyghur people]]" upon the Turkic people of Xinjiang. They wanted instead the name "Turkic ethnicity" ({{zh|c=突厥族|p=tūjué zú}}) to be applied to their people. Masud Sabri also viewed the [[Hui people]] as [[Muslim]] [[Han Chinese]] and separate from his own people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. X. George |last=Wei |first2=Xiaoyuan |last2=Liu |title=Exploring Nationalisms of China: Themes and Conflicts |publisher=Greenwood |date=2002 |p=181 |isbn=978-0-313-31512-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qz3vdkxBt4AC&amp;pg=PA181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names "Türk" or "Türki" in particular were demanded by Bughra as the real name for his people. He slammed Sheng Shicai for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities, which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=209}}

The usage of the name "Uyghur" for the modern ethnic group has led to anachronisms and falsehood when applied to history by both the PRC and Uyghur nationalists.{{sfn|Reed|Raschke|2010|p=7}}

===People's Republic of China===

At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=306}} A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.&lt;ref name="ddx"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/EWCWwp001.pdf |title=Demographics and Development in Xinjiang after 1949 |first=Stanley |last=Toops |date=May 2004 |page=1 |issue=1 |location=Washington, D.C. |work=Working Papers |publisher=[[East–West Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=243}} Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang ([[Dzungaria]]).{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=104}}

Uyghur nationalists often incorrectly claim that 5% of Xinjiang's population in 1949 was Han, and that the other 95% was Uyghur, erasing the presence of [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]], [[Xibe people|Xibes]], and others, and ignoring the fact that Hans were around one third of Xinjiang's population at 1800, during the time of the Qing Dynasty.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=197}}

In 1955 (the first modern census in China was taken in 1953), Uyghurs were counted as 73% of Xinjiang's total population of 5.11 million.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=199}} Although Xinjiang as a whole is designated as a "Uyghur Autonomous Region", since 1954 more than 50% of Xinjiang's land area are designated autonomous areas for 13 native non-Uyghur groups.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=43–46}} The modern [[Uyghur people]] experienced [[ethnogenesis]] especially from 1955, when the PRC officially recognized that ethnic category - in opposition to the Han - of formerly separately self-identified oasis peoples.{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|p=176}}

The People's Republic of China has directed the majority of Han migrants towards the sparsely populated Dzungaria (Junggar Basin), before 1953 most of Xinjiang's population (75%) lived in the Tarim Basin, so the new Han migrants resulted in the distribution of population between Dzungaria and the Tarim being changed.{{sfn|Pletcher|2011|p=318}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Falkenheim |first=Victor C. |title=Xinjiang |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=27 March 2013 |edition=online |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Xinjiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most new Chinese migrants ended up in the northern region, in Dzungaria.{{sfn|Martyn|1978|p=358}} Han and Hui made up the majority of the population in Dzungaria's cities while Uighurs made up most of the population in Kashgaria's cities.{{sfn|Ethnological information on China|196?|p=2}} Eastern and Central Dzungaria are the specific areas where these Han and Hui are concentrated.{{sfn|Ethnological information on China|196?|p=7}} China made sure that new Han migrants were settled in entirely new areas uninhabited by Uyghurs so as to not disturb the already existing Uyghur communities.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=38}} Lars-Erik Nyman noted that Kashgaria was the native land of the Uighurs, "but a migration has been in progress to Dzungaria since the 18th century".{{sfn|Nyman|1977|p=12}}

Both Han economic migrants from other parts of China and Uyghur economic migrants from southern Xinjiang have been flooding into northern Xinjiang since the 1980s.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=42}}

Southern Xinjiang is where the majority of the Uyghur population resides, while it is in Northern Xinjiang cities where the majority of the Han (90%) population of Xinjiang reside.{{sfn|Guo|2007|p=220}} Southern Xinjiang is dominated by its nine million Uighur majority population, while northern Xinjiang is where the mostly urban Han population holds sway.{{sfn|Guo|2009|p=164}} This situation has been followed by an imbalance in the economic situation between the two ethnic groups, since the Northern Junghar Basin (Dzungaria) has been more developed than the Uighur south.{{sfn|Howell|2009|p=37}}

Since the [[Chinese economic reform]] from the late 1970s has exacerbated uneven regional development, more Uyghurs have migrated to Xinjiang cities and some Hans have also migrated to Xinjiang for independent economic advancement. Increased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with Uyghur [[Terrorism in the People's Republic of China|separatist terrorism]] from the 1990s, such as the [[1997 Ürümqi bus bombings]].{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=173–175}}

In the 1980s, 90% of Xinjiang Han lived in north Xinjiang (Jiangbei, historical Dzungaria). In the mid-1990s, Uyghurs consisted of 90% of south Xinjiang (Nanjiang, historical Tarim)'s population.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=241}} In 1980, the liberal reformist [[Hu Yaobang]] announced the expulsion of ethnic Han cadres in Xinjiang to eastern China. Hu was purged in 1987 for a series of demonstrations that he is said to have provoked in other areas of China. The prominent Xinjiang and national official [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]] criticized Hu for destroying Xinjiang Han cadres' "sense of security", and for exacerbating ethnic tensions.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=53}}

In the 1990s, there was a net inflow of Han people to Xinjiang, many of whom were previously prevented from moving because of the declining number of social services tied to ''[[hukou system|hukou]]'' (residency permits).{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=56}} As of 1996, 13.6% of Xinjiang's population was employed by the publicly traded [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]] (''Bingtuan'') corporation. 90% of the ''Bingtuan'''s activities relate to agriculture, and 88% of ''Bingtuan'' employees are Han, although the percentage of Hans with ties to the ''Bingtuan'' has decreased.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=242}} Han emigration from Xinjiang has also resulted in an increase of minority-identified agricultural workers as a total percentage of Xinjiang's farmers, from 69.4% in 1982 to 76.7% in 1990.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=246}} During the 1990s, about 1.2 million temporary migrants entered Xinjiang every year to stay for the [[cotton]] picking season.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=257}} Many Uyghur trading communities exist outside of Xinjiang; the largest in Beijing is one village of a few thousand.{{sfn|Sautman|2000|p=257}}

In 2000, Uyghurs "comprised 45 per cent of Xinjiang's population, but only 12.8 per cent of Urumqi's population." Despite having 9% of Xinjiang's population, Urumqi accounts for 25% of the region's GDP, and many rural Uyghurs have been migrating to that city to seek work in the dominant [[Light industry|light]], [[Heavy industry|heavy]], and [[petrochemical]] industries.{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=178–179}} Hans in Xinjiang are demographically older, better-educated, and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur cohabitants. Hans are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Urumqi, while some Uyghurs also cite trouble with the law back home and family reasons for their moving to Urumqi.{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|p=184}} Hans and Uyghurs are equally represented in Urumqi's [[floating population]] that works mostly in commerce. [[Self-segregation]] within the city is widespread, in terms of residential concentration, employment relationships, and a social norm of [[endogamy]].{{sfn|Hopper|Webber|2009|pp=187–188}} As of 2010, Uyghurs constitute a majority in the Tarim Basin, and a mere plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=11}}

Han and Hui mostly live in northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria), and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="China Census"&gt;{{cite report |author=Department of Population, Social, Science and Technology Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (国家统计局人口和社会科技统计司) and Department of Economic Development of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China (国家民族事务委员会经济发展司), eds. |trans-title=Tabulation on Nationalities of 2000 Population Census of China |script-title=zh:《2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料》 |location=Beijing |publisher=Nationalities Publishing House |date=2003 |isbn=7-105-05425-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tabulation_on_nationalities_of_2000_popu.html?id=xWpLAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the declarations of independence of the constituent republics of the area of Central Asia([[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, calls for the liberation of East Turkestan from China began to surface again from many in the Turkic population. {{Citation needed|reason=24 February 2009|date=March 2009}}

Those that use the term ''Uyghurstan'' tend to envision a state for the [[Uyghur people]]. Those groups that adopt this terminology tended to be allied with the [[Soviet Union]] while it still existed (Indeed, Russia incited and aided the rebellion in attempt to annex these regions in the future). Since then some of the leaders of these groups have remained in Russia, [[Kazakhstan]] or [[Kyrgyzstan]], or have emigrated to Europe and North America. It is worth noting that none of these identities are exclusive. Some groups support more than one such orientation. It is common to support both an Islamic and Turkic orientation for Xinjiang, for example, the founders of independent Republic in [[Kashgar]] in 1933 used names ''Turkic Islamic Republic of East Turkestan'' and ''Eastern Turkestan Republic'' the same time.

Since 1995 the Chair of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] has been [[Erkin Alptekin]], the son of the Uyghur leader [[Isa Alptekin|Isa Yusuf Alptekin]].

==Uyghur views by oasis==
Uyghur views vary by the oasis they live in. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turpan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]]. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=31}} Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-Chinese region. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government.{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|pp=45–47}}{{sfn|Central Asia Monitor|1993|p=19}} In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang.{{sfn|Mackerras|2003|p=118}} Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan soften the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children.{{sfn|Svanberg|Westerlund|2012|p=202}}{{sfn|Rudelson|1997|p=81}} Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca are encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party.

In Xinjiang, Communist Party members and civil servants who are employees of the government are not allowed to participate in religious activities while ordinary private citizens are allowed to practice religion and fast in Ramadan, students in public government directed schools are discouraged from participating in religious activities but not banned from doing so, the policy pertains to all religions-  members of the Communist party are not allowed to carry out [[Daoist]] practices like [[Feng Shui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=zh:陈杰人：中国新疆的"斋月之冤" |trans-title=Chen Jie: China's Xinjiang "Ramadan injustice" | language = zh-hans |work=zaobao.csg |url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/special/zbo/commentary/story20150714-502856 |date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Diplomat'' reported that although Uyghur's religious activities are curtailed, Hui Muslims are granted widespread religious freedom and that therefore the policy of the Chinese government towards Uyghurs in Xinjiang likely reflects "not a distaste for Islam as such, but it is an absolute neurosis towards the threat – serious or not – of territory loss, and with no small degree of xenophobia thrown in there as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/a-tale-of-two-chinese-muslim-minorities/|title=A Tale of Two Chinese Muslim Minorities|last=Crane|first=Brent|date=22 August 2014|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt; China banned a book titled ''Xing Fengsu'' (''Sexual Customs'') which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladney |first=Dru C. |title=Muslim Chinese: ethnic nationalism in the People's Republic |publisher=Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University |date=1991 |p=2 |isbn=978-0-674-59496-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcsmAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Louisa |last=Schein |title=Minority Rules: The Miao and the Feminine in China's Cultural Politics |publisher=Duke University Press |date=2000 |p=154 |isbn=978-0-8223-2444-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GomyOthrHjUC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladney |first=Dru C. |chapter=Alterity Motives |editor-first1=Pál |editor-last1=Nyíri |editor-first2=Joana |editor-last2=Breidenbach |title=China Inside Out: Contemporary Chinese Nationalism and Transnationalism |publisher=Central European University Press |date=2005 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&amp;pg=PA257 |p=257 |isbn=978-963-7326-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladney |first=Dru C. |chapter=The Salafiyya Movement in Northwest China: Islamic Fundamentalism among the Muslim Chinese? |editor-first=Leif |editor-last=Manger |title=Muslim Diversity: Local Islam in Global Contexts |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |p=144 |isbn=978-1-136-81857-8 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WGOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Sautman |chapter=Legal Reform and Minority Rights in China |editor-first=Stuart |editor-last=Nagel |title=Handbook of Global Legal Policy |publisher=CRC Press |date=2000 |p=79 |isbn=978-0-8247-7892-7 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HH94dPJrkA4C&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIWC9wCX2c8C&amp;pg=PA581 |title=China: A History |first=Harold Miles |last=Tanner |year=2009 |publisher=Hackett |page=581 |isbn=0-87220-915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.{{sfn|Gladney|2004|p=232}}

Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs.

{{main|Ili Rebellion|Second East Turkestan Republic|Xinjiang conflict}}

The Soviet Union supported the Uyghur [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] in the [[Ili Rebellion]] against the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. According to her autobiography, ''Dragon Fighter: One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace with China'', [[Rebiya Kadeer]]'s father served with pro-Soviet Uyghur rebels under the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] in the [[Ili Rebellion]] (Three Province Rebellion) in 1944–1946, using Soviet assistance and aid to fight the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].{{sfn|Kadeer|2009|p=9}} Kadeer and her family were close friends with [[Russians in China|White Russian exiles]] living in Xinjiang and Kadeer recalled that many Uyghurs thought Russian culture was "more advanced" than that of the Uyghurs and they "respected" the Russians a lot.{{sfn|Kadeer|2009|p=13}}

Many of the Turkic peoples of the [[Yining County|Ili region]] of Xinjiang had close cultural, political, and economic ties with Russia and then the Soviet Union. Many of them were educated in the Soviet Union and a community of Russian settlers lived in the region. As a result, many of the Turkic rebels fled to the Soviet Union and obtained Soviet assistance in creating the Sinkiang Turkic People's Liberation Committee (STPNLC) in 1943 to revolt against [[Kuomintang]] rule during the [[Ili Rebellion]].{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=173}} The pro-Soviet Uyghur who later became leader of the revolt and the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]], [[Ehmetjan Qasim]], was Soviet educated and described as "Stalin's man".{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=174}}

The Soviet Union incited separatist activities in Xinjiang through propaganda, encouraging Kazakhs to flee to the Soviet Union and attacking China. China responded by reinforcing the Xinjiang-Soviet border area specifically with Han [[Bingtuan]] militia and farmers.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=138}} The Soviets massively intensified their broadcasts inciting Uyghurs to revolt against the Chinese via Radio Tashkent since 1967 and directly harbored and supported separatist guerilla fighters to attack the Chinese border, in 1966 the amount of Soviet sponsored separatist attacks on China numbered 5,000.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=139}} The Soviets transmitted a radio broadcast from Radio Tashkent into Xinjiang on 14 May 1967, boasting of the fact that the Soviets had supported the Second East Turkestan Republic against China.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=188}} In addition to Radio Tashkent, other Soviet media outlets aimed at disseminating propaganda towards Uyghurs urging that they proclaim independence and revolt against China included Radio Alma-Ata and the Alma-Ata published ''Sherki Türkistan Evazi'' ("The Voice of Eastern Turkestan") (شەرقىي تۈركىستان ئاۋازى) newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Dickens |title=The Soviets in Xinjiang: 1911–1949 |publisher=Oxus Communications |date=1990 |url=http://www.oxuscom.com/sovinxj.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in 1962, over 60,000 Uyghurs and Kazakhs [[Kazakh exodus from Xinjiang|defected from Xinjiang]] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], in response to [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] which promised Xinjiang independence. Uyghur exiles later threatened China with rumors of a Uyghur "liberation army" in the thousands that were supposedly recruited from Sovietized emigres.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=141–142}}

The Soviet Union was involved in funding and support to the [[East Turkestan People's Revolutionary Party]] (ETPRP), the largest militant Uyghur separatist organization in its time, to start a violent uprising against China in 1968.{{sfn|Dillon|2003|p=57}}{{sfn|Clarke|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Dillon|2008|p=147}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=China's Search for Security |first1=Andrew James |last1=Nathan |first2=Andrew |last2=Scobell |edition=illustrated |year=2013 |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=etRkjLv8AosC&amp;pg=PT278 |isbn=0-231-51164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the Soviets also supported the [[United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan]] (URFET) to fight against the Chinese.{{sfn|Reed|Raschke|2010|p=37}}

== Attempts at independence ==

===Yaqub Beg establishment of Kashgaria===
The Kokandi [[Yaqub Beg]] invaded Kashgar during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–77)|Dungan revolt]] to establish an independent state after taking advantage of local rebellions.

Also during the Dungan revolt, the [[Taranchi]] Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang initially cooperated with the Dungans (Chinese Muslims) when they rose in revolt, but turned on them, because the Dungans, mindful of their Chinese heritage attempted to subject the entire region to their rule. The Taranchi massacred the Dungans at [[Yining (city)|Kuldja]] and drove the rest through Talk pass to the Ili valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gitcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA35&amp;dq=soviets+defeated+by+tungans#v=snippet&amp;q=tungans%20taranchis%20massacred%20kuldja&amp;f=false|title=Accounts and papers of the House of Commons|author=Great Britain.

===First East Turkestan Republic===
The first republic established by the Uighurs was short lived, the Uighur army was defeated by the [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]], which destroyed the Republic at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]].

===Second East Turkestan Republic===
A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] backed state was created by Uighur rebels in northern Xinjiang. It was absorbed into the newly founded People's Republic of China in 1950.

Dear Brother,&lt;br&gt;
With all due respect to your previous position in the Government of Sinkiang and to the confidence placed in you by His Excellency the President of the Republic of China, I hope that you will refrain from using expressions which should not be used by one who occupied the position of a mufti. We are all serving our beloved country trying to do our best for our countrymen. I also hope that you will refrain from using the expression "The Turkestani Nation" which was the creation of one Abdul Qayyum Khan while he was living in Germany. We are working for the welfare of the true people of Sinkiang not for the Turkestanis living outside Sinkiang or the followers of Abdul Qayyum Khan.&lt;br&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br&gt;

== Turkic nationalism ==
During the [[First East Turkestan Republic]], the Turkic nationalist ideology of the Republic led to hostility between different Muslim ethnic groups. The Uyghurs and Kirghiz, who were both Turkic Muslim peoples, fought against the [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]]s of southern Xinjiang and sought to expel them with the [[Han Chinese]]. This led several [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] Generals like [[Ma Zhancang]], [[Ma Fuyuan]], and [[Ma Hushan]] to fight against the Uyghur attempts and independence.

The Chinese Hui Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] wanted to settle disbanded Chinese soldiers in Xinjiang, which the Uyghurs opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 |title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937 |first=Diana |last=Lary |year=1974 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=124 |isbn=0-521-20204-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument against East Turkestan independence==

[[People's Republic of China|China]] claims to have a historic claim on modern-day [[Xinjiang]] dating back two thousand years. East Asian migrants arrived in the eastern portions of the [[Tarim Basin]] about 3,000 years ago, while the [[Uighur people]] arrived after the collapse of the Orkon Uighur Kingdom, based in modern-day [[Mongolia]], around the year 842.&lt;ref name="Celtic" /&gt; It fears that independence movements are largely funded and led by outside forces that seek to weaken China. China points out that despite such movements, [[Xinjiang]] has made great economic strides, building up its infrastructure, improving its education system and increasing the average life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;China White Paper on Xinjiang 26 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]] criticize Uyghur separatism, and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries over Islam for fear of being perceived as radical.&lt;ref name="Van Wie Davis 2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China |last=Van Wie Davis |first=Elizabeth |work=Asian Affairs |volume=35 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2008 |pp=15–29 |jstor=27821503 |doi=10.3200/aafs.35.1.15-30|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA493744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region, yet the historical native land of the Uyghurs is not the whole land of Xinjiang, but [[Tarim basin]]. Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the capital of Xinjiang [[Urumqi]] was even originally a Han and Hui (Tungan) city with few Uyghur people before recent Uyghur migration to the city, but foreigners mistakenly think that Urumqi was originally a Uyghur city and that the Chinese destroyed its Uyghur character and culture.{{sfn|Millward|1998|pp=77–78, 133–134}} Moreover, the Han and Hui mostly live in northern Xinjiang [[Dzungaria]], and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="China Census"/&gt; While a few people try to give a misportrayal of the historical Qing situation in light of the contemporary situation in Xinjiang with Han migration, and claim that the Qing settlements and state farms were an anti-Uyghur plot to replace them in their land, Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the Qing agricultural colonies in reality had nothing to do with Uyghur and their land, since the Qing banned settlement of Han in the Uyghur Tarim Basin and in fact directed the Han settlers instead to settle in the non-Uyghur Dzungaria and the new city of Urumqi, so that the state farms which were settled with 155,000 Han Chinese from 1760–1830 were all in Dzungaria and Urumqi, where there was only an insignificant amount of Uyghurs, instead of the Tarim Basin oases.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=23}}

Uyghur nationalist historians such as [[Turghun Almas]] claim that Uyghurs were distinct and independent from Chinese for 6000 years, and that all non-Uyghur peoples are non-indigenous immigrants to Xinjiang.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=25, 30–31}} However, the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) established military colonies ([[tuntian]]) and commanderies ([[duhufu]]) to control Xinjiang from 120 BCE, while the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) also controlled much of Xinjiang until the [[An Lushan rebellion]].{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=25–26}} Chinese historians refute Uyghur nationalist claims by pointing out the 2000-year history of Han settlement in Xinjiang, documenting the history of [[Mongols in China|Mongol]], [[Kazakh people|Kazakh]], [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Xibo people|Xibo]] indigenes in Xinjiang, and by emphasizing the relatively late "westward migration" of the [[Huigu]] (equated with "Uyghur" by the PRC government) people from Mongolia the 9th century.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|pp=25, 30–31}} The name "Uyghur" was associated with a Buddhist people in the Tarim Basin in the 9th century, but completely disappeared by the 15th century, until it was revived by the [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=28}}

Uyghur nationalists often incorrectly claim that 5% of Xinjiang's population in 1949 was Han, and that the other 95% was Uyghur, erasing the presence of [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]], [[Xibe people|Xibes]], and others, and ignoring the fact that Hans were around one third of Xinjiang's population at 1800, during the time of the Qing Dynasty.{{sfn|Bovingdon|2010|p=197}} At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=306}} A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.&lt;ref name="ddx"/&gt; Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they [[Zunghar genocide|exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols]] in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.{{sfn|Starr|2004}}

==Groups==
[[File:Flag of Jihad.svg|thumb|The flag of [[Jihad]] is used by the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]].]]

In general, the wide variety of groups who seek independence can be distinguished by the type of government they advocate and the role they believe an independent East Turkestan should play in international affairs. Groups who use the term ''East Turkestan'' tend to have an orientation towards western Asia, the [[Islamic world]], and Russia. These groups can be further subdivided into those who desire [[secularism]], and identify with the struggle of secular [[Kemal Atatürk]] in [[Turkey]], versus those who want an [[Islam]]ic [[theocracy]] and identify with [[Saudi Arabia]], the former [[Taliban]] government in Afghanistan, or [[Iran]]. In many cases the latter diminish the importance or deny the existence of a separate [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] ethnicity and claim a larger Islamic identity. These groups tend to see an independent East Turkestan in which non-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and especially non-Islamic minorities, such as the [[Han Chinese]] would play no significant role.

Some of the groups that support independence for East Turkestan have been labeled [[terrorist organization]]s by both the People's Republic of China, the [[United Nations]] and/or the United States.

==Recent events==
There continues to be concern over tensions in the region, centering upon Uyghur [[Uyghur people#Culture|cultural aspirations]] to independence, and resentment towards what [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] describe as repression of non-[[Han Chinese culture]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Conversely, many [[Han Chinese]] perceive PRC policies of ethnic autonomy as discriminatory against them (see [[autonomous entities of China]]). Independence advocates view Chinese rule in Xinjiang, and policies like the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]] as [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Chinese imperialism]]. The US and the UN have labelled the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]] a [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist group]].

The tensions have occasionally resulted in major incidents and violent clashes during the PRC period. For example, in 1962, 60,000 Uyghur and Kazakh refugees fled northern Xinjiang into the [[Soviet Union]] to escape the famine and political purges of the [[Great Leap Forward]] era; in the 1980s there was a smattering of student demonstrations and riots against police action that took on an ethnic aspect; and the [[Baren Township riot]] in April 1990, an abortive uprising resulted in more than 50 deaths.

A police roundup of suspected separatists during [[Ramadan]] resulted in large demonstrations that turned violent in February 1997 in an episode known as the [[Ghulja Incident]] that led to at least 9 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/china-bck1017.htm |title=China: Human Rights Concerns in Xinjiang |work=Human Rights Watch Backgrounder |date=17 October 2001 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urumqi bus bombs]] of 25 February 1997, perhaps a response to the crackdown that followed the Ghulja Incident, killed 9 and injured 68. Speaking on separatist violence, Erkin Alptekin, a former East Turkestan National Congress chairman and prominent Uyghur [[activist]], said "We must emphasise dialogue and warn our youth against the use of violence because it de-legitimises our movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Manolis |last=Priniotakis |url=http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=chinas_secret_separatists |title=China's Secret Separatists: |work=The Prospect |date=19 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite much talk of separatism and terrorism in Xinjiang, especially after the [[11 September 2001 attacks|9-11 attacks]] in the United States and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], the situation in Xinjiang was quiet from the late nineties through mid-2006. In 2005, Uighur author [[Nurmemet Yasin]] was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for inciting separatism following his publication of an allegorical short story, "The Blue Pigeon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/china-battles-to-convince-terror-sceptics/2005/11/11/1131578236193.html?page=3 |title=China battles to convince terror sceptics |first=Hamish |last=McDonald |date=12 November 2005 |work=The Age |archivedate=30 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330143209/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/china-battles-to-convince-terror-sceptics/2005/11/11/1131578236193.html?page=3 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2007 the Chinese Public Security Bureau raided a suspected [[terrorist training camp]] in the mountains near the Pamir Plateau in southern Xinjiang. According to the reports, 18 terrorists were killed and another 17 captured in a gun battle between the East Turkestan Independence Movement and PRC forces. One police officer was killed and "over 1,500 hand grenades... were seized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chinese police destroy terrorist camp in Xinjiang, one policeman killed |publisher=China Central Television |date=10 January 2007 |url=http://www.cctv.com/english/20070110/100828.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Turkiye-uyghur.jpg|thumb|320x320px|China protest in Turkey in 2015]]

===Olympics===
In 2008, the Chinese government announced that several terrorist plots by Uyghur separatists to disrupt the [[2008 Olympic Games]] involving kidnapping athletes, journalists and tourists were foiled. The security ministry said 35 arrests were made in recent weeks and explosives had been seized in Xinjiang province. It said 10 others were held when police smashed another plot based in Xinjiang back in January to disrupt the Games. However, Uyghur activists accused the Chinese of fabricating terror plots to crack down on the people of the region and prevent them airing legitimate grievances.
Some foreign observers were also skeptical, questioning if China was inflating a terror threat to justify a clampdown on dissidents before the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China 'foils Olympic terror plot' |date=10 April 2008 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7340181.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, during which world attention was drawn by pro-Tibet protests along the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]], Uyghur separatist groups staged protests in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|E4Jnwks3h6s|Uyghurs protest Olympic Torch in Istanbul - NTDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chinese government, a suicide bombing attempt on a China Southern Airlines flight in Xinjiang was thwarted in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth Van Wie |last=Davis |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JD18Ad01.html |title=China confronts its Uyghur threat |work=Asia Times |date=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days before the Beijing Olympics, 16 Chinese police officers were killed and 16 injured in an [[2008 Kashgar attack|attack]] in [[Kashgar]] by local merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080804.wchinaraid0804/BNStory/International/ |title=16 Chinese police officers killed in attack |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=4 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chinese police injured and damaged the equipment of two Japanese journalists sent to cover the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/07/olympics.press.freedom.florcruz/?iref=mpstoryview |publisher=CNN |title=Behind the scenes: Internet police out in force for the Olympics |date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later a bombing in [[Kuqa County|Kuqa]] killed at least two people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL986830 |title=Blasts kill two in China's restive Xinjiang |agency=[[Xinhua]] |publisher=Reuters |date=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, two Chinese police officers were killed and seven more wounded near the city of [[Kashgar]] when their patrol was [[ambush]]ed by at least seven militants, including one woman, wielding knives and automatic weapons. Apparently the patrol was lain upon in a corn field while acting on an erroneous tip from another woman that had been suspected of assisting militants. According to Uighur sources Chinese officials have been "cracking down" on ethnic Uighurs, detaining large numbers in recent weeks and view the incident as Uighurs resisting arrest. Reportedly, 33 people died in Xinjiang because of clashes in the month of August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080828/ap_on_re_as/china_uighur_clash_4 |accessdate=29 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080829/wl_asia_afp/chinaxinjiangunrestoly2008_080829153907 |accessdate=29 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|July 2009 Ürümqi riots}}
On 5 July 2009, [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots|riots broke out in Ürümqi]], the capital of Xinjiang. The state media reported close to 150 people dead. While the riots occurred after a demonstration protesting the deaths of two Uyghurs in the [[June 2009 Shaoguan incident]], the central government claimed that the riot had been masterminded by separatists abroad, particularly exiled leader [[Rebiya Kadeer]].

=== 2015 Bangkok bombing ===
The [[2015 Bangkok bombing]] is suspected to have been carried out by the [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkic]] neo-fascist [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish ultra-nationalist]] organization [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] due to Thailand's deportation of Uyghur terrorist suspects back to China instead of allowing them to travel to Turkey for asylum, a Turkish man named Adem Karadag was arrested by the Thai police in connection to the bombing with Turkish passports and bomb making materials found in his apartment, the Grey Wolves are described by the media as a terrorist group and became famous for their assassinations and killings of journalists, liberals, and leftists in Turkey, their member [[Mehmet Ali Ağca]]'s [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II]], and their involvement in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and the [[First Chechen War|Chechen war]] due to the Muslim and Turkic populations of those areas since their aim is the unification of all Muslim Turkic peoples into one state spanning from Central Asia to the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sherwell |first=Philip |date= 29 August 2015 |title=Bangkok bombing: Was it the Grey Wolves of Turkey? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/11832701/Bangkok-bombing-Was-it-the-Grey-Wolves-of-Turkey.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murdoch  |first=Lindsay |date=30 August 2015  |title=Bangkok bombing: Who are the Turkish terrorist group the Grey Wolves? |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/bangkok-bombing-who-are-the-turkish-terrorist-group-the-grey-wolves-20150830-gjavjz.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rossington  |first=Ben |date= 27 August 2015  |title= Bangkok bombings: Police probe 'Grey Wolves' link to attack which killed 20 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/bangkok-bombings-police-probe-grey-6334814 |work=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cunningham  |first=Susan |date=24 August 2015  |title=Thailand's Shrine Bombing - The Case For Turkey's Grey Wolves |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susancunningham/2015/08/24/thailands-shrine-bombing-the-case-for-turkeys-grey-wolves/ |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 August 2015 |title= Break in Bangkok blast case?

'''Saint Vitus''' ({{IPAc-en|v|aɪ|t|ə|s}}), according to Christian legend, was a [[Christian]] [[saint]] from [[Sicily]]. He died as a [[martyr]] during the [[persecution of Christians]] by co-ruling [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperors]] [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] in 303. Vitus is counted as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]] of medieval Roman Catholicism. 
Saint Vitus' Day is celebrated on 15 June. In places where the [[Julian Calendar]] is used, this date coincides, in the 20th and 21st centuries, with 28 June on the [[Gregorian Calendar]].

In the late [[Middle Ages]], people in [[Germany]] and countries such as [[Latvia]] celebrated the feast of Vitus by dancing before his statue. This dancing became popular and the name "Saint Vitus Dance" was given to the [[neurological disorder]] [[Sydenham's chorea]]. It also led to Vitus being considered the patron saint of dancers and of entertainers in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv07.htm |title=Saint Vitus |publisher=Saints.sqpn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808173149/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv07.htm |archive-date=2012-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitus is considered the [[patron saint]] of [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, and [[epileptic]]s, similarly to [[Genesius of Rome]]. He is also said to protect against [[lightning]] strikes, animal attacks and oversleeping. Vitus is the patron saint of the city of [[Rijeka]] in [[Croatia]]; the towns of [[Ciminna]] &amp; [[Vita, Sicily|Vita]] in [[Sicily]], [[Forio]] on the Island of [[Ischia]], in [[Campania]], [[Italy]]; the contrada of San Vito, in [[Torella dei Lombardi]], in [[Avellino]], [[Italy]]; the town of [[Winschoten]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} in the [[Netherlands]], the italian colony of [[San Vito (Costa Rica)]] in Costa Rica, and the town of [[St. Vith]] located in [[Belgium]].  

Various places in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] are named [[Sankt Veit (disambiguation)|Sankt Veit]] in his honour.

==Martyrdom of Saints Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia==
[[File:Vitusmodestuscrescentia.jpg|thumb|left|The martyrdom of Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia, from a fourteenth-century manuscript]]

According to the legend, Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia were martyrs under [[Diocletian]]. The earliest testimony for their veneration is offered by the "[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]" (ed. [[G. B. de Rossi]]-[[Louis Duchesne]], 78: "In Sicilia, Viti, Modesti et Crescentiae"). The fact that the note is in the three most important manuscripts indicates that it was also in the common exemplar of these, which appeared in the fifth century. The same ''Martyrologium'' has under the same day another mention of a Vitus at the head of a list of nine martyrs, with the statement of the place, in [[Eboli]], "In [[Lucania]]", that is, in the Roman province of that name in [[southern Italy]] between the Tuscan Sea and the [[Gulf of Taranto]]. It is easily possible that it is the same martyr Vitus in both cases.

According to J. P. Kirsch,&lt;ref&gt;The author of [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15490b.htm the article] in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] from which the information in this section is drawn&lt;/ref&gt; the testimony to the public veneration of the three saints in the fifth century proves that they are historical martyrs. There are, nevertheless, no historical accounts of them, nor of the time or the details of their martyrdom.

During the sixth and seventh centuries a purely legendary [[narrative]] of their martyrdom appeared which appears to be based upon other [[legend]]s, especially on the legend of [[Saint Potitus]], and ornamented with accounts of fantastic miracles. According to this legend, which has no apparent historical value, Vitus was a 7-year-old son of a senator of Lucania (some versions make him 12 years old). He resisted his father's attempts, which included various forms of torture, to make him turn away from his faith. He fled with his tutor Modestus and Modestus's wife Crescentia, who was Vitus's nanny, to Lucania. He was taken from there to Rome to [[exorcism|drive out a demon]] which had taken possession of a son of the Emperor Diocletian. This he did, and yet, because he remained steadfast in the Christian faith, he was [[tortured]] together with his tutors. By a [[miracle]] an [[angel]] brought back the three to Lucania, where they died from the tortures they had endured. Three days later Vitus appeared to a distinguished matron named Florentia, who then found the bodies and buried them in the spot where they were.

==Veneration==
[[File:St Vitus Cathedral from south.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Vitus Cathedral]] is the main church of the former imperial capital, [[Prague]].]]

The veneration of the martyrs spread rapidly in Southern Italy and Sicily, as is shown by the note in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". Pope [[Gregory the Great]] mentions a monastery dedicated to Vitus in Sicily ("Epist.", I, xlviii, P.L., LXXXVII, 511).

The veneration of St. Vitus, the chief saint of the group, also appeared very early at Rome. [[Pope Gelasius I]] (492-496) mentions a shrine dedicated to him (Jaffé, "Reg. Rom. Pont.", 2nd ed., I, 6 79), and at Rome in the seventh century the chapel of a deaconry was dedicated to him ("Liber Pont.", ed. Duchesne, I, 470 sq.).

In 756 AD, it is said that the [[relics]] of St. Vitus were brought to the [[Saint-Denis Abbey|monastery of St-Denis]] by [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. They were later presented to Abbot Warin of [[Corvey]] in Germany, who solemnly transferred some of them to this abbey in 836. From Corvey the veneration of St Vitus spread throughout Westphalia and in the districts of eastern and northern Germany. His cult grew in [[Prague]], Bohemia when, in 925 A.D., king [[Henry I of Germany]] presented as a gift the bones of one hand of St. Vitus to [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], Duke of Bohemia. Since then, this relic has been a sacred treasure in the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague.

The cult of St. Vitus became very popular in Slavic lands, where his name (Sveti Vid) may have replaced the old cult of the god of light [[Svetovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/nameE.htm |title=SVIBOR - The Meaning and the Origin of the Word |publisher=Mzos.hr |date=1996-06-14 |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305105129/http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/nameE.htm |archive-date=2012-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Serbia]] his feast day, known as '''[[Vidovdan]]''', is of particular historical importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Đorđević|first=Dimitrije |title=The role of St. Vitus Day in modern Serbian history|journal=Serbian Studies|volume=5|issue=3|date=Spring 1990|publisher=[[North American Society for Serbian Studies]]|url=http://www.serbianstudies.org/publications/pdf/Vol5_3_1990-%20DimitrijeDjordjevic-TheRoleofSt_VitusDayinModernSerbianHistory.pdf|pages=33–40|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day is part of the [[Kosovo Myth]] — the [[Battle of Kosovo]] occurred on that day; several events have symbolically occurred on that day, such as the 1914 [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of the Austrian royal couple]]; Vitus was the patron saint of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].&lt;ref name="CoveWestwell2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis Cove|author2=Ian Westwell|title=History of World War I.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7DR_fheHdCAC&amp;pg=PA72|date=January 2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7231-5|page=72|quote=... was scheduled for June 28. This was a significant date for both Princip and the archduke. It was the day of St. Vitus, the patron saint of Serbia,}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Croatia]], 123 churches are dedicated to St. Vitus. In [[Hungary]] he has been venerated as ''Szent Vid'' since the early Middle Ages. In [[Bulgaria]], it is called Vidovden (Видовден) or Vidov Den (Видов ден) and is particularly well known among the [[Shopi]], in the western part of the country.

Saint Vitus is one of the [[Fourteen Martyrs]] who give aid in times of trouble. He is specifically invoked against [[Sydenham's chorea|chorea]], which is called ''St. Vitus Dance''. 

He is represented as a young man with a palm-leaf, in a cauldron, sometimes with a raven and a lion, his [[Saint symbology|iconographic attribute]] because according to the legend he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling tar and molten lead, but miraculously escaped unscathed.

The names of Saints Modestus and Crescentia were added in the 11th century to the Roman Calendar,&lt;ref name=CR&gt;"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; so that from then on all three names were celebrated together until 1969, when their feast was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]]. Saint Vitus is still recognized as a saint of the [[Catholic Church]], being included in the [[Roman Martyrology]] under June 15,&lt;ref&gt;"Martyrologium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] may be celebrated in his honor on that day wherever the [[Roman Rite]] is celebrated,&lt;ref&gt;[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], [http://www.salesianer.de/liturgie/igmr2002.htm 355]&lt;/ref&gt; while Modestus and Crescentia, who are associated with Vitus in legend, have been omitted, because they appear to be merely fictitious personages.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

The saint's feast day is also the subject of a popular weather rhyme: "If St. Vitus' Day be rainy weather, it shall rain for thirty days together". This rhyme often appears in such publications as [[almanac]]s; its origin is uncertain.

Michael J. Towsend writes that "the phrase 'The patron saint of [[Methodism]] is St Vitus' summed up with reasonable accuracy many people's impressions of the Methodist Church. Methodists, surely, are supremely busy people, always rushing around organizing things and setting up committees to do good works. They can generally be relied upon to play their part in running [[Christian Aid Week]], the sponsored walk for the local hospice or the group protesting about homelessness, and they are known, even now, to be activists in trades unions and political parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A sacramental spirituality for  Methodism|last=Townsend|first=Michael J.|work=The Way|publisher=[[Society of Jesus]]|page=100|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?''''' is a [[wikt:Special:Search/posthumous|posthumous]] 2016 collection of short stories by author [[Kathleen Collins]].  The title story was published by ''[[Granta]]'' in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Kathleen|title=Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?|url=https://granta.com/whatever-happened-to-interracial-love/|work=Granta|issue=136: Legacies of Love|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "The best of these stories are a [[revelation]]. Ms. Collins had a gift for illuminating what the critic Albert Murray called the ‘black intramural class struggle,’ and two or three of her stories are so sensitive and sharp and political and sexy I suspect they will be widely anthologized."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/books/kathleen-collinss-whatever-happened-to-interracial-love.html|title=Kathleen Collins's ‘Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?’|author=Garner, Dwight|authorlink=Dwight Garner (critic)|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claire Fallon of ''[[HuffPost]]'' praised the book saying "in poignant, searching scenes and contemplations, readers will be reintroduced to a great and under-appreciated creative talent in Kathleen Collins."&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite web|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=December 2, 2016|title=‘Whatever Happened To Interracial Love?’ Asks Questions We’re Still Trying To Answer|author=Fallon, Claire|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whatever-happened-to-interracial-love_us_5840aee7e4b09e21702ddb0f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3824">'''William Robert Shepherd''' (12 June 1871 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] – 7 June 1934 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]) was an American [[cartographer]] and [[historian]] specializing in American and [[Latin America]]n history.

In 1896, Shepherd completed his PhD at [[Columbia University]]. He then studied in Berlin and finally became professor of history at [[Columbia University]]. He is best known for his ''Historical Atlas'', published in several editions during the early twentieth century. He is considered a pioneer in the field of Latin American history. Shepherd's address to the 1909 meeting of the [[American Historical Association]] was "probably the first time that a part of the program of the annual meeting was devoted to the history of other peoples in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Hanke]] introduction to William R. Shepherd, "The Contribution of the Romance Nations to the History of the Americas" in ''Latin American History: Essays on its Research and Teaching, 1898-1965'' Section III, Pioneers, 1900-1918. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1967, vol. 1, p. 66. Reprinted from ''Annual Report of the American Historical association for the Year 1909''. 1:221-227. Washington DC 1910).&lt;/ref&gt; In his remarks, he decried that in the United States the history of the western hemisphere focuses on the English colonies and ignores or disparages the history of Spanish, Portuguese, and French America. He called for a more balanced history of the Americas, stressing "That the history of the Spanish, Portuguese, and the French in America possesses an interest and a significance of its own, entirely apart from its relation to the "Anglo-American" element."&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, "The Contribution of Romance Nations", p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
