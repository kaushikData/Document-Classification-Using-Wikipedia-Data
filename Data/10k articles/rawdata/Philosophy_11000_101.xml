'''Anastastio Cuschieri''' (1872–1962) was a Maltese poet, politician, and minor philosopher. He held the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Malta]] (1901–39). In philosophy he was mostly interested in ethics.&lt;ref name="M_2001_I_103_104"&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2009|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2011|pp=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Cuschieri was born at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], on January 27, 1876. He joined the [[Carmelite Order]] on April 25, 1891, at 19 years of age. That same year he began pursuing his institutional studies in philosophy and theology at the [[University of Malta]].  He made his religious profession on August 28, 1892. On completion of his university courses in 1898, Cuschieri was ordained a priest, and sent to Rome, Italy, to pursue studies in philosophy and theology at the [[Jesuits]]' [[Gregorian University]].  In 1901 he became a Doctor of Philosophy and a [[Doctor of Theology]].

===Chair of philosophy===
On his return to Malta in 1901, Cuschieri was immediately appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Malta. Here just a year later, in 1902, he was elevated to the chair of philosophy, an office he occupied for 30 years. During this time, while busy teaching philosophy at the university, as a gifted [[orator]] he was frequently called upon to address various gatherings, and he was particularly popular to deliver religious orations. Twice was he chosen as a provincial superior of the Maltese [[Carmelites]] (1906–10; 1913–16).

===Poetry===
Culturally, Cuschieri was utterly in love with the Italian language and the Latin culture. For many years he was one of the examiners of the Italian language and Italian literature. Many of his earliest poems were in Italian, and continued to write refined Italian poems all his life. A collection of these appeared in Oreste Tencajoli's ''Poeti Maltesi d'Oggi'' (Rome, 1932). Nevertheless, Cuschieri also wrote perceptive poems in the [[Maltese language]], especially from 1909 onwards (after being heartily encourage by Napoleon Tagliaferro). These he published in various cultural and religious periodicals. Due to his beautiful poems lauding the Maltese language, he became known as ''il-poeta tal-kelma Maltija'' (the poet of the Maltese idiom). Nonetheless, in religious circles he also became known as ''il-poeta tal-Madonna'' (the poet of the [[Blessed Virgin]]).

===Politics===
Cuschieri was also engaged in party politics. His early commitments were characterised by his love of the Latin culture, and, together with others, decided that Malta's own culture should be defined in [[Italian culture|Latin]], rather than in [[Anglo-Saxon culture#Culture|Anglo-Saxon]], terms. This pitched him against the [[Protestant]] British colonial government of [[Malta]]. Nonetheless, his political commitment had a pronounced social edge. In 1921, when his political activity became more manifest, he was encouraged by a visit to Malta made by the Jesuit [[Plater College|Charles Plater]] to accept an invitation by the ''Unione Cattolica San Giuseppe'' (St. Joseph Catholic Workers' Union) to become the first Director of a Study Club which had the intention of educating workers. This society was domesticated by the [[Catholic Church]] to keep workers away from socialist teachings and action. This was in harmony with Cuschieri's conservative politics.

After 1921 Cuschieri's political engagements continued to grow gradually. The rise to power of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy in 1922 made him, and many others in [[Malta]], look to fascism with increasing fascination and appeal. Like many other [[Neo-Scholasticism|Neo-Thomists]], Cuschieri saw great congruence between the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]' philosophical position and the Italian [[Benito Mussolini#Government|philosophy of fascism]]. By time, Cuschieri became an overt and avowed Fascist, and this was recognised both in Malta and in Italy. In 1932, Cuschieri was elected to [[Parliament of Malta|parliament]] on behalf of the Fascist [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] as a representative of university graduates.

===Philosophy===
Cuschieri was an accomplished adherent of [[Scholasticism]] of the Aristotelico-Thomist type. Throughout his life, by training and by vocation, he was always part of the orthodox branch of this school. Though he was versed in the writings and doctrines of [[Thomas Aquinas]], he never harboured or cultivated a thoroughly speculative mind, even if he seems to have been quite capable of subtleties and abstruse distinctions. Nonetheless, his inclination tended more to the applicability of [[Thomistic]] and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] principles, especially to cater for his audiences in the pastoral fields.

In his own way, even ideologically, Cuschieri was somehow part of the [[Neo-Thomistic]] movement that grew after the wake of [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s pontificate, who gave great impetus, mainly for political reasons, to the movement. All of this, however, ended with [[World War II]], up till which Thomist Scholastics carried on a sort of love-affair with fascism, and this suited Cuschieri very well.

===Last years and death===
After the fall of fascism and the end of the war, Cuschieri proceeded with his pastoral and academic work. Throughout his life he loved sports, especially [[Association football|football]]. Nevertheless, when he grew older, he preferred to play [[billiards]], especially at the Civil Service Sports Club of which he was a member. Alternatively, he cherished frequenting friends, especially members of the ''[[Akkademja tal-Malti]]'' (Academy of the Maltese Language), and discussing current affairs, literature and philosophy.

On August 15, 1959, Cuschieri suffered a grave setback in his health. He had become bed-bound at the Carmelite convent at [[Valletta]], and gradually grew paralysed. His ailment and sufferings continued for three years. On July 17, 1962, he was administered the [[last rites]], and eight days later, on July 25, 1962, he died.

==Works==
A collection of Cuschieri's poetry was published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Charló Camilleri and Toni Cortis.&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding his poetry, Cuschieri otherwise published very little in his lifetime. Nevertheless, a large number of manuscripts still exist. These were kept in his personal possession, and later passed on into the archive of the Carmelites at Valletta. Most of them were typed by Cuschieri himself, and sometimes annotated in his own hand. All are in Italian. The writings which contain philosophical content (that is, excluding the purely religious or devotional essays) are, namely, the following:

===Published===
* 1905 – Di alcune proprietà del genio (On some properties of the intellect).&lt;ref name="M_2001_I_103_104"/&gt; An article in Italian published in ''Malta Letteraria'' discussing the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] properties and functions of human reasoning.
* 1913–15 – Three articles in Italian published in Italy's ''Rivista di Filosofia Neo-Scolastica'':&lt;ref name="M_2001_I_103_104"/&gt;
** ''A proposito del problema criteriologico'' (Concerning the criteriological problem).
** ''Il problema criteriologico o il problema ontologico'' (The criteriological problem or the ontological problem).
** ''A proposito di soluzioni e problemi'' (Concerning solutions and problems).
:The articles were composed in response, and opposition, to [[Benedetto Croce]]'s [[idealism]] concerning the [[criteria of truth]] (or 'criteriology', as the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] used to call them). The compositions came under the scrutiny of [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] such as [[Angelo Pirotta]] and other foreign [[Thomistic]] heavy-weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1915 – ''In Morte di Napoleone Tagliaferro'' (On the Death of Napoleon Tagliaferro).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 203}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 16-page pamphlet in Italian published in [[Malta]] (Daily Malta Chronicle) which reproduces a talk Cuschieri delivered at the ''aula magna'' of the [[University of Malta]] on November 4, 1915, in a ceremony commemorating the [[archaeologist]], [[philologist]], mathematician, and writer Napoleon Tagliaferro who had recently died. Cuschieri focuses mainly on love of country.
* 1919 – ''Per la Messa Novella di Goffredo Lubrano'' (For the Solemn Mass of Goffredo Lubrano).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 17-page pamphlet in Italian published in [[Malta]] (Scuola Tip. Salesiana, [[Sliema]]) which reproduces a talk which Cuschieri delivered at the [[Senglea]] parish church on September 21, 1919, during the first mass of the newly ordained [[Doctor of Law]], Goffredo Lubrano. Cuschieri's talk was mainly about the importance of Christians' commitment towards the poor and the oppressed.

[[File:Ann Graybiel 2001.jpg|thumb|Graybiel receives the Medal of Science from President Bush in 2001]]
'''Ann Martin Graybiel''' (born 1942) is an [[Institute Professor]] and a faculty member in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. She is also an investigator at the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]]. She is an expert on the [[basal ganglia]] and the neurophysiology of habit formation, and her work is relevant to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], substance abuse and other disorders that affect the basal ganglia.

== Research ==
For much of her career, Graybiel has focused on the physiology of the [[striatum]], a basal ganglia structure implicated in the control of movement, cognition, habit formation, and decision-making. In the late 1970s, Graybiel discovered that while striatal neurons appeared to be an amorphous mass, they were in fact organized into chemical compartments, which she termed [[striosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/75/11/5723.short|title = Histochemically distinct compartments in the striatum of human, monkey, and cat demonstrated by acetylthiocholinesterase staining|last = Graybiel|first = AM|date = November 1978|journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|accessdate = 23 October 2014|doi = 10.1073/pnas.75.11.5723|pmid =  103101|last2 = Ragsdale, Jr.|first2 = CW|issue = 11|pages = 5723–26|publication-date = 1978|volume = 75|pmc=393041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research revealed links between striosomal abnormalities and neurological disorders, such as mood dysfunction in Huntington's disease&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/130/1/206.long|title = Striosomes and mood dysfunction in Huntington's disease|last = Tippet|first = LJ|date = Jan 2007|journal = Brain|accessdate = 23 October 2014|doi = 10.1093/brain/awl243|pmid =  17040921|last2 = Waldvogel|first2 = HJ|last3 = Thomas|first3 = SJ|last4 = Hogg|first4 = VM|last5 = van Roon-Mom|first5 = W|last6 = Synek|first6 = BJ|last7 = Graybiel|first7 = AM|last8 = Faull|first8 = RL|volume = 130|issue = 1|pages = 206–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depletion of dopamine in Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v307/n5946/abs/307062a0.html|title = Weaver mutation has differential effects on the dopamine-containing innervation of the limbic and nonlimbic striatum|last = Roffler-Tarlov|first = S|date = 5 Jan 1984|journal = Nature|accessdate = 23 October 2014|doi = 10.1038/307062a0|pmid = |last2 = Graybiel|first2 = AM|volume = 307|pages = 62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graybiel's subsequent research demonstrated how modular organization of the striatum relates to cognition, learning, and habit formation. She found that neurons project from areas in the sensory and motor cortices governing the same body part and cluster together in the striatum, forming matrisomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jn.physiology.org/content/66/4/1249|title = Corticostriatal transformations in the primate somatosensory system.

In later work, Graybiel demonstrated, first in the striatum and later in the infralimbic cortex, that a task-bracket or “chunking” pattern of neuronal activity emerges when a habit is formed, wherein neurons activate when a habitual task is initiated, show little activity during the task, and reactivate when the task is completed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(13)00490-X|title = A dual operator view of habitual behavior reflecting cortical and striatal dynamics|last = Smith|first = KS|date = July 2013|journal = Neuron|accessdate = 23 October 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.05.038|pmid = 23810540|last2 = Graybiel|first2 = AM|volume = 79|issue = 2|pages = 361–74|pmc=3951965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent work, Graybiel has focused on identifying specific pathways underlying aspects of behavior such as habit formation, learning and cognition, and decision-making, including being the first to analyze the effect of dopamine depletion on the activity of neurons affected by Parkinson's disease during behavioral tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/11/4782.short|title = Selective effects of dopamine depletion and L-DOPA therapy on learning-related firing dynamics of striatal neurons|last = Hernandez|first = LF|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Neuroscience|accessdate = 23 October 2014|doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3746-12.2013|pmid = 23486949|last2 = Kubota|first2 = Y|last3 = Hu|first3 = D|last4 = Howe|first4 = MW|last5 = Lemaire|first5 = N|last6 = Graybiel|first6 = AM|volume = 33|issue = 11|pages = 4782–95|pmc=3655722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2013/parkinsons-disease-pathway-0312|title = MIT News|last = Trafton|first = Anne|date = 12 March 2013|work = Breaking down the Parkinson’s pathway|accessdate = 23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41996">{{Nihongo3|"hamlet people"/"village people", "those who live in hamlets/villages"|部落民|'''Burakumin'''}} is an outcast group at the bottom of the traditional Japanese social order that has historically been the victim of severe discrimination and ostracism. They were originally members of outcast communities in the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|feudal era]], composed of those with occupations considered [[ritual impurity|impure]] or tainted by death (such as executioners, undertakers, workers in slaughterhouses, butchers, or tanners), which have severe social stigmas of ''[[kegare]]'' ({{lang|ja|穢れ}} or "defilement") attached to them. Traditionally, the Burakumin lived in their own communities, [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]], or [[ghettos]].

==Terminology==
The term {{lang|ja|部落}} ''buraku'' literally refers to a small, generally rural, commune or a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. People from regions of Japan where "discriminated communities" no longer exist (e.g. anywhere north of Tokyo) may refer to any hamlet as a ''buraku'', indicating the word's use is not necessarily pejorative.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Historically the term was used for an outcast community that was heavily discriminated against officially and formally.

A widely used term for buraku settlements is '''dōwa chiku''' ({{lang|ja|同和地区}} "assimilation districts"), an official term for districts designated for government and local authority assimilation projects.

The social issue surrounding "discriminated communities" is usually referred to as '''dōwa mondai''' ({{lang|ja|同和問題}} "assimilation issues") or less commonly, '''buraku mondai''' ({{lang|ja|部落問題}}"hamlet issues").

In the [[Tokugawa period|feudal era]], the outcaste were called '''eta''' ({{lang|ja|穢多}}, literally, "an abundance of defilement" or "an abundance of filth"), a term now considered derogatory. ''Eta'' towns were called ''etamura'' (穢多村).

Some burakumin refer to their own communities as "mura" ({{lang|ja|村}} "villages") and themselves as "mura-no-mono" ({{lang|ja|村の者}} "village people").{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Other outcaste groups from whom Buraku may have been descended included the ''hinin'' (非人—literally "non-human"). The definition of ''hinin'', as well as their social status and typical occupations varied over time, but typically included ex-convicts and vagrants who worked as town guards, street cleaners or entertainers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the 19th century the umbrella term ''burakumin'' was coined to name the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan Encyclopedia|first=Louis|last=Frédéric|isbn=9780674017535|series=Harvard University Press Reference Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2002|publisher=Belknap|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term burakumin does not refer to any [[ethnic minorities in Japan]].

==Historical origins==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
There are many theories as to how and in which era the outcast communities came into existence. For example, it is disputed whether society started ostracizing those who worked in tainted occupations or whether those who originally dropped out of society were forced to work in tainted occupations.

According to the latter view, [[displaced persons|displaced]] populations during the internal wars of the [[Muromachi era]] may have been relocated and forced into low-status occupations, for example, as public sanitation workers.

The social status and typical occupations of outcast communities have varied considerably according to region and over time.  A burakumin neighborhood within metropolitan [[Tokyo]] was the last to be served by [[tram|streetcar]] and is the site of butcher and leather shops to this day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

At the start of the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867), the [[social class]] system (more properly, a caste system, since it was based upon birth and not upon economics) was officially established as a means of designating hierarchy, and ''eta'' were placed at the lowest level, outside of the [[Four divisions of society|four main divisions of society]]. Like the rest of the population, they were bound by [[sumptuary laws]] based on the inheritance of their social class. The ''eta'' lived in  [[geographical segregation|segregated]] settlements, and were generally avoided by the rest of Japanese society. 'Eta' were never allowed to change caste, unlike the other castes who, depending on special circumstances, could move into a different class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

When dealing with members of other castes, they were expected to display signs of subservience, such as the removal of [[headwear]]. Physical contact was considered absolutely taboo and required ritual purification for the non-eta person. In an 1859 court case described by author [[Shimazaki Toson]], a magistrate declared that "An ''eta'' is worth 1/7 of an ordinary person." They could be killed with impunity by members of the samurai caste.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Historically, ''eta'' were not liable for taxation in feudal times, including the [[Tokugawa Shogunate|Tokugawa period]], because the taxation system was based on rice yields, which they were not permitted to possess. Some outcasts were also called ''kawaramono'' ({{lang|ja|河原者}}, "dried-up riverbed people") because they lived along river banks that could not be turned into rice fields.

Since the taboo status of the work they performed afforded them an effective monopoly in their trades, some succeeded economically and even occasionally obtained [[samurai]] status through marrying or the outright purchase of troubled houses, although their status as former 'eta' would have to be kept secret.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Some historians point out that such exclusive rights originated in ancient times, granted by shrines, temples, [[kuge]], or the imperial court, which held authority before the [[Shogunate]] system was established.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==End of the feudal era==
[[File:Jiichiro Matumoto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The most famous leader of the [[Buraku Liberation League|BLL]],  [[Jiichirō Matsumoto]] (1887–1966), who was born a burakumin in [[Fukuoka prefecture|Fukuoka]]. He was a statesman and called "the father of buraku liberation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss12/reber_old.shtml Buraku Mondai in Japan: Historical and Modern Perspectives and Directions for the Future] - Emily A. Su-lan Reber&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The feudal caste system in Japan formally ended in 1869 with the [[Meiji restoration]]. In 1871, the newly formed [[Meiji Era|Meiji]] government issued a decree called ''Senmin Haishirei'' ([[:ja:賤民廃止令|賤民廃止令]] ''Edict Abolishing Ignoble Classes'') giving outcasts equal legal status.  It is currently better known as the ''Kaihōrei'' ([[:ja:解放令|解放令]] ''Emancipation Edict'').  However, the elimination of their economic monopolies over certain occupations actually led to a decline in their general living standards, while social discrimination simply continued.  For example, the ban on consumption of meat from livestock was lifted in 1871 in order to "westernise" the country, and many former ''eta'' moved on to work in [[slaughterhouse|abattoirs]] and as [[butcher]]s.

However, slow-changing social attitudes, especially in the countryside, meant that abattoirs and workers were met with hostility from local residents. Continued ostracism as well as the decline in living standards led to former ''eta'' communities turning into slum areas.

There were many terms used to indicate former outcastes, their communities or settlements at the time. Official documents at the time referred to them as ''kyu-eta'' ({{lang|ja|旧穢多}} "former eta"), while the newly liberated outcasts called themselves ''shin-heimin'' ({{lang|ja|新平民}} "new citizens"), among other things.

The term ''tokushu buraku'' (特殊部落 "special hamlets", now considered inappropriate) started being used by officials in the 1900s, leading to the meaning of the word ''buraku'' ("hamlet") coming to imply  former ''eta'' villages in certain parts of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Movements to resolve the problem in the early 20th century were divided into two camps: the {{Nihongo|"assimilation"|同和|dōwa}} movement which encouraged improvements in living standards of ''buraku'' communities and integration with the mainstream Japanese society, and the {{Nihongo|"levelers"|水平社|suiheisha}} movement which concentrated on confronting and criticising alleged perpetrators of discrimination.

==Post-war situation==
Although legally liberated in 1871, with the abolition of the feudal [[caste system]], this did not put an end to social [[discrimination]] against them nor their lower living standards because [[Koseki|Japanese family registration]] was fixed to ancestral home address until recently, which allowed people to deduce their Burakumin membership.

The long history of [[taboo]]s and [[myths]] of the ''buraku'' left a legacy of social desolation and since the 1980s, more and more young ''buraku'' have started to organize and [[protest]] against alleged social misfortunes, encouraged by political activist groups. Movements with objectives ranging from liberation to encouraging integration have been tried over the years to put an end to this problem.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Demographics===
The number of Burakumin asserted to be living in modern Japan varies from source to source. A 1993 investigative report by the [[Politics of Japan|Japanese Government]] counted 4,533 ''dōwa chiku'' ({{lang|ja|同和地区}} "assimilation districts" - Buraku communities officially designated for assimilation projects), mostly in western Japan, comprising 298,385 households with 892,751 residents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The size of each community ranged from under five households to over 1,000 households, with 155 households being the average size. About three quarters of settlements are in rural areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The distribution of discriminated communities varied greatly from region to region.

According to a survey conducted by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;"東京の被差別部落の歴史と現状・全文" (in Japanese)[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~mg5s-hsgw/tkburaku/history/tkbtxt.html], Buraku Liberation League, Tokyo. 23 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 76% of Tokyo residents would not change their view of a close neighbor whom they discovered to be a burakumin; 4.9% of respondents, on the other hand, would actively avoid a burakumin neighbor. There is still a [[social stigma|stigma]] attached to being a resident of certain areas traditionally associated with the burakumin and some lingering [[Ethnic issues in Japan|discrimination]] in matters such as [[Marriage in Japan|marriage]] and [[Economy of Japan|employment]].

The [[Buraku Liberation League]] (BLL), on the other hand, extrapolates [[Meiji-era]] figures to arrive at an estimate of nearly three million burakumin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/7/alldritt001.html |title=The Burakumin: The Complicity of Japanese Buddhism in Oppression and an Opportunity for Liberation |author=Leslie D. Alldritt |publisher=Journal of Buddhist Ethics |date=July 2000 |issn=1076-9005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125094650/http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/7/alldritt001.html |archivedate=2005-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 source indicates the presence of some two million burakumin, living in approximately 5,000 settlements.

In some areas, burakumin are in a majority; they account for over 70 percent of all residents of [[Yoshikawa, Kōchi|Yoshikawa]] in [[Kōchi Prefecture]]. In [[Oto, Fukuoka|Ōtō]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], they account for over 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|ja|図説　今日の部落差別　各地の実態調査結果より}}" P.31 (March 15, 1997 published by [[:ja:部落解放・人権研究所|BLHRRI]]) {{ISBN|4-7592-0193-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese government statistics show the number of residents of assimilation districts who claim buraku ancestry, whereas BLL figures are estimates of the total number of descendants of all former and current buraku residents, including current residents with no buraku ancestry.

===Discrimination in access to services===
While in many parts of the country ''buraku'' settlements, built on the site of former ''eta'' villages, ceased to exist by the 1960s because of either urban development or integration into mainstream society, in other regions many of their residents continued to suffer from slum-like housing and infrastructure, lower economic status, illiteracy, and lower general educational standards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1969, the government passed the Special Measures Law for Assimilation Projects to provide funding to these communities. Communities deemed to be in need of funding were designated for various Assimilation Projects ({{lang|ja|同和対策事業}} ''dōwa taisaku jigyō''), such as construction of new housing and community facilities such as health centers, libraries and swimming pools. The projects were terminated in 2002 with a total funding of an estimated 12 trillion yen over 33 years, with the living standards issue effectively resolved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Social discrimination===
Cases of social discrimination against residents of ''buraku'' areas are still an issue in certain regions. Outside of the [[Kansai]] region, people in general are often not even aware of the issue, and if they are, usually only as part of feudal history. Due to the taboo nature of the topic, it is rarely covered by the media, and people from eastern Japan, for example, are often shocked when they learn that it is a continuing issue.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The prejudice most often manifests itself in the form of marriage discrimination, and less often, in employment. Traditionalist families have been known to check on the backgrounds of potential in-laws to identify people of ''buraku'' background. These checks are now illegal, and marriage discrimination is diminishing; Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that between 60 and 80% of burakumin marry a non-burakumin, whereas for people born in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the rate was 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nancho.net/kyoto/nadamoto.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases of continuing social discrimination are known to occur mainly in western Japan, particularly in the [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyogo]], and [[Hiroshima]] regions, where many people, especially the older generation, stereotype ''buraku'' residents (whatever their ancestry) and associate them with squalor, unemployment and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japanfocus.org/article.asp?id%3D485 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430222434/http://japanfocus.org/article.asp?id=485 |archivedate=2006-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No discriminated-against communities were identified in the following [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]]: [[Hokkaido]], [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]], [[Yamagata Prefecture|Yamagata]], [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], and [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blhrri.org/nyumon/yougo/nyumon_yougo_02.htm |script-title=ja:同和地区 |language=Japanese |publisher=Buraku Liberation and Human Rights Research Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522103357/http://blhrri.org/nyumon/yougo/nyumon_yougo_02.htm |archivedate=2006-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokkaido and Okinawa have had their own separate history of discrimination of their native ethnic groups the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and the [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]], respectively.

===Yakuza membership===
According to [[David Kaplan (author)|David E. Kaplan]] and Alec Dubro in ''Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld'' (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1986), burakumin account for about 70 percent of the members of [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], the biggest [[yakuza]] syndicate in Japan.

Mitsuhiro Suganuma, an ex-member of the [[Public Security Intelligence Agency]], testified that burakumin account for about 60 percent of the members of the entire yakuza.&lt;ref name="Suganuma"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by Mitsuhiro Suganuma|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA1X2gCImbQ|work=Japanese Yakuza|page=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Tokushu Buraku Chimei Sōkan" incident===
In November 1975, the Osaka branch of the Buraku Liberation League was tipped off about the existence of a book called "A Comprehensive List of Buraku Area Names" ({{lang|ja|特殊部落地名総鑑}} ''Tokushu Buraku Chimei Sōkan''). Investigations revealed that copies of the hand-written 330-page book were being secretly sold by an Osaka-based firm to numerous firms and individuals throughout Japan by a mail order service called Cablenet, at between ¥5,000 and ¥50,000 per copy. The book contained a nationwide list of all the names and locations of ''buraku'' settlements (as well as the primary means of employment of their inhabitants), which could be compared against people's addresses to determine if they were ''buraku'' residents. The preface contained the following message: "At this time, we have decided to go against public opinion and create this book [for] personnel managers grappling with employment issues, and families pained by problems with their children's marriages."{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

More than 200 large Japanese firms, including (according to the Buraku Liberation and Human Rights Research Institute of Osaka) [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Honda]] and [[Daihatsu]], along with thousands of individuals purchased copies of the book. In 1985, partially in response to the popularity of this book, and an increase in ''mimoto chōsa'' ({{lang|ja|身元調査}}, private investigation into one's background) the Osaka prefectural government introduced "An Ordinance to Regulate Personal Background Investigation Conducive to Buraku Discrimination".{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Although the production and sale of the book has been banned, numerous copies of it are still in existence, and in 1997, an Osaka private investigation firm was the first to be charged with violation of the 1985 statute for using the text.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Nonaka incident===
[[File:Hiromu Nonaka 199807.jpg|thumb|Hiromu Nonaka]]
In 2001, future Prime Minister of Japan [[Tarō Asō]], along with [[Hiromu Nonaka]], was among the LDP's chief candidates to succeed [[Yoshirō Mori]] as prime minister of Japan. During a meeting of LDP leaders at which Nonaka was not present, Asō reportedly told the assembled group, "We are not going to let someone from the buraku become the prime minister, are we?".&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;Yamaguchi, Mari, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090125a2.html Discrimination claims die hard in Japan]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 January 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonaka subsequently withdrew as a candidate. Asō's comment about Nonaka's heritage was revealed in 2005. Asō denied that he had made the statement, but [[Hisaoki Kamei]], who was present at the 2001 meeting, stated in January 2009 that he had heard Asō say something "to that effect".&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt;

==Burakumin rights movement==
As early as 1922, leaders of the Hisabetsu Buraku organized a movement, the "Levelers Association of Japan" (''Suiheisha''), to advance their rights.  The Declaration of the Suiheisha encouraged the burakumin to unite in resistance to discrimination, and sought to frame a positive identity for the victims of discrimination, insisting that the time had come to be "proud of being ''eta"''.

The declaration portrayed the burakumin ancestors as "manly martyrs of industry" and argued that to submit meekly to oppression would be to insult and profane these ancestors. Despite internal divisions among anarchist, Bolshevik, and social democratic factions, and despite the Japanese government's establishment of an alternate organization Yūma movement, designed to undercut the influence of the Suiheisha, the Levelers Association remained active until the late 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

After [[World War II]], the National Committee for Burakumin Liberation was founded, changing its name to the [[Buraku Liberation League]] (''Buraku Kaihō Dōmei'') in the 1950s. The league, with the support of the [[Japan Socialist Party|socialist]] and [[Japan Communist Party|communist]] parties, pressured the government into making important concessions in the late 1960s and 1970s.

In the 1960s the [[Sayama Incident]] (狭山事件), which involved the murder conviction of a member of the discriminated communities based on circumstantial evidence (which is generally given little weight vs. physical evidence in Japanese courts), focused public attention on the problems of the group.

One concession was the passing of the ''Special Measures Law for Assimilation Projects'', which provided financial aid for the discriminated communities. Also, in 1976, legislation was put in place which banned third parties from looking up another person's  family registry ([[koseki]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

This traditional system of registry, kept for all Japanese by the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] since the 19th century, would reveal an individual's ''buraku'' ancestry if consulted. Under the new legislation, these records could now be consulted only in legal cases, making it more difficult to identify or discriminate against members of the group.

In the 1980s some educators and local governments, particularly in areas with relatively large ''hisabetsu buraku'' populations, began special education programs which they hoped would encourage greater educational and economic success for young members of the group and decrease the discrimination they faced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Branches of burakumin rights groups exist today in all parts of Japan except for [[Hokkaidō]] and [[Okinawa]].

"Human Rights Promotion Centers" (人権啓発センター) have been set up across the country by prefectural governments and local authorities; these, in addition to promoting ''burakumin'' rights, campaign on behalf of a wide range of groups such as women, the disabled, ethnic minorities, foreign residents and released prisoners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Even into the early 1990s, however, discussion of the 'liberation' of these discriminated communities, or even their existence, was taboo in public discussion.

===Buraku Liberation League and the Zenkairen===
The [[Buraku Liberation League]] is considered one of the most militant among burakumin's rights groups. The BLL is known for its fierce "denunciation and explanation sessions", where alleged perpetrators of discriminatory actions or speech are summoned for a public hearing before a panel of activists.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Early sessions were marked by occasions of violence and kidnapping, and several BLL activists have been arrested for such acts. The legality of these sessions is still disputed, but to this date the authorities have mostly turned a blind eye to them except in the more extreme cases.&lt;ref&gt;Upham, Frank K. (1987), Instrumental Violence and the Struggle for Buraku Liberation_, 146-190, in Michael Weiner (ed.), ''Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan Volume II Indigenous and Colonial Others'', London and New York: Routledge Curzon.  {{ISBN|0-415-20856-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pharr, Susan J. (1990), Burakumin Protest: The incident at Yoka High School_, 133-145, in Michael Weiner(ed.), ''Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan Volume II Indigenous and Colonial Others'', London and New York: Routledge Curzon. {{ISBN|0-415-20856-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ichinomiya Yoshinari and Group K21 and Terazono Atsushi (eds.)

In 1990, [[Karel van Wolferen]]'s criticism of the BLL in his much-acclaimed book ''[[The Enigma of Japanese Power]]'' prompted the BLL to demand the publisher halt publication of the Japanese translation of the book.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Van Wolferen condemned this as an international scandal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The other major buraku activist group is the National Buraku Liberation Alliance (全国部落解放運動連合会 ''Zenkoku Buraku Kaihō Undō Rengōkai'', or '''Zenkairen'''), affiliated to the [[Japanese Communist Party]] (JCP). It was formed in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Neary, Ian (1997), Burakumin In Contemporary Japan_, 50-78, in Michael Weiner (ed.), ''Japan's Minorities: The Illusion of Homogeneity'', London: Routledge p. 66 {{ISBN|0-415-15218-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by BLL activists who were either purged from the organization or abandoned it in the late 1960s due to, among other things, their opposition to the decision that subsidies to the burakumin should be limited to the BLL members only. Not all burakumin were BLL members and not all residents of the areas targeted for subsidies were historically descendent from the out-caste.&lt;ref name="Upham 1987"&gt;Upham (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Zenkairen'' often came head-to-head with the BLL, accusing them of chauvinism. The bickering between the two organizations boiled over in 1974 when a clash between teachers belonging to a JCP-affiliated union and BLL activists at a high school in Yoka, rural [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], put 29 in hospital.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1988, the BLL formed the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism (IMADR). The BLL sought for the IMADR to be recognized as a [[United Nations]] [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Government Organization]], but in 1991, the ''Zenkairen'' informed the [[United Nations]] about the alleged human rights violations committed by the BLL in the course of their 'denunciation sessions' held with accused 'discriminators'.&lt;ref name="Upham 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ichinomiya, Group K21 and Terazono (eds.) (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--reference refers only to the characterisation and terminology of the 'crimes' not to the IMADR application to the UN--&gt;&lt;!-- What crimes were those??? --&gt;

According to a BLL-funded think tank, when suspected cases of discrimination were uncovered, the ''Zenkairen'' often conducted denunciation sessions as fierce as those of the BLL. Nonetheless, the IMADR was designated a UN human rights NGO in March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Buraku Liberation and Human Rights Research Institute (2005 [2004]), Photo Document of the Post-war 60 Years-Development of the Buraku Liberation Movement, Osaka: Kaiho Publishing Company Ltd. {{ISBN|4-7592-4116-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2004, the ''Zenkairen'' announced that "the ''buraku'' issue has basically been resolved" and formally disbanded. On 4 March 2004 they launched a new organization called "National Confederation of Human Rights Movements in The Community" (全国地域人権運動総連合　'Zenkoku Chiiki Jinken Undō Sōrengō') or ''Zenkoku Jinken Ren''.&lt;ref&gt;"Zenkoku Buraku Kaihou Undou Rengkai" (National Buraku Liberation Alliance) (2004), "Zenkairen Dai 34 Kai Teiki Taikai Ni Tuite" ('About the Zenkairen 34th Regular Meeting), available at http://www.geocities.jp/zenkairen21/01-5.html [26 February 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Zenkoku Chiiki Jinken Undou Sourengou" (National Confederation of Human-Rights Movements in the Community)(2008) Blog, available at http://zjr.sakura.ne.jp/ [28 February 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious discrimination==
&lt;!-- Could someone with more expertise in this area than I please attempt to clean this section up and give it more perspective --&gt;

According to BLL sources, nearly all Japanese Buddhist sects have discriminated against the burakumin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Zenkairen disputes this.

[[Jōdo_Shinshū|Jodo Shinshu Buddhism]] was the original supporter of lower castes. The side-effect of this liberating philosophy, however, was that it led to a series of anti-feudal rebellions, known as the [[Ikkō-ikki]] revolts, which seriously threatened the religious and political status-quo. Accordingly, the political powers engineered a situation whereby the Jōdo Shinshū split into two competing branches, the [[Shinshu Otani|Shinshu Otani-ha]] and the [[Hongan-ji|Honganji-ha]]. &lt;!-- I'm not sure how relevant this is to the burakumin, but how?? --&gt; This had the consequence that the sects moved increasingly away from their anti-feudal position towards a feudal one.

Later the state also forced all people to belong to a specific Buddhist school according to the formula:

{{quote|the imperial family is in [[Tendai]], the peerage is in [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]], the nobility is in [[Pure Land Buddhism|Jōdo]] (Honen's followers), the Samurai is in [[Zen]], the beggar is in [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]], and [[Jōdo Shinshū|Shin]] Buddhists (Shinran's followers) are at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara 1996&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In consequence the Honganji, which under [[Rennyo]]'s leadership had defiantly accepted the derogatory label of 'the dirty sect' (see [[Rennyo#Writings_and_Liturgy|Rennyo's letters known as the Ofumi/Gobunsho]]) now began to discriminate against its own burakumin members as it jostled for political and social status.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1922, when the National Levelers' Association (Zenkoku-suiheisha) was founded in Kyoto, Mankichi Saiko, a founder of the movement and Jodo Shinshu priest, said:

{{quote|We shouldn't disgrace our ancestors and violate humanity by our harsh words and terrible actions. We, who know how cold the human world is, and how to take care of humanity, can seek and rejoice from the bottom of our hearts in the warmth and light of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shindharmanet.com/writings/burakumin.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503084212/http://www.shindharmanet.com/writings/burakumin.htm |archivedate=2005-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After many petitions from the BLL, in 1969 the Honganji changed its opinion on the burakumin issue.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Zenkairen, which split from the BLL in 1968, regrets this decision.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Religious discrimination against the burakumin was not recognized until the BLL's criticism sessions became widespread. For example, in 1979 the Director-General of the [[Sōtō]] Sect of Buddhism made a speech at the "3rd [[Religions for Peace|World Conference on Religion and Peace]]" claiming that there was no discrimination against burakumin in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''Cyril Edwin Mitchinson Joad''' (12 August 1891 – 9 April 1953) was an English [[philosopher]] and broadcasting personality. He appeared on ''[[The Brains Trust]]'', a [[BBC Radio]] wartime discussion programme. He popularised philosophy and became a celebrity, before his downfall in a scandal over an unpaid train fare in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C. E. M. Joad|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/c-e-m-joad|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=14 February 2014|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joad was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]], the only son of Edwin and Mary Joad (née Smith). In 1892 his father became an Inspector of Schools and the family moved to [[Southampton]], where he received a very strict Christian upbringing. Joad started school at the age of five in 1896, attending Oxford Preparatory School (later called the [[Dragon School]]) until 1906, and then [[Blundell's School]], Tiverton, Devon, until 1910.

===Balliol College===
In 1910 Joad went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. Here he developed his skills as a philosopher and debater. By 1912 he was a first class sportsman and [[Oxford Union]] debater. He also became a [[Syndicalist]], a Guild Socialist and then a [[Fabian Society|Fabian]]. In 1913 he heard about [[George Bernard Shaw]] through the newly-founded magazine the ''[[New Statesman]]''. This developed his study of philosophy, one of the building blocks for his career as a teacher and broadcaster. After completing his course at Balliol, achieving a first in Honour Moderations in [[Literae Humaniores]] (1912),&lt;ref&gt;This corrects an error in Geoffrey Thomas, ''Cyril Joad'', p. 8, in which Joad is credited with a first in classical moderations.&lt;/ref&gt; a first in Greats (a combination of philosophy and ancient history, 1914) and [[John Locke]] scholarship in mental philosophy (1914), Joad entered the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C. E. M. Joad|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/Jjoad.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=15 February 2014|author=John Simkin|date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil service==
Joad began at the [[Board of Trade]] in 1914 after attending a Fabian Summer School. His aim was to infuse the civil service with a socialist ethos. He worked in the Labour Exchanges Department of the Board of Trade, the department becoming the new [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]] in 1916. In the months leading up to the [[First World War]] he displayed "ardent" [[pacifism]], which resulted in political controversy.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[[Stanley J. Kunitz]] and Howard Haycraft, 
''Twentieth Century Authors, A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', (Third Edition). New York, The H.W. Wilson Company, 1950, (p.p. 726-7)&lt;/ref&gt; Joad, along with George Bernard Shaw and [[Bertrand Russell]], became unpopular with many who were trying to encourage men to enlist as soldiers to fight for their country.

==Marriage==
In May 1915 Joad married Mary White, and they bought a home in [[Westhumble]], near [[Dorking]], in [[Surrey]]. The village, formerly home to [[Fanny Burney]], was near to the founder of the [[Fabian Society]], [[Beatrice Webb]]. Joad was so fearful of [[conscription]] that he fled to [[Snowdonia]], [[Wales]], until it was safe to return. After the birth of three children, Joad's marriage ended in separation in 1921. Joad later caused some controversy by stating his separation had caused him to abandon his [[feminism]] and instead adopt a belief in the "inferior mind" of women.&lt;ref name="tca" /&gt;

== Life after separation ==
After the separation Joad moved to [[Hampstead]] in London with a student teacher, Marjorie Thomson. She was the first of many [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]], all of whom were introduced as 'Mrs Joad'. He described sexual desire as "a buzzing [[Blue bottle fly|bluebottle]] that needed to be swatted promptly before it distracted a man of intellect from higher things." He believed that female minds lacked objectivity, and he had no interest in talking to women who would not go to bed with him. By now Joad was "short and rotund, with bright little eyes, round, rosy cheeks, and a stiff, bristly beard."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He dressed in shabby clothing as a test: if people sneered at this they were too petty to merit acquaintance.

Job interviews proved a great difficulty for Joad, due to his flippancy. In 1930, however, he left the civil service to become Head of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]]. Although the department was small, he made full use of his great teaching skills. He popularised philosophy, and many other [[philosophers]] were beginning to take him seriously. With his two books, ''Guide to Modern Thought'' (1933) and ''Guide to Philosophy'' (1936), he became a well-known figure in public society.

==1930s-40s==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13579, Harz, Brocken, Hexenexperiment.jpg|thumb|Joad second from right on the [[Brocken]] in June 1932]]
In his early life Joad very much shared the desire for the destruction of the [[Capitalism|Capitalist system]]. He was expelled from the [[Fabian Society]] in 1925 because of sexual misbehaviour at its summer school, and did not rejoin until 1943. In 1931, disenchanted with Labour in office, Joad became Director of Propaganda for the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]]. Owing to the rise of [[Oswald Mosley]]'s pro-Fascist sympathies, Joad resigned, along with [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]. Soon afterwards he became bitterly opposed to [[Nazism]], but he continued to oppose militarism and gave his support to [[pacifist]] organisations, including the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]].

While at Birkbeck College Joad played a leading role in [[The King and Country debate]]. The motion, devised by David Graham and debated on Thursday 9 February 1933, was "that this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country.” The debate was often interpreted as illustrating both the attitude of Oxford undergraduates and the state of Europe at the time; Adolf Hitler had become Chancellor of Germany just ten days prior to the debate. Joad was the principal speaker in favour of the proposition, which passed by a vote of 275 to 153. Joad’s speech was described as “well-organized and well-received, and probably the single most important reason for the outcome of the debate.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, “The ‘King and Country’ Debate, 1933: Student Politics, Pacifism and the Dictators.” ''The Historical Journal'', June 1979, 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Joad's part in the debate caused him to gain a public reputation as an absolute pacifist.&lt;ref name="tca" /&gt; Joad was also involved in the [[National Peace Council]], which he chaired, 1937-38.

Joad was an outspoken controversialist; he declared his main intellectual influences were [[George Bernard Shaw]] and
[[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref name="tca" /&gt; He was strongly critical of contemporary philosophical trends such as [[Marxism]], [[Behaviorism]] and [[Psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="tca" /&gt; He was also repeatedly referred to as
"the [[H. L. Mencken|Mencken]] of England", although, as Kunitz and Haycraft pointed out, Joad and Mencken "would be 
at sword's point on most issues".&lt;ref name="tca" /&gt;

Joad crusaded to preserve the English countryside against industrial exploitation, [[ribbon development]], overhead cables and destructive tourism. He wrote letters and articles in protest against decisions being made to increase Britain's wealth and status, as he believed the short term status would bring long term problems. He organised rambles and rode recklessly through the countryside. Joad was also associated with the fledgling [[naturist]] movement in England.{{sfn|Hill|2011|p=17}}{{sfn|Connell|2011|p=21}}{{sfn|Turton|2007|p=91}} He also had a passion for hunting.

Hating the idea of nothing to do, Joad organised on average nine lectures per week and two books per year. His popularity soared and he was invited to give many lectures and lead discussions. He also involved himself in sporting activities such as tennis and [[hockey]], and recreational activities such as [[Contract bridge|bridge]], [[chess]] and the [[player piano]]. He was a great conversationalist, and enjoyed entertaining distinguished members of society.

After the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] he became disgusted at the lack of [[liberty]] being shown (he was a founding vice-president of the [[National Council for Civil Liberties]] from 1934). He went as far as to beg the [[Minister of Information|Ministry of Information]] to make use of him. In January 1940 Joad was selected for a BBC Home Service wartime discussion programme, ''The Brains Trust'', which was an immediate success, attracting millions of listeners. Shortly afterwards Joad abandoned his pacifism and placed his support behind the British war effort. &lt;ref&gt;"In May 1940...other leading pacifists, including Joad, [[Rose Macaulay|Macaulay]] and [[A. A. Milne]], made highly publicized recantations..." Martin Ceadel, ''Semi-Detached Idealists : the British Peace Movement and international relations, 1854-1945'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.{{ISBN|9780199241170}} (p.406).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Joad never reverted to pacifism, he actively supported at least one [[conscientious objector]] during the war, leading to a pamphlet, ''The Present Position of Conscientious Objection'', published by the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors, 1944. Joad also opposed the continuation of conscription into peacetime, writing the pamphlet ''The Rational Approach to Conscription'', published by the No Conscription Council, 1947.

==Psychical research==

[[File:Price and Joad in haunted bed.jpg|thumb|Joad with the psychic researcher [[Harry Price]] in an alleged haunted bed.]]

Joad was interested in the [[paranormal]], and partnered [[Harry Price]] on a number of [[ghost-hunting]] expeditions, also joining [[the Ghost Club]], of which Price became the president. He involved himself in psychical research, travelling to the [[Harz Mountains]] to help Price to test whether the 'Bloksberg Tryst' would turn a male goat into a handsome prince at the behest of a maiden pure in heart; it did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Trevor H. Hall|Trevor Hall]] | publisher=[[Gerald Duckworth and Company]] | date=Oct 1978 | isbn=0-7156-1143-7 | title=Search for Harry Price | pages=160–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he became Chairman of the [[University of London Council for Psychical Investigation]], an unofficial committee formed by Price as a successor body to his [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fifty Years of Psychical Research | author=Harry Price | authorlink=Harry Price | edition=reprint | publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-7661-4242-6 | page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Joad's publications on psychical research were severely criticised in the ''Proceedings'' of the [[Society for Psychical Research]]. It was discovered that Joad was not present at séances he had claimed to have attended.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, W. H. (1939). [https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsofsoc45soci#page/216/mode/2up ''Adventures in Psychical Research by C. E. M. Joad'']. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research 45: 217-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Price later suspended the operations of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''op. cit.'', pp. 170–173&lt;/ref&gt; 

Joad opposed the spiritualist hypothesis of [[mediumship]]. He debated the psychical researcher Shaw Desmond on spiritualism. He argued against immortality and spirit communication preferring his "mindlet" hypothesis which held that [[Bundle theory|bundle of ideas]] which were formerly regarded as the mind of the dead person may survive death for a temporal period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, Shawl; Joad, C. E. M. (1946). ''Spiritualism. By S. Desmond-for- &amp; C.E.M. Joad-against''. Muse Arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joad, C. E. M. ''Returning to the Church''. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; During the later years of his life he published articles on how [[extrasensory perception]] may fit into a Christian framework.&lt;ref&gt;Gudas, Fabian. (1985). ''Extrasensory Perception''. Arno Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Brains Trust''==
Joad's prominence came from ''[[The Brains Trust]]'', which featured a small group including Commander [[A. B. Campbell]] and [[Julian Huxley]]. His developed and matured discussion techniques, his fund of anecdotes and mild humour brought him to the attention of the general public.

The programme came to deal with difficult questions posed by listeners, and the panellists would discuss the question in great detail, and render a philosophical opinion. Examples of the questions ranged from "What is the meaning of life?" to "How can a fly land upside-down on the ceiling?" Joad became a star of the show, his voice being the most heard on radio except for the news. Joad nearly always opened with the catchphrase "It all depends on what you mean by…" when responding to a question. Although there was [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], who complained about political bias, the general public considered him the greatest British philosopher of the day and celebrity status followed.

==Rise and fall==
As Joad had become so well known, he was invited to give after-dinner speeches, open [[bazaars]], even advertise tea, and his book sales soared. He stood as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate at a [[Combined Scottish Universities by-election, 1946|by-election in November 1946]] for the [[Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined Scottish Universities]] constituency but lost.

Joad once boasted in print, "I cheat the railway company whenever I can."&lt;ref&gt;C.E.M. Joad, ''The Testament of Joad'', 54&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 1948 Joad was caught travelling on a Waterloo to Exeter train without a valid ticket.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6532414 Cyril Edwin Mitchinson "C.E.M." Joad (1891–1953) – Find A Grave Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; When he failed to give a satisfactory explanation, he was convicted of fare dodging and fined £2 (£{{Inflation|UK|2|1948}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}). This made front-page headlines in the national newspapers, destroyed his hopes of a [[peerage]] and resulted in his dismissal from the BBC.&lt;ref name=street&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of British Radio|author=Sean Street|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2009|isbn=0-8108-6847-4| page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humiliation of this had a severe effect on Joad's health, and he soon became bed-confined at his home in [[Hampstead]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Joad renounced his agnosticism and returned to the Christianity of the Church of England, which he detailed in his book ''The Recovery of Belief'', published in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/493829/The-Recovery-of-Belief The Recovery of Belief (work by Joad) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After the bed-confining [[thrombosis]] following his dismissal from the BBC in 1948, Joad developed terminal cancer. He died on 9 April 1953 at his home, 4 East Heath Road, [[Hampstead]], aged 61, and was buried at [[St John-at-Hampstead Church|Saint John's-at-Hampstead Church]] in London.

==Legacy==
Joad was one of the best known British intellectuals of his time, as well known as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in his lifetime. He popularised philosophy, both in his books and by the spoken word.

Quotes from Joad appear in [[Virginia Woolf]]'s novel ''Three Guineas''.
For example: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If it is, then the sooner they give up the pretence of playing with public affairs and return to private life the better. If they cannot make a job of the House of Commons, let them at least make something of their own houses. If they cannot learn to save men from the destruction which incurable male mischievousness bids fair to bring upon them, let women at least learn to feed them, before they destroy themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Woolf]], ''Three Guineas'', p43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joad was invited to appear at the [[Socratic Club]], an undergraduate society at Oxford University, where he spoke on 24 January 1944, on the subject "On Being Reviewed by Christians", an event attended by more than 250 students. This was a stepping-stone in Joad's life, particularly at a time when he was re-examining his convictions.  This re-examination eventually led to his return to the Christian faith of his youth, an event he mentioned in ''The Recovery of Belief''. [[C. S. Lewis]], President of the Socratic Club, is mentioned twice in this book, once as an influence on Joad through Lewis' book ''[[The Abolition of Man]]''.  Part of his legacy, then, was to return to the faith that he had set aside as an Oxford undergraduate and to defend that faith in his writings.

Joad is also mentioned in [[Stephen Potter]]'s book ''[[Gamesmanship]]'', as his partner in a tennis match in which the two men were up against two younger and fitter players who were outplaying them fairly comfortably, until Joad questioned his opponent whether a ball that he had clearly thrown way behind the line was in or out; an event which Potter says made him start thinking about the concept of gamesmanship.

'''Carlos Brandt''' (11 October 1875 – 27 February 1964)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maestre.org/f%20Carlos%20Brandt.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427084834/http://www.maestre.org/f%20Carlos%20Brandt.html |date=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Venezuelan author, historian, philosopher and naturopath.

==Background==
Dr. Carlos Brandt Tortolero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetarianismo.com.br/sitio/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=281 |title=Carlos Brandt |publisher=Vegetarianismo.com.br |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an author, historian, doctor of philosophy, philosopher of vegetarianism, essayist, novelist, biographer, musicologist and naturopath, who was born in Miranda, a town in Carabobo State, [[Venezuela]].

==Early life==
He was born in Miranda, [[Carabobo|Carabobo state]], [[Venezuela]], the son of a German immigrant Karl Brandt, a coffee planter and exporter, and Zoraida Tortolero, mother to Carlos, Juan Luis, Fernando, Augusto, Asteria and Mary. His younger brother (by 17 years) was the composer [[Augusto Brandt]]. He studied in [[Puerto Cabello]] Elementary School and was sent to Germany to join the Pro Gymnasium in Hamburg, aged 14 to 19. He toured German and France, and returned to Venezuela at 19, fluent in German, French and English. At 25, he met [[Leo Tolstoy]], which encouraged his literary ambitions. In 1901, his first book appeared ''La Belleza de la Mujer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/samizdata.geo/LIB14brandt.html |title=Hace 35 años... Carlos Brandt |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027111514/http://www.geocities.com/samizdata.geo/LIB14brandt.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
Under the dictatorship of [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], he was imprisoned and then exiled to Spain, Italy, Belgium, the [[Netherlands]] and then the United States. Protesting at the dictatorship, he encountered the anarchist organization "[[Generación Consciente]]" in [[Barcelona]].  He eventually returned to Venezuela, and died in [[Caracas]], aged 88.

==Writings==
He promoted natural living, pacifism, free-thinking, liberty and spiritualism, in his writings, as well as being a novelist and biographer. Many of his books emerged during his time in exile. In 1913, ''Fundamentos de la Moral'', also known as ''El Problema Vital'' (''The Vital Problem''), was published with a prologue by [[Albert Einstein]]. For his work, the American School of Naturopathy awarded him an honorary doctorate. With this and further writings, Brandt counted as one of the original founders of the [[Vegetarian]]ism movement.

His books were published in Spanish, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Flemish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], English, French and [[German language|German]]. His first book published in English was ''Hight and Right''.

As well as his historic and philosophical writings, Brandt generated extensive correspondence with authors such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Benedict Lust]] - one of the founders of natural medicine, [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Max Nordau]], [[Gabriela Mistral]], [[Raffaele Garofalo]], [[Russell Wallace]] and [[Elmer Lee]].

==Naturopathy==
Brandt, along with [[Arnold Ehret]], [[Benedict Lust]] and Louis Kuhn, was one of the original pioneers of [[naturopathy]]. Brandt taught Nicolás Capó&lt;ref&gt;Mis observaciones clinicas sobre el limon, el ajo y la cebolla/How to use lemon, garlic and onion in order to prevent and cure more than 170 illnesses, by Nicolás Capó, Kier Editorial, 2004, 126 pages (page 24), {{ISBN|950-17-1262-1}}, {{ISBN|978-950-17-1262-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born around 1902), who wrote his first book circa 1935. Many of Brandt's books were distributed through Capo's Instituto de Trofoterapia, in Barcelona.

Capó and José Castro (Galician naturopath),&lt;ref&gt;La nueva medicina futura bioterapia o normofunción by Castro, José Dr. Naturópata, Published in 1976, Ediciones Castro (Valencia), Series: Biblioteca de Calobiótica y macrobiótica&lt;/ref&gt; were pioneers of dietary health and healing in Spain, during the 1920s to 1940s, opening Escuela Naturo-Trofologica in Barcelona in 1925. Capo left Spain for Argentina around 1939, fleeing from [[Francoist Spain]].

German pioneers of the nature cure and [[hygiene hypothesis|natural hygiene]] movements are featured in ''Children Of The Sun: A Pictorial Anthology From Germany to California 1883-1949'' by Gordon Kennedy, Navaria Press 1998.

Brandt is listed in ''Who’s Who In Latin America''.

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]], the '''doctrine of chances''' is a [[rules of evidence|rule of]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that allows evidence to show that it is unlikely a defendant would be repeatedly, innocently involved in similar, suspicious circumstances.

Normally, under [[Federal Rules of Evidence|Federal Rule of Evidence]] 404, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

Using the doctrine of chances allows a prosecutor to admit evidence of prior "accidents" that can persuade a jury that prior incidents are so similar that it is very improbable that the case at bar is actually accidental.

The doctrine of chances was first developed by English courts in the case ''[[George Joseph Smith|Rex v. Smith]]'', 11 Cr. App. R. 229, 84 L.J.K.B. 2153 (1915), better known as the "brides in the bath murder". In this case the defendant was accused of murdering his wife by drowning her in a bath. The defendant claimed that his wife had fainted in the bath. The prosecutor sought to include evidence in the trial that the defendant's two previous wives had both died in the same way. The evidence was allowed.

'''Enrique Gil Robles''' (1849–1908) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] law scholar and a [[Carlist]] theorist. In popular public discourse he is known mostly as father of [[José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones]]. In scholarly debate he is recognized principally as one of key ideologues of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]]; some authors view him also as major representative of a theory of law known as [[Natural law|iusnaturalismo]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Gil y Carrasco.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|[[:es:Enrique Gil y Carrasco|Enrique Gil y Carrasco]]]]
Enrique’s paternal ancestors were a family of modest [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]] from [[León (historical region)|Leon]]. His grandfather, Juan Gil, settled in the town of [[Villafranca del Bierzo]], serving as administrator of real estates belonging to [[:es:Marquesado de Villafranca|Marqués de Villafranca]] and those owned by the local Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Pérez Valle, ''Biografía. D. Enrique Gil y Carrasco'', part 1: ''Su nacimiento'', [in:] Ricardo Gullón (ed.), ''Cisne Sin Lago. Vida y obra de Enrique Gil y Carrasco'', Madrid 1951, p. 6, available [http://perso.wanadoo.es/jlpv/vida/index_nacimiento.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though a conservative, during [[Trienio Liberal]] (1821-1823) Gil was particularly active enlarging Villafranca’s holdings by massive purchases of former Church property, put on sale during the first wave of [[:es:Desamortización española|desamortización]]. Following the death of marqués, audit of his possessions performed by state officials revealed that there were 20,114 [[Spanish real|reales]] missing.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Valle 1951, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Though there were many doubts lingering, Gil left in disgrace and settled in [[Ponferrada]].&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Valle 1951, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan’s oldest son, [[:es:Enrique Gil y Carrasco|Enrique Gil y Carrasco]], served in the [[:es:Cristino|cristino]] army during the [[First Carlist War]]&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Pérez Valle, ''Biografía. D. Enrique Gil y Carrasco'', part 3: ''Su juventud'', [in:] Ricardo Gullón (ed.), ''Cisne Sin Lago. Vida y obra de Enrique Gil y Carrasco'', Madrid 1951, p. 7, available [http://perso.wanadoo.es/jlpv/vida/index_juventud.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and later became one of the best known Spanish authors of [[Romanticism]]. Before moving on diplomatic mission to [[Prussia]] he worked as local tax collector; since the job was inheritable, it was taken over by Juan's younger son and the future father of Enrique, [[Eugenio Gil y Carrasco]] (1819-?). Eugenio also demonstrated some knack for letters; following premature death of his brother he edited his works and published some himself. They were intended to preserve the memory of his late sibling, though Eugenio published also poems, few dedicated to his son.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Gil, ''Un ensueño - biografia'', [in:] (ed.), G. Laverde, ''Obras de Enrique Gil'', Madrid 1855, especially a poem ''A mi hijo'', p. XXXIII, available online [http://www.bibliotecagilycarrasco.com/recursos/archivos/articulos_biblioteca/I%20Poes%C3%ADas%20l%C3%ADricas%20facs%C3%ADmil%201%C2%AA%20ed%201873.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; He married Maria Robles Burruezo,&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Alfonso Rojas Quintana, ''Enrique Gil y Robles: la respuesta de un pensadór católico a la crisis del 98'', [in:] ''Hispania Sacra'' 53 (2001), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; a native of [[Málaga]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastián Martín, ''Gil y Robles, Enrique (1849-1908)'' entry, [in:] ''Diccionario de catedráticos españoles de derecho (1847-1943)'' 2014, available [http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/instituto_figuerola/programas/phu/diccionariodecatedraticos/lcatedraticos/grobles here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple settled in [[Salamanca]], where Eugenio continued as "administrador de rentas reales".&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:José María Gil Robles.JPG|thumbnail|160px|[[José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones]]]]
There is very little information available on the childhood years of the young Enrique, except that he was very early orphaned by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained bachillerato in Filosofía y Letras in Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza of Salamanca in 1864,&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; studied law at the [[Salamanca University]] but graduated in derecho civil y canonico in [[:es:Universidad de Madrid|Universidad Central]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;in Madrid, Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the 1870 foundation of Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza in Ponferrada he was employed as "profesor interino" and commenced teaching historia universal, historia de España and retórica y poética, in the early 1870s assuming also the chair of psicología, lógica y ética.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously he was pursuing doctoral research in [[Madrid]]; he defended the [[PhD]] thesis in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014; some sources claim the correct date is 1874, see Rojas 2001, p. 214. One of the assessors, Francisco Giner de los Ríos, was so impressed by the young scholar he visited Gil later the same day, offering him protection and friendship. Gil rejected the former and accepted the latter, which was maintained– despite sharp ideological differences – until the death of Robles, ''Revista católica de cuestiones sociales'' 163 (1908) p. 470, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002644449&amp;page=62 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Already a doctor, in 1875 he became full titular professor of the Ponferrada Instituto.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 45-year-old Enrique Gil Robles married Petra Quiñones Armesto,&lt;ref&gt;''José María Gil Robles'', [in:] ''Vida. Biografias anecdoticas'' 3 (1936), p. 3, available [http://bibliotecadigital.jcyl.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=10075577 here]&lt;/ref&gt; originating from Ponferrada.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 3 children, born between 1894 and 1898; the oldest son died few days after birth. The second and the youngest son, José María, as leader of [[CEDA]] became one of the best known politicians of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]; acknowledging nationwide renown of his father, he adopted the name of José María Gil-Robles y Quinones.&lt;ref&gt;and not José Maria Gil Quinones, as would have been usual according to the Spanish naming customs; detailed discussion of José María changing the surname in ''José María Gil Robles'', [in:] ''Vida. Biografias anecdoticas'' 3 (1936), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; His son and Enrique’s grandson, [[:es:José María Gil-Robles y Gil-Delgado|José María Gil-Robles y Gil-Delgado]], following the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] became one of the country leading politicians; active in Alianza Popular and [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]], in 1997-1999 he was president of the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Excmo. Sr. Dr. D. José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado'', [in:] ''Real Academia de Ciencias Economicas y Financieras'' website, available [https://racef.es/es/academicosnumerario/jmgilrobles here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==
[[File:Patio de las Escuelas Menores, Universidad de Salamanca.jpg|thumbnail|left|Escuelas Menores patio, [[Salamanca University|Salamanca]]]]
In 1874 Gil apparently intended to take part in contest for chairs of elementos de derecho publico y administrativo español, to be held by universities in [[Oviedo]], [[Valencia]] and [[Granada]]. Though admitted, for reasons which are not clear he did not attend the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1875 he did, however, participate in the contest for chairing cátedra de derecho político y administrativo in his native University of Salamanca, and emerged successful,&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014; some sources claim in 1873, see Rojas 2001, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; in 1876 nominated catedrático numerario.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He will occupy this post for the next 32 years, failing to show up at university premises only 4 days before death.&lt;ref&gt;''Revista católica de cuestiones sociales'' 163 (1908) p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; The only difference in his assignment was that at some point the cátedra was split in two, and Gil continued as chair of derecho político.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of times Gil attempted to move away from Salamanca. In 1881 he was unsuccessful when applying for the same chair in [[Barcelona]]. The appeal was turned down by the ministry, but his victorious contender resigned and Gil was appointed in due course. However, shortly afterwards Gil resigned as well, quoting "unforeseen circumstances", and resumed his Salamanca duties.&lt;ref&gt;as the contest took place during the summer holiday period, Gil’s career in Salamanca has not been interrupted, Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882-1883 he fielded his candidature for derecho publico at Universidad Central in Madrid; the attempt was unsuccessful following some repeated changes of the admission procedure, which might be interpreted as aimed against Gil.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883-1886 he applied to enter the contest for cátedra de historia del derecho at Central, but was not admitted on legal grounds; similarly, he was rejected in 1885 for literatura jurídica and in 1886 for derecho canónico, always at Central. In 1891 he resumed his attempt for historia in Madrid, again to no avail. In 1901 Gil presented his bid for chair of Estudios Superiores de Derecho penal y de Antropología criminal, again in the capital, and was again unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;it was a newly created chair within the faculty of law, Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Escuelas Mayores, Salamanca. Capilla.jpg|thumbnail|160px|university chapel]]
Gil was building his academic position over time. In the early 1880s he had to suffer aggression from liberal circles both in the city and at the Salamanca university;&lt;ref&gt;José María Hernández Díaz, ''Maestros y escuelas en la Salamanca contemporánea'', Salamanca 2001, ISBN SBN 8495327031, esp. the sub-chapter ''Agresión a Gil Robles por un "cate" en la Universidad (1884)''&lt;/ref&gt; as late as in the mid-1880s he was referred to as "almost unknown" in the world of Spanish law scholars.&lt;ref&gt;"casi desconocido", Adolfo Posada, ''Fragmentos de mis memorias'', Oviedo 1983, {{ISBN|9788474680706}}, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually gaining recognition, throughout his career Gil was a number of times acting as judge in numerous contests for academic chairs across Spain and took part in national juridical congresses.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1881 in Granada, 1886 and 1888 in Barcelona or 1902 in Seville, Martín 2014, also ''El Dia'' 25.08.86, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002215447&amp;page=2 here] or ''El Dia'' 18.08.88, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002246342&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also popular among students, who appreciated his clear style combined with courtesy and benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;his peculiarity was the obsession to know each student personally; for picturesque description of his lectures see Rojas 2001, pp. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; Temporarily rising to dean of the law faculty,&lt;ref&gt;at unspecified time and as decano interino, temporary dean, Rojas 2001, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1890s Gil, along [[Mariano Arés Sanz]], was already among the most prestigious Salamanca scholars;&lt;ref&gt;Posada 1983, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; indeed by the end of the decade together with other neo-[[Thomism|Thomists]] he dominated the Salamanca intellectual realm and was largely responsible for conservative reputation of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Enrique Rodríguez-San Pedro Bezares, ''Historia de la Universidad de Salamanca'', vol. 1, ''Trayectoria histórica e instituciones vinculadas'', Salamanca 2002, {{ISBN|9788478001163}}, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the centuries it was rather the newcomers with pro-socialist leaning, like [[Miguel de Unamuno]], who had to struggle against overwhelmingly conservative ambience.&lt;ref&gt;Unamuno wrote: "esta Salamanca era por entonces, cuando yo llegué acá, uno de los más activos focos – acaso el más activo – de las luchas intestinas de la derecha antiliberal", quoted after Ana Chaguaceda Toledano, ''Miguel de Unamuno. Estudios sobre su obra'', Vol. 2, Salamanca 2005, {{ISBN|9788478005925}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Largely aided by arrival of [[:es:Pedro Dorado Montero|Pedro Dorado Montero]], they gained ground in the 1900s,&lt;ref&gt;Posada 1983, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; though Gil Robles until his death remained an iconic Salamanca figure.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Rabaté, ''1900 en Salamanca. Guerra y paz en la Salamanca del joven Unamuno'', Salamanca 1997, {{ISBN|9788474818512}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:YTB.89.43.56.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|''Tratado de derecho'']]
Enrique Gil Robles was not a prolific writer; his written heritage is one major work, few booklets, a couple of articles in specialized reviews and a handful of manuscripts. He is known to have contributed to a number of periodicals, but exact scope of this activity is unclear; none of the scholarly studies consulted refers to him as "periodista".&lt;ref&gt;Gil is known to have contributed to ''La Informacion'' - see ''La Epoca'' 27.07.08, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000768615&amp;page=3 here], to ''La Región'' - see José Andres Gallego, ''La politica religiosa en España'', Madrid 1975, p. 41, to ''La Tradicion'' - see Rabaté 1997, p. 170, and to ''La Tesis'', Carlos Manuel Sánchez Pérez, ''Manuel Sánchez Asensio (1860-1919) a través de los periódicos que fundó y dirigió'', [in:] ''Documentación de las Ciencias de la Información'' 30 (2007), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; His works fall into 3 categories: [[Political science|theory of state]], [[theory of law]] and [[pedagogy]]. Though he started writing in the early 1870s, his best known works were written and published between 1891 and 1902.

Gil’s opus magnum was ''Tratado de derecho político según los principios de la filosofía y el derecho cristianos'' (Treaty on political law according to the principles of Christian law and philosophy), published in Salamanca in two volumes respectively in 1899 and 1902. Spanning across over 1,100 pages, the work was intended to provide exhaustive lecture on organization of state in general and principles of public law in particular, though it grew into synthesis of author’s view on politics, history and religion. Two other publications, incomparable in size but far more often quoted, are two booklets: ''El absolutismo y la democracia'' (1891, containing his address opening the academic year in University of Salamanca) and ''Oligarquía y caciquismo. Naturaleza. Primeras causas. Remedios. Urgencia de ellos'' (1901). Both were formatted as lectures on problems of current Spanish politics, enveloped in wider ideological and philosophical discourse. Much less known is his early work on theory of a lawful state, ''¿Qué condiciones debe reunir la Jurisprudencia para disfrutar de la autoridad de doctrina legal?'' (1888).

Among a number of works related to education the first to be named is ''El catolicismo liberal y la libertad de enseñanza'' (1896), a book comparing Catholic and liberal educational models; it developed theses laid out earlier in ''La Libertad Universitaria'' (1882).&lt;ref&gt;see ''La Ciencia Cristiana'' 37 (1884), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025478504&amp;page=151 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Less partisan and more technical studies were ''Ensayo de metodologia juridical'' (1893), ''Guía para el estudio del Derecho administrativo'' (1899), ''Advertencia preliminar a las "Recitaciones de Derecho Canónico y disciplina Eclesiástica de España" de Julián Portilla Martín'' (1900), ''Indicador y programa para la explicación en cátedra y la preparación fuera de ella de la asignatura de derecho político español comparado con el extranjero'' (1906), ''Método de enseñanza y programa de la asignatura de Elementos de Derecho político y administrativo español'', ''Memoria acerca del método de enseñanza, plan, y programa de la asignatura de elementos de Derecho Político y Administrativo español'' and ''Razonamiento y programa de la asignatura de Historia general del Derecho español para las oposiciones de dicha Cátedra vacante en la Universidad Central'' (all in manuscript).&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Díaz Díaz, ''Hombres y documentos de la filosofía española'', vol. 3, Madrid 1988, {{ISBN|9788400067038}}, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt;

Gil’s written heritage is complete with very few scholarly articles on politics, education and law,&lt;ref&gt;''Sobre el discurso de D. Antonio Cánovas en la Academia de Ciencias Morales y Politicas'' [in:] ''La ciencia cristiana'' (Madrid pp. 5-12, 103-107, 409-417, 502-506, year 1881,) ''Otro discurso académico del Sr. Cánovas del Castillo'' (Madrid 1882 pp. 385-395, 516-526), ''De Pedagogía'' [in:] ''La España Moderna'' (1894, pp. 39-47), ''Estudios socials sobre el código civil'', [in:] ''Revista Católica de las cuestiones Sociales'' 97 (1903)&lt;/ref&gt; one translation from German ([[Friedrich Julius Stahl]], ''Rechtsphilosophie'') and an unspecified number of pieces contributed to local and national periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;usually signed, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 06.11.95, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000182674&amp;page=1 here], though also under pen names like E.G.y R., see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.06.99, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000208074&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; None of his works was issued again until 1961, when ''Tratado de derecho politico'' was re-edited by a Madrid publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;by Casa Afrodisio Aguado and with punctuation corrected by Pablo Beltrán de Heredia&lt;/ref&gt; One present-day student refers to his opus as "very ample".&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that Gil’s doctrine formed part of [[regenerationism]] and was largely a response to the [[American-Spanish War|1898 disaster]];&lt;ref&gt;like Rojas&lt;/ref&gt; most scholars claim that his thought continued earlier 19th Traditionalist works, especially those of [[Juan Donoso Cortés|Donoso Cortés]], and developed mostly as reaction to the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|1868 revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;like García Canales, Gonzalez Cuevas or Montoro Ballesteros&lt;/ref&gt; All students agree that Gil diagnosed the key malady of Spain as [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberalism]], which destroyed traditional structures and replaced them with [[bourgeoisie]] [[oligarchy]], exercised systematically by means of industry and trade and personally by the network of [[:es:Caciquismo (España)|caciques]].&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, pp. 219-20&lt;/ref&gt; The prescription advocated was reversal to the spirit and partially institutions of [[Ancien Régime|Antiguo Régimen]];&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; two key elements of Gil’s vision were organic society and sovereign king.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano García Canales, ''La democracia y el repliegue del individuo: organicismo y corporativismo'', [in:] ''Espacio, Tiempo y Forma'' 27 (2015), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gil men, who are not equally free and sovereign, form part of different groups.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Alberto Montoro Ballesteros, ''La idea de democracia en el pensamiento de don Enrique Gil y Robles'', [in:] ''Revista de estudios políticos'' 174 (1970), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Though being individuals, they are expressed by activity in various social entities and in the overall structure.&lt;ref&gt;Gil pursued a concept of dual relationship, as an individual is linked to groups he belongs to and to the entire society, Mariano García Canales, ''La teoría de la representación en la España del siglo XX: (de la crisis de la restauración a 1936)'', Madrid 1977, {{ISBN|9788460010531}}, p. 45, García Canales (2015), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Society is not a sum of individuals, but a structure made of these groups; comparison to a living body consisting of vital organic wholes gave rise to the term "organic society", a pluralist and gradualist structure.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo, catolicismo y nacionalismo'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 71 (2008), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; All groups retain their internal autonomy;&lt;ref&gt;García Canales 1977, pp. 38, 43-4&lt;/ref&gt;  in Gil’s nomenclature it was referred to as "autarquia"&lt;ref&gt;José J. Albert Márquez, ''Hacia un estado corporativo de justicia. Fundamentos del derecho y del estado en José Pedro Galvao de Sousa'', Barcelona 2010, {{ISBN|9788415929284}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; and stood for self-government.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; Society consists of 3 layers: noble class, middle class and working class, each with own roles and functions,&lt;ref&gt;Montoro Ballesteros 1970, p. 93, Rojas 2001, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; though there are also other horizontal and vertical lines making various groups distinct.&lt;ref&gt;horizontal ones are mostly territorial: family, municipio, region, province etc, while vertical are mostly functional, like gremios, asociaciones, parties etc., Garcia Canales 1977, p. 46, García Canales 2015, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy&lt;ref&gt;the term was used by Gil literally, as "democracia"&lt;/ref&gt; is not a political regime, but a constituting principle of such a society;&lt;ref&gt;Montoro Ballesteros 1970, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; it means recognition of roles performed by various groups and of their internal sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;"Llamemos, pues, democracia al total estado jurídico del pueblo, es decir, a la condición que resulta del reconocimiento, garantía y goce de todos los derechos privados, públicos y políticos que corresponden a la clase popular, la cual, si no es soberana, es también imperante y gobernante en proporción de su valor y fuerza sociales", quoted after Montoro Ballesteros 1970, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; which at times might include the right to coerce.&lt;ref&gt;"el derecho que corresponde a la persona superior de una sociedad para obligar a los miembros de ella a los actos conducentes al fin social, en cuanto, por naturaleza o circunstancias, sean incapaces esos miembros de ordenarse a dicho fin o bien", quoted after Montoro Ballesteros 1970, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Society is held together by interdependence of its components and not by any [[social contract]]; contracts, by definition voluntary, temporary and reversible, would make such a commonality absurd.&lt;ref&gt;García Canales 2015, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Herrera thomas aquinas.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Aquinas]] by [[Francisco Herrera the Younger|Herrera]]]]
Political representation is performed not by [[universal suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;which was deemed as dictatorship of the plebs ("plebe"), Montoro Ballesteros 1970, pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; which is anti-democratic as it unduly elevates individual self&lt;ref&gt;Montoro Ballesteros 1970, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and gives rise to corruption and political oligarchy, but is to be channeled along corporative lines.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia Canales 1977, p. 46, García Canales 2015, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The diet – named "organicista"&lt;ref&gt;Javier Ordoñez, ''Utopía y distopía en el XIX español'', [in:] Manuel Suárez Cortina (ed.), ''Utopías, quimeras, y desencantos: el universo utópico en la España liberal'', Oviedo 2008, {{ISBN|9788481024821}}, pp. 38-9&lt;/ref&gt; or "corporatista"&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Las tradiciones ideológicas de la extrema derecha española'', [in:] ''Hispania'' 207 (2001), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; - is to be entrusted with legislative initiative and consulting tasks.&lt;ref&gt;García Canales 2015, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It should consist of two chambers. The lower one is to host territorial and labor entities, the upper one is to be made of selected and noble nominees.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia Canales 1977, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of state should be based on "monarquía bajomedieval",&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; a withdrawn structure&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; which performs only basic roles and cedes most governing to its social components.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 222; Gil strongly opposed the idea of omnipotent state, advancing theory of autarquic societies versus institutional power, Suárez Cortina 2008, pp. 38-9&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of potent state – like most European countries of the late 19th century, Spain included - was due to decomposition of the society, unable to govern itself. In case of sane society, the state structure should be topped by a sovereign, a person (monarchy) rather than entity (poliarquia),&lt;ref&gt;influenced by Karl Ludwig van Haller and Luigi Taparelli, Montoro Ballesteros 1970, pp. 96, 100&lt;/ref&gt; limited in his powers by autarquia of social groupings, but enjoying political sovereignty – Gil rejected [[separation of powers]] into legislative, executive and juridical,&lt;ref&gt;Montoro Ballesteros 1970, pp. 96, 98&lt;/ref&gt; though he distinguished between social and political sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] Javier Fernández Sebastián (ed.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, p. 1163&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed absolutist&lt;ref&gt;as cesarist, Rojas 2001, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; and constitutional&lt;ref&gt;Gil distinguished between two types of constitutional monarchy: monarquía democrática (Spain according to the 1869 constitution; its article 32 declared sovereignty of the nation and assigned executive role to the king) or monarquía doctrinaria (Spain according to the 1876 constitution; its article 18 declared that powers reside jointly with Cortes and king), Montoro Ballesteros 1970, pp. 101-2&lt;/ref&gt; monarchy alike. However, in extremis he was prepared to endorse coercion&lt;ref&gt;Cristóbal Robles, Cristóbal Robles Muñoz, ''José María de Urquijo e Ybarra: opinión, religión y poder'', Madrid 1997, {{ISBN|9788400076689}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted that dictatorial monarchy was acceptable as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 221 Javier Esteve Martí, ''El carlismo ante la reorganización de las derechas.

None of the sources consulted clarifies how Gil adopted a conservative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Salamanca city and province were by no means a Carlist stronghold, though the movement retained significant force to be accounted for; it was powered by "notables rurales: medianos propietarios del campo, algunos comerciantes de relieve, pequeño artesanado y el añadido de unos profesionales liberales concentrados básicamente en la capital y en algunas cabezas de partido", Leopoldo-Santiago Diez Cano, ''Carlismo en Salamanca en el sexenio: notas sobre un movimiento "marginal"'', [in:] ''Studia historica. Historia contemporánea'' 4 (1986). pp. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt; Having been eyewitness to excesses of the 1868 revolution in Madrid he might have been influenced by the [[:es:Neocatólico|neocatólicos]], especially that he forged a close relationship with [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]]. In 1869 co-founder of local Juventud Católica,&lt;ref&gt;Diez Cano 1986. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; starting 1870 he was delivering addresses with strong Traditionalist leaning and was quoted by Carlist newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;like ''La Regeneración'' 03.05.70, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026691172&amp;page=2 here], ''La Regeneración'' 22.05.70, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026691485&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; No source confirms (or denies) that he took part in the [[Third Carlist War]], though some obituaries ambiguously claim that he "led the brave youth of Salamanca [...] fighting to defend Spain" of his ideal;&lt;ref&gt;"figuró á la cabeza de aquella brava y animosa juventud salmantina que, respondiendo corno á una solemne evocación del espíritu de nuestra raza, peleaba con denuedo en defensa de la España de sus amores y de la religión de sus padres", ''Revista católica de cuestiones sociales'' 163 (1908) p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; it remains mysterious why he failed to attend 1874 hearings for academic posts he signed up to.&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Gil remained active in Juventud also after 1876,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 09.03.78, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000030491&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in late 1870s continued in its Salamanca executive.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.12.78, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000039319&amp;page=2 here], also ''El Siglo Futuro'' 15.12.79, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000048556&amp;page=1 here]; one source claims that as one of the Madrid Juventud Católica leaders he was offered a place in the Cortes by Canovas, the only string attached that he did not endorse the rights of Carlos VII; Gil allegedly refused, ''Revista católica de cuestiones sociales'' 163 (1908) p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged in broad Traditionalist movement, he prepared a massive 1882 pilgrimage to [[Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.01.82, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000060121&amp;page=2 here]; the initiative was soon dissolved as pressed by the episcopal authorities, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.02.82, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000061161&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and co-signed letters of support, addressed to ecclesiastical hierarchs and animated by the Nocedals.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 07.04.85, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000089157&amp;page=1 here] also ''El Siglo Futuro'' 26.05.85, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000090660&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Gil participated also in clearly Carlist initiatives, like 1883 attempt to build a monument of [[Zumalacarregui]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 03.03.83, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000066890&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; published in Carlist press&lt;ref&gt;mostly ''La Tradicion'' (subtitled Dios, Patria y Rey), issued in 1886, Rabaté 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and in the mid-1880s was already among leaders of the Salmantine Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 12.05.83, [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000069018&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he was rumored to run on the Carlist ticket for the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Dinastia'' 06.02.88, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001428122&amp;page=10 here]&lt;/ref&gt; but the party eventually decided to maintain their abstention strategy. 
[[File:Don Carlos de Borbón, en Nuevo Mundo.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]], 1898]]
During the 1888 crisis Gil decided to join the breakaway Nocedal-led [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]],&lt;ref&gt;Javier Real Cuesta, ''El carlismo vasco 1876–1900'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|9788432305108}}, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; signing up to ''Manifesto de Búrgos''.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 07.11.88, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000127757&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Gil was among organizers of their [[Partido Tradicionalista]], but did not enter its executive.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 01.08.89, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000135479&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spanish general election, 1891|1891]] he ran as Integrist for the Cortes in the [[Sequeros]] district;&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión Católica'' 29.01.91, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004885652&amp;page=3 here]; Sequeros was the most Carlist district of the province, some 26% of the party militants used to come from the area, Diez Cano 1986, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; initially reported victorious,&lt;ref&gt;''El Liberal'' 03.02.91, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001209191&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was finally declared defeated&lt;ref&gt;see the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDBuscHisDip?_piref73_1340033_73_1340032_1340032.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXDSP.fmt&amp;DOCS=4-4&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%40ELEN%26gt%3B%3D%2237%22+%26+%40ELEN%26lt%3B%3D%2242%22+%26+%28%22SEQUEROS%22%29.DIST. here]&lt;/ref&gt; and did not renew his bid in the following [[Spanish general election, 1893|campaign of 1893]].

At that time his relations with Nocedal were cooling down.&lt;ref&gt;around 1897 ''El Siglo Futuro'' ceased to publish his articles and to advertise his books&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from other reasons,&lt;ref&gt;initially cordial relationship between Nocedal and Gil, forged in the late 1860s, started to crack allegedly in 1891-1892, when Nocedal refused to appeal to the Roman Rota protesting episcopal measures against ''La Región'', José M. Cuenca Toribio, ''Otras memorias jesuíticas de la Restauración'', [in:] ''Anales de Historia Contemporánea'' 1 (1982), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Gil was allegedly uncomfortable with virulent Integrist campaign against the Carlist claimant.&lt;ref&gt;Cuenca Toribio 1982, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1899 Gil attempted to arrange reconciliation between mainstream Carlists and the Integrists, but was greeted with ice cold response of Nocedal.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.06.99, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000208074&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the two broke altogether,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 30.06.99, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000208268&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; their public altercation cheered by the Republican press.&lt;ref&gt;which mocked Gil by referring to him as "catedrático de Salamanca por desgracia de la juventud española", ''El País'' 12.07.99, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001873695&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having left Integrism Gil returned to "vieja mansión" of mainstream Carlism;&lt;ref&gt;Cuenca Toribio 1982, p. 153, Román Oyarzun, ''Historia del carlismo'', Madrid 1969, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; following 1899 exchange of cordial letters with [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]]&lt;ref&gt;Gil wrote in November 1899: "Señor: No encuentro palabras bastante expresivas con que manifestar a V. M. La gratitud de que le soy deudor. El regio autógrafo con que V. M. se ha dignado honrarme, sería sobrada recompensa de los más ilustres y heroicos servicios a la Causa de Dios, de la Patria y del Rey, no habiendo tenido yo la dicha de prestarlos; mas obligado quedo a consagrarme a ella sin reserva ni restricción alguna, para que los renglones trazados de la real mano sean merecida ejecutoria de lealtad que transmitir sin mancha a mis hijos. Hora es ya de que no haya más que un programa y una hueste bajo la Cruz triunfadora de todas las desventuras y catástrofes bajo la Monarquía cristiana, que hoy, como después del Guadalete, es la única institución que flota sobre el naufragio", to which Carlos VII responded: "Mi querido Gil Robles: Quiero ponerte yo mismo dos letras, pues arrepentimientos y retractaciones como las tuyas prueban, además de un espíritu recto y elevado, un gran corazón. Cuento contigo, y quiera Dios que muchos de los engañados abran los ojos y sigan tan noble ejemplo, para bien de nuestra querida y tan desgraciada España. Tu afectísimo, Carlos", quoted after Maximiliano Garcia Venero, ''Historia de la Unificacion'', Madrid 1970, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; he started to publish in semi-official party daily ''Correo Español'',&lt;ref&gt;Cuenca Toribio 1982, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not enter the party structures.

Gil was active in many fields of the Salmantine realm. In 1883 he entered the local Comisión de Reformas Sociales;&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; in 1887 he was admitted as member-correspondent to Académia de Legislación y Jurisprudencia de Salamanca;&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in 1893 he was voted into the city [[ayuntamiento]], where he led the conservative faction; this council was dubbed "ayuntamiento de notables";&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, pp. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; in 1894 he was vice-president of the Salamancan Liga de Productores;&lt;ref&gt;and lobbied in favor of protective measures against foreign imports, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 03.01.95, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000179344&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1902&lt;ref&gt;having received the official title of consejero de instrucción publica. In 1901, in recognition of his merits in education, he was offered high posts in administration, the proposal rejected as he decided not to accept assignements beyond his academic path, Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; he was nominated to Consejo Universitario in Salamanca&lt;ref&gt;Martín 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and other provincial educational bodies&lt;ref&gt;Posada 1983, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1903 he was proposed to represent the province in the [[Senate (Spain)|Senate]], delegated by the University.&lt;ref&gt;but declined opting for running on a Carlist ticket to the lower chamber of the diet, Rojas 2001, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to Salmantine Traditionalist periodicals, first ''La Tesis'',&lt;ref&gt;an intransigent periodical issued in 1885-1886 by Manuel Sánchez Asensio. He wrote: "Tendremos respeto, tolerancia y caridad para las personas. Seremos inflexibles e intransigentes con las miserias y los vicios", the latter a reference to liberalism, Sánchez Pérez 2007, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; then ''La Región'' and finally ''La Información''.&lt;ref&gt;''La Región'' was issued in Salamanca between 1890 and 1892, ''La Información'' between 1892 and 1897, Sánchez Pérez 2007, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gil left his trademark on the Salmantine life by means of two long-lasting conflicts with other local personalities.

The intransigent Integrists clashed with the Spanish ecclesiastical hierarchy, which advocated the platform of Catholic unity, almost from the onset, which finally led to calling off the 1882 pilgrimage to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.02.82, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000061161&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Locally the conflict was aggravated with the 1885 arrival of the new Salamanca bishop, [[Tomás Cámara y Castro]], a hierarch described as posibilista,&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez Pérez 2007, p 153; he declared acceptance of art. 11 of the 1876 constitution, which set a new model of church-state relations, and adhered to the "hypothesis" theory, logical pillar of the "Catholic unity" strategy, Posada 1983, pp. 268-9&lt;/ref&gt; moderado and aperturista.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano Esteban de Vega, ''Católicos contra liberales notas sobre el ambiente ideológico salmantino en la Restauración'', [in:] ''Studia historica. Historia contemporánea'' 4 (1986), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He launched onslaught on fundamentalist line of local Traditionalist periodicals,&lt;ref&gt;Posada 1983, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; which soon led to an open press war;&lt;ref&gt;de Vega 1986, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; the most distinguished representative of Salmantine Integros, supported by the local [[Jesuits]],&lt;ref&gt;"jesuitas de la Clerecía", Claude Rabaté 1997, pp. 169-170&lt;/ref&gt; was Gil, dubbed "prohombre" of "camarilla jesuítica antiepiscopal".&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez Pérez 2007, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict climaxed in 1892, when Cámara banned local Catholics from reading ''La Región''&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión Católica'' 05.04.92, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004892411&amp;page=1 here]; the episcopal order read: "esta prohibición se extiende, mientras otra cosa no ordenáramos, á cualquier papel periódico que redactaren D. Manuel Sánchez Asensio ó D. Enrique Gil y Robles"&lt;/ref&gt; and all periodicals edited by Manuel Sánchez Asensio and Gil Robles.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Gallego 1975, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The latter fought back appealing to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, p. 179, Cuenca Toribio 1982, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; kept referring to the bishop with venomous irony&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; and confronted him as late as in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 24.01.95, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000179558&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1890s the conflict scaled down as Gil moved away from Integrism and Cámara turned his ally in showdown against liberal University scholars.
[[File:Miguel de Unamuno 1912.png|thumbnail|160px|[[Miguel de Unamuno]]]]
After 1891 death of Mariano Arés Sanz the Salmantine academic realm was almost entirely dominated by conservatives like Gil Robles, [[Alejandro de la Torre Vélez]] and [[Nicasio Sánchez Mata]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-San Pedro Bezares 2002, p, 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was exactly the funeral of Arés which produced confrontation with Miguel de Unamuno, then a young professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] freshly landed in Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;1891 signed a letter supporting the idea of denying funeral academic honors to Ares, quoting law which prevented honors other than those compliant with Religión del Estado, Rabaté 1997, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Gil’s address opening the 1891-2 course elicited another backlash, which took shape of 5 Unamuno’s articles titled ''Un nocedalino desquiciado''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, pp. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Written in very aggressive language quite untypical for public disputes between academics of the era, they denounced Gil as a reactionary intending to galvanize the long dead [[Middle Ages]]; Unamuno lambasted his opponent as "inepto, mediocre y indocto" and his address as "sudado, artificioso, falso, manera y no estilo".&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Unamuno backtracked, at least in terms of tone,&lt;ref&gt;Rabaté 1997, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; but relations between the two remained tense.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Unamuno soon found an ally in another newcomer academic, Pedro Dorado Montero, in 1897 endangered not only by expulsion from the university, but also by excommunication;&lt;ref&gt;the issue was a so-called "Tercera cuestión universitaria" (teaching in line with Catholic outlook); in 1897 students denounced Montero as not adhering to the religious principles. Camara demanded that Dorada be expulsed, but the rector quoted constitutional stipulation that no-one will be persecuted for his religious outlook, Rojas 2001, p. 218, Sánchez Pérez 2007, pp. 164-6&lt;/ref&gt; the two kept reclaiming the local academic realm from the conservatives, the task largely completed after the death of Gil Robles.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Chaguaceda Toledano, ''Miguel de Unamuno. Estudios sobre su obra'', vol. 2, Salamanca 2005, {{ISBN|9788478005925}}, pp. 74-75.

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
By the end of his life Gil emerged as key Traditionalist thinker and gained a prestigious scholarly position;&lt;ref&gt;according to Francisco Giner de los Ríos, Gil "era el escritor y pensador de más sólida formación de la escuela católica española en lo referente a las ciencas políticas", quoted after Posada 1983, pp. 268-9, and his ''Tratado de Derecho Politico'' was above anything written in Catholic Hispanic literature, Rojas 2001, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not make it to the top elite of Spanish law academics, as certified by his failures to obtain a chair in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;he has also never entered Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación&lt;/ref&gt; Following death&lt;ref&gt;he died due to [[hemiparesis]] and his death reverberated in the press of the era, for review of obituaries see ''Revista católica de cuestiones sociales'' 163 (1908) p. 470 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt; his memory was first eclipsed and later relegated into oblivion by prolific activity of another Carlist theorist, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]].&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Orella Martínez, ''El origen del primer Catolicismo social Español'', [PhD thesis, Universidad de Educación a Distancia], Madrid 2012, pp. 36-7&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s his image was reduced further on to merely "a father of José Maria Gil-Robles". After the [[Spanish Civil War|war]] neither the [[Francoism|regime]] nor any other political grouping admitted deference to Gil. During revival of the Carlist doctrine in the late Francoist era its key theorists focused on de Mella and referred to Gil casually,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the writings of [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Francisco Elias de Tejada]] or [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Rafael Gambra]]. The sole post-war Traditionalist scholar who ventured to develop some threads of Gil’s work was [[Marcial Solana González-Camino|Marcial Solana]]; he focused on the autarchy thesis, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji'', Radzymin 2015, {{ISBN|9788360748732}}, pp. 113, 189–201&lt;/ref&gt; though he was acknowledged as one of the giants of Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;see the 1970 booklet ''¿Que es el carlismo?'', available [http://www.carlismo.es/librosElectronicos/queeselcarlismo.pdf here], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Following transición Traditionalism went dramatically out of fashion and a present-day student refers to Gil as "unknown figure, unjustly forgotten".&lt;ref&gt;"figura desconocida, injustamente olvidado", Rojas 2001, pp. 213, 227&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from an unpublished 1969 PhD thesis and a handful of articles, he has earned no major monograph so far.

In the current scholarly discourse as a law theorist Gil is classified as 'iusnaturalista" belonging either to the neo-scholastic&lt;ref&gt;''Indice Historico Espanol'' Vol. XVIII no 65, Barcelona 1972, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; or neo-thomist school,&lt;ref&gt;Montoro Ballesteros, ''Filosofia y estilo de vida: apunte biografico y perfil intelectual del profesor Mariano Hurtado Bautista'', [in:] Antonio Perez Martin (ed.), ''Funciones y fines del derecho: estudios en homenaje al profesor Mariano Hurtado Bautista'', Murcia 1992, {{ISBN|9788476843260}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; indebted to [[Luigi Taparelli]], [[José Prisco (1835-1923)|José Prisco]]&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Enrique Pérez Luño, ''El derecho natural en la España del siglo XX'', [in:] F. Puig (ed.), ''El Derecho Natural Hispánico'', Madrid 1973, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luis Mendizábal Martín (1859-1931)|Luis Mendizabal Martín]].&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Luño 1973, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In dedicated works on natural law in Spain he is treated either marginally&lt;ref&gt;compare Pérez Luño 1973, pp. 140-1&lt;/ref&gt; or not at all,&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Pérez Luño, ''Natural law theory in Spain and Portugal'', [in:] ''The Age of Human Rights Journal'' 1 (2013), pp. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt; though some authors appreciate his original contribution.&lt;ref&gt;namely his elaboration of monistic "derecho objetivo" (aimed against duality of public and private law), noted by Albert Márquez 2010, p. 99, and distinction between derecho natural divino, a natural attribute of a being, and derecho natural adventicio, appearing in cases and deeds created by human activity, distinction which enables historic projection of natural law and which relates to doctrine of Francisco Suárez and his differentiating between lex (ius naturale praeceptivum) and dominium (ius naturale dominativum), - Pérez Luño 1973, pp. 140-1; detailed discussion of Suárez concept in J. A. Fernández-Santamaría, ''Natural Law, Constitutionalism, Reason of State, and War: Counter-reformation Spanish Political Thought'', vol. 1, Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|9780820474274}}, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; As a theorist of education he is presented as representative of Catholic fundamentalism,&lt;ref&gt;education is to be managed by the Church, which guarantees unity and spirit of the nation, Rojas 2001, p 222&lt;/ref&gt; enemy of [[krausism]] and heterodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Las tradiciones ideológicas de la extrema derecha española'', Hispania 207 (2001), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; As a state theorist he is usually referred to as Traditionalist,&lt;ref&gt;one of "doctrinarios de tradicionalismo carlista" (Orella Martínez 2012, p. 449), "teoretico del tradicionalismo" (Juan Rodríguez Ruiz, José María Benavente Barreda, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] ''Enciclopedia de la Cultura Española'', Madrid 1968, pp. 456-459), also García Canales 2015, p 25, González Cuevas 2008, p. 1165; some claim that Gil "offers fruitful and original synthesis of neothomism and traditionalism" (Díaz Díaz 1988, p. 462. A peculiar approach is demonstrated by a historian militant in progressist Partido Carlista, who claims that Traiditonalists were aliens who infiltrated the genuine Carlism, compare José Carlos Clemente Muñoz, ''El carlismo en el novecientos español (1876-1936)'', Madrid 1999, {{ISBN|9788483741535}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also as "organicista",&lt;ref&gt;José Manuel Roca, ''La derecha furiosa'', Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|9788493447472}}, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; "católico tradicional"&lt;ref&gt;Rojas 2001, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; or representative of "corporativismo católico".&lt;ref&gt;Laureano López Rodó, ''Memorias'', Madrid 1990, {{ISBN|9788478630097}}, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; As a politician Gil is typically labeled either as Carlist&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Alvarez Chillida, ''El antisemitismo en España: la imagen del judío, 1812-2002'', Madrid 2002, {{ISBN|9788495379443}}, p. 227, José Andrés-Gallego, Antón M. Pazos, ''La Iglesia en la España contemporánea 1800-1936'', Madrid 1999, {{ISBN|9788474905199}}, p. 216, José Andrés Gallego, ''Historia general de España y América'', Madrid 1982, {{ISBN|9788432121135}}, p. 694, Eric Storm, ''La perspectiva del progreso: Pensamiento político en la España del cambio de siglo (1890-1914)'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|9788470309090}}, p. 134, Paul Preston, ''Coming of the Spanish Civil War : Reform, Reaction and Revolution in The Second Republic'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|9788425335990}}, p. 102, Cristián Garay Vera, ''El tradicionalismo y los orígenes de la guerra civil española (1927-1937)'', Santiago de Chile 1987, p. 96.. Some scholars classify Gil (along Matías Barrio, Pascual Comín, Salvador Minguión, Bartolomé Feliú and others) as representative of "academic" Carlism, Bartyzel 2015, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; or Integrist.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Gil Novales, ''Centenario de la "información de 1901" del Ateneo de Madrid sobre "oligarquía y caciquismo"'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788424509194}}, p. 140, Chaguaceda Toledano 2005, p. 74, Rabaté 1997, pp. 114-5, Luciano G. Egido, ''Salamanca, la gran metáfora de Unamuno'', Salamanca 1983, {{ISBN|9788474812435}}, p. 19, Dolores Gómez Molleda, ''Unamuno "agitador de espiritus" y Giner de los Ríos'', Salamanca 1976, {{ISBN|9788460069089}}, p. 11, Posada 1983, p. 221, José Javier López Antón, ''Arturo Campión entre la historia y la cultura'', Pamplona 1998, {{ISBN|9788423517879}}, p. 106. Some refer to Gil as "ora integrista, ora carlista", see Victor Manuel Arbeloa, ''El quiebro del PSOE (1933-1934)'', vol. 1, ''Del gobierno a la revolución'', Madrid 2015, {{ISBN|9788415705642}}, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; As a public figure he is considered a reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;"postura inequívocamente reaccionaria" (Ángel Menéndez Rexach, ''La jefatura del Estado en el derecho público español'', Barcelona 1979, p. 199), "uno de los más reaccionarios" scholars in Salamanca (Víctor Ouimette, ''Los intelectuales españoles y el naufragio del liberalismo, 1923-1936'', v. 1, Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788481911770}}, p. 246), "Católico reaccionario" (Manuel José Alonso García, ''Temas y protagonistas del pensamiento español del siglo XX'', v. 1, Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788492177417}}, p. 113)&lt;/ref&gt; According to his son&lt;ref&gt;who was orphaned by his father at the age of 10&lt;/ref&gt; he was "a democrat to the core";&lt;ref&gt;"demócrata en lo más profundo del alma", which does not prevent José María from calling his father "inquebrantable carlista", José María Gil-Robles, ''No fue possible la paz'', Barcelona 1968, p. 20. He also declared that only lack of overt monarchism divided CEDA from Traditionalism, Garcia Canales 2015, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; José María Gil-Robles admitted having been politically indebted to his father,&lt;ref&gt;during one of his Cortes addresses In the early 1930s a Carlist deputy exclaimed: "this is Traditionalism!", to which Gil-Robles responded by stating that the Carlists did not possess exclusive rights to Traditionalism&lt;/ref&gt; but their visions of [[Christian democracy]] were entirely incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Robles viewed first papal references to Christian democracy as "acción social benéfica", sort of Catholic social actitivity and by no means acceptance of "the people" as a political sovereign, Montoro 1970, pp. 105-7. This approach to papal introduction of the term was fairly typical among Catholic conservatives first faced with the papal initiative, see Jacek Bartyzel, ''Demokracja chrześcijańska a konserwatyści (w świetle nauczania papieskiego)'', [in:] Jacek Bartyzel, ''Śmiertelny bóg demos'', Warszawa 2009, {{ISBN|9788389812148}}, pp. 136-144. Another interpretation offered is that Gil viewed christian democracy as recognition that pueblo (hierarchized) shared sovereignty with a monarch, González Cuevas 2001, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars differ when assessing Gil’s contribution to Traditionalism. In a very recent historiographical synthesis of the theory he is treated marginally;&lt;ref&gt;there are 7 rather casual references in Bartyzel 2015; in comparison, Vázquez de Mella is mentioned 67 times&lt;/ref&gt; some see him as merely a "sistematizador" of earlier thought;&lt;ref&gt;mostly Balmes, Cortes and Aparisi - Garcia Canales 1977, p. 44, García Canales 2015, p 25&lt;/ref&gt; others view him as a theorist who re-modeled the ideology&lt;ref&gt;"remodelar los planteamientos del tradicionalismo", Javier Ugarte Tellería, ''El Nacionalismo vasco: Mitos, conmemoraciones y lugares de la memoria'', Madrid 2006, {{ISBN|9788497425513}}, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the all-time Traditionalist greats.&lt;ref&gt;in Marcial Solana, ''El tradicionalismo político español y la ciencia hispana'', Madrid 1951, Vázquez de Mella is mentioned 68 times, Gil Robles 46 times, Ramón Nocedal 25 times, Menendez Pelayo 25 times and Aparisi Guijarro 23 times, referred after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; One student names Gil "most systematic doctrinaire of Traditionalism of the early 20th century" and considers de Mella his follower.&lt;ref&gt;"doctrinario más sistemático del tradicionalismo a comienzos del siglo XX" - González Cuevas 2008, p. 1163. For key differences between Gil Robles and Vázquez de Mella see Bartyzel 2015, p. 140 and García Canales 2015, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In the Spanish public discourse Gil remains largely unknown&lt;ref&gt;the popular Madrid daily ''ABC'' mentioned Enrique Gil Robles only 3 times during 20 years between 1996 and 2016, compare [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/avanzada.stm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and hence, unlike some other Traditionalist thinkers, does not generate controversy.&lt;ref&gt;most controversial case having been [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Víctor Pradera]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the international realm popular works of mostly foreign historians portrayed him as sort of proto-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;especially Paul Preston; "sin duda, el historiador británico no ha leído ni a Enrique Gil Robles, ni a Juan Vázquez de Mella, ni a Víctor Pradera; y tiende, con su habitual ignorancia, a presentar el carlismo como una especie de remedo del fascismo, sin tener en cuenta el antiestatismo y antitotalitarismo característicos del tradicionalismo carlista", Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''En torno a la obra del hispanista Paul Preston'', [in:] ''Catoblepas'' 91 (2009), available [http://www.nodulo.org/ec/2009/n091p01.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Also specialized Spanish scholars, when discussing his general contribution to right-wing thought, despite Gil’s vehement hostility towards omnipotent state admit that "generic organicist ideas that emerged in a general movement of reflux of individualism, put in front of the social question, eventually facilitated the arrival in the twenties to authoritarian or totalitarian corporatist solutions."&lt;ref&gt;García Canales 2015, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7464">'''Ethics of bioprinting''' is a sub-field of [[ethics]] concerning [[bioprinting]]. Some of the ethical issues surrounding bioprinting include equal access to treatment, clinical safety complications, and the enhancement of human body (Dodds 2015).&lt;ref name="SD_2015"&gt;Dodds, S. (2015, February 11). [http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2015/02/11/4161675.htm 3D printing raises ethical issues in medicine]. Retrieved from ABC Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10604035/3D-printing-human-tissue-and-organs-to-spark-ethics-debate.html |title=3D printing human tissue and organs to 'spark ethics debate' |author=Rhiannon Williams |date=29 January 2014 |newspaper=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D printing was invented by Charles Hull in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.3dhubs.com/what-is-3d-printing|title=What is 3D Printing? The definitive guide|website=3D Hubs|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3D printing is a process in additive manufacturing which uses a digital design to produce a physical copy. This process is carried out by a specific printer, which uses several layers in order to complete the design. However, bioprinting uses the ways of 3D printing to create things such as organs, tissues, cells, blood vessels, prosthetics and a broad range of other things that can be used in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innovateus.net/health/what-bioprinting|title=What is Bioprinting?|website=www.innovateus.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explainingthefuture.com/bioprinting.html|title=ExplainingTheFuture.com : Bioprinting|website=www.explainingthefuture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Pioneers" of bioprinting include, Organovo, Tissue Engineering and Regenerative medicine Lab at Columbia University, Makoto Nakamura, to name a few. These pioneers have all helped to shape bioprinting into what it is. The ethics of bioprinting have been a topic of discussion as long as bioprinting has been popular. Ethics are moral principles that govern production, behavior, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/|title=What is Ethics? - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics|last=University|first=Santa Clara|website=www.scu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equal access to treatment ==

Bioprinting focuses on the individual care rather than developing a universal treatment plan for all patients. [[Personalized medicine]] is expensive and increases the disparity between the rich and poor. Since 3D printing is an individual treatment, the general public assumes that it may prevent people with financial issues from receiving care. However, bioprinting improves [[universal health care|universal access]] to healthcare because it will eventually "bring down the time and cost" of treatment.&lt;ref name="SD_2015"/&gt; For example, [[prosthetic limb]]s and [[orthopedic surgery]] can be done in an efficient and inexpensive manner. People would not have to wait months for their prosthetics, which will ultimately decrease the medical expense. The bioprinter may be used to manufacture bone replacements and produce customized prosthetic limbs quickly. Also the printing of human organs, and tissues, are available with decreased time, only taking a few weeks to produce instead of a regular transplant. Currently in the United states the Transplant list is 115,000 people are awaiting a transplant, which can take nearly two years to obtain, while nearly 2 million people have lost a limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amputee-coalition.org/limb-loss-resource-center/resources-filtered/resources-by-topic/limb-loss-statistics/limb-loss-statistics/|title=Limb Loss Statistics - Amputee Coalition|work=Amputee Coalition|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americantransplantfoundation.org/about-transplant/facts-and-myths/|title=Facts and Myths – American Transplant Foundation|website=www.americantransplantfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were previously excluded from these medical advancements will now have access to them.

== Safety ==

Any new treatment involving 3D printers is risky and patients must be well informed of the health implications. Doctors hope in the future to print organs in order to replace dysfunctional bio-structures. Similar to organ donations, the cells must match genetically otherwise the recipient’s body will reject the organ. The patient would have an autoimmune response and destroy the donated tissue. The individual’s stem cells must be used to manufacture the organ for the specific patient. In order to advance this technology the medical field must find a way to test and standardize organ production.

== Human enhancement ==

Bioprinting may be used to increase human performance, strength, speed, or endurance. For instance, bioprinting may be used to manufacture enhanced bones and replace regular human bones that are stronger and more flexible. The 3d printer could also be used to increase muscle performance by making muscles more "resilient and less likely to become fatigued".&lt;ref name="SD_2015"/&gt; [[Lung capacity]] could also be improved by replacing it with an artificial lung that can increase oxygen efficiency in the blood. Human enhancement would have a dangerous but incredible impact on society; bioprinting could create a culture without disease or imperfection. 

== Legality and policies ==
Brioprinted items must require regulation. In the United States this is the job of FDA. The FDA must make sure that printed organs are handled a bit differently then human organs because while Biopriting is a growing field, still little is known about it and what it does to the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pennlawreview.com/print/166-U-Pa-L-Rev-515.pdf|title=FDA Regulation of 3D Printed Organs and Associated Ethical Challenges|last=Kelly|first=Elizabeth|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In bioprinting we face tradeoffs between restricted use and open use. Restricted use will allow bioprinting to only be done by trained professionals, where as, open use is more of a free for all. There are also trade offs between if it is ethical to mass produce organs or if it could make issues in transplant cases worse. The legality behind bioprinting is a means in which selling organs on the black market is deemed a problem but is the production and selling of bioprinted items also fall under that law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=53688a72-1ced-48cd-bc95-6ac15b8b0d7a@sessionmgr4006|title=Marvin K.

'''Frode Alfson Bjørdal''' (born 1960) is professor emeritus in philosophy at the [[University of Oslo]], Norway, and professor colaborador at ''Programa de pós-graduação em filosofia'' at the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte]] in Natal, Brazil.

== Education ==
Bjørdal did his undergraduate studies in philosophy, logic and economics at the University of Bergen, Norway, and was a DAAD-Stipendiat at the Johan Wolfgang Goethe Universität in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1985/86. He continued his studies in philosophy at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], USA, from 1988 to 1992, and got this PhD from there in 1993.

== Career ==
From 1992 to 1994 Bjørdal was a university lecturer at the University of Trondheim (now the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), from 1994 to 1996 an associate professor at the [[University of Tromsø]] and from 1996 to 2005 an associate professor at the University of Oslo. As from 2005 he is a full professor at the University of Oslo, and as from 2013 he is professor emeritus there. As from 2013 he is also a professor colaborador at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

== Scientific interests ==
Bjørdal has mainly been preoccupied with developing an alternative set theory £ (libra) which serves as a foundation for mathematics and deals with the set theoretical and semantical paradoxes in a novel manner. He is also preoccupied with topics in the philosophy of religion, and as a logician he has wide interests in other central areas in philosophy such as ethics, metaphysics and epistemology.

'''GNU Pascal''' (GPC) is a [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] [[compiler]] composed of a frontend to [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), similar to the way [[Fortran]] and other languages were added to GCC. GNU Pascal is [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 7185 compatible, and it implements "most" of the ISO 10206 Extended Pascal standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/Welcome.html#Welcome GPC Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

The major advantage of piggybacking GNU Pascal on the GCC compiler is that it is instantly [[Porting|portable]] to any platform the GCC compiler supports. However since GPC is a frontend, it does have to adapt if major changes are done to GCC (like a major new version). Typically, new major versions are adopted only slowly (still mostly at 3.x, with 4.x experimental builds). This is probably one of the reasons why developers are looking at a C targeting backend.

In July 2010 a developer [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170318/http://fjf.gnu.de/gpc-future.html publicly asked opinion] (it vanished from the web between July 2014 and June 2015) on the future of GNU Pascal, due to developer shortage and maintenance issues as a GCC port. There was a  [https://web.archive.org/web/20150908094319/http://www.g-n-u.de/pipermail/gpc/2010-July/thread.html lively discussion on the maillist] where the developers seemed to lean towards reimplementing in C++ with a C code generating backend. The maillist went to sleep again, and {{As of|2016|12|lc=on}} no further releases or announcements about the future course of the project have been made.

[[Dev-Pascal]] is a graphical [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] that supports GNU Pascal.

'''''Heidegger on Concepts, Freedom, and Normativity''''' is a 2014 book by [[Sacha Golob]], in which the author provides an account of the arguments and concepts characterizing [[Heidegger]]'s early thought and examines their positions both in contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] and the [[history of philosophy]].

'''Howard Kahane''' (19 April 1928 &amp;ndash; 2 May 2001) was a professor of philosophy at [[Baruch College|Bernard M. Baruch College]] in [[New York City]]. He was noted for promoting a popular, and non-mathematical, approach to logic, now known as [[informal logic]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; His best known publication in that area is his textbook ''Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday Life'',&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Lewis, Paul (2001) [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/22/nyregion/howard-kahane-73-philosopher-who-advanced-a-school-of-logic.html  Obituary: Howard Kahane, 73, Philosopher Who Advanced a School of Logic], New York Times, May 22 (Accessed April 29, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hausman, Alan., Landesman, Charles. and Seamon, Roger. (2002) Howard Kahane, 1928-2001 ''[[Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association]]'' Vol. 75, No. 5, May, pp. 191-193&lt;/ref&gt; now at 11th (2009, posthumous) edition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Cavender|author2=Howard Kahane|title=Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday Life|year=2009|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-0-495-80411-6|edition='''11th'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 12th edition was published in 2014.&lt;ref name="cen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edu.cengage.co.uk/catalogue/product.aspx?isbn=1133942326|title=Cengage EMEA: Higher Education Textbooks, eBooks &amp; Digital Solutions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another textbook of his that saw posthumous publication is ''Logic and Philosophy: A Modern Introduction'' (12th edition in 2012).&lt;ref name="HausmanKahane2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Hausman|author2=Howard Kahane|author3=Paul Tidman|title=Logic and Philosophy: A Modern Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9hf-gJg27EC|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-05000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--it's not a retitling of the other one, it had its own, different 11th ed.--&gt;

Kahane graduated with a master's degree from the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (1958) and received a Ph.D. from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1962. Before Baruch College, Kahane taught at [[Whitman College]], the [[University of Kansas]], [[American University]] and the [[University of Maryland at Baltimore]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Nancy Cavender, who is a Professor Emeritus at the [[College of Marin]] and coauthored later editions of Kahane's 1971 textbook,&lt;ref name="cen"/&gt; was also "his companion", according to the New York Times.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Kahane fathered one daughter.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
According to [[argumentation theory]] scholar Michael A. Gilbert, before Kahane's 1971 book North American curricula on [[critical thinking]] and [[fallacies]] was primarily taught from textbooks (such as [[Irving Copi]]'s ''Introduction to Logic'') in which "fallacies are presented in a brief fashion using examples that were mostly invented or taken out of context. [...] The 'radical change' was that Kahane's book took current examples from newspapers and periodicals dealing with issues students cared about or, at least, recognized. This meant that fallacies were more ''situated'' than in older books."&lt;ref name="Gilbert1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A. Gilbert|title=Coalescent Argumentation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1di8D_AZxyIC&amp;pg=PA12|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8058-2520-6|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistics professor Louise Cummings notes that Kahane's book marked a "shift to context", that is, toward [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] criteria for evaluating [[natural language]] arguments. She cites Van Eemeren, Grootendrost and Henkemans (of the [[pragma-dialectic]] school) observation that thanks to his contextual approach Kahane "added new fallacies to the traditional list, so the one will find not only ''[[ad hominem]]'' but also '[[provincialism]]', not only ''[[ad verecundiam]]'', but also the '[[red herring]]', not only [[hasty generalization]] but also '[[suppressed evidence]]'."&lt;ref name="Cummings2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Cummings|title=Pragmatics: A Multidisciplinary Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIRRVDgp4mgC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8058-5543-2|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4034">'''Ilm-e-Khshnoom'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is a school of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] philosophy, practiced by a very small minority of the Indian Zoroastrians ([[Parsi people|Parsis]]/[[Irani (India)|Iranis]]), based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts.

==Principal belief==
At the core of the philosophy is the belief that faith facilitates a connection to a consciousness that transcends normal experience or critical analysis, and that the prayers of the [[Avesta]], which are to a degree metrical, are a means to achieve that consciousness.

==The ''Saheb-e-Dilan''==
In 1875, an eighteen-year-old Parsi named Behramshah Nowroji Shroff left [[Surat]] (Gujarat, [[India]]) for [[Peshawar]] (now in [[Pakistan]]) in search of employment. According to followers of the mystic philosophy, on Shroff's way there, he met a caravan led by members of the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' ("Masters of the Heart"), who persuaded him to accompany them to their home in the mountains. The ''Saheb-e-Dilan'', according to Shroff, were a group of about 2000 individuals led by 72 Mahgav ([[Magi]]) priests, called the ''Abed Saheb-e-Dilan'', who lived in isolation in the recesses of [[Caucasus Mountains]] (alternatively, in the [[Alborz]] range, around [[Mount Damavand]]). Having accompanied the caravan, say his followers, Behramshah Shroff lived with the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' for three years, and so obtained an intimate knowledge of their religious practices and traditions which followed a mystic aspect of the teachings of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra (Zoroaster)]].

Upon his return to India, Shroff gathered a following from among the [[Parsi people|Parsi]] community, who in due course began calling themselves 'Khshnoomists' after 'Khshnoom', or spiritual ecstasy, that they believed were embodied in their prayers and ceremonies.

==20th Century development==
Around 1909, Behramshah Nowroji Shroff met the Parsi priest and Zoroastrian scholar Phiroze Masani, who, influenced by the temperance movement of the United States, had established ''The Parsi Vegetarian &amp; Temperance Society'' in Bombay two years earlier. The philosophy of the ''Ilm-e-Kshnoom'' had a deep influence on Masani, who in turn began publishing Shroff's teachings in ''Frashogard'' ('renewal'), the society's Gujarati quarterly.

In 1917, the society, together with its sister organization, the ''Zoroastrian Radih Society'', bought a large tract of land in Bombay with the intention of establishing a [[Fire temple|Fire Temple]] and a Zoroastrian residential complex there. The foundations were laid in 1923 by Behramshah Shroff
himself, but it was not until 2001 that the Fire-Temple, now known as the "Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher", could be consecrated. The residential complex, now known as "Behram Baug", grew up around it.

Behramshah Nowroji Shroff died in 1927.

==Publications==
Phiroze Masani continued to publish the ''Frashogard'' until his death in 1943. In 1947, Jehangir Chiniwalla, the younger brother of Framroze Chiniwalla, one of the more prolific authors of articles in the ''Frashogard'', began publishing the weekly newspaper "Parsi Avaz".

The ''Parsi Avaz'', which remained in print for 27 years, was followed by the ''Dini Avaz'' in Bombay in 1976, and the "Mazdayasni Connection" in the United States in 1983. The ''Parsi Pukar'', founded in [[Bombay]] in 1995, is today the primary publication of followers of the ''Ilm-e-Kshnoom''.

The '''Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism''' ('''IPCB''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Nixon, Nevada|Nixon]], [[Nevada]] for the purpose of [[political activism]] against the emergent field of [[population genetics]] for [[human migration]] research. The term "biocolonialism" is a [[neologism]] &amp;mdash;a [[portmanteau]] of "[[biology|bio-]]" and "[[colonialism]]" &amp;mdash;used by the IPCB to pejoratively characterise population genetics research as part of invasive and destructive [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] against [[indigenous peoples]].

The group claims to advocate for the interests of indigenous peoples, to assist "in the protection of their genetic resources, indigenous knowledge, cultural and human rights from the negative effects of [[biotechnology]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcb.org/about_us/our_mission.html IPCB Website - Our mission]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the IPCB's protests were based on a rejection of participating in scientific research that would negate or otherwise contradict traditional [[Native American mythology|Native American accounts and narratives]] about their [[creation myth|ancestral origins]], and lend support to other alternate views.

IPCB was a signatory of the [[Indigenous Peoples' Seattle Declaration]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ldb.org/indi99.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The IPCB was founded in 1999 by the current Executive Director Debra Harry, following her growing concerns over a perceived impact of genetic colonialism on the lives of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement |last=Sandler |first=Ronald |publisher=The MIT Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-262-69340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization objects to genetic variation research on isolated populations, as well as its prospective commercial exploration; claiming it as a global threat, not only to the self-determination of all indigenous peoples, but also to the non-indigenous world and to the earth itself.

In 2005 and 2006, the group protested against the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'s [[Genographic Project]] (cf. [[Genographic Project#Criticism|criticism]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13629">'''Ioan Petru Culianu''' or '''Couliano''' (5 January 1950 &amp;ndash; 21 May 1991) was a [[Romania]]n historian of [[history of religion|religion]], [[cultural history|culture]], and [[intellectual history|ideas]], a philosopher and political essayist, and a short story writer. He served as professor of the history of religions at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1988 to his death, and had previously taught the history of [[Romanian culture]] at the [[University of Groningen]].

An expert in [[gnosticism]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], he was encouraged and befriended by [[Mircea Eliade]], though he gradually distanced himself from his mentor. Culianu published seminal work on the interrelation of the [[occult]], [[Eros (love)|Eros]], magic, [[physics]], and history.&lt;ref name=Anton&gt;Anton, Ted. [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9209/culianu.html "The Killing of Professor Culianu"], in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', Volume 2, No. 6 - September/October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Culianu was murdered in 1991. It has been much speculated his murder was in consequence of his critical view of Romanian national politics.&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eros, magic, &amp; the murder of Professor Culianu'' Ted Anton page 23&lt;/ref&gt; Some factions of the Romanian political right openly celebrated his murder.&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt; The Romanian ''[[Securitate]]'', which he once lambasted as a force "of epochal stupidity", has also been suspected of involvement and of using puppet fronts on the right as cover.&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt;

==Biography==

===Career===
Culianu was born in [[Iaşi]]. He studied at the [[University of Bucharest]], then traveled to [[Italy]] where he was granted [[political asylum]] while attending lectures in [[Perugia]] in July 1972. He later graduated from the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt; He lived briefly in [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], before leaving Europe for [[Chicago]], in the [[United States]]. There, after a stint as [[visiting professor]], he became a professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. He took a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne|University of Paris IV]] in January 1987, with the thesis ''Recherches sur les dualismes d'Occident. Analyse de leurs principaux mythes'' ("Research into Western Dualisms. An Analysis of their Major Myths"), coordinated by [[Michel Meslin]].

Having completed three doctorates and being proficient in six languages, Culianu specialized in [[Renaissance]] [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[mysticism]]. He became a friend, and later the [[literary executor]], of [[Mircea Eliade]], the famous historian of religions. He also wrote fiction and political articles.

Culianu had divorced his first wife, and at the time of his death was engaged to Hillary Wiesner, a 27-year-old graduate student at [[Harvard University]].

===Death===
Minutes after concluding a conversation with his doctoral student, [[Alexander Argüelles]], at noon on a day when the building was teeming with visitors to a book sale, Culianu was murdered in the bathroom of the [[divinity school]], Swift Hall, of the University of Chicago. He was shot once in the back of the head. The identity of the killer and the motive are still unknown.

Speculation arose that he had been killed by former [[Securitate]] agents, due to political articles in which he attacked the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]]. The murder occurred a year and a half after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]] and [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s death.

Before being killed, he had published a number of articles and interviews that heavily criticized the [[Ion Iliescu]] post-Revolution regime, making Culianu one of the government's most vocal adversaries. Several theories link his murder with [[Serviciul Român de Informaţii|Romanian Intelligence]], which was widely perceived as the successor of the Securitate;&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt; several pages of Culianu's Securitate files are inexplicably missing. Some reports suggest that Culianu had been threatened by anonymous phone calls in the days leading up to his killing.&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt;

Ultra-[[nationalist]] and [[neo-fascist]] involvement, as part of an [[Iron Guard]] revival in connection with the nationalist discourse of the late years of Ceauşescu's rule and the rise of the [[Vatra Românească]] and [[Greater Romania Party|România Mare]] parties, was not itself excluded from the scenario;&lt;ref&gt;Antohi; Savin; Tismăneanu, "Cei pe care..."&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]]: "[Culianu] gave the most devastating indictment of the new union of [[far left]] and [[far right]] in Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, in Anton&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his criticism of the Iron Guard, Culianu had come to expose [[Mircea Eliade]]'s connections with the latter movement during the [[interwar years]] (because of this, relations between the two academics had soured for the final years of Eliade's life).&lt;ref name=Anton /&gt;

The [[FBI]] also investigated the possibility of an [[occult]] group having been involved in the killing, owing to Culianu's work in that field.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Iranian philosophy''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: فلسفه ایرانی) or '''Persian philosophy'''&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia. Edited by Mehdi Amin. Razavi. (Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996).

Tauris/Ismaili Studies, October 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84511-542-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip G. Kreyenbroek: "Morals and Society in Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy".

Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; can be traced back as far as to [[Iranian languages|Old Iranian]] philosophical traditions and thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. According to the [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]], the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathustra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through [[Judaism]], and therefore on [[Middle Platonism]]."

Throughout [[History of Iran|Iranian history]] and due to remarkable political and social changes such as [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|the Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions, to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after the Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

==Ancient Iranian Philosophy==
''See also [[Ancient Philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Ancient Iranian Philosophy]]''

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Zartosht.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] portrayed in a popular 18th century Indian [[Parsi people|Parsi]] Zoroastrian depiction.]] --&gt;

The teachings of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (Zoroaster) appeared in [[Persia]] at some point during the period 1700-1800 BCE.&lt;ref name="Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zarathushtra, Mazdayasna and Governance|author=Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitley"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Date and Teaching of Zarathustra|author=Whitley, C.F.|pages=219–223|journal=Numen|volume= 4|issue=3|date=Sep 1957|doi=10.2307/3269345}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wisdom became the basis of the religion [[Zoroastrianism]], and generally influenced the development of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] branch of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] philosophy. Zarathustra was the first who treated the problem of evil in philosophical terms.&lt;ref name="Whitley" /&gt; He is also believed to be one of the oldest [[monotheism|monotheists]] in the history of religion{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. He espoused an ethical philosophy based on the primacy of ''good thoughts (andiše-e-nik), good words (goftâr-e-nik), and good deeds (kerdâr-e-nik).''

The works of Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism had a significant influence on [[Greek philosophy]] and [[History of Western philosophy|Roman philosophy]]. Several [[ancient Greek]] writers such as  [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and [[Latin]] writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] praised Zoroastrian philosophy as "the most famous and most useful"{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. [[Plato]] learnt of Zoroastrian philosophy through Eudoxus and incorporated much of it into his own [[Platonic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr. Saxl", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''49''' (1), p. 111-116 [111].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BC, however, [[Colotes]] accused Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' of plagiarizing parts of Zoroaster's [[On Nature (Zoroaster)|On Nature]], such as the [[Myth of Er]].&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone (2002), ''The Dying God: The Hidden History of Western Civilization'', p. 144-145, iUniverse, {{ISBN|0-595-23199-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr. Saxl", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''49''' (1), p. 111-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarathustra was known as a sage, magician and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture, though almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late eighteenth century. By this time his name was associated with lost ancient wisdom and was appropriated by [[Freemasons]] and other groups who claimed access to such knowledge. He appears in Mozart's opera [[The Magic Flute]] ("Die Zauberflöte") under the variant name "Sarastro", who represents moral order in opposition to the "Queen of the Night". [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]] promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational [[Deism]], preferable to [[Christianity]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

In 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, S. (2005). p 409, The Oxford dictionary of philosophy. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, H., Frankfort, H. A. G., Wilson, J. A., &amp; Jacobsen, T. (1964). Before Philosophy. Penguin, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Zarathustra's impact lingers today due in part to the system of rational ethics he founded called Mazda-Yasna. The word Mazda-Yasna is [[Avestan]] and is translated as "Worship of Wisdom" in English. The encyclopedia [[Natural History (Pliny)]] claims that Zoroastrians later educated the Greeks who, starting with [[Pythagoras]], used a similar term, philosophy, or “love of wisdom” to describe the search for ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|title=Pliny Natural History Vol 8; Book XXX|last=Jones|first=W.H.S.|date=1963|website=|publisher=Heinemann|access-date=December 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|archive-date=2017-01-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Persian Era===
Little is known of the situation of philosophy during the time of the ancient Greek philosophers. We know that the Persian culture had influence on the creation of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of thought, but nothing has been left in Persian writings.

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}

[[Manichaeism]], founded by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], was influential from [[North Africa]] in the West, to [[China]] in the East. Its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism, which he passionately denounced in his writings, and whose writings continue to be influential among Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox [[theology|theologians]]. An important principle of Manichaeism was its [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] [[cosmology]]/[[theology]], which it shared with [[Mazdak]]ism, a philosophy founded by Mazdak. Under this dualism, there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, and man's role in this life was through good conduct to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. Mani saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, while Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.

===Mazdakism===
{{main|Mazdak}}
[[File:The Iranian prophet Mazdak being executed.png|thumb|Execution of [[Mazdak]]]]
[[Mazdak]] (d. 524/528 CE) was a proto-[[Socialism|socialist]] Persian reformer who gained influence under the reign of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian]] king [[Kavadh I of Persia|Kavadh I]]. He claimed to be a [[prophet]] of God, and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs.

In many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social [[revolution]], and has been referred to as early "[[communism]]"&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;Wherry, Rev. E. M. "A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran and Preliminary Discourse", 1896. pp 66.&lt;/ref&gt; or proto-socialism.&lt;ref name="Manfred"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Manfred, Albert Zakharovich|year=1974|title=A Short History of the World|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|volume=1|page=182|others=(translated into English by Katherine Judelson)|oclc=1159025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zurvanism===
{{main|Zurvanism}}

[[Zurvanism]] is characterized by the element of its First Principle which is Time, "Zurvan", as a primordial creator. According to Zaehner, Zurvanism appears to have three schools of thought all of which have classical Zurvanism as their foundation:

====Aesthetic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Aesthetic Zurvanism|Aesthetic Zurvanism]] which was apparently not as popular as the ''materialistic'' kind, viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated Time, which, under the influence of desire, divided into reason (a male principle) and concupiscence (a female principle).

====Materialist Zurvanism====
While Zoroaster's [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]] created the universe with his thought, [[Zurvanism#Materialist Zurvanism|materialist Zurvanism]] challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing.

====Fatalistic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Fatalistic Zurvanism|Fatalistic Zurvanism]] resulted from the doctrine of limited time with the implication that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe and that the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. According to the [[Middle Persian]] work [[Menog-i Khrad]]: "[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets."

==Classical Islamic period==
{{see also|Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy}}
The intellectual tradition in [[Persia]] continued after Islam and was of great influence on the further development of Iranian Philosophy. The main schools for such studies were, and to some extents still are, Shiraz, Khurasan, Maragheh, Isfahan, Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr,"Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy", SUNY Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7914-6799-6}}, Chapters 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicennism===
{{main|Avicennism}}
[[File:IbnSinaCanon1.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]]''.]]
In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], due to [[Avicenna]]'s (Ibn Sina's; born near [[Bukhara]]) successful reconciliation between [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] along with [[Kalam]], Avicennism eventually became the leading school of [[Islamic philosophy]] by the 12th century. Avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then, and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time:&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p. 80-81, "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"People nowadays [believe] that truth is whatever [Ibn Sina] says, that it is inconceivable for him to err, and that whoever contradicts him in anything he says cannot be rational."}}

Avicennism was also influential in [[medieval Europe]], particularly his doctrines on the nature of the [[soul]] and his [[existence]]-[[essence]] distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in [[Scholasticism|scholastic Europe]]. This was particularly the case in [[Paris]], where Avicennism was later [[proscribed]] in 1210. Nevertheless, his [[psychology]] and theory of knowledge influenced [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], and his [[metaphysics]] influenced the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm#H5 The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980-1037)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminationism===
{{main|Illuminationist philosophy}}

[[Illuminationist philosophy]] was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the 12th century. This school is a combination of [[Avicenna]]'s philosophy and ancient Iranian philosophy, along with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by [[Neoplatonism]].

===Transcendent theosophy===
{{main|Transcendent Theosophy}}

[[Transcendent Theosophy]] is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Mulla Sadra]] in the 17th century. Mulla Sadra bought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.&lt;ref name=Kamal&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5271-8|pages=9 &amp; 39|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Iranian philosophy==
{{see also|Modern Islamic philosophy}}

Philosophy was and still is a popular subject of study in Iran. Previous to Western style universities, philosophy was a major field of study in religious seminaries.  Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060322165520/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2245/html/art.htm#53538][https://archive.is/20131204114301/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education]

On the diversity and expansion of philosophy in Iran, [[Khosrow Bagheri]] has stated "One part of philosophical endeavor in Iran today, and perhaps the main one, is concerned with the local philosophy which is dominated by the school of Mulla Sadra. He has provided a philosophy in line with the old metaphysical inclination but in the feature of a combination of mysticism, philosophy, and the Islamic religious views. On the other hand, a relatively strong translation movement has been shaped in which the Iranian readers are provided by some of the important sources of contemporary philosophy in Persian including both the analytic and continental traditions. In the former, Wittgenstein, Searle, and Kripke, and in the latter, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault can be mentioned. There have also been concentrations on a local polar contrast between Popper and Heidegger, and, due to the religious atmosphere, on philosophy of religion." &lt;ref&gt;http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among journals being published in Iran on philosophy there are ''FALSAFEH-The Iranian Journal of Philosophy''[http://journals.ut.ac.ir/issueuser/AboutUs.aspx?MissID=46]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} published by the department of philosophy of the University of Tehran since 1972 and  ''Hikmat va Falsafeh'' published by Allamah Tabataba'i University in Tehran, ''Ma'rifat-e Falsafeh'' published by the Imam Khomeini Education and Research Institute in Qom, and many others. Also worthy of mention is the journal, ''Naqd o Nazar'' published by Daftar Tablighat in Qom, which often includes articles on philosophical topics and other issues of interest to religious thinkers and intellectuals.

It is important to note that [[Sufism]] has had a great amount of influence on Iranian/Persian philosophy.

In the history of Islamic philosophy, there were a few Persian philosophers who had their own schools of philosophy: [[Avicenna]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]]. Some philosophers did not offer a new philosophy, rather they had some innovations: Mirdamad, Khajeh Nasir and Qutb al-Din Shirazi belong to this group. Some philosophers had new narration of existing philosophies: Agha Ali Modarres is an example of such philosophers.[http://kadivar.com/Index.asp?DocId=305&amp;AC=1&amp;AF=1&amp;ASB=1&amp;AGM=1&amp;AL=1&amp;DT=dtv]

{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''Bojo Jinul''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hanja=普照知訥|hangul=보조지눌}}, 1158–1210), often called '''Jinul''' or '''Chinul''' for short, was a [[Korea]]n monk of the [[Goryeo]] period, who is considered to be the most influential figure in the formation of Korean [[Korean Seon|Seon]] (Zen) [[Buddhism]].  He is credited as the founder of the [[Jogye Order]], by working to unify the disparate sects in [[Korean Buddhism]] into a cohesive organization.

== Biography ==
Bojo Jinul's birthname was Jeong and by age 15 he left his family to ordain under Seon Master Jonghwi of the Sagulsan School, one of the [[nine mountain schools]] of Seon, receiving the ordination name "Jinul". This occurred in 1173.  By 1182, Jinul passed the royal examination for monks and qualified for a higher administrative position, but turned it down to join the Seon [[sangha]] at Bojesa in [[Pyongyang]]. The community being uninterested in his efforts to reform the retreat community, he moved to Cheongwonsa at Changpyeong, then Bomunsa on Hagasan.

During this period of travel and study, Jinul was said to have studied the entire [[Tripiṭaka]] and had a series of awakenings.  Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon which he called the "[[samadhi]] and [[prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] society" ({{Ko-hhrm|hanja=定慧社|hangul=정혜사|rr=Jeonghyesa}}). This movement's goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. Jinul eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of [[Songgwangsa]] on [[Jogyesan]], and in the process the [[Jogye Order]], which taught a comprehensive approach to Buddhism including meditation, doctrine, chanting and lectures. By 1209, he completed his magnum opus the ''Excerpts from the Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record with Personal Notes'' ({{korean|hangul=법집별항록절요병입사기|hanja=法集別行錄節要幷入私記|rr=beopjip pyeolhaeng nok cheolyo byeongip sagi}}), an extensive exploration of various schools of [[Chan Buddhism]] in China, with extensive commentaries on the writings of the Chinese monk [[Guifeng Zongmi]] as well as personal notes.

This earned him the respect of the [[Goryeo]], and in particular [[Huijong of Goryeo|King Huijong]], who ordered that Mount Songgwangsan be renamed Jogyesan in his honor. Upon his death in 1210, he was given a posthumous title of honor by King Huijong as well.

== Teachings ==

=== Essence-Function ===

[[Essence-Function]] ({{korean|hanja=體用|hangul=체용}}) is a key concept of [[Korean Buddhism]]. Essence-Function takes a particular form in the philosophy and writings of Jinul.&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Charles A. (1995). "The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa" cited in ''Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University'' No. 3, March 1995, pp 33-48.Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229110417/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }} (accessed: September 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== View of Nirvana ===

Jinul viewed [[Nirvana]] as a sublime essence that is present in all beings. This essence is the very nature of Buddha and has always been present in beings. Writing on the faith in such matters held by his own school, Jinul states:
{{quote|Right faith in the patriarchal sect ... does not believe in conditioned causes or effects. Rather, it stresses faith that everyone is originally a Buddha, that everyone possesses the impeccable self-nature, and that the sublime essence of nirvana is complete in everyone. There is no need to search elsewhere; since time immemorial, it has been innate in everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert Jr.|authorlink=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EazRC28tdIIC|year=1991|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1427-4|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jinul further believed that the true nature of all people is unchanging and that their minds are ultimately numinous and marked by awareness, even when seemingly in a state of delusion. In a discussion of Buddhist schools, he writes, "In the present condensation, I treat the school of Ho-tse first, primarily so that people who are practicing meditation will be able to awaken first to the fact that, whether deluded or awakened, their own minds are numinous, aware, and never dark and their nature is unchanging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert Jr.|authorlink=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EazRC28tdIIC|year=1991|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1427-4|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth George Mills''' (January 25, 1923 – October 8, 2004) was a Canadian [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]/[[philosophical]] speaker and author. An exponent of the [[oral tradition]], he gave spontaneous [[lectures]] and [[poetry]] for over 37 years. At the same time, he became noted for his accomplishments in [[music]], particularly as the conductor of the choral ensemble The Star-Scape Singers. He excelled at [[Musical composition|composing]], [[painting]] and [[design]] and has been described by some as a [[New Age]] man, a man for all seasons, and a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Omega New Age Directory'', book review of ''The Golden Nail'', November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Omega New Age Directory'', book review of ''Change Your Standpoint ~ Change Your World'', August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Urban, quoted in "An Open Letter of Appreciation to Canada," written by Rolland G. Smith, broadcast journalist, and published in PRIME Mentors’ newsletter, "Tenth Anniversary Gala Celebration!" April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Mills was born in [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick]] in January 1923. He attended [[Mount Allison University]] in Sackville, New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="NYTimes obituary"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EED71E3BF930A25753C1A9629C8B63 Obituary, The New York ''Times'', October 13, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Trained from the age of 7 in [[music]], he became a [[concert pianist]], with debuts in [[Toronto]] in 1952 and [[New York City]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="canadian encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1SEC887473 ''Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''], 2nd edition. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Though he chose to end his career as a concert pianist in 1963, he concentrated on teaching piano and adjudicating young musicians for another ten years.&lt;ref name="canadian achievers"&gt;Tan-Willman, Conchita: "Canadian Achievers and Their Mentors," Vol. 1, PRIME Mentors of Canada (Toronto: PRIME Mentors of Canada, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Living in [[Toronto]], he began speaking spontaneously to those who requested that he do so,&lt;ref name="Son 2007 p. 191"&gt;''The Candy Maker’s Son: Memoirs of Kenneth G. Mills'' (Toronto: The Kenneth G. Mills Foundation, 2007), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately offering many thousands of hours of metaphysical/philosophical lectures and meetings over his lifetime.
 
Mills extended his musical interests in 1976 when he formed the [[a cappella]] vocal ensemble The Star-Scape Singers. He and his singers would eventually give concerts throughout &lt;!-- Canada?,  --&gt;Eastern and Western Europe and the United States. Mills also engaged in [[musical composition]], creating both [[choral]] and [[orchestral]] works. In addition, he explored various types of designing, and in 1993 created a line of [[haute couture]] [[fashions]]. His interest in [[painting]] yielded more than 200 large canvases.&lt;ref name="canadian achievers" /&gt; He was recognized for [[mentoring]] and sponsorship of artists in all these disciplines, and he continued his mentoring and spontaneous speaking until shortly before his death in October 2004.

==Spontaneous lectures==
In 1964, Mills decided to speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. He made this agreement after he received the same message from two different sources: "You must learn to speak the Word again."&lt;ref name="Son 2007 p. 191"/&gt; Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called ''Unfoldment'', as "an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living beyond the limits of three dimensions and translating what seems to be the ordinary into another level of consideration."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; He also often spoke in [[poetry]], offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="canadian achievers" /&gt;

Many of Mills’ spontaneous lectures were recorded and transcribed. Ultimately, a number of them were gathered together and published as books or as spoken word recordings, described by one reviewer as offering [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas which are "provocative and deeply inspiring."&lt;ref&gt;Book review in ''Science of Mind'', March 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leading Edge Review 1993, p. 3"&gt;''Leading Edge Review'', Fall 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer of one of his poetry books observed that Mills’ universal themes "revolve around wonder, light and love,"&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews," ''Performing Arts'', November 1987, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; while an endorsement on another of his books described Mills as having fun with the language and the sounds of words.&lt;ref&gt;Renee Gelpi, journalist and broadcaster, endorsement for ''Change Your Standpoint ~ Change Your World''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been pointed out that Mills’ lectures and books "give a universal, metaphysical perspective on some of the most perplexing problems faced by men and women today."&lt;ref name="Leading Edge Review 1993, p. 3"/&gt;

In 1989, the Earth-Stage Actors, a [[New York City]]–based ensemble, began to dramatize excerpts from Mills’ publications. Critics have called these dramatizations "a theatre of philosophy" and "modern-day [[Shakespeare]]."&lt;ref name="canadian achievers" /&gt;

==Music==

Mills’ philosophy always possessed for him strong musical implications. "The purpose of Music is to reveal to man his innate at-one-ment with a harmonic state of Being", he said.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Kenneth G., quoted in "Star-Scape Singers," CanComp 206, December 1985, cited in [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1SEC887473 ''Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''], 2nd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; When three singers (from the vocal group [[The Free Design]]) asked him for help with their voices in 1976, Mills soon found himself re-engaging the world of concertizing. Within a short time, the three singers were joined by seven others, and the a cappella vocal ensemble he called The Star-Scape Singers was formed. These singers were ultimately acclaimed in the United States and abroad as creators of a renaissance in choral art.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, Emslie, "Star-Scape Singers: A Celestial Sound," ''Performing Arts in Canada'', September 1986, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Star-Scape made their American debut at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1981, ultimately performing seven different concerts there between 1981 and 1986.&lt;ref name="ussr tour"&gt;Alberghini, Susan, "Star-Scape Singers’ USSR Tour Transcends Boundaries," in ''Music Magazine'', vol. 12, no. 2 (April 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; New York City critics described them as "an instrument of bright and extraordinary varied capacity"&lt;ref&gt;"Music; Star-Scape Singers" by Tim Page. The New York ''Times'', October 30, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a vocal ensemble of rare distinction."&lt;ref&gt;"Music Beat" by Robert Kimball. ''New York Post'', November 1, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the Singers embarked upon their first tour to [[Europe]], performing at several large choral festivals, and on subsequent tours at many of the great halls and cathedrals of both Western and Eastern Europe. One critic in [[Munich]] described their work with Mills as "phenomenal, artistic, one-of-a-kind vocal art."&lt;ref&gt;"Sounds of Stars" by Wolfgang Schreiber, ''Suddeutsche Zeitung'', Munich, May 29, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Mills and the ensemble made a total of seven lengthy [[Europe]]an and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tours. While on tour in 1984, they were asked to make a recording for broadcast on [[Radio Vatican]], inaugurating the World Year of Music in 1985.&lt;ref name="ussr tour" /&gt; One of their performances of ''The Fire Mass'', considered the ensemble’s major work, at [[Roy Thomson Hall]] in [[Toronto]] was broadcast nationwide by the ([[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]) in 1988.&lt;ref name="canadian encyclopedia" /&gt; On their tour to the then-USSR in 1991, Mills and the Singers led the first non-military Victory Day Parade down [[Gorky Street]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="ussr tour" /&gt;

Mills co-composed or arranged over 150 pieces for the Star-Scape repertoire in collaboration with composer [[Christopher Dedrick]].&lt;ref name="canadian achievers" /&gt; In 1996, Mills began composing spontaneous orchestral works, using four [[MIDI]] keyboards plus foot pedals to capture his instantaneous compositions. Critics have credited him with bridging the classical and new age genres.&lt;ref&gt;McDevitt, Sean: "Spontaneous Symphonies," Home Recording, July/August 1999, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to approximate the sounds of real instruments as closely as possible with the keyboards, and in 2002 a CD of several of his orchestral compositions, titled ''Majestic Tonescape'', was released, performed by musicians from the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Cover notes, ''Majestic Tonescape'' CD, Sun-Scape Enterprises, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other endeavors==
In February 1993, Mills began to draw and paint for the first time. He soon became a prolific painter of large canvasses, creating more than 200 in less than three years. Most of his paintings depict huge flowers or otherworldly landscapes, and they have been recognized for the bold use of color and their energy. The paintings have been exhibited in both Canada and the U.S., and some are found in private collections.

Mills also ventured into the realm of [[fashion design]]. Ultimately, he created an elegant line of [[haute couture]] fashions, Moulins Originales, many of which were debuted in a fashion show titled ''The Integrity of Elegance''. This showing was captured on a pioneering [[high-definition television]] recording at [[New York City]]’s [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in February 1993.&lt;ref name="canadian achievers" /&gt; Another showing of Mills’ designs occurred at the [[Design Exchange]] in [[Toronto]] during the PRIME Mentors’ 10th Anniversary Celebration, in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Urban, Director of the Design Exchange, writing in PRIME Mentors newsletter, "Tenth Anniversary Gala Celebration!" April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
At the gala banquet of the MedArt International 1992 World Congress, a gathering of physicians and artists who specialize in bringing the arts to medicine, Mills was presented with a Special Recognition Award "for the outstanding healing power of his art"&lt;ref name="NYTimes obituary" /&gt; (i.e. his music).

A lifelong supporter of the arts, Mills founded Patrons of Wisdom in 1980, a [[non-profit organization]] that supported and encouraged young classical musicians and artists. In recognition of his continuous support of deserving individuals and "for being an exemplary [[mentor]] and for serving as a role model par excellence whom society could look up to for inspiration and guidance," he was chosen Honorary PRIME Mentor of Canada in April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primementorscanada.org/honorary-mentors.htm PRIME Mentors of Canada Honorary PRIME Mentors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Mills was awarded an honorary doctorate of Humanities from Wolfe’s University. That same year, the [[Senate of Canada]] recognized Mills with their Award of Excellence "for outstanding achievement in humanity, education, philosophy and arts."&lt;ref name="NYTimes obituary" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31094">The '''knight of faith''' is an individual who has placed complete [[faith]] in himself and in God and can act freely and independently from the world. The 19th-century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] vicariously discusses the knight of faith in several of his pseudonymic works, with the most in-depth and detailed critique exposited in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''.

==Overview==
Johannes de Silentio, Kierkegaard's pseudonymous author of ''Fear and Trembling'', argues that the knight of faith is the paradox, is the individual, absolutely nothing but the individual, without connections or pretensions.  The ''knight of faith'' is the individual who is able to gracefully embrace life: Kierkegaard put it this way in  ''Either/Or'', "When around one everything has become silent, solemn as a clear, starlit night, when the soul comes to be alone in the whole world, then before one there appears, not an extraordinary human being, but the eternal power itself, then the heavens open, and the I chooses itself or, more correctly, receives itself. Then the [[Personality psychology|personality]] receives the accolade of knighthood that ennobles it for an eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or part II p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; "The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien."&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, Hong p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox |Most people live dejectedly in worldly sorrow and joy; they are the ones who sit along the wall and do not join in the dance. The knights of infinity are dancers and possess elevation. They make the movements upward, and fall down again; and this too is no mean pastime, nor ungraceful to behold. But whenever they fall down they are not able at once to assume the posture, they vacillate an instant, and this vacillation shows that after all they are strangers in the world. This is more or less strikingly evident in proportion to the art they possess, but even the most artistic knights cannot altogether conceal this vacillation. One need not look at them when they are up in the air, but only the instant they touch or have touched the ground–then one recognizes them. But to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime in the pedestrian–that only the knight of faith can do–and this is the one and only prodigy.|Johannes de Silentio|Fear and Trembling, 1843| width  = 33%| align  = right

== The three stages ==
{{Further information|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Three stages of life {{!}} The Three Stages}}
Kierkegaard recognized three levels of individual existence: The Aesthetic, The Ethical, and The Religious.  In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Silentio refers to individuals in each stage as the personal self, the civic self, and the religious self.  Each of these levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical or religious person can still enjoy life aesthetically. Abraham learned how to keep his finite relationship with his family separate from his infinite relationship with God. He had to overcome the fear of having anxiety over losing something. Each individual experiences anxiety to a different degree and the fear of anxiety in a unique way.

== Knight of faith and the knight of infinite resignation ==
Kierkegaard's Silentio contrasts the knight of faith with the other two, knight of infinite resignation and the aesthetic realm's "slaves."  Kierkegaard uses the story of a princess and a man who is madly in love with her, but circumstances are that the man will never be able to realize this love in this world.  A person who is in the aesthetic stage would abandon this love, crying out for example, "Such a love is foolishness. The rich brewer's widow is a match fully as good and respectable."  A person who is in the ethical stage would not give up on this love, but would be resigned to the fact that they will never be together in this world.  The knight of infinite resignation may or may not believe that they may be together in another life or in spirit, but what's important is that the knight of infinite resignation gives up on their being together ''in this world; in this life.''

The knight of faith feels what the knight of infinite resignation feels, but with exception that the knight of faith believes that ''in this world; in this life'', they will be together.  The knight of faith would say "I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, in virtue, that is, of the absurd, in virtue of the fact that with God all things are possible."  This double movement is paradoxical because on the one hand it is humanly impossible that they would be together, but on the other hand the knight of faith is willing to believe that they will be together through divine possibility.

== Abraham and Isaac ==
[[File:Anthony van Dyck - Abraham and Isaac - WGA07427.jpg|right|thumb|350px|alt=Abraham and Isaac|Abraham and Isaac by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]Johannes de Silentio believes that [[Abraham]] is one such knight of faith.  In the [[Book of Genesis]], God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abraham dearly loved his son, but although bemoaning this fate, Abraham obeyed this command faithfully.  Just as he was about to commit the act, an angel stopped Abraham and rewarded him with his son and his steadfast faith.  In the same paradoxical act of committing murder, which would humanly kill off his son, Abraham believed, through virtue of the absurd, he would still have his son alive and well. Abraham was willing to risk everything for God. He was willing to act and in his action he received the highest good, his eternal happiness.

But "how" did Abraham act? He walked for 3 days step by step trusting in God. That is an example of keeping expectancy alive when any ethicist would say it should have died before he left home. What would have happened to his expectancy had he told Sarah? Or Isaac? He would have to explain himself but he couldn't. So he ventured for the truth of what he understood as the highest good. He kept his resolution intact. {{Quotation|To have faith in God-does that mean to think about how glorious it must be to have faith, to think about what peace and security faith can give? Not at all. Even to wish, where the interest, the subject’s interest, is far more evident, is not to have faith, is not to act. The individual’s relation to the thought-action is still continually only a possibility that he can give up. It is not denied that with regard to evil there are cases in which the transition is almost undetectable, but these cases must be explained in a special way. This is due to the fact that the individual is so in the power of habit that by frequently having made the transition from thinking to acting he has finally lost the power for it in the bondage of habit, which at his expense makes it faster and faster. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 339-340}} {{Quotation|If I, acting, am truly to venture and truly to aspire to the highest good, then there must be uncertainty and, if I may put it this way, I must have room to move. But the greatest space in which I can move, where there is space enough for the most rigorous gesture of infinite passion, is uncertainty of knowledge with regard to an eternal happiness, or that choosing it is lunacy in the finite sense-see, now there is room, now you can venture. Therefore eternal happiness, as the absolute good, has the remarkable quality that it can be defined only by the mode in which it is acquired, whereas other good, just because of the mode of acquisition is accidental or at any rate relatively dialectical, must be defined by the good itself. Money, for example, can be acquired by work and can also be obtained without work, and in turn both are different in many ways, but money still remains the same good. Knowledge, for example, is acquired differently according to talent and outward circumstances and therefore cannot be defined by the mode of acquisition. But nothing else can be said of eternal happiness than that it is the good that is attained by absolutely venturing everything. Any description of the gloriousness of this good is already an attempt, as it were, to make various modes of acquisition possible-an easier way, for example, and a harder way, which shows that the description is not describing the absolute good but only fancies doing it and essentially is talking about relative goods. Venture everything. There are no [[anecdotes]] to tell how [[Saint Peter|Peter]] became rich by working, and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] by playing the lottery, and Hans by inheritance, and Matthew by monetary reform, and Christopher by purchasing a piece of furniture from a secondhand dealer. But in another sense the [[discourse]] is long, indeed, the longest of all discourses, because to [[Risk|venture]] everything demands a [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparency]] of [[consciousness]] that is acquired only very slowly. Right here is the task of the religious discourse. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 426-427}}

== Who are knights of faith? ==
[[File:Jan Janssens - The Annunciation - WGA11940.jpg|left|thumb|200px|alt=The Annunciation|The Annunciation, by [[Jan Janssens]]]]Silentio personally believes that only two people were ever knights of faith: The [[Virgin Mary]], and Abraham.  It is also possible that Silentio regards [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as a knight of faith.  Silentio grants that there may be knights of faith out there that we do not know about, or that there never have been knights of faith. This is because knights of faith exist alone in isolation. Yet Kierkegaard said the following in ''Repetition''. "The Young Man has gone through the same ordeal as Job but neither of them is a Knight of Faith."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Repetition'' p. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham wasn't really alone and living in isolation, he was only alone for three anxious filled days,&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; he was a married man who had a wife and children and God had promised him many more. Mary was alone with the angel for a short time but then she was a wife and later a mother. &lt;blockquote&gt;To be sure, Mary bore the child wondrously, but she nevertheless did it “after the manner of women,” and such a time is one of [[anxiety]], distress and [[paradox]]. The angel was indeed a ministering spirit, but he was not a meddlesome spirit who went to the other young maidens in Israel and said: Do not scorn Mary, the extraordinary is happening to her. The angel went only to Mary, and no one could understand her. Has any woman been as infringed upon, as Mary, and is it not true here also that the one whom God blesses he curses in the same breath? ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 65&lt;ref&gt;See Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 259-260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Knight of Faith is a man or woman of action. (See ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' for the kind of action.) Abraham became a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily lifted the knife to sacrifice Isaac. Mary was a Knight of Faith because she volunteered to have Jesus. Jesus became a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily went to the cross. Paul was a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily (resolutely) went to Jerusalem. Kierkegaard considered Diogenes a Knight of Faith also but he didn't have to do great feats or conquer the universe to become one. Kierkegaard stressed the reversal of the inner and the outer in his first book, ''Either/Or''. He may have been thinking that Mary and Joseph, Job, Abraham, Paul, Socrates, and Jesus  all acted in the "innermost being" rather than in the external temporal world at times. However, he made a sharp distinction between Mary and others in his ''[[The Book on Adler]]''. Adler had an action in the innermost being but didn't think it was his job to do what he was told but that it was something he should tell the whole church (assembly) to do. An action in the inner-being is something completely different from an action in the outer being. How does one paint an inner action? How does one show an inner action on the stage? How does one describe it to another?&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 397ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard says, "When the [[Eleatics]] denied [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], as everyone knows, came forward as an opponent. He literally did come forward, because he did not say a word but merely paced back and forth a few times, thereby assuming that he had sufficiently refuted them."&lt;ref&gt;''Repetition'', Hong p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He used Diogenes in the same way in ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' in 1844. {{Quotation|When Philip threatened to lay siege to the city of Corinth and all its inhabitants hastily bestirred themselves in defense, some polishing weapons, some gathering stones, some repairing the walls, Diogenes seeing all this hurriedly folded his mantle about him and began to roll his tub zealously back and forth through the streets. When he was asked why he did this he replied that he wished to be busy like all the rest, and rolled his tub lest he should be the only idler among so many industrious citizens. Such conduct is at any rate not sophistical, if Aristotle be right in describing sophistry as the art of making money. It is certainly not open to misunderstanding; it is quite inconceivable that Diogenes should have been hailed as the saviour and benefactor of the city. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments '', p. 5 (Kierkegaard was probably quoting Lucian of Samosata from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6829 The Way to Write History)]}}

Kierkegaard kept to the same theme in his earlier and later works. "The great heroic feats are the stuff of history but they are not the stuff of life. Each single individual can do the great things of life. Each of us is born with the power to become what we become. "[Faith] can be grasped and held fast by the simplest of people, it is only the more difficult for the cultured to attain. What a wondrous, inspiring, Christian humanity: the highest is common for all human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 293-294&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;he then possesses himself as a task in such a way that it is chiefly to order, shape, temper, inflame, control-in short, to produce an evenness in the soul, a harmony, which is the fruit of the personal virtues. ... Someone can conquer kingdoms and countries without being a hero; someone else can prove himself a hero by controlling his temper. Someone can display courage by doing the out-of-the-ordinary, another by doing the ordinary. The question is-how does he do it? .... When the originality in earnestness is acquired and preserved, then there is succession and repetition, but as soon as originality is lacking in repetition, there is habit.The earnest person is earnest precisely through the originality from which he returns in repetition. It is said that a living and inward feeling preserves this originality, but the inwardness of the feeling is a fire that may cool as soon as earnestness no longer attends to it. Søren Kierkegaard Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 262, 298, Repetition p. 149&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Then he discovered that life was beautiful, that it was a new gloriousness of faith that no human being can give it to another, that every human being has what is highest, noblest, and most sacred in humankind. It is original in him, and every human being has it if he wants to have it-it is precisely the gloriousness of faith that it can be had only on this condition. Therefore, it is the only unfailing good, because it can be had only by constantly being acquired and can be acquired by continually being generated. ... The original natural power of endurance can be different in different individuals, but as soon as the fulfillment fails to come for such a long time that his original power is consumed and exhausted, then and only then will it become manifest whether a person has new oil in readiness, only then will his patience in expectancy become manifest. ... With a smile or with tears, one confesses that expectancy is in the soul originally. Only the true expectancy, which requires patience, also teaches patience. But true expectancy is such that it pertains to a person essentially and does not leave it up to his own power to bring about the fulfillment. Therefore every truly expectant person is in a relationship with God.  ... everyone has an original supply of oil with which to sustain expectancy. .... If it is really so that there is something in life that has or can have such power over a person that it little by little makes him forget everything that is noble and sacred and makes him a slave in the service of the world, of the moment; if it is really so that time has or can gain such power over a person that while it adds days to his life it also every passing day measures the greater distance of his life from the divine, until he, trapped in everydayness and habit, becomes alienated from the eternal and the original. Resolution is a wakening up to the eternal. ... The 'individual’ is the category of spirit, of spiritual awakening. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' (1843-1844) p. 14, 213-214, 220-221, 348 Søren Kierkegaard, ''Point of View'' p. 133 Lowrie&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;when in dealing with the concept of faith the historical is made so one-sidedly significant that the primitive originality of faith in the individual is overlooked, faith becomes a finite pettiness instead of a free infinitude. ... Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward, whereas genuine repetition is recollected forward. ... The transition from [[Potentiality and actuality|possibility to actuality]] is, as Aristotle rightly teaches, a movement. This cannot be said in the language of abstraction at all or understood therein, because abstraction can give movement neither time nor space, which presuppose it or which it presupposes. There is a halt, a [[Leap of faith|leap]]. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 62-63 ''Repetition'' p. 131-132, Concluding Postscript p. 341-342&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Kierkegaard always points the individual forward just as he did with Abraham. He's always expectant of the good instead of dreading the evil. He trusted God. It's the same with the single individual who has to make a resolution to give some finite thing up and has found that the finite has become of infinite importance. &lt;blockquote&gt;Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life. In fact, if his faith had been only for the life to come, he certainly would have more readily discarded everything in order to rush out of a world to which he did not belong. ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard uses this extreme example of the [[paradox]] of faith to help people who are afraid to give something up or to take a risk without any certainty of reward. Abraham was willing to risk everything to follow God and Christ was willing to risk everything to teach humanity how to love. Neither of them knew what would come of it. Abraham learned how to love God but did he learn how to love his neighbor and himself?&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I am anxious about a past misfortune, then this is not because it is in the past but because it may be repeated, i.e., become future. If I am anxious because of a past offense, it is because I have not placed it in an essential relation to myself as past and have in some deceitful way prevented it from being past. If indeed it is actually past, then I cannot be anxious but only repentant. If I do not repent, I have allowed myself to make my relation to the offense dialectical, and by this the offense itself has become a possibility, and not something past. If I am anxious about the punishment, it is only because this has been placed in a dialectical relation to the offense (otherwise I suffer my punishment), and then I am anxious for the possible for the future. Thus we have returned to where we were in Chapter I. Anxiety is the psychological state that precedes sin. It approaches sin as closely as possible, as anxiously as possible, but without explaining sin, which breaks forth only in the [[Leap of faith|qualitative leap]]. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 91-92&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maurice Stanley Friedman]] compared Kierkegaard and Kafka in his 1963 book ''Problematic rebel, an image of modern man'' (p. 386) &lt;blockquote&gt;K. is at times lacking in courage and at other times brazenly impudent, and he is far from "observing every rule of propriety with a glad and confident enthusiasm," like Kierkegaard's "knight of faith." But he does not exalt the Castle "meanly" and, unlike the villagers he dares "to enter those palaces where not merely the memory of the elect abides but . . . the elect themselves." He knows the Angst of Kierkegaard's "knight of faith" who is "born outside the universal" and walks "a solitary path, narrow and steep . . . without meeting a single traveller." Passage after passage in The Castle, indeed, shows K. as essentially a Single One, who has the courage to meet the officials face to face and who is willing to dispense with all the universal patterns and official procedures if he can do so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jacques Maritain]] wrote in 1964, “Soren Kierkegaard was a contemporary of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. But it was only at the beginning of the twentieth century that his name began to become famous and his influence to be felt. Neither a [[philosopher]] in the strict sense of the word-although nourished in philosophy-and yet a philosopher in the sense of being a lay thinker; nor a theologian nor a prophet (obsessed by his feeling for the requirements of the [[Gospel]] and by his own unworthiness, he hardly dared to profess himself a Christian), and yet a kind of prophet and a knight of faith, and, at the end of his life, “a witness to the truth” in his passionate revolt against the established church, this poet of the religious, as he called himself, is a figure complex and ambiguous enough to occupy generations of interpreters and to justify their disagreements.”&lt;ref&gt;Moral Philosophy, Jacques Maritain, Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York, 1964, pp. 353-354; see pages 353-370 (Person and Liberty for more)&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that [[Theodor Haecker]] was a knight of faith.&lt;ref&gt;see Haeker’s book Journal in the Night https://archive.org/stream/journalinthenigh009030mbp#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raffaello Sanzio - Theological Virtues (Faith) - WGA18670.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Theological Virtues (Faith)|[[Theological Virtues]] by [[Raphael]]]] Kierkegaard used his book ''Fear and Trembling'' to make the claim that Abraham, Mary and a tax collector were also knights of faith. These were just common people so faith isn't just for the "chosen few", he says, "[[Moses]] struck the rock, but  he did not have faith. … Abraham was God’s chosen one, and it was the Lord who imposed the ordeal.”&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling'', Hong p. 19,&lt;/ref&gt; He says "artists go forward by going backward"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard Journals and papers 1A 86 September 29, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; by writing about Abraham's faith, Job's faith, Paul's faith and even Christ's faith and by creating imaginary constructions about "heroes" of faith they make Christianity difficult for the simple individual who wants to be a Christian. Yet at the same time churches often make Christianity "a matter of course". Faith just grows by itself, it needs no testing by the individual who wants to have faith, it ends up explained by external functions rather than the internal acknowledgement by the single individual who wants to be a Christian. Artistically faith becomes something impossible to reproduce in actual life. Only the person who is existing can reproduce [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit|faith, expectancy, patience, love]]  and the [[Self-control|resolution]] to hold fast to the expectation no matter what happens in his or her own life to the best of their ability. A person can become a Knight of Faith by acting without certainty. This is what Abraham did in ''Fear and Trembling'' and The Young Man failed to do in ''Repetition''. One says, I'll do it because everything within me says I should and the other says I'll do it if everything outside of me says I should. Kierkegaard described the difference well in ''Either/Or''. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one wishes to strip people of their illusions in order to lead them to something more true, here as always you [the esthete] are “at your service in every way.” On the whole you are tireless in tracking down illusions in order to smash them to pieces. You talk so sensibly, with such experience, that anyone who does not know you better must believe that you are a steady man. But you have by no means arrived at what is true. You stopped with destroying the illusion, and since you did it in every conceivable direction, you actually have worked your way into a new illusion-that one can stop with this. Yes, my friend, you are living in an illusion, and you are achieving nothing. Here I have spoken the word that has always had such a strange effect on you. Achieve-“So who is achieving something? That is precisely one of the most dangerous illusions. I do not busy myself in the world at all; I amuse myself the best I can, and I am particularly amused by those people who believe that they are achieving, and is it not indescribably funny that a person believes that? I refuse to burden my life with such grandiose pretensions.” Søren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong, p. 78-79&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biographical==
Kierkegaard was raised by parents who were at opposite poles of the spectrum of faith. His father read philosophy and studied with the leaders of the Church of Denmark while his mother couldn't even read. He had learned the terror of belief at an early age. He stood far to the right of the two extremes of the consciousness of sin: those who believe that they sin because Adam sins, so there is no use trying to stop sinning; and those who believe that every sin is like [[crucifixion|crucifying]] [[Christ]] and possibly commit suicide because they despise themselves so much. One is in danger of being too light-minded about sin, and the other is in danger of being halted or stopped at every moment in fear and trembling. His father taught him the terror of Christianity but his mother showed him the lighter side of the faith. He sought his own balance between the two and he thought his contribution to the discussion about beauty, truth and faith was worth reading. This is how he explained it to himself in ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'', and in his Journals (1849). He died not knowing if he had achieved anything at all but he still had faith.&lt;blockquote&gt;If you had loved people then the earnestness of life might have taught you not to be strident but to become silent, and when you were in distress at sea and did not see land, then at least not to involve others in it; it might have taught you to smile at least as long as you believed anyone sought in your face an explanation, a witness. We do not judge you for doubting, because doubt is a crafty passion, and it can certainly be difficult to tear oneself out of its snares. What we require of the doubter that he be silent. What doubt did not make him happy-why then confide to others what will make them just as unhappy. Doubt is a deep and crafty passion. But he whose soul is not gripped by it so inwardly that he becomes speechless is only shamming this passion, therefore what he says is not only false in itself but above all on his lips. The expectancy of faith, then, is victory. The doubt that comes from the outside does not disturb it, since it disgraces itself by speaking. Yet doubt is guileful, on secret paths it sneaks around a person, and when faith is expecting victory, [[doubt]] whispers that this expectancy is a deception. An expectancy that without a specified time and place is nothing but a deception; In that way one may always go on waiting; such an expectancy is a circle into which the [[soul]] is bewitched and from which it does not escape. In the expectancy of [[faith]], the soul is indeed prevented from falling out of itself, as it were, into multiplicity; it remains in itself, but it would be the worst evil that could befall a person if it escaped from this cycle. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Two Upbuilding Discourses'', May 16, 1843&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I began as an author of ''Either/Or'', I no doubt had a far more profound impression of the terror of Christianity than any clergyman in the country. I had a fear and trembling such as perhaps no one else had. Not that I therefore wanted to relinquish [[Christianity]]. No, I had another interpretation of it. For one thing I had in fact learned very early that there are men who seem to be selected for suffering, and, for another thing, I was conscious of having sinned much and therefore supposed that Christianity had to appear to me in the form of this [[terror]]. But how cruel and false of you, I thought, if you use it to terrify others, perhaps upset every so many happy, loving lives that may very well be truly Christian. It was as alien as it could possibly be to my nature to want to terrify others, and therefore I both sadly and perhaps also a bit proudly found my joy in comforting others and in being gentleness itself to them-hiding the terror in my own interior being. So my idea was to give my [[contemporaries]] (whether or not they themselves would want to understand) a hint in [[humor]]ous form (in order to achieve a lighter tone) that a much greater pressure was needed-but then no more; I aimed to keep my heavy burden to myself, as my cross. I have often taken exception to anyone who was a [[sin]]ner in the strictest sense and then promptly got busy terrifying [[Other (philosophy)|other]]s. Here is where ''Concluding Postscript'' comes in. …

[[Image:Laurence caruana in his Bastille studio.jpg|thumb|330px|Artist L. Caruana in his Bastille studio, Paris.]]

==Biography==
Laurence Caruana was born the third son of Maltese parents who met and married in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. After completing his studies in German and ancient Greek Philosophy (B.A. from the ''[[University of Toronto]]'' 1985), he learned classical painting techniques at the ''Akademie der Bildenden Künste'' in Vienna (''[[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]]'' 1990).&lt;ref name="Europa 2005 p. 14"&gt;''Dalis Erben malen Europa'', edited by Roger M. Erasmy (Kastner Verlag, 2005) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caruana then began an itinerant existence, living variously in Toronto, [[Malta]], [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]], [[Munich, Germany|Munich]], [[Monaco]], and [[Paris, France|Paris]]. In that period, he actively pursued visionary experience (dreams, [[entheogen]]s) as a source for his painting and writing.&lt;ref&gt;''La Mort Transfigurée: L'Art Visionnaire et la Mort'' (Galerie l'Arche de Morphée, 2006) p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting his French fiançée in Munich, L. Caruana settled in Paris. In the year 2000 he met [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] of the [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]] and subsequently apprenticed under him for a year, working in his studios in Monaco and Castillon, as well as at the St. Egid chapel in [[Klagenfurt]].&lt;ref name="Europa 2005 p. 14"/&gt;

In 2008 he held the first [http://academyofvisionaryart.com/seminar '''Visions in the Mischtechnik'''] painting seminar in the eco-village of [[Torri Superiore]] Italy, which eventually led to the creation of [http://academyofvisionaryart.com/ '''The Vienna Academy of Visionary Art'''], where Caruana has served as Director and Principal Lecturer since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;L. Caruana website: http://www.lcaruana.com/webtext/bio.html&lt;/ref&gt; While still maintaining a studio in the Bastille area of Paris, the artist currently lives in the Josefstadt district of Vienna - frequently traveling abroad to exhibit, teach or lecture on visionary art.&lt;ref&gt;The Vienna Academy of Visionary Art website: http://academyofvisionaryart.com/faculty/biographies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
After apprenticing with Ernst Fuchs, Caruana began using the ''[[Mischtechnik]]'', a painting technique which alternates between glazes of oil color (mixed in an oleo-resinous medium) and water-based whites (mixed in [[egg tempera]] or [[casein]]).

His art is highly mythological. Through fine lines, strong colors and precise rendering, Caruana's work manifests the imagery typical of [[visionary]] experience. More uniquely, his work combines symbols and styles from different cultural mythologies.

He has exhibited his works in London, Paris, Vienna, Munich, Monaco, and other cities, both individually (''Le Pouvoir des Mythes'' in ''Galerie d'Art Visionnaire de Paris'') and as part of various groups (''Chimeria'' in France, ''[[Society for Art of Imagination]]'' in England).&lt;ref&gt;L. Caruana - http://www.lcaruana.com/webtext/bio.html, Chimeria - http://www.chimeria.org, Society for Art of the Imagination - http://artofimagination.org&lt;/ref&gt; Giclée reproductions of his work have frequently appeared at [[transformational festival]]s such as The [[Boom Festival]] in Portugal and the O.Z.O.R.A. festival in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Boom Festival - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMsptBHmu20, O.Z.O.R.A. festival - http://ozorafestival.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's images have also been reproduced on album covers,&lt;ref&gt;The Artaxian Mantra's EP ''Luneo'': https://myspace.com/theartaxianmantra1, Soul Stalkaz' EP ''The Lordz of Deth'' https://www.jpc.de/jpcng/poprock/detail/-/art/Soul-Stalkaz-Lordz-Of-Deth/hnum/7353663&lt;/ref&gt; in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;''The Gnostic 4'' magazine, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as tattoos, trading cards,&lt;ref&gt;''The Galactik  Trading Card Oracle Complex'': http://www.elvism.net/&lt;/ref&gt; and in posters for transformational festivals.

==Writing==
L. Caruana's creative and critical writing are extensions of his interest in mythology and visionary art.

===Creative writing===
In a novel such as ''The Hidden Passion'' (Recluse 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-9782637-0-6}}), the author has retold the tale of Christ from the Gnostic perspective. Though condemned by the early church as a heresy, [[Gnosticism]] expands Christian myth by incorporating motifs from other cultures, such as ancient Greece ([[Platonism]]) and Egypt ([[Hermeticism]]). Throughout the novel, Christ utters the actual sayings (''logia'') of the [[Gnostic gospels]] found at [[Nag Hammadi]] Egypt. L. Caruana's interest in Gnosticism forms part of a much broader fascination with crossing myths from different cultural mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, Laurence, ''The Hidden Passion: A Novel of the Gnostic Christ, Based on the Nag Hammadi Texts'' (Recluse 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-9782637-0-6}}) Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical writing===
Due to his deep involvement with the Visionary art movement, L. Caruana has also become one of its spokesmen. Through his on-line [http://visionaryrevue.com ''Visionary Revue''], he has documented the history and evolution of this international movement. His ''First Manifesto of Visionary Art'' (Recluse 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-97826373-7}}, English, French and Portuguese editions) was published on-line and in print to an enthusiastic response.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:
*Silvia Thyssen, ''Boundaries in Question : Examining Visionary Art'', Erowid Extracts: Psychoactive Plants and Chemicals, May 2003, which also exists on-line at: [http://www.erowid.org/culture/art/art_article1.shtml Article].
*Erik Davis, ''The New Eye: Visionary Art and Tradition'', Introduction to ''True Visions'' (Betty Books, 2006 {{ISBN|88-902372-0-1}}), which first appeared in the COSM Journal, issue 4 and also appears on-line at [http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2006-09-11-1818-0.txt Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012104754/http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2006-09-11-1818-0.txt |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative essays ''Myrette'' and ''A Mirror Delirious'', which appear in [http://visionaryrevue.com issue 4], bring up to date all the author’s thoughts and insights into Visionary art since the publication of the Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionaryrevue.com/webtext4/editorial4.html Visionary Revue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caruana's lifelong pursuit of 'the ancient image-language' reached fruition in a book entitled ''Enter Through the Image: The Ancient Image-Language of Myth, Art and Dreams'' (Recluse 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9782637-2-0}}). Drawing upon examples from sacred and visionary art, the book demonstrates how we may 'think through images' and eventually ''enter through'' the image to the mystical experience of [[henosis]]. In its elaboration of the image-language, the book delineates how various myths may cross one another and how different cultural symbols may be combined.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana, Laurence, ''Enter Through the Image: The Ancient Image-Language of Myth, Art and Dreams'' (Recluse 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9782637-2-0}}) Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Since 2008, Caruana has held ''The Visions in the Mischtechnik'' painting seminar in the eco-village of Torri Superiore Italy, co-teaching with [[Amanda Sage]], A. Andrew Gonzalez and others. He has also taught painting at the [[Omega Institute for Holistic Studies]] and [[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]] in New York. In 2013 he co-founded ''The Vienna Academy of Visionary Art'' which ''"revives classical techniques of painting while pursuing art as the expression of beauty, spirit and vision."'' &lt;ref&gt;http://academyofvisionaryart.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lectures==
From his studio in ''The Vienna Academy of Visionary Art'', L. Caruana often travels abroad to deliver lectures on visionary art. He has spoken at such venues as the ''[[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]]'' in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;See the RISC (Relais d'information sur les sciences de la cognition) website: {{cite web |url=http://hallucinations.risc.cnrs.fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708185151/http://hallucinations.risc.cnrs.fr/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.metageum.org ''Metageum''] conference in Malta,&lt;ref&gt;Metageum conference: http://www.metageum.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alex Grey]]'s The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Chapel of Sacred Mirrors: http://www.cosm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metamathematics''' is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces [[metatheory|metatheories]], which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert program|attempt]] to secure the [[foundations of mathematics]] in the early part of the 20th century. Metamathematics provides "a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and [[logic]]" (Kleene 1952, p.&amp;nbsp;59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition "2+2=4" as belonging to [[mathematics]] while categorizing the proposition "'2+2=4' is valid" as belonging to metamathematics.

== History ==
Metamathematical [[metatheorem]]s about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary [[mathematical theorem]]s in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the [[foundational crisis of mathematics]]. [[Richard's paradox]] (Richard 1905) concerning certain 'definitions' of real numbers in the English language is an example of the sort of contradictions that can easily occur if one fails to distinguish between mathematics and metamathematics. Something similar can be said around the well-known [[Russell's paradox]] (Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?).

Metamathematics was intimately connected to [[mathematical logic]], so that the early histories of the two fields, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, largely overlap. More recently, mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics, such as [[set theory]], [[recursion theory]] and pure [[model theory]], which is not directly related to metamathematics{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

Serious metamathematical reflection began with the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], especially his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''.

[[David Hilbert]] was the first to invoke the term "metamathematics" with regularity (see [[Hilbert's program]]). In his hands, it meant something akin to contemporary [[proof theory]], in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems (Kleene 1952, p.&amp;nbsp;55).

Other prominent figures in the field include [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Thoralf Skolem]], [[Emil Post]], [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]], [[Willard Quine]], [[Paul Benacerraf]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Gregory Chaitin]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Kurt Gödel]].

Today, [[metalogic]] and metamathematics are largely synonymous{{citation needed&lt;!--rather, there is a big overlap between metalogic and mathematical logic!--&gt;|date=March 2013}} with each other, and both have been substantially subsumed by mathematical logic in academia.

== Milestones ==
=== The discovery of hyperbolic geometry ===
{{See also|Non-Euclidean geometry#History |Hyperbolic geometry#History}}

The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] had important [[philosophy|philosophical]] consequences for Metamathematics. Before its discovery there was just one geometry and mathematics; the idea that another geometry existed was considered improbable.

When [[Gauss]] discovered hyperbolic geometry, it is said that he did not publish anything about it out of fear of the "uproar of the [[Boeotia#Pejorative term|Boeotians]]", which would ruin his status as ''princeps mathematicorum'' (Latin, "the Prince of Mathematicians").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torretti|first1=Roberto|title=Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincare|date=1978|publisher=Reidel|location=Dordrecht Holland|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The "uproar of the Boeotians" came and went, and gave an impetus to metamathematics and great improvements in [[mathematical rigour]], [[analytical philosophy]] and [[logic]].

=== Begriffsschrift ===
{{main|Begriffsschrift}}
'''''Begriffsschrift''''' (German for, roughly, "concept-script") is a book on [[logic]] by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879, and the [[formal system]] set out in that book.

''Begriffsschrift'' is usually translated as ''concept writing'' or ''concept notation''; the full title of the book identifies it as "a [[formula]] [[language]], modeled on that of [[arithmetic]], of pure [[thought]]." Frege's motivation for developing his formal approach to logic resembled [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s motivation for his [[calculus ratiocinator]] (despite that, in his ''Foreword'' Frege clearly denies that he reached this aim, and also that his main aim would be constructing an ideal language like Leibniz's, what Frege declares to be quite hard and idealistic, however, not impossible task). Frege went on to employ his logical calculus in his research on the [[foundations of mathematics]], carried out over the next quarter century.

=== Principia Mathematica ===
{{main|Principia Mathematica}}
Principia Mathematica, or "PM" as it is often abbreviated, was an attempt to describe a set of [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven. As such, this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy,&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/#SOPM
|title=Principia Mathematica (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
|last=Irvine
|first=Andrew D.
|date=1 May 2003
|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University
|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may be achievable. However, in 1931, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] proved definitively that PM, and in fact any other attempt, could never achieve this lofty goal; that is, for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them.

One of the main inspirations and motivations for ''PM'' was the earlier work of [[Gottlob Frege]] on logic, which Russell discovered allowed for the construction of [[Russell's paradox|paradoxical sets]]. ''PM'' sought to avoid this problem by ruling out the unrestricted creation of arbitrary sets. This was achieved by replacing the notion of a general set with notion of a hierarchy of sets of different '[[system of types|types]]', a set of a certain type only allowed to contain sets of strictly lower types. Contemporary mathematics, however, avoids paradoxes such as Russell's in less unwieldy ways, such as the system of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].

===Gödel's incompleteness theorem ===
{{main|Gödel's incompleteness theorem}}
Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two [[theorem]]s of [[mathematical logic]] that establish inherent limitations of all but the most trivial [[axiomatic system]]s capable of doing [[arithmetic]].  The theorems, proven by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. The two results are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that [[Hilbert's program]] to find a complete and consistent set of [[axiom]]s for all [[mathematics]] is impossible, giving a negative answer to [[Hilbert's second problem]].

The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an "[[effective procedure]]" (e.g., a computer program, but it could be any sort of algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the relations of the [[natural numbers]] ([[arithmetic]]).  For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that such a system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.

===Tarski's definition of model-theoretic satisfaction===
{{main|T-schema}}
The T-schema or truth [[schema (logic)|schema]] (not to be confused with '[[Semantic theory of truth#Convention T|Convention T]]') is used to give an [[Recursive definition|inductive definition]] of truth which lies at the heart of any realisation of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]]. Some authors refer to it as the "Equivalence Schema", a synonym introduced by [[Michael Dummett]].&lt;ref name="Künne2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Künne|title=Conceptions of truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uakr0t90ylEC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-928019-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T-schema is often expressed in [[natural language]], but it can be formalized in [[Predicate logic|many-sorted predicate logic]] or [[modal logic]]; such a formalisation is called a '''''T-theory'''''.  T-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in [[philosophical logic]], where they are applied in several important controversies in [[analytic philosophy]].

As expressed in semi-natural language (where 'S' is the name of the sentence abbreviated to S):
'S' is true [[if and only if]] S

Example: 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white.

=== The impossibility of the Entscheidungsproblem ===
{{main|Entscheidungsproblem}}
The {{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}} ([[German language|German]] for '[[decision problem]]') is a challenge posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert and Ackermann&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}} asks for an [[algorithm]] that takes as input a statement of a [[first-order logic]] (possibly with a finite number of [[axiom]]s beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement is ''universally valid'', i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the axioms. By [[Gödel's completeness theorem|the completeness theorem of first-order logic]], a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the {{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}} can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic.

In 1936, [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] published independent papers&lt;ref&gt;Church's paper was presented to the American Mathematical Society on 19 April 1935 and published on 15 April 1936. Turing, who had made substantial progress in writing up his own results, was disappointed to learn of Church's proof upon its publication (see correspondence between [[Max Newman]] and Church in [http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0948&amp;kw= Alonzo Church papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607132453/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0948&amp;kw= |date=2010-06-07 }}). Turing quickly completed his paper and rushed it to publication; it was received by the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'' on 28 May 1936, read on 12 November 1936, and published in series 2, volume 42 (1936-7); it appeared in two sections: in Part 3 (pages 230-240), issued on Nov 30, 1936 and in Part 4 (pages 241-265), issued on Dec 23, 1936; Turing added corrections in volume 43(1937) pp. 544–546. See the footnote at the end of Soare:1996.&lt;/ref&gt; showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notation of "[[effectively calculable]]" is captured by the functions computable by a [[Turing machine]] (or equivalently, by those expressible in the [[lambda calculus]]). This assumption is now known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].

{{Japanese name|Miura}}
{{Nihongo|'''Miura Baien'''|三浦 梅園||extra=September 1, 1723 – April 9, 1789}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] philosopher of the [[Edo period|Tokugawa era]]. A scholar often qualified as prolific original thinker in economy, interested in epistemology,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Japan: Early modern Japan, page 633&lt;/ref&gt; he studied nature in a methodical way. He grounded his thought in [[Neo-Confucianism]].

==Life==
Born as '''Miura Susumu''' into the family of a village physician in the present [[Ōita Prefecture]] (at that time named ''Bungo'') on the island of [[Kyūshū]], he became himself a physician and declined invitations to take office in the service of a local feudal lord. A master of Chinese language and poetry, he later became an advocate of a new [[rationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Japanese Tradition, Vol. I'', compiled by Ryusaku Tunoda, Wm. Theodore de Bary, Donald Keene, Columbia University Press, New York, 1958, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; He is notable for criticizing [[Christianity]] and European [[imperialism]], arguing in Confucian terms that Christianity was used to subvert indigenous culture in order to facilitate colonization.&lt;ref name=InventionOfRel&gt;{{cite book|first=Jason Ā. |last=Josephson|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxzuzIszO60C|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and Algerian War==
Mohamed Sahnoun was born in 1931 in [[Chlef]] (known as [[Castellum Tingitanum]] during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Al Asnam]] during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] period and from 1962 to 1980 as well as [[Orléansville]] during the French colonization), in [[Algeria]]. He first studied at the Lycée of Algiers and then went on at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. He was there on the day of [[Algerian War#Beginning of hostilities|the first hostilities of the Algerian War]] (1 November 1954). As an activist of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], he responded to the call to strike launched by the  '’Union générale des étudiants musulmans algériens (Ugema)'’ on 19 May 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Henry Clement-Moore, L'Ugema (1955–1962) : témoignages, Casbah Éditions, Alger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; stopped studying in Paris and came back home in Algeria.

There, he started to work in the 'Social Centers' created by former French Resistance fighter [[Germaine Tillon]] with the agreement of [[Jacques Soustelle]] (then Governor General of Algeria) in order to alleviate misery, squalor and illiteracy in Algerian populations.&lt;ref name = Chapeu &gt;Sybille Chapeu, Des Chrétiens dans la Guerre d'Algérie: l'action de la mission de France, Éditions « Atelier Ed De L'», Paris, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1957, the organisation was raided and searched by police, who arrested and detained twelve Christians (among which priests) and twenty-three Muslims. Being one of the managers of the 'Social Centers', Mohamed Sahnoun was part of this group, which was charged with conspiracy and tried in a fairly loudly-trumpeted trial, nicknamed the “Progressive Christians” trial.&lt;ref name = Chapeu/&gt; Mohamed Sahnoun was subsequently detained in the infamous "{{ill|Villa Sésini|fr}}", the torture and detention centre of the [[1st Foreign Parachute Regiment]] during the [[Battle of Algiers (1956–57)|Battle of Algiers]]. He himself was subjected to torture.&lt;ref&gt;''Les ennemis complémentaires: guerre d'Algérie'', par Germaine Tillon, Éditions Tirésias, 2005, {{p.|216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released for lack of conclusive evidence, Mohamed Sahnoun then sought refuge in metropolitan France, in [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] then in Switzerland in [[Lausanne]]. He was unable to go back to Algeria before independence.

During his early years Mohamed Sahnoun also got acquainted with the pacifist NGO [[Service Civil International]] in Algeria in 1952–53; he participated in several of their international workcamps and even became the head of their Algerian branch for some time. This provided him with an enduring philosophical background (see infra) and also with an important network of trusted friends who would be of great assistance to him through the events of the 1950s. Mohamed Sahnoun then resumed his studies at [[New York University]] where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degrees, both in political science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diplomatic career ==

===At the service of Algeria===
Mohamed Sahnoun first became diplomatic advisor of the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]]. In 1962 he travelled with [[Ahmed Ben Bella|president Ben Bella]] on his first official visit to the USA, where he met with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|president John Kennedy]] who had been one of the supporters of the cause of Algerian independence.  As the Algerian delegation was then due to travel to [[Cuba]], Kennedy showed Ben Bella the first secret pictures taken by [[Lockheed U-2|U2 planes]] showing [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Russian missiles launch pads in Cuba]]. In the name of peace and human security, Ben Bella agreed to convey a message to [[Fidel Castro]] making clear how much the American regarded this situation as a ''casus belli''&lt;ref&gt;''Ainsi était le "Che"'' par Ahmed Ben Bella, Le Monde diplomatique, novembre 1997 [http://www.mai68.org/textes/lecheparbenbella/benbella.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;Interview de Mohamed Sahnoun par Katherine Marshall dans le Huffington Post le 10 mai 2011 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-marshall/mohamed-sahnoun-interview-healing-memories_b_993262.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mohamed Sahnoun then held the following positions:
*Deputy Secretary-General of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) (1964–1973)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/people/mohamed-sahnoun|title=Mohamed Sahnoun|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Deputy Secretary-General of the [[League of Arab States]] in charge of Arab-Africa dialogue (1973–1975).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*Algerian Ambassador to [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (1975–1979)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Algerian Ambassador to France (1979–1982). Under his leadership, an agreement was reached between France and Algeria regarding social security and retirement settlement for Algerian workers in France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
*Head of the Algerian diplomatic mission to the United States (1982–1984)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Algerian Ambassadeur d'Algérie to the United States (1984–1989). During his tenure, he organised a state visit by president [[Chadli Bendjedid]] to Ronald Reagan, the first official visit ever of an Algerian head of state to the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*In 1989, Sahnoun is called to take over urgently as Algeria's Ambassador to [[Morocco]], in order to succeed ambassadeur [[Abdelhamid Mehri]], who is himself urgently requested to take the presidency of [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] after the [[1988 October riots]] in Algeria; he becomes simultaneously Algerian Ambassador to Morocco and secretary of the [[Arab Maghreb Union]] (1989–1990).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*His name was mentioned as a possible recourse candidate for the [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|Algerian presidential election of April 1999]] but it is finally [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], a former foreign minister who had retired from public office since 1981, who stood as a " free candidate " for and from [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]].&lt;ref name = naylor&gt;Phillip C. Naylor, Historical Dictionary of Algeria, Scarecrow Press, Oxford, 2006 ; {{p.|400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At the service of the United Nations ===
*Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).&lt;ref name=ONU&gt;Source : United Nations press release, 27 January 1997, last consulted 7 March 2015 [https://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970127.sga626.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Somalia (April to November 1992).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt; In this position, the efficiency of his diplomatic style is unanimously recognised and promising results are achieved;&lt;ref name = naylor/&gt; however his peacebuilding action was interrupted by the lack of efficient backing from the UN&lt;ref&gt;In his book entitled "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", Mohamed Sahnoun clearly showed that when the United Nations tried to provide [[humanitarian assistance]], they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies, their main Somalia envoys operating from the safety of their desks in Nairobi. The refusal of [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], then [[UN Secretary General]] to accept this criticism led to the early end of Mohamed Sahnoun's mission in Somalia&lt;/ref&gt; and by the US military impatience to intervene. Mohamed Sahnoun resigned in protest. The intervention led by the US-backed [[Unified Task Force]] (code-named Operation Restore Hope) actually ended in utter disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Mohamed Sahnoun et [[Cornelio Sommaruga]] by Richard Werly and François d'Alançon, in ''Oser la Paix'', Éditions Autrement, Paris, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-7467-3053-3}}, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the OAU in the Congo (1993).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*Special Adviser to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the Culture of Peace Programme (1995–1997).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*United Nations/[[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa (1997).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;

==Studies and reports==
*Mohamed Sahnoun was a member of the [[Brundtland Commission]] on environment and development and co-author of the [[Our Common Future|Brundtland report]], which coined the expression [[sustainable development]] and its definition.

In February 2001, the ICISS suggested the phrase "responsibility to protect" as a way to avoid the "right to intervene" or "obligation to intervene" doctrines and yet keep a degree of duty to act to resolve humanitarian crises.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, Steven; Kassimeris, George, ed.

==Books==
*In 1994, Mohamed Sahnoun published "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities",&lt;ref&gt;USIP Press Books, octobre 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-878379-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in [[Somalia]]; he shows in particular that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] regime in January 1991, the United Nations missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the United Nations tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the United Nations would continue to respond to such crisis in a climate of inept improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Book Review by Gail M. Gerhart in ''Foreign Affairs'', March/April 1995 [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/50763/gail-m-gerhart/somalia-the-missed-opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007, Mohamed Sahnoun also published (in French) a largely autobiographic novel set in [[Algeria]] in 1954, ''Mémoire blessée'' ('’Hurt Memory'’); its main character, Salem, '’a man of faith and dialogue'’, is jailed and tortured because of his convictions. He is however rescued by French people, some civilian, some military and some ecclesiactic – who all take great risks to shield him.  The book is clearly an evocation of the events which marked the author's younger years (see above the early years and Algeria wars section), but it also calls for human solidarity and the protection of the weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Mémoire blessée : Algérie, 1957}}; Presses de la Renaissance, Paris, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2750902988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Mohamed Sahnoun met [[pacifism]] in 1952 in Alger through the [[Service Civil International]] NGO.  He had read the book by [[Pierre Ceresole]], the Swiss founder of this organisation, and even more importantly the book by [[Romain Rolland]] on [[Gandhi]], "which was practically my bedside book at the time.&lt;ref name=SCI&gt;Interview dans Breaking down barriers 1945–1975, 30 years of voluntary service for peace with [[Service Civil International]], Olivier Bertrand, Paris, 2008 (in French) [http://www.archives.sciint.org/sahnoun-mohamed_fr]&lt;/ref&gt;"
These ideas stayed with him through his long professional career, where he was from the onset a man of dialogue, trying for instance to establish appropriate communication between communities about [[Congo-Kinshasa|Congo]] through the UNESCO-backed World Assembly of Youth (WAY), or as a leading figure of the [[OAU]], particularly when African countries were confronted with the problems stemming from the borders inherited from [[colonialism]], or in his different missions for the UN.
His participation for several years in the very international and religiously mixed [[Service Civil International]] NGO also played a role in his understanding the sources of conflict and brought him to invest in how to heal the memory injuries resulting from past conflicts.&lt;ref name=SCI/&gt; 
He reinforces further this reflection in his later career years as he more and more commits in favour of human security, for instance though ''The Responsibility to Protect'' project (2001) or through his organizing from 2008 to 2012 of the Caux Forum for Human Security, with the following five themes: Healing Memory, Just Governance, Living Sustainably, Inclusive Economics and Intercultural Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cauxforum.net/about/holistic#sthash.iBxTC4QC.dpuf|title=Holistic Approach {{!}} Caux Forum for Human Security|website=www.cauxforum.net|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very committed to interreligious diversity and dialogue, Mohamed Sahnoun rose strongly against the idea of [[Clash of Civilizations]], saying for example: "I said to [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] during a discussion in Washington, there is no such clash. Take the Somalian example: from a religious point of view, Somalis are more or less all on the same wavelength. But because of total insecurity, they split into clans and sub-clans. That's why I want to develop intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. "&lt;ref name = Le_Temps/&gt;

'''Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari''' ({{lang-fa|محمد مجتهد شبستری}};  born 1936 in [[Shabestar]], [[Iran]]) is an [[Iran]]ian philosopher, theologian, hermeneutist and former professor at [[University of Tehran]]. He is noted for his idea that "''ad-din,'' (religion) is perfect, but not all-encompassing, i.e. it does not possess the answer to every question in life".&lt;ref name="schirazi"&gt;''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / 
by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B. Tauris, 1997 p.279&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly a political activist and MP, he retired himself from politics in 1984.

He was also Imam of [[Islamic Centre Hamburg]] between 1970 and 1978.
==Education and career==
As a student in [[Qom]], Shabestari studied with [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] and [[Ayatollah]] [[Allameh Tabatabaei]]. He was influenced by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s idea that "Islamic ethics was not limited" to "personal relationships", but should be "reflected in the state and its form of government."&lt;ref name="qantara"&gt;[http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-575/_nr-3/_p-1/i.html?PHPSESSID=5869 Mohammad Shabestari Faith, Freedom, and Reason ]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He stayed in the seminary for seventeen years, achieving both degrees of [[Ijtihad]] (religious adjudication) and Doctor of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Sadri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm |title=Mahmoud Sadri: Attack from Within. Dissident political theology in contemporary Iran |accessdate=2003-02-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226124152/http://kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of the political [[Shia]] in 1960s and 1970s Iran, Shabestari also felt closely associated with the thinking of religious intellectuals such as [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]] and [[Ali Shariati]], as well as the politically motivated cleric [[Morteza Motahhari]].

From 1970-1978, Shabestari served as director of the Shiite Islamic Center in the Imam Ali Mosque in [[Hamburg]], Germany. He followed in this position [[Ayatollah]] [[Mohammad Beheshti]] (who was to become one of the main architects of the Islamic revolution of Iran) and was later succeeded in this position by future president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, [[hojatoleslam]] [[Mohammad Khatami]].&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt;

During the period he spent in Hamburg, Shabestari strongly supported the Christian-Islamic dialogue and extended the mosque’s scope of influence by opening it up to all Muslims. He also learned German and was able to pursue his interest, already evident in Qom, in Western philosophy and Christian, especially Protestant, theology.&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt;  He studied the writings of theologians such as [[Paul Tillich]], [[Karl Barth]], and [[Karl Rahner]], as well as the thinking of philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]].

Upon his return to Iran, he served as a member of the first parliament ([[Majles of Iran]]) after the revolution, but distanced himself from politics afterwards.

Shabestari was a full professor of Islamic philosophy at the [[University of Tehran]] from 1985-2006, where he also taught comparative religion and theology. He regularly organized international conferences on the theme of Christian-Muslim dialogue.

He is one of the editors of the Great Encyclopedia of Islam, published in Tehran, and chairs the department of Theology and Sects of the [[Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name="The Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.cgie.org.ir/en/Section_Theology.html The Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia. Department of Theology &amp; Sects]&lt;/ref&gt; So far 16 volumes have been published of the encyclopedia, covering the first five letters of the alphabet.

== His philosophy and contributions ==
Although Shabestari has made a modest contribution to the introduction and application of modern [[hermeneutics]] to traditional Shiite theology and jurisprudence, and thus to the proposition of variability of religious knowledge, his most significant contribution seems to be his authoritative commentary on the essentially limited nature of religious knowledge and rules, and thus the necessity of complementing it with extra-religious sources.&lt;ref name="kadivar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm |title=Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari: Champion of the New "Kalam" |accessdate=2003-02-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226124152/http://kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabestari argues that distinguishing the eternal (values), from the changeable (instances and applications) in religion needs a kind of knowledge that is not, itself, contained in the rules developed in Islamic jurisprudence (''[[Fiqh]]''). He laments the lack of such a body of knowledge in Islamic society: In the same vein, he underscores the limited nature of religious knowledge in general, and religious jurisprudence, in particular.(10) In Shabestari's view, what is essential and eternal is the general values of Islam not particular forms of their realization in any particular historic time, (including the time of the prophet):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The meaning of perfection of religion (''Ekmal e Din'') is not that it contains everything under the sun, so that if we were unable to find a specific item in it, we could go off calling it imperfect. It is not perfection for religion to function as a substitute for science, technology, and human deliberation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion does not wish to replace science and technology, and lay claim to the place of reason ... God has only offered answers for some of the needs of human beings. As for other needs, He has left it to reason and human effort to supply the answer.&lt;ref name="schirazi"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shabestari even suggests that there has been a divine providence for a separation of religious values and secular realities: In his latest book, ''Naghdi Bar Ghera'at e Rasmi az Din'' (''A Critique of the Official Reading of Religion'', December, 2000) Shabestari pursues his critique of religious absolutism as hermeneutically naive and realistically unworkable. Also, he launches a major defense of modern concepts of [[individualism]], [[democracy]], and human rights, although they have not been articulated as such in Islamic sources.&lt;ref name="kadivar"/&gt;

In Shabestari’s view, human rights and democracy are products of human reason that have developed during the course of time and continue to evolve. As such, they are not already prescribed in the [[Koran]] and [[Sunnah|Sunna]].

Indeed, the Qur'an remains mute with regard to our modern understanding of human rights, and yet these do not in any way contradict the divine truth contained in the Qur'an. Drawing on modern hermeneutics, Shabestari dismisses any claim that man could ever come into direct possession of God’s absolute truth.&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt;

Since the early 1990s, he has been increasingly active in publishing articles in liberal daily papers and magazines in which he argues for a new, more critical approach to religion.&lt;ref&gt;Farzin Vahdat: "Post-revolutionary Islamic modernity in Iran: the intersubjective hermeneutics of Mohamad Mojtahed Shabestari" in Suha Taji-Farouki (ed): Modern Muslim Intellectuals and the Qur'an, Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17250">[[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation]] is the maintenance of [[biological diversity]]. Conservation can focus on preserving diversity at [[genetics|genetic]], [[species]], [[community]] or whole [[ecosystem]] levels. This article will examine conservation at the species level, because [[mutualisms]] involve interactions between species. The ultimate goal of conservation at this level is to prevent the [[extinction]] of species. However, species conservation has the broader aim of maintaining the abundance and distribution of all species, not only those threatened with extinction (van Dyke 2008). Determining the value of conserving particular species can be done through the use of evolutionary significant units, which essentially attempt to prioritise the conservation of the species which are rarest, fastest declining, and most distinct genotypically and phenotypically (Moritz 1994, Fraser and Bernatchez 2001).

Mutualisms can be defined as "interspecific interactions in which each of two partner species receives a net benefit" (Bronstein et al. 2004). Here net benefit is defined as, a short-term increase in inclusive fitness (IF). Incorporating the concept of genetic relatedness (through IF) is essential because many mutualisms involve the eusocial insects, where the majority of individuals are not reproductively active. The short-term component is chosen because it is operationally useful, even though the role of long-term adaptation is not considered (de Mazancourt et al. 2005). This definition of mutualism should be suffice for this article, although it neglects discussion of the many subtitles of IF theory applied to mutualisms, and the difficulties of examining short-term compared to long-term benefits, which are discussed in Foster and Wenselneers (2006) and de Mazancourt et al. (2005) respectively. Mutualisms can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, obligate mutualism, where two mutualistic partners are completely interdependent for survival and reproduction. Secondly, facultative mutualism, where two mutualistic partners both benefit from the mutualism, but can theoretically survive in each other's absence.

Mutualisms are remarkably common, in fact all organisms are believed to be involved in a mutualism at some point during their lives (Bronstein et al. 2004). This is particularly likely to be true for the definition of mutualism adopted here, where herbivory can paradoxically be mutualistic, for example in a situation where a plant overcompensates by producing more biomass when grazed on. Therefore, any species identified as particularly important to conserve will probably have mutualistic partners. It is beyond the purview of this article to discuss all these mutualisms, so the focus will be on specifically animal-plant mutualisms.

==Mutualism coextinction==
A mutualism coextinction event is where a species goes extinct upon the loss of its mutualist (Koh et al. 2004). Models have attempted to predict when the breakdown of a mutualism leads to coextinction, because in this situation protecting the mutualism will be particularly important for conservation. These models are multi-dimensional, so examine complex networks of interactions, rather than just pairs of interacting species. This means that these models incorporate modelling the breakdown of obligate mutualisms (which lead directly to coextinction), but also the breakdown of facultative mutualisms (which can lead indirectly to coextinction). Koh et al. (2004) use a "nomographic model of affiliate extinctions", which estimates the probability that the extinction of a species leads to the extinction of its mutualist, for a given estimate of the specificity of the mutualism. By applying the model to actual species, Koh et al. (2004) estimate that 200 coextinctions have occurred since records of species extinction began in the past few centuries, and 6300 coextinctions are at risk of occurring in the near future. However, these estimates are not exclusively for mutualism coextinctions (e.g. parasitic coextinctions are incorporated), but mutualism coextinctions make up a significant proportion of the number quoted. Additionally the model predicts that these coextinctions can start extinction cascades, where many other species in the surrounding ecosystem go extinct. Other recent models largely agree with this one, predicting that mutualism coextinction is a very significant cause of species loss, and that it can lead to extinction cascades (Dunn et al. 2009).

Surprisingly, given the model predictions, there are very few recorded examples of global mutualism coextinctions actually occurring (Bronstein et al. 2004, Dunn et al. 2009), and many examples often quoted are unconvincing on examination. For example, a well documented case of animal-plant coextinction and an extinction cascade involves a butterfly (''[[Maculinea arion]]'') to ant (''[[Myrmica sableti]]'') interaction. ''M. arion'' larvae provide honeydew for the ''M. sableti'' workers, which raise the caterpillars in their nest. When the [[Myxoma]] virus was introduced to control rabbit populations in the UK, the subsequent increase in grassland caused a decrease in soil temperatures at ground level. This caused reductions in the ''M. sableti'' populations, which led to the extinction of the M. arion populations (Dunn 2005). However, this is actually a relatively weak example, because it was a local (rather than a global) extinction, and the nature of the interaction is often not viewed as mutualistic, because it has been long known that the ''M. sableti'' caterpillars eat ''M. sableti'' larvae (Elmes and Thomas 1992).

So, why are there very few documented examples of mutualism coextinctions? There are various possible reasons. Perhaps global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely uncommon, and the model predictions are inaccurate. The models may overestimate the specificity of the mutualisms, because species may only associate with alternative species when their 'normal' mutualist is rare or absent. For example, [[oligolectic]] bees visit a small number of flowers for pollen. However, these bees do not generally have strongly specialised anatomy, morphology or physiology. Therefore, in the absence of these usual flowers, many oligolectic bee species are able switch to collecting pollen from flower species they would never normally associate with (Wcislo and Cane 1996). Even some [[fig wasps]], often considered to be in completely obligate relationships, have maintained low population densities when introduced to new areas without their natural mutualist [[fig tree]] species (McKey 1989). The models may also underestimate the robustness of the mutualisms. For example, fig trees and fig wasps are coadapted so that the wasps can find the trees from a long distances away (Bronstein et al. 1994).

Alternatively, there may simply be many global mutualism coextinctions that have occurred which we are not yet aware of. This explanation is not unlikely, because mutualisms have generally been understudied as interactions (Bronstein 1994, Richardson et al. 2000). There is additionally the difficulty of defining when a species becomes globally extinct, compared to just extremely rare or maintained exclusively through captive breeding programs. Of course, these stated explanations are not mutually exclusive. However, more research is required to rectify the model predictions of many mutualism coextinctions, with the lack of empirical evidence for such events. Only then can we discover if conserving mutualisms is likely to prevent many global species extinction.

==Mutualism "codeclines"==
Even if global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely rare, conserving mutualisms may still be important for conservation. As mentioned previously, conservation is not just about preventing extinctions, but also about preventing species decline. Unlike with coextinctions, there are numerous recorded examples of where the decline or extinction of a species has led to the decline of its mutualist ("codeclines"). A documented example of a pollination mutualism breakdown leading to population declines is the [[Indian rubber tree]] (''Ficus elastica'') to its pollinator wasp (''[[Pleistodontes clavigar]]'') interaction. [[Habitat fragmentation]] has led to the ''F. elastica'' declining to very low population levels. However, F. Elastic can propagate clonally, so has remained extant. Meanwhile, ''P. clavigar'' is virtually extinct globally, because the mutualist relationship is probably obligate for P. clavigar (Mawsdley et al. 1998). An example of a seed dispersal mutualism breakdown causing population declines comes from two endemic species on Menorca Island. A frugivorous lizard (''[[Podarcis lilfordi]]'') is a seed disperser of a shrub (''[[Daphne rodriguezii]]''). When ''P. lilfordi'' became extinct on Menorca, due to the introduction of carnivorous mammals, ''D. rodriguezii'' numbers declined significantly to endangered levels. This ''D. rodriguezii'' decline could be attributed to the local extinction of ''P. lilfordi'', due the lack of seedling recruitment on Menorca compared to other nearby islands, where ''P. lilfordi'' remained extant and ''D. rodriguezii'' populations larger (Traveset and Riera 2005).

However, in some cases it has been shown that declines of one partner in a mutualism do not lead to significant declines in the other. For example, a Hawaiian vine (''Freycinetia arborea'') was pollinated in the nineteenth century by four species of birds. These bird species are all now either locally endangered or extinct. Despite this, ''F. arborea'' continues to survive in reasonable abundance, but is now mainly pollinated by the recently introduced [[white-eye]] (''Zosterops japonica'') (Cox and Elmqvist 2000). In this case, conservation of the mutualism was not required to maintain the ''F. arborea'' population. There are probably no published estimates of how frequently declines of one species do not result in declines of that species' mutualist, due to a 'replacement' mutualist. However, judging by the few examples in the literature where this replacement has been reported to have happened, it seems to be a relatively rare occurrence.

==Alien species in mutualisms==
The Hawaiian vine example also illustrates that alien species can be involved in animal-plant mutualisms. In fact, alien species are often dependent on mutualisms to establish themselves in new habitats (particularly on islands), and especially those alien species requiring animal mediated pollination (Richardson et al. 2000). These alien species will, by definition, be beneficial to the short-term inclusive fitness of the species they form a mutualism with. However, the alien species will negatively impact other species in the ecosystem. For example, through competition for resources (including competition for mutualist partners) (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009). In fact, these negative impacts could theoretically cascade through the ecosystem, and lead to the alien species having an indirect long-term negative impact on its mutualist. This means that mutualisms involving alien species is important in conservation. However, the action taken by a conservation organization could be either to conserve or disrupt the mutualism.

In some situations, a conservation organization will want to conserve the mutualistic relationship. For example, many of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] have lost the vast majority of their native seed dispersers, and introduced bird species now act as very major seed dispersers of native species. In fact, these exotic species appear to actually facilitate the re-growth of native forests in some areas (Foster and Robinson 2007). In these situations, conserving the native mutualism may become less important than conserving the new one. Alien species involved in mutualisms may actually be desirable for conservationists to protect in a more general way. Alien species are particularly likely to generate highly generalised and asymmetric mutualisms, which help stabilise communities, making them less vulnerable to decline and extinctions (Aizen et al. 2008).

In other situations, conservation will be facilitated by disrupting mutualisms involving alien species. For example alien bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have displaced many native pollinators, and pollinated some unwanted weed species, across the globe (Hingston et al. 2002). These mutualisms could lead to a decline in both animal and plant species of particular value to conservation. The empirical evidence would suggest that in the majority of cases a conservation organisation should try and disrupt the mutualisms involving the alien species (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009).

Accessed 26 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gould's separate magisteria==
In a 1997 essay "Nonoverlapping Magisteria"&lt;ref name = NOMA&gt;Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html "Nonoverlapping Magisteria."] ''Natural History'' 106 (March): 16–22 and 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Natural History'' magazine, and later in his book ''[[Rocks of Ages (book)|Rocks of Ages]]'' (1999), Gould put forward what he described as "a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to . . . the supposed conflict between [[science]] and religion.",&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt; from his puzzlement over the need and reception of the 1996 address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences "Truth Cannot Contradict Truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02tc.htm
|author = Pope John Paul II 
|title = Truth Cannot Contradict Truth
|date = October 22, 1996
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He draws the term ''[[magisterium]]'' from [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[encyclical]], ''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950), and defines it as "a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution",&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt; and describes the NOMA principle as  "Science tries to document the factual character of the natural world, and to develop theories that coordinate and explain these facts. Religion, on the other hand, operates in the equally important, but utterly different, realm of human purposes, meanings, and values—subjects that the factual domain of science might illuminate, but can never resolve."&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt; "These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry (consider, for example, the magisterium of art and the meaning of beauty)."&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt;

Gould emphasized the legitimacy of each field of endeavor only within its appropriate area of inquiry: "NOMA also cuts both ways. If religion can no longer dictate the nature of factual conclusions residing properly within the magisterium of science, then scientists cannot claim higher insight into moral truth from any superior knowledge of the world's empirical constitution."&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt; In the chapter "NOMA Defined and Defended" Gould gave examples of the types of questions appropriate to each area of inquiry, on the topic of "our relationship with other living creatures": "Do humans look so much like apes because we share a recent common ancestor or because creation followed a linear order, with apes representing the step just below us?" represents an inquiry concerning fact, while "Under what conditions (if ever) do we have a right to drive other species to extinction by elimination of their habitats? Do we violate any moral codes when we use genetic technology to place a gene from one creature into the genome of another species?" represent questions in the domain of values.&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt;  He went on to present "an outline of historical reasons for the existence of conflict, where none should exist;"&lt;ref name = RoA/&gt;

In a speech before the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]], Gould stressed the diplomatic reasons for adopting NOMA as well, stating that "the reason why we support that position is that it happens to be right, logically. But we should also be aware that it is very practical as well if we want to prevail."  Gould argued that if indeed the polling data was correct—and that 80 to 90% of Americans believe in a supreme being, and such a belief is misunderstood to be at odds with [[evolution]]—then "we have to keep stressing that religion is a different matter, and [[science]] is not in any sense opposed to it," otherwise "we're not going to get very far."&lt;ref&gt;SJ Gould (2000). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRB19MYxaUs&amp;t=14m46s "Evolution and the 21st Century."] ''Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences''. March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, consider this diplomatic aspect to be paramount, writing in 1997: "NOMA represents a principled position on moral and intellectual grounds, not a mere diplomatic stance."

In 1997 he had elaborated on this position by describing his role as a scientist with respect to NOMA:

{{quote |Religion is too important to too many people for any dismissal or denigration of the comfort still sought by many folks from theology. I may, for example, privately suspect that papal insistence on divine infusion of the soul represents a sop to our fears, a device for maintaining a belief in human superiority within an evolutionary world offering no privileged position to any creature. But I also know that souls represent a subject outside the magisterium of science. My world cannot prove or disprove such a notion, and the concept of souls cannot threaten or impact my domain. Moreover, while I cannot personally accept the Catholic view of souls, I surely honor the metaphorical value of such a concept both for grounding moral discussion and for expressing what we most value about human potentiality: our decency, care, and all the ethical and intellectual struggles that the evolution of consciousness imposed upon us.}}Ciarán Benson sees a tendency to re-negotiate the  borders  between  the  "human sciences and  the  natural sciences", as in [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s 1883 claim for the distinction between  ''Geisteswissenschaften'' (humanities) and ''Naturwissenschaften'' (science).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Ciarán|date=2013-01-01|title=A Secular Spirituality?

==National Academy of Sciences==
Also in 1999, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] adopted a similar stance. Its publication ''Science and Creationism'' stated that "Scientists, like many others, are touched with awe at the order and complexity of nature. Indeed, many scientists are deeply religious. But [[science]] and religion occupy two separate realms of human experience. Demanding that they be combined detracts from the glory of each."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS Press]] | year = 1999 | url = http://newton.nap.edu/openbook/0309064066/html/R9.html | title = Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences | author = Steering Committee on Science and Creationism  |accessdate = 2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Humani generis''==
Gould wrote that he was inspired to consider non-overlapping magisteria after being driven to examine the 1950 encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'', in which [[Pius XII|Pope Pius XII]] permits Catholics to entertain the [[human evolution|hypothesis of evolution for the human body]] so long as they accept the divine infusion of the soul.&lt;ref name = NOMA/&gt; Gould cited the following paragraph:

{{quote|The Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter—for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Pius XII (1950) [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_pi12hg.htm] ''Encyclical Letter Concerning Some False Opinions Which Threaten to Undermine the Foundations of Catholic Doctrine'', August 12, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
[[Richard Dawkins]] has criticized Gould's position on the grounds that religion is not divorced from scientific matters or the material world. He writes, "it is completely unrealistic to claim, as Gould and many others do, that religion keeps itself away from science's turf, restricting itself to morals and values. A universe with a supernatural presence would be a fundamentally and qualitatively different kind of universe from one without. The difference is, inescapably, a scientific difference. Religions make existence claims, and this means scientific claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' | year = 1998 | url = http://secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=dawkins_18_2 | title = When Religion Steps on Science's Turf | author = Dawkins, Richard | accessdate = 2008-09-13 | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083637/http://secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=dawkins_18_2 | archivedate = 2012-03-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gould's observation that "These two magisteria do not overlap..." does not consider the claims of many religions upon material reality, such as [[miracle]]s or [[Efficacy of prayer|prayer]].

Dawkins also argues that a religion free of divine intervention would be far different from any existent ones, and certainly different from the [[Abrahamic religions]]. Moreover, he claims that religions would be only too happy to accept scientific claims that supported their views. For example, if DNA evidence proved that Jesus had no earthly father, Dawkins claims that the argument of non-overlapping magisteria would be quickly dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]'' | year = 2006 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-dawkins/why-there-almost-certainl_b_32164.html | title = Why There Almost Certainly Is No God | author = Dawkins, Richard | accessdate = 2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf has been sympathetic with the approach, but claims it as well for the theological side - Graf assumes that e.g. [[creationism]] may be interpreted as a reaction of religious communities on the [[Weltanschauung|''Verweltanschaulichung'']] of (natural) science in [[social Darwinism]]. That said, attempts to compete with religion by natural science may generate a backlash, that is detrimental to both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/kosmos-cover-story-93-1.html|title=Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation - Science and Faith: Cover Story: Science and Faith Research and Faith Are not a Contradiction in Terms|last=Graf|first=Friedrich Wilhelm|date=2009|website=www.humboldt-foundation.de|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf: Kreationismus. Sechs Kapitel aus der Religionsgeschichte der Moderne (Creationism, six chapters from modern history of religion), in: -: /Ulrich Barth, Christian Danz, Wilhelm Gräb (ed.): Aufgeklärte Religion und ihre Probleme. Schleiermacher – Troeltsch – Tillich, Berlin/Boston 2013 (= Theologische Bibliothek Töpelmann, Band 165), 113-134. The paper is being based on a 2011 honor lecture at the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Bavarian Academy of Science]] in Munich.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciarán Benson, himself a secular humanist  defends the spiritual as a category against both. He assumes that while Gould claims for NOMA (non-overlapping magisteria of science, morality and religion), and Richard  Dawkins  for, verbally,  "a brand  of  SM ([[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]  of  the  others  by  the  scientific magisterium)", Benson preferred OM (overlapping magisteria), especially in the case of art and religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] criticized what he saw as the limits of NOMA, arguing that [[science]], religion, and other spheres have "partially overlapped" while agreeing with Gould that morals, spirituality and ethics cannot be determined from naturalistic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Francis. ''The Language of God''. Simon and Schuster, 2007. pg 95, 165&lt;/ref&gt; This exceeds the greatest interconnection allowed by Gould in his original 1997 essay "Nonoverlapping Magisteria" in which he writes:
{{quote|Each ... "subject has a legitimate magisterium, or domain of teaching authority ... This resolution might remain all neat and clean if the nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA) of science and religion were separated by an extensive no man's land. But, in fact, the two magisteria bump right up against each other, interdigitating in wondrously complex ways along their joint border. Many of our deepest questions call upon aspects of both for different parts of a full answer—and the sorting of legitimate domains can become quite complex and difficult.&lt;ref name="Leonardo p. 274" /&gt;}}

[[Matt Ridley]] notes that religion does more than talk about ultimate meanings and morals, and science is not proscribed from talking about the above either. After all, morals involve [[human behavior]], an observable phenomenon, and science is the study of observable phenomena. Ridley notes that there is substantial scientific evidence on evolutionary origins of ethics and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Matt Ridley | first = Matt | last = Ridley | title = The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation | publisher = Penguin | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
According to her daughter Olavo had a troubled early life with maltreatment of his children. All content was wrapped in a letter that was later shared on Facebook social network. According to the letter, Olavo had even pointed a gun to the head of one of his children. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nakamura |first1=Erika K |title=Em carta aberta devastadora, filha de Olavo de Carvalho acusa o pai de "colocar arma na cabeça dos seus filhos" |url=https://www.diariodocentrodomundo.com.br/essencial/em-carta-aberta-devastadora-filha-de-olavo-de-carvalho-acusa-o-pai-de-colocar-arma-na-cabeca-dos-seus-filhos/ |website=Diário do Centro do Mundo |language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olavo also accused [[Pepsi]] of using cells from [[Abortion|aborted fetuses]] to [[Sweetened beverage|sweeten]] soft drinks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Serboncini |first1=Fernando |title=Coisas em que o Olavo de Carvalho acredita |url=https://medium.com/@fserb/coisas-que-o-olavo-de-carvalho-acredita-654e1617b6eb |website=Fernando Serboncini |date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

====Science====

Olavo strongly criticizes several figures who occupy a prominent place in the history of the sciences, such as [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Giordano Bruno]], who according to him "did not make any discoveries... He did not even study modern sciences, physics, astronomy, biology or mathematics, he was not condemned for defending scientific theories, but for practicing witchcraft, which at the time was a crime". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/traducoes/epicurus.htm ''The Garden of Afflictions''], Chap. VI, §16–17 [Chapter in English].&lt;/ref&gt;, The criticism extends to Galileo, of whom he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A background of charlatanism appears to have already been introduced into physics by Galileo, when he proclaimed that he had overturned the notions of ancient science, according to which an object not propelled by an external force stands still - an illusion of the senses, he said. In fact, he pontificated, an object in such conditions remains stationary or in uniform and rectilinear motion. But, after having thus overthrown the old physics, he discreetly clarified that rectilinear and uniform movement does not really exist, but is a fiction conceived by the mind to facilitate measurements. Now if the object not moved from without stands still or has a fictitious movement, it means, strictly speaking, that it stands still in every case, just as ancient physics said, and that Galileo, by means of a new system of measurements, could only explain why it stands still. That is to say, Galileo did not dispute ancient physics, he merely invented a better way of proving that it was correct, and that the testimony of the senses, being true enough, does not have in itself proof of its veracity, which was well known since the time of Aristotle. It was this episode that inaugurated the craze of modern scientists to take simple changes of methods as if they were "proofs" of a new constitution of reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/traducoes/epicurus.htm ''The Garden of Afflictions''], Chap. VI, §16–17 [Chapter in English].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is also critical of [[Georg Cantor]]'s work on [[Transfinite number|transfinite numbers]], accusing him of confusing "numbers with their mere signs," seeing his work as a "play on words" and a "false logic", &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/traducoes/epicurus.htm ''The Garden of Afflictions''], Chap. VI, §16–17 [Chapter in English].&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated that the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] was invented by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] merely to obfuscate the fact that [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] was wrong and that the earth does not in fact revolve about the sun.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

He does not believe in [[global warming]], basing his arguments on the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy|Climategate]] episode in which hackers, on the eve of the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Conference]], disseminated thousands of e-mails from [[University of East Anglia]] climatologists in order to undermine the credibility of conference. In addition, Olavo claims Climategate to be the work of a conspiracy led by the [[Rockefeller family]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations|Council of Foreign Relations]] and the [[Bilderberg Meeting|Bilderberg Club]], indicating them also as leaders of the "[[Abortion|global abortion]] [...] campaigns of the new global religion, and of the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration's proposal for universal control of the movement of capital. "{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

For Olavo, [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] does not pose a risk to the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, basing his arguments on journalist [[Michael Fumento]]'s book The Myth of Heterosexual Aids, and he does not agree that AIDS has been an imminent danger to all humanity, claiming that this idea has been disseminated by the pharmaceutical industry and other groups to raise government funding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====Politics====
Olavo maintains that his ideas do not fall into an ideological category, and points out that the evaluation of a position as politically left or right wing is subjective and varies by place and historical context. Broadly speaking however, he does see himself as aligned with the American right.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In November 2018, after the Brazilian presidential election, he declared that (if invited) he would accept to be the Brazilian ambassador to the United States. He stated that, if nominated by President-elect [[Jair Bolsonaro]], this would be the only position he would accept. According to him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What Brazil needs most is money, and as an ambassador to the United States, I would be able to make money. I have some practice from this international trade business from the time I lived in Romania. I am not totally ignorant in international trade. [...] The ambassador to a foreign other country has full authority over his countrymen there. He can kick out whoever he likes, he can have anyone arrested. He's a king."&lt;ref name="ambass"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2018/11/06/interna_politica,717731/olavo-de-carvalho-diz-que-gostaria-de-ser-embaixador-do-brasil-nos-eua.shtml|title=Olavo de Carvalho diz que gostaria de ser embaixador do Brasil nos EUA|last=Braziliense|first=Correio|date=2018-11-06|work=Correio Braziliense|access-date=2018-12-01|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Paul Beck Goddard''' (1811 - July 5, 1866) was an American physician and editor of medical books who also made pioneering contributions to [[photography]].{{r|e19cp}}

He graduated from the medical school of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1832. As well as practicing as a physician and surgeon, he was professor of anatomy at [[Franklin Medical College]] of Philadelphia,
and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].{{r|e19cp}}

Goddard died in Philadelphia on July 5, 1866. Reporting his death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him "one of the most eminent physicians of this country" and said, "His devotion to wounded soldiers during the war gained him great popularity among the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nyti.ms/2usTfdH|title=Death of Dr. Paul Beck Goddard.|last=|first=|date=July 6, 1866|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pen pals''' (or '''penpals''', '''pen-pals''', '''penfriends''' or '''pen friends''') are [[people]] who regularly write to each other, particularly via [[postal mail]].

==Purposes==
A penpal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a [[foreign language]], to improve [[literacy]], to learn more about other countries and life-styles, and to make friendships. As with any friendships in life, some people remain penpals for only a short time, while others continue to exchange letters and presents for life. Some penpals eventually arrange to meet face to face; sometimes leading to serious relationships, or even [[marriage]].

Penpals come in all ages, nationalities, cultures, languages and interests. Pals may seek new penfriends based on their own age group, a specific occupation, hobby, or select someone totally different from them to gain knowledge about the world around them.

A modern variation on the traditional penpal arrangement is to have a keypal / epal and exchange [[email]] addresses as well as or instead of paper letters. This has the advantage of saving money and being more immediate, allowing many messages to be exchanged in a short period of time. The disadvantage is that the communication can be very ephemeral if the email messages are not routinely saved. Many people prefer to receive paper letters, gaining the satisfaction of seeing their name carefully printed on a thick envelope in the letterbox.  Using [[postal mail]], it is possible to trade coupons, swap slips, [[postcard]]s, [[postage stamp|stamps]] and anything else light and flat enough to fit inside an envelope, often called "tuck-ins". Many penpallers like to trade sheets of stickers, notecards and stationery sets.

While the expansion of the [[Internet]] has reduced the number of traditional penpals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6133903/50-things-that-are-being-killed-by-the-internet.html|title=50 things that are being killed by the internet|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; penpal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Some people are looking for romantic interests, while others just want to find friends. It seems, on the internet, that the term "pen pals" defines those looking to correspond with others that live in a different place, where pen pals originated via postal mail correspondences and has evolved to mean something more. Penpals also make and pass around [[friendship book]]s, slams and crams. Another term used to describe pen pal is the word penfriend.

In recent years, pen pal correspondence with prison inmates has gained acceptance on the Internet.

==Organizations==
Many penpals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.

Organizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.

While the traditional [[snail mail]] pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world's [[communication]] gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow [[prisoners]] to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the [[United States]] and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.

==In popular culture==
The [[Australia]]n author [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] wrote a [[memoir]] entitled ''Foreign Correspondence'' (1997) about her childhood, which was enriched by her exchanges of letters with other children in Australia and overseas and her travels as an adult in search of the people they had become.

In the 1970s, syndicated children's television program ''[[Big Blue Marble]]'' often invited viewers to write to them for their own pen pal.

On another children's TV show, ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', [[Pee-wee Herman]] would often receive pen pal letters.

At the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964/1965 World's Fair]] in New York, the [[Parker Pen]] pavilion provided a computer pen pal matching service. This service was officially terminated by Parker Pen in 1967. This service did not work in conjunction with any other pen friend clubs. The computer system and database used for this service were not sold, taken over, or continued in any way.

In the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip from the 1960s and 1970s, Charlie Brown tries to write to a pen pal using a fountain pen  but after several literally "botched" attempts, Charlie switches to using a pencil and referring to his penpal as his "pencil-pal", with his first letter to his "pencil-pal" explaining the reason for the name change.

The 1983 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Romance (1983 film)|Romance]]'' is about two people, Amar (from India) and Sonia (from the UK) who fall in love after becoming pen pals. The 1999 Bollywood film ''[[Sirf Tum]]'' has a similar storyline.

The 1998 film ''[[You've Got Mail (film)|You've Got Mail]]'' is a romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal Email courtship who are unaware that they are also business rivals.

The 2004 action-drama film ''[[Out of Reach (film)|Out of Reach]]'' is about a pen pal relationship  between a Vietnam veteran and a 13-year-old orphaned girl from Poland. When the letters suddenly stop coming, he heads to Poland to find out the reason.

The 2009 [[claymation]] film ''[[Mary and Max]]'' is about the pen pal relationship between an American man and an Australian girl.

The 2012 novel ''[[Penpal (novel)|Penpal]]'' takes a dark twist to this innocent idea by the plot revolving around the protagonist being stalked ever since sending his letter.

The 2015 musical album ''Gold'' is a collaboration between musicians [[Jetty Rae]] and [[Heath McNease]] under the moniker "Pen Pals".

He is so far [[Malta]]'s first known philosopher, fragments of whose works are extant. His philosophical views and positions qualify him as an honourable adherent of the mediaeval humanist movement. His contribution skilfully stands as a mature reflection of the social and cultural revival of his time.

Caxaro's cultural preparation and his humanistic character, together with his philosophy, entirely reflect the peculiar force, functions and needs of a [[Mediterranean]] people whose golden age had still to come, but whose mental constitution and mode of expression were readily set. The discovery of the man and his philosophy is immeasurably relevant to further recognition of the wise tenure of an ancient civilization.

No portrait of Caxaro has been found.

== Family ==

Peter Caxaro was born of a noble [[Mdina]] family in [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;The following information is basically from M. Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, pp. 74–75. Formal and explicit permission granted by the copyright holder/s. Full bibliographical and documentary references are given below.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the date of his birth is still unknown, and it is very doubtful whether it had ever been recorded at all. We might suppose, however, that he was born around the beginning of the 15th century, perhaps around 1400.

His father's name was Leo, and his mother's Zuna. It might be possible that the family was of [[Jewish]] descent which had been forced to convert to the [[Catholic]] faith. It is known that one of Caxaro's brothers, Nicholas, was killed in 1473 following a brawl with people from [[Siggiewi]], Malta, because of a girl he was secretly seeing.

== Studies and offices ==

Caxaro's first studies were undertaken in Malta. Later, he went to [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], to pursue them further. At the time, Palermo was a flourishing city imbued with the spirit of Renaissance [[humanism]]. There, Caxaro completed his studies and became a notary in 1438. A couple of months after his graduation, he was appointed judge at the courts of [[Gozo]] for the years 1440-1441. In 1441, he also sat as judge in the courts of Malta, and the similarly in 1475. He was judge at the civil courts in 1460-1461, 1470–1471 and 1481–1482, and judge at the ecclesiastical courts in 1473 and 1480-1481.

Caxaro was also jurat at the Town Council of [[Mdina]] in 1452-1453, 1458–1459, 1461–1462, 1469–1470, 1474–1475 and 1482-1483. He was a notary or secretary to the same council in 1460 and 1468.

He possessed considerable property at the northern side of Malta, and was the owner of six slaves.

== Friendship with Dominicans ==

During all this time, Caxaro was on very good terms with the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars. These had a monastery at [[Rabat, Malta]], very close to [[Mdina]], Caxaro's home-town and centre of operation. The Dominicans had originally arrived in Malta around 1450, and quickly forged good friendships amongst the literary population and professional people, including academics. Towards the end of the 15th century, the Dominicans could boast of erudite friars amongst their fold, such as Peter Xara, Peter Zurki, Dominic Bartolo (who was also Pro-Inquisitor for some cases of the [[Inquisition]] in Malta) and Bartolomeus Pace.

Caxaro was certainly a good friend of some of these men, both for intellectual as well as personal reasons. The fact that he designated the Dominicans as his general inheritors, or residuary legatees, in his will is proof enough of this.

== Marriage attempt ==

Around 1463, Caxaro aspired to marrying a widow, Franca de Biglera. However, her brother, a Canon at the bishop's cathedral chapter, objected on the grounds of “spiritual affinity”, since Caxaro's father was a godfather to Franca.

Despite the fact that Caxaro did all he could to win Franca over, and also obtained the official blessing of the bishop of Malta, the marriage did not take place. To the great consternation of Caxaro, Franca changed her mind.

Caxaro remained a bachelor to the end of his days.

== Excommunicated ==

At the Town Council of Mdina Caxaro had three particular themes which he seemed to come to life about: the welfare and maintenance of his town-home Mdina, the education of the common people, and the accountability of civil servants.

In 1480, Caxaro took an active and bold part in an issue which involved the bishop of Malta, who was suspected of corruption. Caxaro was vehement against such corruption, and vigorous in his demand for an immediate remedy. In June 1480, as an act of retaliation, the bishop excommunicated him, an action which was considered immensely serious in those days. Nevertheless, Caxaro was unyielding in his opposition and demands. Consequently, the bishop interdicted him. However, Caxaro was nonetheless undaunted.

The issue lingered on until the first half of the following year, when the bishop had to accede to Caxaro's and the Town Council's demands. Accordingly, the excommunication and the interdict were removed. Caxaro's determination and resolve in the matter were highly praised.

== Death ==

On August 12, 1485, Caxaro drew up his will, and died a few days later. The precise date of his death is still not known with any certainty. All his possession went to the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars.

It is not known where he was initially buried. However, later, as he had it willed, his remains were laid to rest in one of the newly built chapels of the church of [[St. Dominic]] at [[Rabat, Malta]]. The chapel had been actually constructed at Caxaro's expense, and dedicated to Our Lady of Divine Help.

A memorial was unveiled within the same chapel over Caxaro's tomb on September 30, 1992.

== Caxaro's cultural formation ==

=== Unveiled ===

Peter Caxaro was virtually unknown&lt;ref&gt;The information contained in this section is basically from M. Montebello, ''Pietru Caxaru u l-Kantilena Tieghu'' (Peter Caxaro and his ‘Cantilena’), Malta, 1992, pp. 15–38. Formal and explicit permission obtained from the copyright holder/s.&lt;/ref&gt; until he was made famous in 1968 by the publication of his ''Cantilena'' by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Michael Fsadni and Godfrey Wettinger.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Michael Fsadni who discovered the ''Cantilena'' on September 22, 1966, at the back of the third page from the last in the first of Reverend Brandan Caxaro's notarial registers (1533–1536), currently numbered R175, in the Notarial Archives, [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Montebello, ‘Who really discovered the Cantilena?’, Culture and Entertainment, supplement with The Sunday Times of Malta, 14 June, p. 1; P. Xuereb, ‘The Cantilena’, Sunday Times of Malta, 21 June, p. 25; J. Vella, ‘Who really discovered the Cantilena?’, Sunday Times of Malta, 21 June, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Caxaro's work was actually transcribed by Rev. Brandan himself in its original Maltese version. The discovery was encountered with enthusiasm within scholarship circles since it had eventually given Maltese literature its greatest boost for a very long time.&lt;ref&gt;M.V.S., 1968: 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It had taken the authors about two years before they were able to present Caxaro's ''Cantilena'' to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger, 1977: 88f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authenticity of Caxaro's work is undoubtable,&lt;ref&gt;Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and so is Brandan's transcription. The discoverers themselves, both reliable historical researchers,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger, 1977: 93.&lt;/ref&gt; carefully examined the document and found that it could not reveal any suspicious feature.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'': 89f.&lt;/ref&gt; It was next to impossible for the document to have been faked so well that no sign of its faking remained.

Up till 1968, modern scholarly references to Peter Caxaro had been few. The first known to have referred to him was the Dominican Paul Galea in his history of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at [[Rabat, Malta]], published in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Galea, 1949: 62f.&lt;/ref&gt; Further data was produced by Michael Fsadni O.P. in 1965, also attempting his hand at a similar history.&lt;ref&gt;Fsadni, 1965: 53f.; cf. also M. Fsadni, ''Il-Madonna tal-Ghar: Il-Knisja, il-Kunvent u s-Santwarju'', Malta 1980: 24f.&lt;/ref&gt; Both friars based their information on a common source; namely, on the ''Descrittione delli Tre Conventi che l’Ordine dei Predicatori tiene nell’Isola di Malta'', I, 1, by Francesco Maria Azzopardo O.P., written about 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Archives of the Dominicans, Rabat, Malta: Ms. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mention of Caxaro had also been made in a work preceding Azzopardo's by approximately three decades. This had been by [[Giovanni Francesco Abela]]'s 1647 publication entitled (in short) ''Della Descrittione di Malta''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''infra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The man ===

Introducing his transcription of the composition, Rev. Brandan - a member of the [[Society of True Christians]] - indicated its author as a "philosopher, poet and orator".&lt;ref&gt;''Prol.'', vv. 2f.; Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 36; ''ibid''., 1983: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On examination, it is positively held that Caxaro's original version was in the [[Maltese language|Maltese]] tongue, and that Rev. Brandan transcribed it as faithfully as possible as he recalled it.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 12f.; ''ibid''., 1983: 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The composition proves that Caxaro's qualification as a philosopher, poet and orator is fully justified since its construction is professionally accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;Mallia, 1970: 120.&lt;/ref&gt; He certainly was a man of learning.

Lately, a few proposals have been made which held that the said composition, in part&lt;ref&gt;Cassola, 1986: 120.&lt;/ref&gt; or as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;Kabazi, 1990: 42.&lt;/ref&gt; does not have Peter Caxaro as its author. It has been said that the poem is none other than Rev. Brandan's innocent transcription in Latin characters of a Megrebian or [[Andalusia]]n ''qasida''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; The proponent unscientifically based his suppositions, as he himself said, on an “extrasensorial impression”. Thus the author hastily concluded that the qualifications attributed to Caxaro by Rev. Brandan are spurious.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The truth, however, seems to be otherwise. Caxaro's competence as a poetic writer, apart from his philosophic and oratorical skills, is highly estimable. He seems to qualify&lt;ref&gt;Mallia, 1970: 123.&lt;/ref&gt; as a phonetic master, as well as one having control of classical rhetoric techniques. He has tact in expressing his veiled poetic thought in striking and tempting allusions. In other words, Caxaro is a forceful writer,&lt;ref&gt;Xuereb, 1971: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; possessing clarity of thought, and is confident in handling of style.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 16f.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cantilena'' is a piece of fine literature; the work of dextrous mastership.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 43f.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows a very particular formal attention, and an uncommon capability of stylistic invention in its structure.&lt;ref&gt;Brincat, 1986: 16f.&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be noticed, however, that [[Giovanni Francesco Abela]], in his ''Descrittione'' of 1647,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''infra''.&lt;/ref&gt; did not include Caxaro in his list of some forty-six ''Houmini di Malta per varie guise d’eccellenza celebri, e famosi'',&lt;ref&gt;Pp. 548-573.&lt;/ref&gt; of which not all are that illustrious. Abela could have mentioned Caxaro's philosophic, poetic or oratorical skills, if anything. This may suggest that Caxaro's aptitudes were somewhat concealed.

The known sources of Caxaro's biographical data are few, namely four,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 15-22; and ''ibid''., 1983: 20-27.&lt;/ref&gt; the State Archives of Palermo, Sicily (''Protocollo del Regno'', mainly vol. 34), the National Library of Malta (''Universitas'', 11), the Archives of the Dominicans, Rabat (Ms. 321, ''Giuliana Antica'', I), and ''Della Descrittione di Malta Isola nel Mare Siciliano con le sue Antichità, ed altre Notitie'' of [[Giovanni Francesco Abela]], printed by Paolo Bonecota, Malta, in 1647 (''passim'').

The first known date regarding Caxaro is April 1, 1438, when he set for the examination to be given the warrant of public notary of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] by the competent authorities in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 21, n. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In those times, Malta and its dependencies formed part of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. This means that Caxaro had spent some time in Palermo, a city then imbued with [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;It is not excluded that Caxaro studied abroad either before or/and after this date.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, we are informed of a series of appointments in Malta and Gozo between 1440 and 1483, a span of forty-three years. Alternatively or concurrently, at one time or another Caxaro acted as judge in the civil courts of Gozo&lt;ref&gt;For 1440-1441, cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 22, n. 69. Caxaro was appointed judge in June 1438. Cf. ''ibid''.: 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and of Malta,&lt;ref&gt;For 1441, 1470-1471 and 1481-1482, cf. next note.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ecclesiastical cours.&lt;ref&gt;For 1480-1481, Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 22, nn. 70ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He was further juror in Malta at the Mdina city-council,&lt;ref&gt;For 1452-1453, 1461-1462, 1469-1470, 1475-1476 and 1482-1483, ''ibid''.: n. 73; and G. Wettinger, ''Acta Juratorum et Consilii Civitatis et Insulae Maltae'', Associazione di Studi Malta-Sicilia, Palermo 1993.: ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; to which he sometimes acted as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;For 1460 and 1468, ''ibid''.: 24, n. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at [[Rabat, Malta]] preserve a substantial part of his will, drawn on August 12, 1485,&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 53, n. 96; Fsadni, 1974: 52f.; Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 24f., n. 82ff.&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 1983: 26, n. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; No wife or offspring are mentioned in the will.

Caxaro had willed that he be buried in the Dominican newly built church at Rabat, as eventually happened.&lt;ref&gt;Explicit reference is made regarding the execution of Caxaro’s desire in the archives of the Dominicans at Rabat, Ms. 321, ''Giuliana Antica'', I, f. 83v (January 28, 1497): ''“… in dicta Ecclesia et Cappella, in qua est defunctus dictus quondam Notarius Petrus …”''.&lt;/ref&gt; in a chapel built at his own expense, dedicated to the ''Gloriosissima Vergine del Soccorso''.&lt;ref&gt;Abela, ''Descrittione'', 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further known with certainty that Peter Caxaro was a native of Malta,&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger, 1977: 100f.&lt;/ref&gt; born of Maltese parents,&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 24, nn. 75f.&lt;/ref&gt; and lived at Mdina.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: n. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; His date of birth is still unknown. His immobile property was considerable,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 24f.&lt;/ref&gt; though not exuberant. It is known that he had in his service at least six slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 25, n. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Caxaro's public offices and death, which is satisfactorily documented, two other personal episodes are known. The first, occurring either in 1463 or 1478,&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger, 1977: 105.&lt;/ref&gt; concerns his proposed marriage to Francha di Biglera.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 96. The whole transcript of the extant related documents are given in ''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; From the court proceedings we know that Caxaro's father had frequently visited [[Catalonia]] (specifically [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have some bearing on Peter's own formation.

The second instance concerns the murder of Caxaro's brother, Cola, in 1473 at [[Siggiewi]], [[Malta]],&lt;ref&gt;The story was revealed in ''ibid''., 97, but extensively dealt with in Wettinger, 1980: 70-77.&lt;/ref&gt; which may have given a not-so-good reputation to his family.

The most recent significant addition to the personal data and profile of Peter Caxaro was made by Frans Sammut in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sammut, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that Caxaro came from a [[Jewish]] family that had been converted to [[Christianity]]. In support of his claim he proposed that Caxaro's ''Cantilena'' was in fact a ''zajal'', which in [[Arabic]] refers to a song which the Jews of [[Spain]] (and [[Sicily]]) adopted and promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Though interesting as a suggestion, one must perhaps bear in mind that it was the very transcriber of the poem who originally called it a ''“cantilenam”'' in the prologue to the poem itself. This was none other than a member of the Caxaro family itself. If the poem was a ''zijad'', wouldn't he have known?&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extant fragments ===

Little of Caxaro's scholarship is known to exist. Much work has yet to be accomplished in this difficult field. We only possess isolated parts of his contributions, the most complete being the ''Cantilena'', which, in itself, comes down to us through an imperfect, indirect source.

That Brandan's transcript&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 36; Wettinger, 1977: 102f. and Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 47.&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Cantilena'' is faulty is evident from various internal traits. Furthermore, the reasons for which Brandan recalled the work, and even the manner in which he did so, is unto this day a baffling uncertainty. The cheerfulness felt by Brandan apparently seems to be doubly caused, namely by both the memory of the composition ''and'' the memory of his ancestor (with a necessary relationship of one to the other). Brandan's opening sentence of the short prologue seems to suggest that he was gladdened ''more'' by the relationship than by any of the related parts. Wettinger and Fsadni had suggested&lt;ref&gt;1983: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; that it was the consolation which Brandan saw in the content of the composition that prompted him to leave us a memory of it, writing it down in one of the registers of his acts. But this is a question which must still be open to discussion.

The first to seriously suspect certain imperfections in Brandan's transcript was Joseph Brincat in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Brincat, 1986: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; suspicious of the verses which do not have any rhyme. He specifically refers here to the four lines of the refrain (vv. 7-10) and the first four lines of the second stanza (vv. 11-14). Brincat, guided by his erudition as by common sense, concludes that the quatrain which stands on its own between the two stanzas, of six verses and ten verses each respectively, is erroneously transcribed by Brandan.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Brincat very aptly provides convincing internal evidence for the error.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'': 13f.&lt;/ref&gt; Brincat's important conclusion was followed by other scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Cassola, 1986: 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and to which we also subscribe here.{{clarify|reason=where is "here"?|date=September 2016}}

Apart from the ''Cantilena'', other fragments concerning Caxaro's contributions are extant, namely, a few judicial sentences passed by Caxaro at the ecclesiastical courts,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. at the Cathedral Museum, Mdina, Original Archives, Ms. 1. See, for instance, ff. 187vr and 19vf.&lt;/ref&gt; and secretarial minutes taken at the [[Mdina]] town-council meetings in which Caxaro took part.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger, ''Acta Juratorum'', ''op. cit''. See, for instance, nn. 4, 8, 10, 11, 21, ''etc.''&lt;/ref&gt; Both are naturally extra-philosophical in nature.

The sentences, however interesting they may be, only give us an inkling into the equilibrate soberness of Caxaro. Herein, we search in vain for any of Caxaro's own original thinking, apart from the arid judicial and official terminology.

The same may be said of the municipal acts. Only here the information provided regards Caxaro's context in matters which interested his town (Mdina) particularly, and the [[Maltese Islands]] in general. Caxaro's name is mentioned at least in some 267 sittings of the council between 1447 and 1485. At most of these, he had a minor say;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for instance, ''ibid''., nn. 11, 21,24, 39, ''etc.''&lt;/ref&gt; at other times, his share is more substantial.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for instance, ''ibid''., nn. 45, 94, 121, 124, ''etc.''&lt;/ref&gt; Some acts are also written in Caxaro's own hand.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for instance, ''ibid''., nn. 36, 37, 75, 97, ''etc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The philosopher ===
''Philosopher'' is the title attributed to Caxaro by Rev. Brandan.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 15f.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rest of the ''Cantilena''’s prologue, which is formally in accord with the general practice of the times,&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Bonnici, 1990: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; the poetic rather than the philosophical or oratorical excellences of Caxaro are emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;''Prol.'', vv. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These are left in the shadow, even by modern scholars. It has been naively ventured&lt;ref&gt;Cassola, 1968: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that the appellative ''philosopher'' is to be understood merely in the sense of a man of wisdom or learning (''“bniedem gharef”'', literally indicating a sophist rather than a philosopher). However, being a trustworthy notary in possession of a precise vocabulary (to which the rest of the prologue, at least, is witness), Rev. Brandan is to be understood in a strict sense. The hope of the discovery of corroborative material in this regard must remain enkindled.

The fact that a man's philosophy is to be detected from nothing more than a fragment of his written thought, however substantial it may be, does not make novelty in the history of philosophy. Innumerable cases of the sort may be found to exist, including philosophers of a gigantic stature, such as the Miletians, or even [[Aristotle]] himself.

The same is to be said regarding the poetic form of Caxaro's extant philosophy. We have similar cases with philosophers of outstanding relevance, such as the [[Eleatics]], including [[Parmenides]] himself, the father of philosophy. However, here, with Caxaro's case, the question is slightly more complex. We do not have to do with a then out-going poetic custom in an age where prose took the precedence, as in the Greek naturalistic philosophers (of the 5th century BCE). We are in the context of (15th-century) [[Medieval philosophy]], highly susceptible to classical literature, both Greek and Roman, but particularly to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Here, more than anything else, the poetic form is a technique, an expressive and cognitive distinction.

Some scholars today, especially those brought up in a scholastic tradition, would like to qualify a philosophic work from its systematic nature. Such a definite distinctness would have philosophers like [[Aristotle]], [[Avicenna]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Aquinas]], and the like, fitting like drawers. On the other hand, however, it would unwittingly exclude, if none other, [[Plato]] himself, the archetype philosopher of all time, who, unlike the scientist Aristotle, is an artist prior to being a philosopher. The ''Corpus Platonicum'' stands as evident testimony.

Thus Caxaro is part of a tradition which may characteristically and properly be called ''platonic''. The accent here would fall less on unsystemization, and more on narration, or better, on the ''myth-type'' philosophy in its technical connotation. From the formal, essential aspect, we are in the line of Plato, [[St. Augustine]] and the Medieval neo-Platonists, especially those with a humanistic formation in the early [[Renaissance]] period. This was later continued by people like [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Rousseau]], [[Nietzsche]], and the like. In general, it is a philosophical trend commencing with an ''ideal'' response, technically speaking, to [[Parmenides]]' concept of being, marked with an intense attention to the affective functions in man, to that knowledge acquired through a volitive prompting, and further manifested with an openness to flexibility. Though the will is duly valued, the intrinsic mental capabilities of man are held to be necessary, prior to the senses, in discovering the true object of knowledge, that being which is different and superior to mere sense data.

== A Humanistic character ==

It seems to be opportune at this point to highlight two instances from Caxaro's acquaintances, namely, his father's contact with [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]], and Caxaro's own connection with [[Palermo]].

=== Humanist Catalonia ===

[[Catalonia]], together with [[Aragon]], became familiar with humanism before [[Crown of Castile|Castille]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. G. Fraile, ''Historia de la Filosofia'', Madrid 1966, III: 80f.&lt;/ref&gt; The first contact of the Catalan scholars with the movement was at its first appearance at the Pontifical court of [[Avignon]], where [[Petrarch]] sojourned, and at the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418), [[Basle]] (1431) and [[Florence]] (1438–1455), as at the Neapolitan court of [[Alphonse V]] of Aragon, so-called ''El Magnanimo'' (died 1458).

The Catalan movement was initiated by Juan Fernandez' efforts in the 14th century. Fernandez travelled to the East and returned with many Greek manuscripts. He later established himself as a translator, compiler and commentator of classical texts, therefore giving rise to a literary culture concerned with human interests.

Fernandez was followed by other men of standing, such as Pedro de Saplana, a Dominican (14th century), Antonio Canals, [[Bernat Metge]] (''c''.1340-1413), Carlos de Aragon (1421–1461), nephew of King [[Alphonse V]], and Bachiller Alfonso de la Torre (15th century). These men of letters concentrated on the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Boethius]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Marcianus Capella]], Pedro Campostella, and the like. They were additionally highly instrumental in animating the cultural centres of [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]] with the spirit of humanism.

It would not be surprising that Caxaro's father, in the course of his constant voyaging between [[Catalonia]], [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]], like so many other tradesmen of his time, came in contact with the then prevailing environment of Spain's Mediterranean city-harbours. Here, as elsewhere, humanism was not restricted to mere cultural circles, but had become the philosophy of the people. Caxaro, apart from his father, had other members of his family, together with many of his townfolk,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Abela, ''Descrittione'': 288ff., and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; taking part in this same commerce of goods and ideas.

=== Humanist Palermo ===

King [[Alphonse the Magnanimous]] of [[Aragon]], asserting his seat at [[Naples]], and set in giving additional splendour to the reign of Aragon, was successful in changing the Neapolitan court in one of [[Renaissance]]'s most brilliant great centres.&lt;ref&gt;Fraile, ''op. cit.'': 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Naples and its favoured twin [[Palermo]] were visited by the most eminent of humanists from all over the [[Italian peninsula]], [[Catalonia]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and Aragon.

From the first half of the 15th century onwards, Palermo went through an enormous and impressive economic, demographic and urbanistic development,&lt;ref&gt;I. Peri, ''Restaurazione e Pacifico Stato in Sicilia 1377-1501'', Rome-Bari 1988: 157-163.&lt;/ref&gt; manifesting a substantial cultural facelift. Though the times were rather difficult due to the frequent incursions of the Turks, and the disastrous effect of epidemics and other diseases,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 203f.&lt;/ref&gt; the enthusiasts of the ''humanæ litteræ'' were great in number. Up to Caxaro's visit to Palermo many native men familiar with the ''studia humanitatis''&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 143ff.&lt;/ref&gt; made a name for themselves and for their town, scholars like [[Giovanni Aurispa]] and Giovanni Marrasio.

As in the case of Catalonia, the spirit of humanism was imported to [[Sicily]] from [[Northern Italy]] where large numbers of Palemitans went to study.&lt;ref&gt;C. De Seta and L. Di Mano, ''Palermo'', Palermo 1988: 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1445, when the ''Studio di Catania'' was established,&lt;ref&gt;Peri, ''op. cit''.: 149f.&lt;/ref&gt; it was Palermo which attracted the largest number of law students. These were centres where the classical texts were circulated mainly in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;It was only later, at the end of the 15th century, that printed books came in vogue. ''Ibid''.: 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In those days, the large number of intellectuals and law students considered the juridical culture as instrumental in acquiring a worthy social standing.&lt;ref&gt;A. Guiffride, “Lu quartieri di lu Cassaru”, ''Note sul quartiere del Cassaro a Palermo nella prima metà del secolo XVI'', in ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]]'', Serie Moyen Ages – Temps Modernes, LXXXIII, 1971, 2, 454f., quoted in De Seta and Di Mano, ''op. cit.'': 55f.&lt;/ref&gt; The professional state, especially the juridical, became an integral part of the refreshed milieu of the times at [[Palermo]]. Moreover, while the use of the vulgar tongues became established as a practised norm,&lt;ref&gt;Peri, ''op. cit''.: 152.&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called ''cultura del decoro'' of the humanists became, more than restricted to cultural circles, a quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.: 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly it became the diffused, general mentality of the educated Palermitans.&lt;ref&gt;De Seta and Di Mano, ''op. cit.'': 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit to Palermo the young Caxaro himself must have been extremely impressed by the evident restoration and construction of Palermo's edifices, both within and without the walls, according to the tastes of the time. The whole city was caught in a rediscovered renovation, manifesting a strong concern for the quality of life. The prevailing humanism brought to the fore a movement of the spirit, each time aesthetic, philosophic, scientific and religious,&lt;ref&gt;Phillippart, ''Revue de Synthese'', X: 107.&lt;/ref&gt; sharpening the notion of beauty, and brightening the relationship to nature (and naturalism).

Caxaro's sojourn at Palermo in 1438 must have recalled to him King Alphonse's stop in Malta, amidst great pomp and exultation, five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Abela, ''Descrittione'', 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The Magnanimous, personifying the spirit of the time, entered [[Mdina]], Caxaro's town-fortress, ''“con quelle magiori dimostrationi di giubilo, &amp; applauso, che potevan originarsi da affetto sincero di devoti, e riverenti Vassalli verso il loro Signore”''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The spirit of mediaeval humanism ===

In order to comprehend better Caxaro's philosophy we cannot do less than grasp the spirit of humanism in his age.

The heart of the Mediaeval humanists, as distinct from that of the 14th century Mediaeval masters, and from the exponents of the 16th century [[Renaissance]], was the retrieval and imitation of the beauty of ancient letters. This had nothing of any anti-Christian sentiment but definitely emphasized naturalism enormously. The imitation of the customs of ''pagan'' antiquity came later.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Fraile, ''op. cit''.: 24f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of humanism coincided with a number of other occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ibid.'': 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first place, the [[Eastern Schism]], a critical moment in the [[Catholic Church]] which weakened the [[papacy]]. Next, a marked ignorance of the clergy and a relaxation of discipline. Thirdly, the corruption of the customs of the high classes. And finally, the decadence of [[Scholasticism]].

The forerunners of [[humanism]] imprinted their views with surprising power. The works of [[Brunetto Latini]] (1230–1291), [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321), [[Francesco Petrarca]] (1304–1374) and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (1313–1375) became the daily bread of the humanists. All of these extensively admired classical antiquity, idealising its splendour and richness, and dreaming of an ideal society equivalent to that apparently gorgeous achievement.

Ironically (maybe), it was the melancholic and pessimistic cleric [[Petrarch|Petrarca]] who exerted the greatest influence on the humanists,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ed., ''English Literature'', Oxford 1984: 637.&lt;/ref&gt; advocating, like [[Socrates]], the true wisdom in the knowledge of self, and true humility as the path to the secrets of life. His adherence to [[Plato]] and his fierce attacks on [[Scholasticism]] deeply impressed his posteriors. It was Petrarca, eventually, who supplied the humanist movement with its ''battle-cries'': ''Rinascere! Rifiorire! Rivivere! Ritrovare! '' ― stressing the ''ri'' more than anything else.

The humanist rebirth was felt in the whole of [[Western Europe]], especially in the [[Italian peninsula]], [[France]], [[England]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Fraile, ''op. cit.'': 46-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Being the cultural climax of all that has been done in the [[Middle Ages]], the humanist wave of erudition superbly retrieved the Latin, Greek and Christian [[classical literature]], with its proper techniques, methods, forms and tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ibid''.: 33-46.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed sciences, such as [[philology]], [[palaeography]], [[epigraphy]], [[archaeology]], [[numismatics]], [[textual criticism]] and [[literary criticism]], [[geography]] and [[history]]. It also gave rise to the [[printing press]], the libraries, to new universities, paternities and literary associations, such as the renowned ''Academic Platonica'' of [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499). In other words, a true ''renaissance'' with its proper philosophy which recognises the value and dignity of man and makes him, as [[Protagoras]] would have it, the “measure of all things”, somehow taking human nature, its limits and delimits, together with its interests, as it main theme.&lt;ref&gt;Abbagnano, “Humanism”, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edwards Ed., New York 1972: 4, 69f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ''Cantilena'' ==

The textual analyses&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 39-47; Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Cantilena'', employed during these last twenty-five years,&lt;ref&gt;On ''Cantilenas'' in general, cf. Wettinger, 1977: 97f.; Bringcat, 1986: 3f. and 9f.; on syllabization, cf. Fenech, 1972: 12; Friggieri, 1979: 87; ''ibid''., 1983: 7; Zammit Ciantar, 1984: 11; Aquilina, 1984: 12; Bringcat, 1986: 3-9, 9-15; Cohen and Vanhove, 1986: 182f. and Kabazi, 1990: 42; on orthography, cf.

Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 39f.; on the additional vowels in the ''Cantilena'', cf. ''ibid''.: 40; Brincat, 1986: 8f. and Kabazi, 1990: 44; on the consonants, cf. Brincat, 1986: 6ff. and Fenech, 1986: 179ff.; on vocalisatioin, cf. Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11 and Cohen and Vanhove, 1986: 181f.; on phonology, cf. ''ibid''.: 179-183; and on morphology, cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 40; Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11 and G.C.P., 1969: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; have given ample food for thought. In general, the comments regarded the embarrassing inconsistencies which exist in the extant copy of the ''Cantilena''.

The literary value of Caxaro's work, and its standing in the Maltese literary tradition, has likewise been embellished from the historical literary analyses’ point of view.&lt;ref&gt;On the new date for Maltese literature, cf. Cassola, 1968: 1; Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 10; Depasquale, 1969: 12; Brincat, 1986: 1f. and Kabazi, 1990: 45; on European and Latin allegorical poetry, cf.

More interesting comments had been advanced from the perspective of [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;On rules for analysis, cf. Mallia, 1970: 118ff.; Wettinger, 1977: 98f.; Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 44 and Brincat, 1986: 1; on the structure of the ''Cantilena'', cf.

Buttigieg, 1968: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, much work has to be done in this field, especially by scholars with professional standing on mediaeval Arabic, Spanish and Sicilian idioms, dialects and poetic forms.

Due to the ''Cantilena''’s uniqueness interesting results have been put forward by historical linguistics,&lt;ref&gt;On the relation between Maltese and the ''Cantilena'', cf. Cowan, 1975: 5f., 10 and Aquilina, 1984: 12; on historical linguistics’ method and technique, cf. Cowan, 1975: 4f. and Wettinger, 1977: 94 and Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 106f.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasising the drastic changes in the [[Maltese language]] over a span of four centuries.

What interests us here, however, is not the ''Cantilena''’s literary value as much as its philosophical content. Before proceeding further, it would be opportune to give the transliteration of the ''Cantilena'':&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Idiosyncratic analysis ===

At its appearance in 1968 the ''Cantilena'' had been declared to be not readily understandable by today’s generation.&lt;ref&gt;M.V.S., 1968: 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers themselves found it “terribly difficult and absolutely daunting”.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger, 1977: 92f.&lt;/ref&gt; The interpreter, it had been said,&lt;ref&gt;Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; had to be a [[philologist]], a [[Maltese people|Maltese]], one in possession of [[Arabic]], familiar with the [[history of Malta]], and well informed on the author of the composition. It must be admitted that a foreigner, even if expert in this field of study, but unfamiliar to a Maltese way of thinking, will find the text difficult and obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cohen and Vanhove, 1986: 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea of the text, the so-called “physical interpretation”,&lt;ref&gt;Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 117.&lt;/ref&gt; is simple enough. An uncontrollable person had been responsible for the collapse of a building which the author considered to be his.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 39 and ''ibid''., 1983: 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he had misjudged the situation. The theme seems to follow a definite scheme, namely, an apparently simple one:&lt;ref&gt;Bonnici, 1990: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; an invocation (vv. 1-2), the narration of an unhappy love event and the lyric I's situation thereby (vv. 3-6), its delusion (vv. 7-10, 11-14), and finally its attempt to reverse the misfortune (vv. 15-20). It is a scheme which in its content resembles the general classical [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] (specifically [[Arabic]]) ''qasida'' pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Fenech, 1985: 7 and 12; Cachia (1969: 141) had misjudged the said general purposrt as unarabic.&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of curiosity might be interesting here. As from the beginning of 1450,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wettinger, ''Acta'', ''op. cit''.: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mdina]] town-council had been discussing the precarious state of the town walls (the ''mirammerii'') of Mdina. In March of that same year,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ibid''.: 10.&lt;/ref&gt; the Augustinian Matteo di Malta had been commissioned as the town-council's ambassador to lead the talks with the viceroy on the question so as to provide funds for their urgent restoration. Little, if any, progress seems to have been made on the matter, until at the beginning of 1454&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ibid''.: 39.&lt;/ref&gt; an internal tower of the castle at mdina collapsed. So as to take immediate action and prevent further immanent collapse of the walls, at the town-council sitting of January 11&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Caxaro, acting as secretary, spoke in favour of an urgent ''collecta'' (which was later effected), with the approval of the whole house. Furthermore, on May 24,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''ibid''.: 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Caxaro, Peter's brother, had been appointed by the council as ''supramarammerius'' to supervise the restoration of the walls. On that occasion, Peter Caxaro had highly praised the decision taken. Strictly by way of speculation, it seems interesting to associate the ''Cantilena''’s ''mirammiti'' to [[Mdina]]’s ''marammerii'' (being the same term). What is said in the ''Cantilena''’s refrain might be identified to the disastrous collapse of part of Mdina's walls in 1454. The ''Cantilena'' might have been inspired from that serious occasion, which was the effect of a general negligence. Supposing that the ''Cantilena'' had been sung to some of those noblemen at the town-council who were collaborators of Caxaro (as is possible), such speculation might hold some water.

Apart from the immediate and superficial message, we obviously have a more profound and veiled communication. The overall drift of this so-called “metaphysical interpretation”,&lt;ref&gt;Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 117f.&lt;/ref&gt; has been seen to be the ruin of the author's project, either concerning his career or a love affair.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 39 and Wettinger, 1977: 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The general melancholic tone of the composition did not pass unnoticed,&lt;ref&gt;Cachia, 1968: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; though it had been recognised that the final note sounded the victory of hope over desperation; the building anew over the ruins of unfulfilled dreams or ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P.D.M., 1968: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Wettinger categorically denied that the murder of Caxaro's brother had any relevance to the theme of the ''Cantilena''.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger, 1977: 97.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he proposed that it may have to do with Caxaro's marriage proposal which apparently went up in smoke.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', 95ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion had been confirmed jointly by Wettinger and Fsadni in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 43f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though presumably well calculated, it would seem that the comments put forward so far reveal little depth, hinging on to a restricted inspection of the matter. This may have somewhat betrayed Caxaro's philosophic prowess.&lt;ref&gt;For such a rash conclusion, cf. Xuereb, 1968: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have audaciously stated that the composition has no depth of feeling at all.&lt;ref&gt;Aquilina, 1984: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have indeed valued its content highly,&lt;ref&gt;Bonavia, 1968: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; wisely noting that the subject is entirely profane (as opposed to the sacred), and moreover sheds light on the concrete versus abstract thinking of the populace (a feature common amongst [[Mediterranean]] peoples unto this day); reality against illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

What mostly concerns us here is Caxaro's idiosyncrasy in order to comprehend the entire complexity of his thought as it appears synthetically in the text. His cognitive peculiarities as well as his cultural shared-interests jointly constitute his marked philosophical views and positions.

=== The text ===

== Caxaro's philosophy ==
{{original research|section|date=January 2012}}

Given the aforementioned background to Caxaro's thought we shall hereunder indicate introductory and merely signalatory problematics proper to the philosopher under study. The suggested propositions can neither be exhaustive nor comprehensive but may simply aid our understanding of Caxaro's philosophical positions.

=== The common tongue ===

In the first place it is never enough to emphasise the use of the ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]) vulgar idiom by Caxaro. This marked a qualitative leap which resulted from a humanistic formation. The option to express himself with masterly skill while positively valuing highly the language of the people, as opposed to the Latin and Sicilian idioms of the cultured class, indicates real quality on the part of Caxaro. Not only is it a mere choice of tongue but, over and above, it is the adherence to a set mentality peculiar to a geographic territory.

It also shows the worth given to a local culture and heritage, considering it capable of standing on its own two feet on an equal par with that of other neighbouring countries. The use of the Maltese vulgar tongue is not a call for independent rule but an affirmation of a native identity characteristic of a people.

=== Humankind at the centre ===

Similarly important is the profane theme and nature of Caxaro's composition. This marks a further sign of Caxaro's humanistic character. The ''Cantilena'' is not a-religious or anti-Christian but it decidedly does not belong to what is sacred, religious or biblical. It is definitely not irreverent or blasphemous but it characteristically considers life, persons and their surroundings from a human standing.

The theme dwells on the qualities distinctive of the human nature, such faculties which affirm the astonishing skills of humans and their intrinsic power to transcend the otherwise despairing limitations of their essential characters. Caxaro's composition in fact shows a trustworthy reliance on the spiritual, or better, immaterial possibilities of humans. The ''Cantilena'' can thus rightly be considered a profession of faith in humankind.

Such a belief reverts our attention to the classical humanism of the [[Sophists]] and of [[Socrates]] himself, a school which immensely inspired early [[Renaissance philosophy]]. We note here the surpassing of the merely naturalistic mentality of the classics, placing humans at the centre of serious consideration. The classical excellence of proposing natural solutions to age-old problems, over and above the former religious tentative answers, must not be discarded from the context.

=== The sphere of reality ===

The concreteness of Caxaro's reflections stands out loud and clear against any theoretical speculation. The arid, scholastic, professional terminology and mental structure is completely done away with. The practical existential perspective to life and reality is preferred. This may be considered typically Maltese in nature or at least [[Mediterranean]] where an acute common sense is noticeable in everyday dealings.

Caxaro's inclination towards action rather than speculation, subordinating (though not eliminating) the latter to the former reveals his inclination towards the platonic school and away from Aristotelico-Scholastic categories of thought.

This, indeed, marks yet another asset to his humanistic character; a trait so strongly felt in the movement.

=== Myth ''vs.'' Logos ===

Narration in Caxaro, as elsewhere, does not imply shallowness. Nor does it hint at an incapability to express oneself otherwise, namely, in arbitrary (professional) terms. Narration must be considered also as a scientific genre of expression. In fact, it is a traditional technique rich in history where sophistication is purposely ignored, choosing a more fluid, free and inclusive mode of communication.

Caxaro's composition, following the line of [[Plato]]'s own professional preferences, is shrouded in a linguistic and conceptual veil so as to incite us to an active surmise. Its very narrative construction prompts our latent curiosity to probe the hidden meaning under the apparently shallow surface.

As opposed to a technical (“Aristotelico-Scholastic”) form, which is almost always intrinsically rigid and lineated, even if more immediate and direct, Caxaro's philosophy is given under the disguise of a narration which has a reality of its own.

While Caxaro himself synthetically states his concepts, especially as regards the unpleasantness of illusion, he prefers to express himself under “deceptive” clothing. The objective nature of his philosophy is thus skilfully guarded behind a screen through which a mere sensuous perception fails to penetrate.

=== Allegory ''vs.'' Parable ===

Caxaro's narration cannot be taken as a puerile typification of moral or spiritual relations. It is futile to search for strict correspondence between each and every figure he uses and concrete occurrences in life, his or any other. It is on these grounds that the “marriage proposal” interpretation must not be taken seriously, for it despoils Caxaro's composition from its abounding intrinsic qualities.

Correspondences do exist indeed in the ''Cantilena'' between the various symbolisms which Caxaro harmoniously employs. In truth, he does not simply portray an image for the mere artificial imitation of its external form but moreover dwells on the wealthy analogous qualities of the theory of symbols so widely used in the [[Middle Ages]].

At this point it is essential to note that the use of allegory in Caxaro's ''Cantilena'', in accordance with Mediaeval usage, adheres to a subject under the semblance of narrative suggesting similar characteristics. In all probability, Caxaro may not be referring to one single case but to a life-situation in general. The use of an allegory technically functions as a stimulation to further reflection; an openness to the mystery and riddle of life.

=== Truth ''vs.'' Appearance ===
This is an important theme in the ''Cantilena'', maybe carrying the greatest consequence for the whole composition. ''“Fen tumayt insib il gebel sib tafal morchi”'' (“Where I hoped to find rock I found soft clay”, v. 13{19}) gives us the hint.

This may well be the key to the composition's enigma. We have here a juxtaposition of an apparent truth (a pseudo-truth) and the truth itself.

In its most general terms this is a metaphysical problem. It marks human's encounter with a reality which is in itself concealed and garbed with the immediate consciousness and evidence of the sensible. Caxaro eventually contrasts the phenomenal to the noumenical reality, that is, the object of the senses, to which he was attracted in the first place, and the object of the intellect, which he discovered posteriorly. Caxaro's emphasis, however, and this is his proper characteristic in this sphere, is less on the intuitive function of humans and more on experiential undergoing. The senses are the media with which the real is arrived at.

The theme is an echo of Plato's most fundamental problematic. Plato opposes appearance to the truth (reality), to which he identifies life. To the former he identifies existence. Appearance stops at the level of things which are not of any prime importance save as a vehicle of thought. A general superficiality in life at large is a result of constant and persisting shallowness in all aspects of humans’ being. The ability, on the other hand, to go to the heart of things, to the truth of reality, to life itself, would make this appearance ineffective.

=== Metaphysics ===

Caxaro's ontological and epistemological philosophy, together with his psychology, commences with the concrete experience of defeat and impotency (see v. 11{15}). It is not a momentary despondency but rather a state of being. It is the consciousness of humans helplessly succumbing to a reality which overshadows them.

From the reflection of this mode of existence determined by circumstances there arises in Caxaro the humanistic trigger to break out of the humiliating condition (diametrically opposed to the humanizing condition) by a rediscovery of the intrinsic spiritual power within humans themselves. ''“Vargia ibnie”'' (“and build it up again”, v. 11{15}) recalls Petrarca's call for rebirth; a reblooming out of the dust. This marks an essential moment in the rekindled faith and confidence in oneself to overcome helplessness and inertia.

Action now takes the fore (see v. 12{16}). The place of the distorted vision of reality, of the illusory appearance which ruins human living, is to be taken by a fresh renewed conception and introspection. We have here the (spiritual) decision, founded on knowledge, to drastically and decidedly opt for a higher quality of life, namely by the choice of the truth, however troublesome, instead of pseudo-truth (that is, presumed being).

Similarly, being a state of living, this is an option in favour of science, religion, the Church, the State, and the like. Over and above, it is an option in favour of individual personality. All of this is in opposition to pseudo-science, -religion, -Church, -State, and pseudo-personality.

Thus humans are indeed vulnerable and susceptible to the riddle of existence (see vv. 13-14{17-18}). It is their sense of real ascertainment, their capability of applying their judging faculties with right measure (see vv. 15-16{19-20}), that gives them the right sense of direction.

=== Logic ===

No minute examination of Caxaro's logic as presented in vv. 7-10{11-14}. Caxaro's formal logic seems to be characteristic of his times, showing a notable departure from the former scholastic logic.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. I. Thomas, “Interregnum”, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edwards Ed., ''op. cit''., 4, 534f.&lt;/ref&gt; His syllogism is simple. It avoids complicated compounds. It is based on mental associations of necessary and contingent relationships.

The first four propositions seem to form two pairs of conditional statements, called “consequential” by the mediaevalists, with true status for both the “antecedents” and the “consequents”. The remaining four follow from the former propositions and seem to be constructed on the first inferential schemata of traditional logic.

=== Causation ===
Caxaro seems to have in mind notions other than the archaic [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] concepts of cause. The whole of vv. 3-4 recall one of the motive forces which [[Empedocles]] called “Strife”, accounting for the dissolution or decay of the other force, “Love”, which is the principle of generation.

Furthermore, [[Plato]]'s own concept of cause seems to play an additional part. The forms, or formal causes, of things are proposed by Plato to give account for the changes in the world. It seems that Caxaro, especially in v. 3, touches upon this idea.

In general, the mediaeval humanists consistently attempted to avow Aristotle's concepts whenever possible, including those of cause. However, his influence was never completely cancelled. Consequently, they tried to adhere to other theories of causation, especially those, as Caxaro's lines seem to demonstrate, which do not admit of any necessary consequence, if not with further qualifications.

=== Communication ===

The triad at the head of the ''Cantilena'' is part of the general narrative theory of language. It rests on two legs, namely, Caxaro's examined life, a tenet proceeding from [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] up to [[Petrarch]], and further on the transmission of that experience.

This is opposed to the teaching of an otherwise abstract theory, somewhat confirming a superiority of the subject of communication over the object of that communication. A narration of an undergone experience strictly speaking does not rest on the cognitive understanding of the addressee but on his affective capabilities, which to some degree are universal. In other words, it calls for sympathy of sentiments.

Caxaro's narration, in which he takes a clear philosophical position, retracts from being an instruction, whether it moral or dogmatic. The narration qualifies as an announcement of the discovery of an all-important immaterial world, over and above mere semblances.

=== Symbolism ===
In this context one can easily comprehend the nature of the language used by Caxaro: an expressive mode which, in accordance with his general philosophy, is intrinsically unconfined and porous. It is likewise based on a theory of correspondences.

Caxaro does not seem to employ images in an unrelated (or extrinsically related) aloof manner. He does not merely appropriate their external form in some way. Caxaro aptly creates a harmony of nuances amongst the symbols he uses, taking advantage of their mutual agreeability. Moreover, he presents them in an analogous relationship with his world of being through the understanding of that world as an indissoluble unity.

Caxaro's symbols, like those of the Megalithics in Malta and the posteriors [[Eleatics]] in [[Greece]], are neither simple nor artificial. They do not point to the author's identification to the images ''qua'' images. Caxaro's peculiar material expression presupposes a prior cosmic spiritual relationship between all matter.

This is a philosophy very proper to the mediaeval philosophers, especially those of the so-called Platonic school.

Unfortunately, here we must sadly restrain myself from going into each and every symbolic implication of the ''Cantilena''. The qualities of the symbolism of the heart (''calb'', v. 3), the well (''bir'', v. 4), the steps (''…tiragin'' and ''tirag'', vv. 4 and 5 respectively), the water (''bachar'', v. 6), the house (''miramm{a}…'', vv. 7{11}, 10{14} and 11{15}), the foundations (''sisen'', v. 7{11}), the rock (''gebel'', vv. 8{12} and 9{13}), the land (''miken'', vv. 12{16} and 13{17}; ''…rad…'' and ''ard'', vv. 14{18} and 15{19}), and the colours (''bayda'', white; ''seude'', black; ''hamyra'', red, v. 15{19}), are all proportional to other qualities in humans themselves, who are also part of a coherent, interconnected reality.

Each symbol used by Caxaro is given a qualification, thus modifying their absoluteness. At the same time he recognises their contingent being in relation to humans themselves. The heart is qualified with ''“mehandihe chakim soltan ui le mule”'' (“ungoverned, kingless and lordless”, v. 3). The well with ''“imgamic”'' (“bottomless”, v. 4). The steps with ''“mecsule”'' and ''“mizeli”'' (“stop short” and “downfall” respectively, v. 4). The water with ''“il hali”'' (“stormy” or “deep”, v. 6). The house with ''“lili zimen nibni”'' (“I had long been building”, v. 10{14}).

The rest of the symbolisms follow an indirect qualification. The foundations with ''“tafal morchi”'' (“soft clay”, v. 9{13}). The rock with ''“kitatili”'' (“gave way”, v. 8{12}). The land with ''“vintura”'' and ''“sura”'' (“fortune” and “difference”, vv. 13{17} and 14{18} respectively). The colours with ''“ard”'' (“land”) itself (v. 15{19}).

Of course, the qualification are essential as the correspondences themselves, and also as much as the logical associations of vv. 7(11) to 10(12), where symbolism has a major role.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10928">[[Truth]] is most often used to mean being in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]], or fidelity to an original or standard.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; '''Religious views on truth''' vary between [[religion]]s.

==Buddhism==
===The Four Noble Truths===
{{main|Four Noble Truths}}
The Four Noble Truths are the most fundamental [[Buddhist]] teachings and appear countless times throughout the most ancient Buddhist texts, the [[Pali Canon]]. They arose from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s [[bodhi|enlightenment]] and are regarded in Buddhism as deep spiritual insight, ''not as philosophical theory'', with Buddha noting in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]: "These Four Noble Truths, monks, are actual, unerring, not otherwise. Therefore, they are called noble truths."&lt;ref name = "noble1"&gt;''The Collected Discourses of the Buddha: A new translation of the Samyutta Nikaya'', Bhikkhu Bodhi, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four Noble Truths (''Catvāry Āryasatyāni'') are as follows: 
# The truth that suffering exists ([[Dukkha]]).
# The truth that suffering exists with a root cause ([[Tanha|craving]]).
# The truth that suffering can be eliminated ([[Nirvana]]).
# The truth that there is a way to eliminate suffering known as the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

===Two Truths Doctrine===
{{main|Two truths doctrine}}
The two truths doctrine in [[Buddhism]] differentiates between two levels of [[truth]] in Buddhist [[discourse]], a "relative", or commonsense truth (Tibetan: ''kun-rdzob bden-pa''; Sanskrit: ''samvrtisatya''), and an  "ultimate" or absolute spiritual truth  (Tibetan: ''don-dam bden-pa''; Sanskrit: ''paramarthasatya''). Stated differently, the Two Truths Doctrine holds that truth exists in conventional and ultimate forms, and that both forms are co-existent. Other schools, such as [[Dzogchen]], hold that the Two Truths Doctrine are ultimately resolved into nonduality as a lived experience and are non-different.  The doctrine is an especially important element of [[Buddhism]] and was first expressed in complete modern form by [[Nagarjuna]], who based it on the ''[[Kaccāyanagotta Sutta]]''.

==Christianity==
{{see also|John 18:38}}
[[Image:What_is_truth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nikolai Ge]]'s ''What is Truth?'', depicting the [[New Testament]] account of the question as posed by Pilate to Jesus.]]
[[Image:IQueEsLaVerita.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pontius Pilate]]'s "[[John 18:38|What is Truth?]]" - stylized inscription at entrance to [[Antoni Gaudi]]'s [[Sagrada Família]] ([[Barcelona]]).]]
Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] notes that the Bible typically uses the words true or truth in non-philosophical senses to indicate such qualities as fidelity, moral rectitude, and reality. However, it does sometimes use the word in the [[philosophical]] sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Are There Objective Truths about God?|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/are-there-objective-truths-about-god|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe that other authorities are sources of doctrinal truth. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that the [[Papal infallibility|Pope is infallible]] when pronouncing on certain, rather specific, matters of [[Christian Church|church]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Richard F. Costigan, ''The Consensus Of The Church And Papal Infallibility: A Study In The Background Of Vatican I'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian Science]], (not recognised as a Christian organization by the bulk of mainstream churches) Truth is God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth Truth - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The Magisterium of the Church===
{{Main|Sacred tradition}}
The [[magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]] is the church's authority or office to establish teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/magisterium Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ignatius&gt;[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2007/tstorck_magisterium_may07.asp Thomas Stork, "What Is the Magisterium?"]&lt;/ref&gt; That authority is vested uniquely in the [[Pope]] and the bishops, under the premise that they are in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the correct and true teachings of the faith which is shown in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope and to the college of bishops in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with Him" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PN.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 100])&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred scripture and sacred tradition "make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which is entrusted to the Church",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation ''Dei verbum'', 10]&lt;/ref&gt; and the magisterium is not independent of this, since "all that it proposes for belief as being [[Revelation|divinely revealed]] is derived from this single deposit of faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PM.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical inerrancy===
{{Main|Biblical inerrancy|Biblical infallibility|Biblical literalism}}
Biblical inerrancy, as formulated in the "[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]]", is the [[doctrine]] that the [[Protestant Bible]] "is without error or fault in all its teaching";&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, NL. and Roach, B., ''Defending Inerrancy: Affirming the Accuracy of Scripture for a New Generation, Baker Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or, at least, that "Scripture in the original [[Manuscript|manuscripts]] does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact".&lt;ref name="Grudem90"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A.|last=Grudem|authorlink=Wayne Grudem|title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine|publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]]|location=[[Leicester]]|year=1994|page=90|isbn=978-0-85110-652-6|oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various interpretations have been applied, depending on the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.''  Norman L. Geisler, ''Inerrancy'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Davis, ''The debate about the Bible: Inerrancy versus infallibility'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations of the doctrine, ''all'' of the Bible is without error, i.e., is to be taken as true, no matter what the issue. Other interpretations hold that the Bible is always true on important matters of [[faith]], while other interpretations hold that the Bible is true but must be specifically interpreted in the context of the [[language]], [[culture]] and time that relevant passages were written.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'' Marcus J. Borg, ''Reading the Bible Again For the First Time: Taking the Bible Seriously But Not Literally'' (2002) 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
Generally, truthfulness relates to speech: to speak only what one has seen, heard or understood, however the essence of truthfulness is far deeper in [[Hinduism]]: it is defined as upholding the central concept of righteousness.&lt;ref name="hindu1"&gt;Truth Alone Will Triumph, [http://www.akhand-jyoti.org/ArticlesMarApr03/Truth.html Akhand-Jyoti.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Upanishads]] of ancient India, truth is ''Sat'' (pronounced Sah't), the One Reality and Existence, which is directly experienced when the vision is cleared of [[dross]]. The Rishi discovers what exists, ''Sat'', as the truth of one's own Being, the Self or ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]]'', and as the truth of the Being of God, [[Ishvara]]. In this usage, the term truth is used to refer to not merely a derived quality "true rather than false", but the true state of being, truth as what really is there. This is described by Ramana Maharshi: "There is no greater mystery than that we keep seeking reality, though, in fact, we are reality."

==Jainism==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Although, historically, [[Jainism|Jain]] authors have adopted different views on truth, the most prevalent is the system of ''[[anekantavada]]'' or "not-one-sidedness". This idea of truth is rooted in the notion that there is one truth, but only enlightened beings can perceive it in its entirety; unenlightened beings perceive only one side of the truth (''ekanta''). ''Anekantavada'' works around the limitations of a one-sided view of truth by proposing multiple vantage points (''nayas'') from which truth can be viewed (cf. ''[[Anekantavada#Nayavāda|Nayavāda]]''). Recognizing that there are multiple possible truths about any particular thing, even mutually exclusive truths, Jain philosophers developed a system for synthesizing these various claims, known as ''[[syadvada]]''. Within the system of ''syadvada'', each truth is qualified to its particular view-point; that is "in a certain way", one claim or another or both may be true.

==Judaism==
There is no unilateral agreement among the different denominations of Judaism concerning truth. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], truth is the revealed word of God, as found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and to a lesser extent, in the words of the sages of the [[Talmud]]. For [[Hasidic]] Jews truth is also found in the pronouncements of their [[rebbe]], or spiritual leader, who is believed to possess [[divine inspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebbe#Relationship of chasidim to their rebbe|Relationship of chasidim to their rebbe]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kotzk, a Polish Hasidic sect, was known for their obsession with truth.

In [[Conservative Judaism]], truth is not defined as literally as it is among the Orthodox. While Conservative Judaism acknowledges the truth of the [[Tanakh]], generally, it does not accord that status to every single statement or word contained therein, as do the Orthodox. Moreover, unlike Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism believes that the nature of truth can vary from generation to generation, depending on circumstances. For instance, with respect to ''[[halakha]]'', or Jewish law, Conservative Judaism believes that it can be modified or adapted depending on the needs of the people. In Orthodox Judaism, by contrast, the ''halakha'' is fixed (by the sages of the Talmud and later authorities); the present-day task, therefore, is to interpret the ''halakha'', but not to change it.

[[Reform Judaism]] takes a much more liberal approach to truth. It does not hold that truth is found only in the Tanakh; rather, there are kernels of truth to be found in practically every religious tradition. Moreover, its attitude towards the Tanakh is, at best, a document parts of which may have been inspired, but with no particular monopoly on truth, or in any way legally binding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6835">[[Image:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Berkeley]] is credited with the development of subjective idealism.]]
'''Subjective idealism''', or '''empirical idealism''', is the [[Monism|monistic]] metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist. It [[logical consequence|entails]] and is generally identified or associated with [[wikt:immaterialism|immaterialism]], the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], [[neutral monism]], and [[materialism]]; indeed, it is the contrary of [[eliminative materialism]], the doctrine that all or some classes of [[mind|mental]] [[phenomena]] (such as emotions, beliefs, or desires) do not exist, but are sheer [[illusion]]s.

==Overview==
Subjective idealism is a fusion of [[phenomenalism]] or empiricism, which confers special status upon the immediately perceived, with [[idealism]], which confers special status upon the mental. Idealism denies the knowability or existence of the non-mental, while phenomenalism serves to restrict the mental to the empirical. Subjective idealism thus identifies its mental reality with the world of ordinary experience, rather than appealing to the unitary world-spirit of [[pantheism]] or [[absolute idealism]]. This form of idealism is "subjective" not because it denies that there is an objective reality, but because it asserts that this reality is completely dependent upon the minds of the subjects that perceive it.

The earliest thinkers identifiable as subjective idealists were certain members of the [[Yogācāra]] school of Indian Buddhism, who reduced the world of experience to a stream of subjective perceptions. Subjective idealism made its mark in Europe in the 18th-century writings of [[George Berkeley]], who argued that the idea of mind-independent reality is incoherent, concluding that the world consists of the minds of humans and of God. Subsequent writers have continuously grappled with Berkeley's [[skepticism|skeptical]] arguments. [[Immanuel Kant]] responded by rejecting Berkeley's immaterialism and replacing it with [[transcendental idealism]], which views the mind-independent world as existent but incognizable [[noumenon|in itself]]. Since Kant, true immaterialism has remained a rarity, but is survived by partly overlapping movements such as phenomenalism, subjectivism, and [[perspectivism]].

==History==
Thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] anticipated idealism's antimaterialism with their views of the inferior or derivative reality of matter. However, these [[Platonism|Platonists]] did not make Berkeley's turn toward subjectivity. Indeed, Plato rationalistically condemned sense-experience, whereas subjective idealism presupposed [[empiricism]] and the irreducible reality of [[sense data]]. A more subjectivist methodology could be found in the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists']] emphasis on the world of appearance, but their skepticism precluded the drawing of any [[ontology|ontological]] conclusions from the epistemic primacy of phenomena.

The first mature articulations of idealism arise in [[Yogacara|Yogacarin]] thinkers such as the 7th-century epistemologist [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]], who identified ultimate reality with sense-perception. The most famous proponent of subjective idealism in the Western world was the 18th-century [[Ireland|Irish]] philosopher [[George Berkeley]], although Berkeley's term for his theory was ''immaterialism''. From the point of view of subjective idealism, the material world does not exist, and the phenomenal world is dependent on humans. Hence the fundamental idea of this philosophical system (as represented by Berkeley or [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]) is that things are complexes of ideas or sensations, and only subjects and objects of perceptions exist. Berkeley summarized his theory with the motto "''esse est percipi''" ("To be is to be perceived"), but went on to elaborate it with God as the source of [[consensus reality]] and other particulars.

According to Berkeley, an object has real being as long as it is perceived by a mind. God, being omniscient perceives everything perceivable, thus all real beings exist in the mind of God. However, it is also evident that each of us has free will and understanding upon self-reflection, and our senses and ideas suggest that other people also possess these qualities as well. According to Berkeley there is no material universe, in fact he has absolutely no idea what that could possibly mean. To theorize about a universe that is composed of insensible matter is not a sensible thing to do. This matters because there is absolutely no positive account for a material universe, only speculation about things that are by fiat outside of our minds.

Berkeley's assessment of immaterialism was criticized by [[Samuel Johnson]], as recorded by [[James Boswell]].  Responding to the theory, Dr. Johnson exclaimed "I refute it ''thus''!" while kicking a rock with "mighty force".  This episode is alluded to by Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', chapter three. Reflecting on the "ineluctable modality of the visible", Dedalus conjures the image of Johnson's refutation and carries it forth in conjunction with Aristotle's expositions on the nature of the senses as described in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]''.  Aristotle held that while visual perception suffered a compromised authenticity because it passed through the diaphanous liquid of the inner eye before being observed, sound and the experience of hearing were not thus similarly diluted. Dedalus experiments with the concept in the development of his aesthetic ideal.

==In fiction==
{{see also|Solipsism}}

Subjective idealism is featured prominently in the Norwegian novel ''[[Sophie's World]]'', in which "Sophie's world" exists in fact only in the pages of a book.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- needs reliable source that what is presented in that book is actually subjective idealism --&gt;

A parable of subjective idealism can be found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' short story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', which specifically mentions Berkeley.

==Early Life and Education==

'''Swami Purnachaitanya''' was born as '''Freek Alexander Luthra''' on 26 October 1984, in [[Leiden]] town in the [[Netherlands]].

Born to Sonia Luthra and Bart Pieter van den Roovaart, he was named Freek (short form for [[Frederick (given name)|Frederick]], which means "Peaceful Ruler") and [[Alexander]] (which means "Defender of the People"). They always instinctively felt that he would live a life dedicated to serving others in a peaceful manner.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

When he was 5 years old, his family moved to [[Haarlem]], another town in the [[Netherlands]], where he spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swami Purnachaitanya Ji |url=https://vaidicpujas.org/swamijis/swamipurnachaitanya/ |website=Vaidic Pujas |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purnachaitanya’s parents were introduced to meditation and spiritual teachings through the programs of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and decided to raise both- Alexander and his younger brother Sebastian as [[vegetarians]] and introduced them to meditation at an early age.

During his childhood, Purnachaitanya showed a keen interest in traditions of the East, leading him to learn and practice various eastern martial arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The travelling swami who leaped from martial arts to the art of living |url=http://creativeindiamag.com/countries/netherlands/the-travelling-swami-who-leaped-from-martial-arts-to-the-art-of-living/ |publisher=Creative India Bharat &amp; Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Aikido]], [[Taekwondo]], [[Judo]], Ninpo Bujutsu and [[Chinese martial arts|Wushu]] (Kungfu). He visited his maternal home in India at the age of 6 years and the cultural diversity left a lasting impression and curiosity in his mind.

==Spiritual Journey==

When he was 16, Purnachaitanya met his spiritual [[Guru]] - [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]], for the first time in 2000, in a public program in Amsterdam. In this meeting, he felt an instant connection with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar- that of him being the spiritual Master he had been waiting for. After this meeting, Purnachaitanya started attending Art of Living programs regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swami Purnachaitanya Ji |url=https://vaidicpujas.org/swamijis/swamipurnachaitanya/ |website=Vaidic Pujas |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after completing his high school studies, he took a year off to work and travel to India for 3 months, where his interest towards the Indian traditions, and especially the Vedic traditions and practices deepened. He then went on to study [[Indology]] ([[Languages]] and [[Cultures]] of [[India]] and [[Tibet]]) at [[Leiden University]], with a specialization in [[Sanskrit]], along with a course in [[Journalism]] and [[New Media]].

After graduation, in 2007, he went to India, where he joined the International Headquarters of the [[Art of Living Foundation]] in [[Bangalore]], as a full-time volunteer. He managed various departments in the [[Ashram]], and also started his Vedic studies in the Veda Agama Pathashala (Vedic studies school) in the Ashram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where he finds his calling |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/where-he-finds-his-calling/article2515176.ece |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Harshini Vakkalanka |publisher=The Hindu |date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching, Social Service and Welfare Initiatives ==

Purnachaitanya became a teacher for various self-development and yoga and meditation programs of the Art of Living in 2008. He is a QCI Certified Level-2 Yoga Teacher and Regional Director of Sri Sri Yoga in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Team |url=https://srisrischoolofyoga.org/in/about-us/our-team/ |website=Sri Sri School of Yoga |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 he started traveling and conducting various programs and service initiatives in [[South India]], mainly in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 2011 his area of work and focus shifted to the [[Northeast India]], where he has traveled and worked extensively in [[Assam]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]], [[Nagaland]], [[Sikkim]], and parts of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Calming the mind Dutchman Swami Purnachaitanya, of the Art of Living foundation, talks about his experiences |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/dec/17/calming-the-mind-1729906.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Shevlin Sebastian |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Traveller; or, a Prospect of Society''''' (1764) is a philosophical poem by [[Oliver Goldsmith]].  In [[heroic verse]] of an [[Augustan poetry|Augustan]] style it discusses the causes of happiness and unhappiness in nations.  It was the work which first made Goldsmith’s name, and is still considered a classic of mid-18th century poetry.

== Synopsis ==

The dedication to ''The Traveller'' sets out Goldsmith's purpose:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have attempted to show, that there may be equal happiness in states, that are differently governed from our own; that every state has a particular principle of happiness, and that this principle in each may be carried to a mischievous excess.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He begins the poem by extolling the happiness of his brother Henry's simple family life.  Then, from a vantage-point in the [[Alps]], he surveys the condition of the world.  Every nation, he says, considers itself the happiest, but this is only because each nation judges by its own standards.  In fact, happiness is probably equally spread, though in different forms which tend to be mutually exclusive.
&lt;blockquote&gt;From Art more various are the blessings sent;&lt;br/&gt;Wealth, commerce, honour, liberty, content.&lt;br/&gt;Yet these each other's power so strong contest,&lt;br/&gt;That either seems destructive of the rest.&lt;br/&gt;Where wealth and freedom reign, contentment fails,&lt;br/&gt;And honour sinks where commerce long prevails.&lt;ref&gt;Line 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then Goldsmith turns to consider various countries individually.  [[Italy]] is naturally fertile and was formerly successful in commerce, but has since been overtaken by other countries.  The remaining great works of art and architecture only inspire a childish love of show in the Italians.  [[Swiss people|The Swiss]] have poverty, but also equality.  They love home-life and simple things, but have no nobility of soul.  [[France]] is a nation motivated by honour, and is therefore too prone to vanity.  In [[Netherlands|Holland]] industry has brought prosperity, but
&lt;blockquote&gt;E'en liberty itself is barter'd here.&lt;br/&gt;At gold's superior charms all freedom flies,&lt;br /&gt;The needy sell it, and the rich man buys.&lt;ref&gt;Line 306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Britain's free constitution has led to a lack of social cohesion, the rich defending their own liberties by oppressing the poor.  Those who have escaped this problem by fleeing across the Atlantic have found a harsh and dangerous land in America.  The poem concludes with the thought that happiness lies within:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How small, of all that human hearts endure,&lt;br/&gt;That part which laws or kings can cause or cure.&lt;br/&gt;Still to ourselves in every place consign'd,&lt;br/&gt;Our own felicity we make or find.&lt;ref&gt;Line 429&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Composition ==

Goldsmith began writing ''The Traveller'' in 1755 while he was travelling in [[Switzerland]].  His travels in Europe in that and the following year gave him much material to draw on, but he seems to have let the poem drop.  He resumed it in 1763, by which time he was living at Canonbury House in [[Islington]], and completed it in 1764.  Most of the last few lines of the poem was contributed by Goldsmith's friend [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson]].{{sfn|Sells|1974|pp=288–289}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Dinah |editor1-last=Birch |editor1-link=Dinah Birch |editor2-first=Katy |editor2-last=Hooper |title=The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tc_YWBwCuyYC&amp;pg=PA725&amp;lpg=PA725&amp;dq=%22recalled+from+Goldsmith%27s+own+continental+tour%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tgCnxzZO1q&amp;sig=j-bHszq6vXd_18TTeoulpRTQRR8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mjg_Uu_BGufJ0wWUrYD4Ag&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22recalled%20from%20Goldsmith%27s%20own%20continental%20tour%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 September 2013 |edition=4th |year=2012 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199608218 |page=725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldsmith chose not to dedicate ''The Traveller'' to some powerful or wealthy patron, as was the normal practice of the time, but to his brother Henry, the ill-paid curate of an Irish parish.{{sfn|Dussinger|2004–2013}}

== Publication ==

''The Traveller'' was first published on 19 December 1764 by [[John Newbery]], though the year was given on the imprint as 1765.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Masson |editor1-link=David Masson |title=The Miscellaneous Works of Oliver Goldsmith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4D4CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR37&amp;dq=%22one+shilling+and+sixpence+with+this+title%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yPE1Up3BEcyU7Qa6gIH4DA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22one%20shilling%20and%20sixpence%20with%20this%20title%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 September 2013 |year=1869 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=xxxvii }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Prior|1837|p=25}}  It was the first of Goldsmith's books to feature his name on the title-page.{{sfn|Ford|1977|p=380}}  Goldsmith received only £21 for ''The Traveller'', but the publisher must have made a good deal more, since a second edition appeared in March 1765, a fourth in August 1765 (only eight months after the first), and a ninth before Goldsmith's death in 1774.  The author continued to revise the poem for the rest of his life, so that the ninth edition contained 36 new lines not in the first.{{sfn|Prior|1837|pp=42–46, 56–58}}

The style of ''The Traveller'' stands in the tradition of verse in [[heroic couplet]]s that had dominated English poetry for the previous hundred years.  In particular, it owes a debt to [[John Dryden|Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], to whose poems it has often been favourably compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Walter |editor1-last=M'Leod |title=Goldsmith's Traveller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8ITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22heroic+verse%22+%22the+traveller%22+goldsmith&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xo1BUqvXE-rE7Abcn4CgBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heroic%20verse%22%20%22the%20traveller%22%20goldsmith&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 September 2013 |year=1865 |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |location=London |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ross|1971|p=217}}{{sfn|Bohn|1845|p=70}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aikin |first1=J. |authorlink1=John Aikin |title=Letters to a Young Lady on a Course of English Poetry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkoJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22the+traveller%22+goldsmith+dryden+pope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yOU-UqjIMKmJ0AXBPA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20traveller%22%20goldsmith%20dryden%20pope&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 September 2013 |year=1807 |publisher=J.

From an early date much attention has been paid to Goldsmith’s sources for the plan and subject-matter of the poem.  Many who knew Goldsmith personally, having no great opinion of his abilities, believed that ''The Traveller'' owed much to the conversation of Dr. Johnson, as may well be the case, or even that Johnson had written a substantial part of it for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irving |first1=Washington |authorlink1=Washington Irving |title=Works.

== Critical reception ==

''The Traveller'' was the poem which made Goldsmith's reputation.{{sfn|Ford|1977|p=380}}{{sfn|Dussinger|2004–2013}}  Dr. Johnson, so [[James Boswell|Boswell]] reports, said that "there had not been so fine a poem since Pope's time", and he went on to write a brief but laudatory article on it in the ''[[The Critical Review|Critical Review]]''.{{sfn|Forster|1855|p=210}}{{sfn|Prior|1837|p=34}}  Two months after publication the ''St. James's Chronicle'' praised "the beauties of this poem" as "great and various",{{sfn|Forster|1855|pp=213–214}} and this opinion was seconded by the ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine|Gentleman's Magazine]]'' and in large measure by the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', though the ''Monthly''’s reviewer also took Goldsmith to task for his [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] suspicion of commerce.{{sfn|Prior|1837|p=35}}{{sfn|Dussinger|2004–2013}}  Readers of all ages soon began to discover ''The Traveller''’s merits.  The 17-year-old [[Charles James Fox]] admired the poem; a few years later the even younger [[William Wordsworth]] read ''The Traveller'', and was influenced by it when he wrote his earliest surviving poem, "Lines Written as a School Exercise".{{sfn|Forster|1855|p=213}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Duncan |authorlink1=Duncan Wu |title=Wordsworth's Reading 1770–1799 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6_Ou68RnNQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 September 2013 |year=1994 |origyear=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge  |isbn=0521416000 |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poem's critical reception continued high, though it often suffered by comparison with his ''The Deserted Village''.  The bibliographer [[Samuel Egerton Brydges|Egerton Brydges]] preferred ''The Traveller'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sentiments are always interesting, generally just, and often new; the imagery is elegant, picturesque, and occasionally sublime; the language is nervous, highly finished, and full of harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allibone |first1=S. Austin |authorlink1=Samuel Austin Allibone |title=A Critical Dictionary of English Literature. Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmILAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA695&amp;dq=%22The+sentiments+are+always+interesting,+generally+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q-8-Uri8B4bR0QXL64HIBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20sentiments%20are%20always%20interesting%2C%20generally%20%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 September 2013 |year=1858 |publisher=Childs &amp; Peterson |location=Philadelphia |page=695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But many followed the poets [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] in rating ''The Deserted Village'' higher.  Campbell said ''The Traveller''’s field of contemplation was rather desultory, while Hunt complained that some feeble lines gave it the air of having been [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Walter |title=Biographical Memoirs of Eminent Novelists, and Other Distinguished Persons.

Volume 3 |year=1834 |publisher=Robert Cadell |location=Edinburgh |page=249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rousseau|1974|p=315}}  The publisher [[Henry George Bohn|Henry Bohn]] claimed that ''The Traveller'' "combines the highest beauties of ethic and descriptive poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Henry G. |editor1-last=Bohn |title=The Works of Oliver Goldsmith, with a Life and Notes. Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6igvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22short+of+his+master+it+must+be+admitted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7Ug_UsCBJKeH0AX-pID4Ag&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22short%20of%20his%20master%20it%20must%20be%20admitted%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 September 2013 |year=1845 |publisher=Henry G. Bohn |location=London |page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]]'s opinion was that
&lt;blockquote&gt;In general [Goldsmith's] designs were bad, and his execution good.  In ''The Traveller'', the execution, though deserving of much praise, is far inferior to the design.  No philosophical poem, ancient or modern, has a plan so noble, and at the same time so simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Edmund |editor1-last=Fuller |editor1-link=Edmund Fuller |title=The Great English and American Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nezXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22designs+were+bad,+and+his+execution%22&amp;dq=%22designs+were+bad,+and+his+execution%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C_M-UpqICMiY0QXV14CwAw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAzgK |accessdate=27 September 2013 |year=1964 |publisher=Avon |location=New York |page=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The novelist [[William Black (novelist)|William Black]], on the other hand, while highly praising the poem's mellifluous qualities, admitted that "the literary charm of ''The Traveller'' is more apparent than the value of any doctrine, however profound or ingenious, which the poem was supposed to inculcate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Oliver |title=The Vicar of Wakefield, The Traveller, The Deserted Village |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ur5EAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22more+apparent+than+the+value+of+any%22&amp;dq=%22more+apparent+than+the+value+of+any%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5_M-UuP9KIXG0QXF74HwAg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg |accessdate=27 September 2013 |year=1905 |publisher=[[A. L. Burt]] |location=New York |page=61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent academic criticism continues to assert the poem's claims to respectful attention.  Arthur Humphreys considered it "a true and thoughtful poem";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Humphreys |first1=A. L. |editor1-first=Boris |editor1-last=Ford |title=From Dryden to Johnson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CAseAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22true+and+thoughtful+poem%22&amp;dq=%22true+and+thoughtful+poem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-F5FUuTaDMOx0AWmkYCABA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=27 September 2013 |series=The Pelican Guide to English Literature, Volume 4 |year=1977 |origyear=1957 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth |page=87 |chapter=The Literary Scene }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Ford]] noted "the judicious tone, the unruffled movement, the urbane and fluent control of the couplet", which "established him as a great Augustan poet";{{sfn|Ford|1977|p=380}} and Angus Ross thought that ''The Traveller'' proved him a poet with an individual voice, citing particularly its "genuine and deep note of feeling".{{sfn|Ross|1971|p=217}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2232">'''Yangmingism''', known in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as ''Yángmíngxué'' (陽明學) and in Japanese as ''Yōmeigaku''&lt;ref name="craig2"&gt;{{citation |last=Craig|first=Edward |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 7 |year=1998 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-07310-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (陽明学), is one of the major philosophical schools of [[Neo-Confucianism]], based on the ideas of the Neo-Confucian philosopher [[Wang Yangming]]. Yangmingism developed as the main intellectual opposition to the [[Cheng-Zhu school]] of [[Neo-Confucianism]].&lt;ref name="mote1"&gt;{{citation |last=Mote|first=Frederick W. |title=Imperial China 900-1800  |year=2003 |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01212-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is considered part of the [[School of Mind]], established by [[Lu Jiuyuan]]. Yangmingism emphasizes that, one can get the supreme principle (理) from his/her heart, without seeking outside. Futhermore, Yangmingism posits a oneness of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and knowledge in relation to one's concepts of morality. In essence, this is the idea that one's conceptualization of good and evil are irrelevant if one does not, in reality, act in accordance with that conceptualization: "to know and not to act is not to know". Naturally, this extended to the political sphere, and, through incorporation into [[Mitogaku]] thought, a violent form of Yangmingism became an influence on the incipient [[Sonno-joi|anti-foreigner]] movement in 19th century Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ravina |first1=Mark |title=The Last Samurai : The Life and Battles of Saigō Takamori |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471705376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, Japanese author and nationalist [[Yukio Mishima]] examined Yangmingism as an integral part of the ideologies behind the [[Meiji Restoration]] as well as further samurai resistance, in particular the [[Shinpūren rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mishima |first1=Yukio |title=Kōdōgaku Nyūmon |date=1970 |publisher=Bungei Shunjū}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yi I''' ({{korean|hangul=이이|hanja=李珥}}, December 26, 1536 – February 27, 1584) was one of the two most prominent [[Korea]]n [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], the other being his older contemporary, [[Yi Hwang]] (Toegye).&lt;ref&gt;Daehwan, Noh.

Winter 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yi I is often referred to by his [[pen name]] '''Yulgok''' ("[[Chestnut]] valley"). He is not only known as a scholar but also as a revered politician and reformer.&lt;ref name="yi i doosan"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=127580 Yi I] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was academical successor of [[Jo Gwang-jo]].

== Life ==
Master Yi I was born in [[Gangneung]], [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]] in 1537. His father was a Fourth State Councillor (''jwachanseong'' 좌찬성) and his mother, [[Shin Saimdang]], the accomplished artist and [[calligraphy|calligraphist]]. He was the grand nephew of [[Yi Gi]], [[prime minister]] 1549 to 1551.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} early years he was learn of [[Baik In-geol]], successor of [[Jo Gwang-jo]]. late years, It is said that by the age of seven he had finished his lessons in the [[Confucian]] classics, and passed the Civil Service literary examination at the age of 13. Yi I secluded himself in [[Kumgang-san]] following his mother's death when he was 16 and stayed for 3 years, studying [[Buddhism]]. He left the mountains at 20 and devoted himself to the study of [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref name="yi i aks"&gt;{{ko}} [http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_6JOa_A1536_1_0010341&amp;isEQ=true&amp;kristalSearchArea=true Yi I] at The Academy of Korean Studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yi i ekc"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=251870&amp;v=44] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610014537/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=251870&amp;v=44 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

He married at 22 and a half, went to visit [[Yi Hwang]] at [[Dosan Seowon|Dosan]] the following year. He passed special exams with top honors with a winning thesis titled ''Cheondochaek'' (hangul:천도책, hanja: 天道策, "Book on the Way of Heaven"), which was widely regarded as a literary masterpiece, displaying his knowledge of history and the Confucian [[philosophy]] of politics, and also reflecting his profound knowledge of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Eunjik(이은직) translated by Jeong Hongjun(정홍준), ''Great Joseon Masters'' Vol.2 (조선명인전 2) p35, Ilbit Publishing, Seoul, 2005. {{ISBN|89-5645-087-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continuously received top honors on civil exams for a consecutive 9 times. His father died when he was 26.&lt;ref name="yi i doosan"/&gt; He served in various positions in government from the age of 29, and visited the [[Ming Dynasty]] as ''seojanggwan'' (hangul: 서장관, hanja: 書狀官, document officer) in 1568. He also participated in the writing of the ''[[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]] Annals'' and at 34, authored ''Dongho Mundap'', an eleven-article political memorial devoted to clarifying his conviction that a righteous government could be achieved.&lt;ref name="Dongho Mundap"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=50749 Dongho Mundap] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his vast experience in different offices over the years, Yi I was able to garner a wide vision of politics and with the deep trust of the king, became one of the central figures of politics by the time he was 40. His many documents and theses were presented to the royal court but when political conflicts escalated in 1576, his efforts proved fruitless and he returned home. Following his return, he devoted his time to studies and education of his disciples and authored several books.&lt;ref name="yi i doosan"/&gt;

He returned to office at 45 and while holding various minister positions, produced many writings which recorded crucial political events and showed his efforts to ease the political conflicts that were rampant at that time. However, [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] was noncommittal in his attitude and it became difficult for Yi I to remain in a neutral position in the conflicts. He left office in 1583 and died the following year.&lt;ref name="yi i doosan"/&gt;

According to legend, he had a pavilion built near the ford of the [[Imjin River]] in his lifetime and instructed his heirs to set it ablaze when the king had to flee northward from Seoul, to provide a guiding beacon. This took place during Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea at the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)|Imjin war]].&lt;ref&gt;Choi Beomseo (최범서), ''Unofficial History of Joseon Vol. 2'' p52, Garam Publishing, Seoul, 2003.  {{ISBN|89-8435-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
Master Yi I was not only known as a philosopher but also as a social reformer. He did not completely agree with the dualistic [[Neo-Confucianism]] teachings followed by [[Yi Hwang]]. His school of [[Neo-Confucianism]] placed emphasis on the more concrete, material elements; rather than inner spiritual perception, this practical and pragmatic approach valued external experience and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee, Park Sung-soo, Yoon Nae-hyun, translated by The Academy of Korean Studies, ''New History of Korea'' p393, Jimoondang, Paju, 2005. {{ISBN|89-88095-85-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Yi Hwang]], who suffered through tumultuous times and did not enjoy being in politics, Yi I was an active official who thought it important to implement Confucian values and principles to government administration. He emphasized sage learning and self-cultivation as the base of proper administration.&lt;ref name="yi i aks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yi i ekc"/&gt;

Yi I is also well known for his foresight about [[national security]]. He proposed to draft and reinforce the army against a possible Japanese attack. His proposal was rejected by the central government, his worry was found to be well-founded soon after his death, during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin war]].&lt;ref name="yi i ekc"/&gt;

==Selected works==
Yi I's published writings encompass 193 works in 276 publications in 6 languages and 2,236 library holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm|title=WorldCat Identities|website=www.oclc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuriy Drohobych''' or '''Yuriy Kotermak''', ({{lang-la|Magister Georgius Drohobich de Russia}}, {{lang-ua|Юрій Дрогобич}}, {{lang-pl |Jerzy Drohobycz, Jerzy Kotermak Drusianus, Georgius Drohobicz}}, by birthname '''Yuriy Kotermak''', '''Giorgio da Leopoli''') (1450 in [[Drohobych]] - 4 February 1494 in [[Kraków]]) was a [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] philosopher, astrologist, writer, medical doctor, rector of the [[University of Bologna]], professor of [[Kraków Academy]], first publisher of a [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] printed text. He is the author of  '''''Iudicium Pronosticon Anni 1483 Currentis'''''.&lt;ref name="litopys"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://litopys.org.ua/human/hum47.htm | title=Iudicium Pronosticon Anni 1483 Currentis | accessdate=4 August 2014 | author=Magistri Georgii Drohobich de Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Yuriy Drohobych was born in the city of [[Drohobych]] in [[Red Ruthenia]], or ''Ruthenia Rubra'' (modern day [[West Ukraine]]), to a family of a salt maker. He received his primary education in the local parochial school and after that he studied at a lyceum in [[Lviv]] ({{lang-pl|Lwów}}), or Leopolis, in [[Ukraine]] (then [[Ruthenian Voivodeship|Palatinatus Russiae]] of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]]).

==Education==
[[File:Stamp of Ukraine s343.jpg|thumb|right|400px|'''Yuriy Drohobych''']]
In 1468 Yuriy Drohobych entered  the [[Jagiellonian University]] (Uniwersytet Jagielloński) in [[Krakow]]. Two years later he received his bachelor's degree and in 1473 his master's. He taught during the summer months and participated in scientific discussions on Saturdays and Sundays. After he gained some significant achievements in Krakow, Drohobych traveled to [[Bologna University]], where natural sciences and medicine were gaining popularity. Here he improved his Latin, learned Greek, and continued his studies of [[natural philosophy]]. He paid special attention to his studies in astronomy. It's worth noting that Drohobych's astronomy professor was [[Girolamo Manfredi]], one of the most renowned astronomers in 15th century Italy. Manfredi introduced his promising student to German astronomer Johannes Müller ([[Regiomontanus]]) who believed in [[heliocentrism]]; however, it had not been mathematically proven at that time.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Українська педагогіка в персоналіях – ХІХ століття / За редакцією О.В. Сухомлинської / навчальний посібник для студентів вищих навчальних закладів, у двох книгах// «Либідь», - К., 2005, кн. 1., стор.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

==Teaching==

In 1478 Drohobych received his doctorate in philosophy, but he continued his studies. This time he took up medicine. At that time [[natural philosophy]] disciplines were closely connected. Almost all contemporary philosophers demonstrated equally strong prowess in astronomy and medicine, which allowed university professors to transfer from one department to another. Similar methods were used in teaching both disciplines. It was done through reading and interpretation of Latin translations of Greek and Arab classical authors. Medicine was considered the key to understanding nature. Shortly after Drohobych completed his medical studies, he was offered a position to teach astronomy at Bologna University. 
At the beginning of 1481, the student body of the University elected Drohobych to become the rector of the school of Medicine and Free Arts.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;{{rp|34}} He was only thirty at the time. For a year, which was the regular term in office for an elected rector, he combined his academic responsibilities, which included teaching astronomy and medical research, with administrative obligations. He had  civil and legal authority over the students and faculty who were under his supervision. In 1482 he received his PhD in medicine.

In 1486 Drohobych returned to Krakow. He started his medical practice and also taught medicine at Krakow University. Similar to his peers from Bologna, he based his lectures on the works of [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]]. A few years later, he received his professorship in medicine and became the doctor of the [[Poland|Polish]] king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]. In 1492 he became the Dean of the Department of Medicine. It was customary at that time for professors to have off-site meetings to discuss with students issues that  did not fit the official scientific doctrine. [[Copernicus]] attended Drohobych's meetings, however it is not certain whether the former had an influence on the latter.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

It's worth noting that at that time ‘medicine' as we understand the term today was viewed differently in the 15th century. In fact, there were two terms designated to define healing practices.  The term ‘[[medicine]]' derived from the Latin verb medico, meaning "to drug". The practice of medicine therefore emphasized an ability to administer curative remedies.&lt;ref name="Lindberg"&gt;David Lindberg, Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, Cambridge University Press 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|398}} Such remedies might be the potions of quacks ([[quackery]]), developed only to make the seller a profit, or therapies that were invented or revised on the basis of experiences of a particular practitioner with patients and remedies. What was crucial to good medical practice was what we call nowadays "clinical experience": an experienced judgment about what remedies would help a particular patient. A medical education in universities, therefore, might supplement, but was not always necessary for "medical" practice. Hence, practitioners of medicine without university degrees were called "empirics" by the educated physicians. For their part, physicians themselves practiced another kind of healing art, "physic". The term derived from the Greek noun [[physis]], meaning "nature". Physicians had to study natural philosophy because the purposes of physic were to preserve health and prolong life; healing the sick was an important part, but only one of the many parts, of physic. The physician had to be able to offer advice to the healthy as well as to the sick about how to live according to nature, for being in harmony with nature would result in the preservation of health as well as the prolongation of life. Thus "medicine" and "physic," as used in the late 15th century, are terms that suggest the differences between major traditions in the healing arts: one based upon experience, the other upon learning; one concerned primarily with healing, the other primarily with the preservation of health.&lt;ref name="Lindberg"/&gt;{{rp|399}} Drohobych's appointment to King Casimir's court is an indication that he succeeded in both healing fields, because such an important position required extraordinary knowledge of philosophy and natural philosophy as well as practical experience in curing illnesses.

==Publications==
His teaching at Bologna did not interfere with his experiments in astronomy. In a letter which he sent in early 1478 to his friend Mykola Chepel in [[Poznań]], Drohobych mentioned his calculations of planetary positions during a year. According to his observations and calculations, he estimated the exact time for two [[lunar eclipses]]; he also included a chart of the [[phases of the Moon]] for a year. In the letter, Drohobych described how he had calculated the geographic locations of major cities in what is now Poland and Ukraine. He also gave predictions concerning political events that had been taking place in Europe, Egypt, Turkey, Arabia, and India. Mykola Chepel shared these notes with his colleagues at Poznań University. The news about Drohobych's findings quickly spread among many learned people in Europe. One of the first German Humanists and book collector, [[Hartmann Schedel]], copied these letters. In part thanks to his efforts, they were preserved for posterity.

Drohobych wrote a [[treatise]] about the solar eclipse that took place on July 29, 1478. He suggested that cosmic events of this nature may or may not have favorable  effects on events on  Earth  but they certainly would not cause catastrophes.  In the early 1480s, Italy was at the forefront of book printing.  Initially all publications were of a religious nature, however books about astronomy, botany, and geography had been growing in popularity, too.  In 1483 Drohobych  published in  Rome his first book in Latin  "''Prognostic Estimation of the year 1483''" (Iudicium Pronosticon Anni MCCCCLXXXIII Currentis).&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;{{rp|36}} It was a nineteen-page publication of astrological ([[zodiac]]) calendars, which were popular at that time, that helped its readers to make predictions about events on Earth depending on the planets' positions. This publication had several noteworthy elements: Drohobych gave accurate predictions for two lunar eclipses; he provided accurate calculations of the phases of the Moon; and he also  touched upon the subject of planetary movement. Furthermore, he indicated that the geographic coordinates were an important factor in determining the sun's and planets' positions. Depending on the geographic location of the observer, the positions of cosmic objects would vary. His longitude calculations were not error-free, however. He deserves  credit for being the first Eastern European scholar who in a printed publication indicated the exact geographic coordinates of several Ukrainian, Polish, and Lithuanian cities.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

Weather forecasting was another aspect of Drohobych's publication. He suggested that by observing atmospheric phenomena, one can predict the weather. He also argued that climatic conditions depended on the latitude of a geographic location. One of the most important aspects of this treatise was the author's vision that the world is not an abstract notion and that humans are capable of learning its patterns and laws. In the foreword to the treatise, Drohobych wrote that even though our eyes cannot see the end of the boundless skies, our mind can. That we learn from the effect about the cause and from the latter we truly learn.&lt;ref&gt;Довідник з історії України. За ред. І.Підкови та Р.Шуста. — К.: Генеза, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1491 Drohobych, published one of the first books in [[Church Slavonic]] language "''Осьмогласник''", ("[[Octoechos]] "or "Antiphonal")  and the first books in Ukrainian "''Часословець''" ("[[Horologion]]" or "Book of Hour"),  "''Тріодь пісна''" and " ''Тріодь цвітна''" ([[Triodion]]). All these publications built the foundation for the further development of the Ukrainian cultural identity.

Yuriy Drohobych died on February 4, 1494 in Krakow, at only 44. However, he left behind a rich legacy. During his tenure on the faculty of Krakow University, humanistic ideas began to gain popularity among professors and students.&lt;ref&gt;Orest Subtelny, Ukraine: A History, University of Toronto Press 1988, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Drohobych was the first Ukrainian scholar who began to advance these ideas in Ukraine. As time went on, he found many followers among Ukrainian scholars and students who studied in Italy and Poland and who disseminated these ideas upon their return to their homeland. In the mid-15th century, due to the lack of internal and external stimuli, Ukraine's education system slipped into decay. Drohobych and his followers created a niche that helped to preserve, sustain, and develop socio-cultural and philosophical ideas that lay the foundation for Ukraine's revival by the 17th and 18th centuries, which played an important role in preserving the national identity at a time when  present-day Ukrainian lands belong to different rulers.

'''Émile Benveniste''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛ̃venist|lang}}; 27 May 1902 – 3 October 1976) was a [[France|French]] [[Structuralism|structural]] [[linguistics|linguist]] and [[semiotics|semiotician]]. He is best known for his work on [[Indo-European languages]] and his critical reformulation of the linguistic [[paradigm]] established by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].

==Biography==
Benveniste was born in [[Aleppo]], [[Aleppo Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Syria]] to a Sephardi family. His father sent him to Marseilles to undertake rabbinical studies, but his exceptional abilities were noted by [[Sylvain Lévi]] who introduced him to [[Antoine Meillet]].

Initially studying under Meillet, a former student of Saussure, at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], he began teaching at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] and was elected to the [[Collège de France]] a decade later in 1937 as professor of linguistics. By this time he had already begun his investigation into the status of names within the history of Indo-European linguistic forms. He held his seat at the Collège de France until 1969 when he retired due to deteriorating health, after he suffered a [[Hemiparesis|stroke]] that left him [[aphasia|aphasic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvert Watkins]], 'L'Apport d'Emile Benveniste à la grammaire comparée,' in [https://books.google.it/books?id=mTXCjaIIGeAC&amp;pg=PA3  ''E. Benveniste aujourd'hui,''] Actes du Colloque International du C.N.R.S. Université François Rabelais Tours, 28 - 30 septembre 1983 Vol. 2 Peeters Publishers, 1984 pp.3-11 p.3-&lt;/ref&gt; However, he served as the first President of the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]] from 1969 to 1972.

Benveniste died in [[Paris]], aged 74.

==Career==
At the start of his career, his highly specialised and technical work limited his influence to a small circle of scholars. In the late thirties, he aroused some controversy for challenging the influential Saussurian notion of the [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]], that posited a [[Signified and signifier| binary distinction]] between the phonic shape of any given word (''signifier'') and the idea associated with it (''signified''). Saussure argued that the relationship between the two was psychological, and purely arbitrary. Benveniste challenged this model in his ''Nature du signe linguistique''.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Benveniste, 'Nature du signe linguistique,' in ''Acta linguistica'' 1939, 1 pp.23–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of his monumental text, ''Problèmes de linguistique générale'' or ''Problems in General Linguistics'', would elevate his position to much wider recognition.  The two volumes of this work appeared in 1966 and 1974 respectively.  The book exhibits not only scientific rigour but also a lucid style accessible to the layman, consisting of various writings culled from a period of more than twenty-five years.  In Chapter 5, ''Animal Communication and Human Language'', Benveniste repudiated behaviourist linguistic interpretations by demonstrating that human speech, unlike the so-called languages of bees and other animals, cannot be merely reduced to a stimulus-response system.

The I–you polarity is another important development explored in the text.  The third person acts under the conditions of possibility of this polarity between the first and second persons.  Narration and description illustrate this.

:"''I'' signifies "the person who is uttering the present instance of the discourse containing ''I''."  This instance is unique by definition and has validity only in its uniqueness ... ''I'' can only be identified by the instance of discourse that contains it and by that alone."

''You'', on the other hand, is defined in this way:
:"by introducing the situation of "address," we obtain a symmetrical definition for ''you'' as "the individual spoken to in the present instance of discourse containing the linguistic instance of ''you''."  These definitions refer to ''I'' and ''you'' as a category of language and are related to their position in language." — from ''Problems in General Linguistics''

A pivotal concept in Benveniste's work is the distinction between the ''énoncé'' and the ''énonciation'', which grew out of his study on pronouns.  The ''énoncé'' is the statement independent of context, whereas the ''énonciation'' is the act of stating as tied to context.  In essence, this distinction moved Benveniste to see language itself as a "discursive instance", i.e., fundamentally as discourse.  This discourse is, in turn, the actual utilisation, the very enactment, of language.

One of the founders of [[structuralism]], [[Roland Barthes]], attended Benveniste's seminars at École Pratique. [[Pierre Bourdieu]] was instrumental in publishing  Benveniste's other major work, ''Vocabulaire des Institutions Indo-Européennes'' in his series ''Le Sens commun'' at radical publisher [[Les Éditions de Minuit]] (1969). The title is misleading:  it is not a “vocabulary”, but rather a comprehensive and comparative analysis of key social behaviors and institutions across Germanic, [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking, Greco-Roman, and Indo-Iranian cultures, using the words (''vocables'') that denote them as points of entry. It makes use of philology, anthropology, phenomenology and sociology. A number of contemporary French philosophers (e.g., [[Barbara Cassin]], [[Nicole Loraux]], [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], [[François Jullien]], [[Marc Crépon]]) have often referred to Benveniste's ''Vocabulaire'' and are inspired by his methodology and the distinction he draws between meaning (''signification'') and what is referred to (''désignation''). [[Jacques Derrida]]'s famous work on "[[hospitality]], the Other, the enemy"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''De l'hospitalité,'' (avec Anne Dufourmantelle), Calmann-Lévy, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is an explicit "gloss" on Benveniste's ground-breaking study of host/hostility/hospitality in the ''Vocabulary''.&lt;ref&gt;E. Benveniste, ''le vocabulaire des institutions indo-européennes,'' Les Editions de Minuit vol.1, 1969 pp.87-101.&lt;/ref&gt;
