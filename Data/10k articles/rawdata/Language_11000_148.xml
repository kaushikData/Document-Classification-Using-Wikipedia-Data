'''Anthony Sadowski''' (c. 1669 – April 22, 1736) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[The Indian Trade|Indian trader]] and interpreter employed by the [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania|provincial governor of Pennsylvania]] as an Indian agent in the western country.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Antoni Sadowski was born in about 1669 in Poland. He hailed from [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]] near the town of [[Kielce]].  His father was Marcin Sadowski, who was a chamberlain at the Polish king's castle in [[Gostyń]] and, as a deputy of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Polish Sejm]], an inspector of the king's land holdings in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poles.org/DB/S_names/Sadowski_A/Sadowski_art.html | title = The Turbulent Life of Anthony Sadowski | first = Wojciech | last = Wierzewski | year = 2006 | accessdate = April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is not known which schools Antoni attended in his youth, he did receive a [[Classical education movement|classical education]].&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

During the [[Great Northern War]] in 1701, Sadowski was taken captive with his brother at [[Riga]]. He managed to escape captivity, and made his way to [[Scotland]] and [[England]]. He sailed to the British colonies, landing in [[New York City]] in 1704.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

===In America===
[[File:Sadowski marker on Allegheny Co Courthouse.jpg|230px|thumb|right|A historical marker commemorating Sadowski on the exterior of the [[Allegheny County Courthouse]] in downtown [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].]]
After Sadowski moved to the colony of New York, he married Marya Bordt (anglicized as Mary Bird), daughter of Andrew Bird of Newtown, New York. They had six children together. Their eldest son Andrew Sadowski and three daughters, Justina, Anna, and Sofia, all married and had children. Two of their grandsons through son Andrew, James and Jacob Sadowski, became noted Kentucky pioneers.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;  

Sadowski moved his family from New Jersey to Pennsylvania in 1712, to a {{convert|400|acre|km2|adj=on}} property along the [[Schuylkill River]]. He, along with George Boone—grandfather of the noted frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]]—was a founder of [[Amity Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Amity Township]] in [[Berks County]] in 1719.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

Sadowski worked to establish friendly relations with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the area, learning the [[Delaware languages|Delaware]] (Lenape) and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois languages]]. He served as an interpreter to other settlers.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

He became an Indian trader, traveling as far as [[Logstown]] (a village near the site of modern [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania]]).&lt;ref name="marker"&gt;See [[:File:Sadowski marker on Allegheny Co Courthouse.jpg|image of historical marker]] at Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; With two other Indian traders, he established a trading post at present-day [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] in June 1729.&lt;ref name="marker"/&gt; He became a citizen of Pennsylvania in 1735.&lt;ref name="marker"/&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Sadowski died on April 22, 1736 in [[Amityville, Pennsylvania]], and is buried in the cemetery of [[Old St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church]] in [[Douglassville, Pennsylvania|Douglassville]].

His grave marker bears the following inscription:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether or not he opened an Indian trading post on the shores of [[Lake Erie]] and gave his name to [[Sandusky, Ohio]], here lies the greatest Polish frontiersman of colonial times, an organizer of Amity Township in 1719, and founder of the Sandusky family in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSmid=47093752&amp;GRid=33767213&amp; | title = Anthony Sadowski | publisher = Find A Grave | accessdate = April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; However, French maps as early as 1718 identified [[Sandusky Bay]] as Lac Sandouské.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/gmd:@field%28NUMBER+@band%28g3700+ct000666%29%29]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Arbitration''', a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR), is a way to resolve disputes outside the [[court]]s. The dispute will be decided by one or more persons (the "arbitrators", "arbiters" or "[[arbitral tribunal]]"), which renders the "[[arbitration award]]". An arbitration award is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |page=324 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration is often used for the resolution of [[Commercial law|commercial]] disputes, particularly in the context of [[International commerce|international commercial transactions]].  In certain countries such as the United States, arbitration is also frequently employed in consumer and employment matters, where arbitration may be mandated by the terms of employment or commercial contracts and may include a waiver of the right to bring a [[class action]] claim. Mandatory consumer and employment arbitration should be distinguished from consensual arbitration, particularly commercial arbitration.

Arbitration can be either voluntary or mandatory (although mandatory arbitration can only come from a statute or from a contract that one party imposes on the other, in which the parties agree to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration, without necessarily knowing, specifically, what disputes will ever occur) and can be either binding or [[Non-binding arbitration|non-binding]]. Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision cannot be imposed on the parties. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise, the (non-binding) arbiter remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of damages payable. By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration.

Arbitration is a proceeding in which a dispute is resolved by an impartial adjudicator whose decision the parties to the dispute have agreed, or legislation has decreed, will be final and binding. There are limited rights of review and appeal of arbitration awards. Arbitration is not the same as: [[Litigation|judicial proceedings]] (although in some jurisdictions, court proceedings are sometimes referred as arbitrations&lt;ref name="Judicial"&gt;In the [[United Kingdom]], small claims in the [[county court]] are dealt with by a procedure called "small claims arbitration", although the proceedings are held in front of a district judge, paid for by the state. In [[Russia]], the courts dealing with commercial disputes are referred to as the [[Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation]], although it is not an arbitral tribunal in the true sense of the word.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR)&lt;ref&gt;Although all attempts to determine disputes outside of the courts are "alternative dispute resolution" in the literal sense, ADR in the technical legal sense, is the process whereby an attempt is made to reach a common middle ground through an independent mediator as a basis for a binding settlement. In direct contrast, arbitration is an adversarial process to determine a winner and a loser in relation to the rights and wrongs of a dispute.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[expert determination]], [[mediation]] (a form of settlement [[QRG_on_Arbitration,_Conciliation_and_Mediation#Negotiation|negotiation]] facilitated by a neutral third party).

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Parties often seek to resolve disputes through arbitration because of a number of perceived potential advantages over judicial proceedings. Companies often require arbitration with their customers, but prefer the advantages of courts in disputes with competitors:&lt;ref name="ltn"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Hernández |first=Gabrielle Orum |date=2017-10-09 |title=Can Arbitration Solve Tech Sector's Litigation Cost Concerns |url=http://www.legaltechnews.com/id=1202799945603/Can-Arbitration-Solve-Tech-Sectors-Litigation-Cost-Concerns?mcode=0&amp;curindex=0&amp;curpage=ALL |journal=Legaltech News |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}
*In contrast to litigation, where one cannot "choose the judge",&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/the-supreme-courts-retired-but-hardly-retiring-ian-binnie/article2397731/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=The Supreme Court's retired, but hardly retiring, Ian Binnie | date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; arbitration allows the parties to choose their own tribunal. This is especially useful when the subject matter of the dispute is highly technical: arbitrators with an appropriate degree of expertise (for example, quantity surveying expertise, in the case of a construction dispute, or expertise in commercial property law, in the case of a real estate dispute&lt;ref&gt;See for example the arbitration service offered by Falcon Chambers, the specialist property barristers chambers - www.falcon-chambersarbitration.com.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be chosen. 
*Arbitration is often faster than litigation in court.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt;
*Arbitral proceedings and an arbitral award are generally non-public, and can be made confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trans-lex.org/970500|title=Principle XIII.5.1 - Confidentiality - Trans-Lex.org|first=Prof. Dr. Klaus Peter Berger, LL.M., University of|last=Cologne|website=www.trans-lex.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In arbitral proceedings the language of arbitration may be chosen, whereas in judicial proceedings the official language of the country of the competent court will be automatically applied.
*Because of the provisions of the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]], arbitration awards are generally easier to enforce in other nations than court verdicts.
*In most legal systems there are very limited avenues for appeal of an arbitral award, which is sometimes an advantage because it limits the duration of the dispute and any associated liability.

Some of the disadvantages include:
*Arbitration agreements are sometimes contained in ancillary agreements, or in small print in other agreements, and consumers and employees often do not know in advance that they have agreed to mandatory binding pre-dispute arbitration by purchasing a product or taking a job.
*If the arbitration is mandatory and binding, the parties waive their rights to access the courts and to have a judge or jury decide the case.
*If the arbitrator or the arbitration forum depends on the corporation for repeat business, there may be an inherent incentive to rule against the consumer or employee
*There are very limited avenues for appeal, which means that an erroneous decision cannot be easily overturned.
*Although usually thought to be speedier, when there are multiple arbitrators on the panel, juggling their schedules for hearing dates in long cases can lead to delays.
*In some legal systems, arbitration awards have fewer enforcement options than judgments; although in the United States arbitration awards are enforced in the same manner as court judgments and have the same effect.
*Arbitrators are generally unable to enforce interlocutory measures against a party, making it easier for a party to take steps to avoid enforcement of member or a small group of members in arbitration due to increasing legal fees, without explaining to the members the adverse consequences of an unfavorable ruling.
*[[Discovery (law)|Discovery]] may be more limited in arbitration or entirely nonexistent.
*The potential to generate billings by attorneys may be less than pursuing the dispute through trial.
*Unlike court judgments, arbitration awards themselves are not directly enforceable.  A party seeking to enforce an arbitration award must resort to judicial remedies, called an action to "confirm" an award.

==Arbitrability==

By their nature, the subject matter of some disputes is not capable of arbitration. In general, two groups of legal procedures cannot be subjected to arbitration:
* Procedures which necessarily lead to a determination which the parties to the dispute may not enter into an agreement upon:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. [http://www.trans-lex.org/600550#head-10 Section 1030 subsection 1 of the German ''Zivilprozessordnung''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|268|2011|litigants=Larkden Pty Limited v Lloyd Energy Systems Pty Limited |date=1 April 2011 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some court procedures lead to judgments which bind all members of the general public, or public authorities in their capacity as such, or third parties, or which are being conducted in the public interest. For example, until the 1980s, antitrust matters were not arbitrable in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.]]'', 473 U.S. 614 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Matters relating to [[criminal law|crimes]], [[legal status|status]] and [[family law]] are generally not considered to be arbitrable, as the power of the parties to enter into an agreement upon these matters is at least restricted. However, most other disputes that involve private rights between two parties can be resolved using arbitration. In some disputes, parts of claims may be arbitrable and other parts not. For example, in a dispute over [[patent infringement]], a determination of whether a patent has been infringed could be adjudicated upon by an arbitration tribunal, but the validity of a patent could not: As patents are subject to a system of public registration, an arbitral panel would have no power to order the relevant body to rectify any patent registration based upon its determination.
* Some legal orders exclude or restrict the possibility of arbitration for reasons of the protection of weaker members of the public, e.g. consumers. ''Examples'': German law excludes disputes over the rental of living space from any form of arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-lex.org/600550#head-10 Section 1030 subsection 2 ''Zivilprozessordnung'']&lt;/ref&gt; while arbitration agreements with consumers are only considered valid if they are signed by either party,&lt;ref&gt;To be correct: certain form, as defined by statute, of an electronic signature using a chip card and a PIN code is also sufficient&lt;/ref&gt; and if the signed document does not bear any other content than the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-lex.org/600550#head-11 Section 1031 subesction 5 of the ''Zivilprozessordnung'']. The restriction does not apply to notarized agreements, as it is presumed that the notary public will have well informed the consumer about the content and its implications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitration agreement==
{{See also|Arbitration clause}}

Arbitration agreements are generally divided into two types:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* Agreements which provide that, if a dispute should arise, it will be resolved by arbitration. These will generally be normal [[contract]]s, but they contain an [[arbitration clause]]
* Agreements which are signed after a dispute has arisen, agreeing that the dispute should be resolved by arbitration (sometimes called a "submission agreement")
The former is the far more prevalent type of arbitration agreement. Sometimes, legal significance attaches to the type of arbitration agreement. For example, in certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (not including England and Wales), it is possible to provide that each party should bear their own costs in a conventional arbitration clause, but not in a submission agreement.

In keeping with the informality of the arbitration process, the law is generally keen to uphold the validity of arbitration clauses even when they lack the normal formal language associated with legal contracts. Clauses which have been upheld include:
* "arbitration in London - English law to apply"&lt;ref&gt;''Swiss Bank Corporation v Novrissiysk Shipping'' [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 202&lt;/ref&gt;
* "suitable arbitration clause"&lt;ref&gt;''Hobbs Padgett &amp; Co v J C Kirkland'' (1969) 113 SJ 832&lt;/ref&gt;
* "arbitration, if any, by ICC Rules in London"&lt;ref&gt;''Mangistaumunaigaz Oil Production v United Kingdom World Trade'' [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 617&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have also upheld clauses which specify resolution of disputes other than in accordance with a specific legal system. These include provision indicating:
* That the arbitrators "must not necessarily judge according to the strict law but as a general rule ought chiefly to consider the principles of practical business"&lt;ref&gt;''Norske Atlas Insurance Co v London General Insurance Co'' (1927) 28 Lloyds List Rep 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* "internationally accepted principles of law governing contractual relations"&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsche Schachtbau v R'As al-Khaimah National Oil Co'' [1990] 1 AC 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreements to refer disputes to arbitration generally have a special status in the eyes of the law. For example, in disputes on a contract, a common defence is to [[pleading|plead]] the contract is [[void (law)|void]] and thus any claim based upon it fails. It follows that if a party successfully claims that a contract is void, then each clause contained within the contract, including the arbitration clause, would be void. However, in most countries, the courts have accepted that:
# A contract can only be declared void by a court or other tribunal; and
# If the contract (valid or otherwise) contains an arbitration clause, then the proper forum to determine whether the contract is void or not, is the arbitration tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;For example, under English law see ''Heyman v Darwins Ltd.'' [1942] AC 356&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, either position is potentially unfair; if a person is made to sign a contract under [[duress]], and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Conversely a court may be persuaded that the arbitration agreement itself is void having been signed under duress. However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to go to court to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.

== Comparative law ==
Nations regulate arbitration through a variety of laws. The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (as is the case in Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (as is the case in England and Jordan&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Hammouri, Dima A. Khleifat, and Qais A. Mahafzah, ''Arbitration and Mediation in the Southern Mediterranean Countries: Jordan'', Kluwer Law International, Wolters Kluwer - Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.

=== United States ===
{{Main article|Arbitration in the United States}}
The [[Federal Arbitration Act]] (FAA) of 1925 established a [[public policy]] in favor of arbitration. For the first six decades of its existence, courts did not allow arbitration for "federal statutory claims" through a [[Bright-line rule|bright-line]] "nonarbitrability" doctrine, but in the 1980s the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and began to use the act to require arbitration if included in the contract for federal statutory claims.&lt;ref name=Horton2012/&gt; Although some legal scholars believe that it was originally intended to apply to federal courts only, courts now routinely require arbitration due to the FAA regardless of state statutes or public policy [[unconscionability]] determinations by state courts.&lt;ref name=Horton2012&gt;Horton D. (2012). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2158882 Federal Arbitration Act Preemption, Purposivism, and State Public Policy]. Forthcoming in ''Georgetown Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[consumer law]], [[standard form contract]]s often include mandatory predispute [[arbitration clause]]s which require [[consumer arbitration]]. Under these agreements the consumer may waive their right to a [[lawsuit]] and a [[class action]]. In 2011, one of these clauses was upheld in ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]''.&lt;ref name=Horton2012/&gt;

Several arbitration organizations exist, including the [[American Arbitration Association]] and [[JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)|JAMS]].  The [[National Arbitration Forum]] also conducts arbitrations, but it no longer conducts consumer arbitrations pursuant to a consent decree entered into in 2009 because of evidence that it had been biased toward, and had incentives that favored, credit card companies over cardholders.  The AAA was also asked to exit the business.,&lt;ref name=berner&gt;{{cite web|last=Berner|first=Robert|title=Big Arbitration Firm Pulls Out of Credit Card Business|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investing/wall_street_news_blog/archives/2009/07/big_arbitration.html|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not done so.

The United States and Great Britain were pioneers in the use of arbitration to resolve their differences. It was first used in the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795, and played a major role in the [[Alabama Claims]] case of 1872 whereby major tensions regarding British support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War were resolved.  At the First International Conference of American States in 1890, a plan for systematic arbitration was developed, but not accepted. The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Peace Conference]] of 1899, saw the major world powers agreed to a system of arbitration and the creation of a Permanent Court of Arbitration.  President [[William Howard Taft]] was a major advocate. One important use came in the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Britain in 1910.  In 1911 the United States signed arbitration treaties with France and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Campbell, "Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911," ''Journal of American History'' (1966) 53#2 pp: 279-298 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894200 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Jentleson and Thomas G Paterson, eds. ''Encyclopedia of U.S. Foreign Relations''  (1997) 1: pp 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration was widely discussed among diplomats and elites in the 1890-1914 era.  [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895|The 1895 dispute between the United States and Britain over Venezuela]] was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. The [[Olney-Pauncefote Treaty]] of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that required arbitration of major disputes.  The treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson M. Blake, "The Olney-Pauncefote Treaty of 1897," ''American Historical Review,'' (1945) 50#2 pp. 228-243 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1842352 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American Secretary of State [[William Jennings Bryan]] (1913&amp;ndash;1915) worked energetically to promote international arbitration agreements, but his efforts were frustrated by the outbreak of World War I. Bryan negotiated 28 treaties that promised arbitration of disputes before war broke out between the signatory countries and the United States. He made several attempts to negotiate a treaty with Germany, but ultimately was never able to succeed. The agreements, known officially as "Treaties for the Advancement of Peace," set up procedures for conciliation rather than for arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Genevieve Forbes Herrick|author2=John Origen Herrick|title=The Life of William Jennings Bryan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB3Xx4tSqsgC&amp;pg=PA280|origyear=1925|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arbitration treaties were negotiated after the war, but attracted much less attention than the negotiation mechanism created by the [[League of Nations]].

===International agreements===
By far the most important international instrument on arbitration law{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} is the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]], usually simply referred to as the "New York Convention".  Virtually every significant commercial country is a signatory, and only a [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards#States which are not party to the Convention|handful of countries are not parties to the New York Convention]].

Some other relevant international instruments are:
*The Geneva Protocol of 1923
*The Geneva Convention of 1927 [http://interarb.com/vl/g_co1927]
*The European Convention of 1961
*The Washington Convention of 1965 (governing settlement of international investment disputes)
*The [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|Washington Convention]] (ICSID) of 1996 for investment arbitration
*The [[UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration]] of 1985, (revised in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordero-Moss|first=Giuditta|authorlink=Giuditta Cordero-Moss |date=2014|title=International Commercial Contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [http://www.trans-lex.org/705501 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules] (providing a set of rules for an ad hoc arbitration)

===International enforcement===

It is often easier to enforce arbitration awards in a foreign country than court judgments.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]], an award issued in a contracting state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. Only foreign arbitration awards are enforced pursuant to the New York Convention. An arbitral decision is foreign where the award was made in a state other than the state of recognition or where foreign procedural law was used.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the 1958 New York Convention&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these disputes are settled with no public record of their existence as the loser complies voluntarily,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Argen|first = Robert|date = 2015-01-01|title = Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|ssrn = 2393188|location = Rochester, NY|publisher = Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in 2014 UNCITRAL promulgated a rule for public disclosure of investor-state disputes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Virtually [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards#List of parties to the Convention (as of February 2002)|every significant commercial country in the world]] is a party to the Convention while relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments their courts. Additionally, the awards not limited to damages. Whereas typically only monetary judgments by national courts are enforceable in the cross-border context, it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an enforceable order for [[specific performance]] in an arbitration proceeding under the New York Convention.

Article V of the New York Convention provides an exhaustive list of grounds on which enforcement can be challenged. These are generally narrowly construed to uphold the pro-enforcement bias of the Convention.

==== Government disputes ====
Certain international conventions exist in relation to the enforcement of awards against states.
* The Washington Convention 1965 relates to settlement of investment disputes between states and citizens of other countries. The Convention created the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (or ICSID). Compared to other arbitration institutions, relatively few awards have been rendered under ICSID.&lt;ref&gt;Tupman, "Case Studies in the Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes" (1986) 35 ICLQ 813&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Algiers Declaration of 1981 established the [[Iran-US Claims Tribunal]] to adjudicate claims of American corporations and individuals in relation to expropriated property during the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. The tribunal has not been a notable success, and has even been held by an English court to be [[void (law)|void]] under its own governing law.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallal v Bank Mellat'' [1986] 1 QB 441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitral tribunal==

{{Main article|Arbitral tribunal}}

The arbitrators which determine the outcome of the dispute are called the arbitral tribunal. The composition of the arbitral tribunal can vary enormously, with either a sole arbitrator sitting, two or more arbitrators, with or without a chairman or umpire, and various other combinations. In most jurisdictions, an arbitrator enjoys immunity from liability for anything done or omitted whilst acting as arbitrator unless the arbitrator acts in [[bad faith]].

Arbitrations are usually divided into two types: ''ad hoc'' arbitrations and administered arbitrations.

In ''ad hoc'' arbitrations, the arbitral tribunals are appointed by the parties or by an appointing authority chosen by the parties. After the tribunal has been formed, the appointing authority will normally have no other role and the arbitration will be managed by the tribunal.

In administered arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by a professional arbitration institution providing arbitration services, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration|LCIA]] in [[London]], or the [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]] in [[Paris]], or the [[American Arbitration Association]] in the United States. Normally the arbitration institution also will be the appointing authority. Arbitration institutions tend to have their own rules and procedures, and may be more formal. They also tend to be more expensive, and, for procedural reasons, slower.&lt;ref&gt;For example, all arbitral awards issued by the ICC have to be reviewed internally before being handed down, which helps certainty and improves the quality of awards, but leads to delay and expense.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duties of the tribunal===

The duties of a tribunal will be determined by a combination of the provisions of the arbitration agreement and by the procedural laws which apply in the seat of the arbitration. The extent to which the laws of the seat of the arbitration permit "party autonomy" (the ability of the parties to set out their own procedures and regulations) determines the interplay between the two.

However, in almost all countries the tribunal owes several non-derogable duties. These will normally be:
* to act fairly and impartially between the parties, and to allow each party a reasonable opportunity to put their case and to deal with the case of their opponent (sometimes shortened to: complying with the rules of "[[natural justice]]"); and
* to adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, so as to provide a fair means for resolution of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[England]] these are codified in section 33 of the Arbitration Act 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitral awards==
{{Main article|Arbitration award}}

Although arbitration awards are characteristically an award of [[damages]] against a party, in many jurisdictions tribunals have a range of remedies that can form a part of the award. These may include:
# payment of a sum of money (conventional damages)
# the making of a "[[declaration (law)|declaration]]" as to any matter to be determined in the proceedings
# in some{{Which|date=June 2010}} jurisdictions, the tribunal may have the same power as a court to:
## order a party to do or refrain from doing something ("[[injunction|injunctive relief]]")
## to order [[specific performance]] of a [[contract]]
## to order the [[rectification (law)|rectification]], setting aside or cancellation of a [[deed]] or other document.
# In other jurisdictions, however, unless the parties have expressly granted the arbitrators the right to decide such matters, the tribunal's powers may be limited to deciding whether a party is entitled to damages. It may not have the legal authority to order injunctive relief, issue a declaration, or rectify a contract, such powers being reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts.

===Challenge===
Generally speaking, by their nature, arbitration proceedings tend not to be subject to appeal, in the ordinary sense of the word. However, in most countries, the court maintains a supervisory role to set aside awards in extreme cases, such as [[fraud]] or in the case of some serious legal irregularity on the part of the tribunal. Only domestic arbitral awards are subject to set aside procedure.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In [[Arbitration in the United States of America|American arbitration law]] there exists a small but significant body of case law which deals with the power of the courts to intervene where the decision of an arbitrator is in fundamental disaccord with the applicable principles of law or the contract.&lt;ref&gt;The expression appears in the majority judgment in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''Wilko v Swan'' 346 US 427 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this body of case law has been called into question by recent decisions of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately there is little agreement amongst the different American judgments and textbooks as to whether such a separate doctrine exists at all, or the circumstances in which it would apply. There does not appear to be any recorded judicial decision in which it has been applied. However, conceptually, to the extent it exists, the doctrine would be an important derogation from the general principle that awards are not subject to review by the courts.

===Costs===
The overall costs of arbitration can be estimated on the websites of international arbitration institutions, such as that of the ICC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/arbitration-and-adr/arbitration/cost-and-payment/cost-calculator/|title=Cost calculator - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the website of the SIAC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siac.org.sg/index.php?option=com_siaccalculator&amp;view=siaccalculator&amp;Itemid=102|title=Singapore International Arbitration Centre|website=www.siac.org.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the website of the International Arbitration Attorney Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-arbitration-attorney.com/|title=International Arbitration - International Arbitration Information|website=International Arbitration Attorney Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall cost of administrative and arbitrator fees is, on average, less than 20% of the total cost of international arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-arbitration-attorney.com/full-international-arbitration-cost-calculators/|title=Full Arbitration Cost Calculators|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many legal systems - both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] - it is normal practice for the courts to award [[Law of costs|legal costs]] against a losing party, with the winner becoming entitled to recover an approximation of what it spent in pursuing its claim (or in defense of a claim). The [[United States]] is a notable exception to this rule, as except for certain extreme cases, a prevailing party in a US legal proceeding does not become entitled to recoup its legal fees from the losing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the courts, arbitral tribunals generally have the same power to award costs in relation to the determination of the dispute. In [[international arbitration]] as well as domestic arbitrations governed by the laws of countries in which courts may award costs against a losing party, the arbitral tribunal will also determine the portion of the arbitrators' fees that the losing party is required to bear.

==Nomenclature==
As methods of dispute resolution, arbitration procedure can be varied to suit the needs of the parties. Certain specific "types" of arbitration procedure have developed, particularly in North America.

* '''Judicial Arbitration''' is, usually, not arbitration at all, but merely a court process which refers to itself as arbitration, such as small claims arbitration before the [[County Court]]s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Judicial" /&gt;
* '''[[Online dispute resolution|Online Arbitration]]''' is, a form of arbitration that occurs exclusively online. There is currently an assumption that online arbitration is admissible under the New York Convention and the E-Commerce Directive, but this has not been legally verified.&lt;ref&gt;R. Morek "The Regulatory Framework for Online Dispute Resolution: A Critical View" (2006) 38 Tol. L. Rev. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Since arbitration is based on a contractual agreement between the parties, an online process without a regulatory framework may generate a significant number of challenges from consumers and other weaker parties if due process cannot be assured.
* '''High-Low Arbitration''', or '''Bracketed Arbitration''', is an arbitration wherein the parties to the dispute agree in advance the limits within which the arbitral tribunal must render its award. It is only generally useful where liability is not in dispute, and the only issue between the party is the amount of compensation. If the award is lower than the agreed minimum, then the defendant only need pay the lower limit; if the award is higher than the agreed maximum, the claimant will receive the upper limit. If the award falls within the agreed range, then the parties are bound by the actual award amount. Practice varies as to whether the figures may or may not be revealed to the tribunal, or whether the tribunal is even advised of the parties' agreement.
* '''Binding Arbitration''' is a form of arbitration where the decision by the arbitrator is legally binding and enforceable, similar to a court order.
* '''[[Non-binding arbitration|Non-Binding Arbitration]]''' is a process which is conducted as if it were a conventional arbitration, except that the award issued by the tribunal is not binding on the parties, and they retain their rights to bring a claim before the courts or other arbitration tribunal; the award is in the form of an independent assessment of the merits of the case, designated to facilitate an out-of-court [[settlement (law)|settlement]]. State law may automatically make a non-binding arbitration binding, if, for example, the non-binding arbitration is court-ordered, and no party requests a trial ''de novo'' (as if the arbitration had not been held).&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Section 44.103, Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pendulum arbitration|Pendulum Arbitration]]''' refers to a determination in [[industrial dispute]]s where an arbitrator has to resolve a claim between a [[trade union]] and management by making a determination of which of the two sides has the more reasonable position. The arbitrator must choose only between the two options, and cannot split the difference or select an alternative position. It was initiated in Chile in 1979. This form of arbitration has been increasingly seen in resolving international tax disputes, especially in the context of deciding on the Transfer Pricing margins.  This form of arbitration is also known (particularly in the United States) as '''Baseball Arbitration'''. It takes its name from a practice which arose in relation to [[Major League Baseball transactions#Free agency and salary arbitration|salary arbitration]] in [[Major League Baseball]].
* '''Night Baseball Arbitration''' is a variation of baseball arbitration where the figures are not revealed to the arbitration tribunal. The arbitrator will determinate the quantum of the claim in the usual way, and the parties agree to accept and be bound by the figure which is closest to the tribunal's award.

Such forms of "Last Offer Arbitration" can also be combined with mediation to create MEDALOA hybrid processes (Mediation followed by Last Offer Arbitration).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altenburger.ch/uploads/tx_altenburger/jl_2007_The_Interaction_Between_Arbitration_and_Mediation.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== England ===
Arbitration in its common law form developed in England; in the Middle Ages, tribunals such as the Courts of the Boroughs, of the Fair and of the Staple arose as the Royal Courts were not designed for trade disputes, and trade with foreigners was otherwise unenforceable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10224-0_2|title=The History, Importance and Modern Use of Arbitration|last=Noussia|first=Dr Kyriaki|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642102233|pages=11–17|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10224-0_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century, common law courts developed contract law and the Admiralty court became accessible for disputes with foreign merchants, broadening the venues for trade disputes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Courts became suspicious of arbitration; for example, in ''Kill v. Hollister'' (1746), an English court ruled that the arbitration agreement could 'oust' courts of law and equity of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Merchants, however, retained provisions to settle disputes among themselves, but tension between the arbitration proceedings and courts eventually resulted in the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 which provided for the appointment of arbitrators and umpires, allowed courts to 'stay proceedings' when a disputant filed a suit despite an agreement to arbitrate, and provided a process for arbitrators to submit questions to a court.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Later, the Arbitration Act 1889 was passed, followed by other Arbitration Acts in 1950, 1975, 1979 and [[Arbitration Act 1996|1996]]. [[Arbitration Act 1979]] in particular limited judicial review for arbitration awards.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== United States ===
Arbitration was common in the early United States, with George Washington serving as an arbiter on an occasion.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The United States had a notable difference from England, however, in that unlike England, its courts generally did not enforce [[Executory contract|executory agreements]] (binding predispute agreements) to arbitrate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260387685_State_regulation_of_arbitration_proceedings_judicial_review_of_Arbitration_Awards_by_State_Courts|title=State regulation of arbitration proceedings: judicial review of Arbitration Awards by State Courts|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that prior to an award, a claimant could sue in court even if they had contractually agreed to settle disputes by arbitration. After the award, courts reviewed the judgment, but generally deferred to the arbitration,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; although the practice was not consistent.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228208161_Judicial_Enforcement_of_Pre-Dispute_Arbitration_Agreements_Back_to_the_Future|title=Judicial Enforcement of Pre-Dispute Arbitration Agreements: Back to the Future|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of enforcement of predispose agreements led to the [[Federal Arbitration Act of 1925]],&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; with New York leading with a state law enforcing predispose agreements.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In 1921, the [[American Bar Association]] drafted the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] based on the New York law, which was passed in 1925 with minor changes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In the next decade, the [[American Arbitration Association]] promoted rules and facilitated arbitrations through appointments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3553">In [[cryptography]], '''black-bag cryptanalysis''' is a [[euphemism]] for the acquisition of cryptographic secrets via [[burglary]], or other covert means – rather than mathematical or technical [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic attack]]. The term refers to the black bag of equipment that a burglar would carry or a [[black bag operation]].

As with [[rubber-hose cryptanalysis]], this is technically not a form of cryptanalysis; the term is used sardonically. However, given the free availability of very high strength cryptographic systems, this type of attack is a much more serious threat to most users than mathematical attacks because it is often much easier to attempt to circumvent cryptographic systems (e.g. steal the password) than to attack them directly.

Regardless of the technique used, such methods are intended to capture highly sensitive information e.g. [[cryptographic key]]s, key-rings, [[password]]s or unencrypted plaintext. The required information is usually copied without removing or destroying it, so capture often takes place without the victim realising it has occurred. 

==Methods==
In addition to burglary, the covert means might include the installation of [[keystroke logging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.download3k.com/System-Utilities/Other-Utilities/Download-Remote-Password-Stealer.html |title=Remote Password Stealer 2.7 |publisher=Download3K |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920085933/http://www.download3k.com/System-Utilities/Other-Utilities/Download-Remote-Password-Stealer.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] software or hardware installed on (or near to) target computers or ancillary devices. It is even possible to [[Van Eck phreaking|monitor the electromagnetic emissions of computer displays]] or keyboards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10200631-83.html |title= Sniffing keystrokes via laser and keyboard power |author=Elinor Mills |publisher=ZDNet |date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8147534.stm |title=Snooping through the power socket |publisher=BBC News |date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a distance of 20 metres (or more), and thereby decode what has been typed. This could be done by surveillance technicians, or via some form of [[covert listening device|bug]] concealed somewhere in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7681534.stm |title=Keyboard sniffers to steal data |publisher=BBC News |date=October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sophisticated technology is often used, black bag cryptanalysis can also be as simple as the process of copying a password which someone has unwisely written down on a piece of paper and left inside their desk drawer.

The case of ''[[United States v. Scarfo]]'' highlighted one instance in which FBI agents using a [[sneak and peek warrant]] placed a keystroke logger on an alleged criminal gang leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epic.org/crypto/scarfo.html |title=United States v. Scarfo, Criminal No. 00-404 (D.N.J.) |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Orphan|date=March 2017}}

''''Capacity theory''' is the theoretical approach that pulled researchers from Filter theories with Kahneman's published 1973 study, ''Attention and Effort'' (https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf - bottom of page 7 of the book, page 14 of the pdf) positing attention was limited in overall capacity, that a person's ability to perform simultaneous tasks depends on how much "capacity" the jobs require.  Further researchers - Johnson and Heinz (1978) and Navon &amp; Gopher (1979) - went further with Kahneman's study.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, Ronald T. (2016). pp. 79-83.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalom Fisch used Kahneman's capacity theory, just as others did for their research, to published a paper on children's understanding of educational content on television.&lt;ref name=Fisch6391&gt;{{harvnb|Fisch|2000|pp=63&amp;ndash;91}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a communication theory based on model which is used to explain and predict how children learn from [[educational television programing]]. It is formed by combining [[cognitive psychology]] and [[LC4MP|limited capacity]] of working memory. Working memory is explained as having limited resources available for processing external information and when demands exceed capabilities, then the material will not be attended to.
The model attempts to explain how cognitive resources are allocated when individuals, particularly children, comprehend both the educational and the narrative content of an educational program
Capacity theory suggests that when educational content is tangential to the narrative content the two information sources compete with one another for limited resources in working memory. However, when the distance between educational content and narrative content is small, the process complement one another rather than compete for resources, therefore an individual is likely comprehend more.

== Three basic components of the capacity model ==
The capacity model consists of three basic components.
# ''Processing of narrative content''
# ''Processing of education content''
# ''Distance between narrative and educational content''

=== Processing of narrative content ===
Capacity model implies that television viewers will construct their understanding of the [[narrative content]] by accessing prior knowledge and draw inferences on the new material based on previous exposure. Theory and empirical research has supported the notion that people are using working memory to process information needed to follow the story line or plot.&lt;ref name=AndBry331354&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Bryant|1983|pp=331&amp;ndash;354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins125150&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1983|pp=125&amp;ndash;150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HustonWright9991058&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|Wright|1997|pp=999&amp;ndash;1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HustonWright10191020&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|Wright|1997|pp=1019&amp;ndash;1020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PalmerMacNeil2744&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|MacNeill|1991|pp=27&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PearlBouLaz2227&gt;{{harvnb|Pearl|Bouthilet|Lazar|1982|pp=22&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the audio/visual nature of television, individual program factors will influence how much demand is used. For example, a fast paced action sequence will require more working memory to follow the action than perhaps a slow dialogue between two characters.
This is best understood by breaking it down to two types of characteristics, viewer characteristics and program characteristics.

==== Viewer characteristics ====
* Viewer's prior knowledge – if an individual is familiar with the narrative content, such as knowing the characters or storyline, then cognitive demand will be low and more working memory will be made available.
* Story schema – ability to understand the basic components of a story and the hierarchy of events will help influence the amount of cognitive demand required.&lt;ref name=MeadowReev352374&gt;{{harvnb|Meadowcroft|Reeves|1989|pp352&amp;ndash;374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive abilities – individuals with higher intelligence and higher cognitive abilities will make more efficient use of cognitive resources when encoding the narrative.&lt;ref name=EckhardtWoodJacob636649&gt;{{harvnb|Eckhardt|Wood|Jacobvitz|1991|pp=636&amp;ndash;649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JacWoodAlbin219235&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobvitz|Wood|Albin|1991|pp=219&amp;ndash;235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interest in the story - the viewer's interest in the story will affect how much attention is paid to the narrative and therefore will influence how resources are allocated.

==== Program characteristics ====
Developmental research in text comprehension has found that young children can use schemata to process stories only when they are structured simply and clearly state causal linkages&lt;ref name=MandlerJohnson111151&gt;{{harvnb|Mandler|Johnson|1977|pp=111&amp;ndash;151}} cf. Meadowcroft &amp; Reeves, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complexity of the narrative - the number of events in the story and the connections among them will influence how much working memory is required. Studies have shown that children process stories only when they are simple in their construction and clearly show casual linkage. Long narratives with lots of complex chains will increase demands required for processing.&lt;ref name=MandlerJohnson111151/&gt;
* Structure of the Story - stories that are constructed in easily recognizable patterns, such as a beginning, middle, and end are easier to follow, thus reducing demand.
* Explicit vs inferred information - whether or not the information is clearly presented or if it is less clear, thus requiring making inference about the narrative, will affect the amount of cognitive processing required.

=== Processing educational content ===
The processing of educational content has not received as much attention as processing of narrative content. Many of the guiding principles in this section were developed out of speculation and then verified through current studies. As with the narrative content, there are viewer and program characteristics that effect comprehension.

==== Viewer characteristics ====
* Prior knowledge of content - similar to the processing of narrative content, previous exposure to educational information can reduce the amount of working memory required to process the information in children. This has been shown to be true in adults.
* Interest in content - viewers will be able to dedicate a greater pool of resources to information in they are interested in the content. This was suggested by testing children's comprehension of mathematical word problems. The study showed that comprehension was enhanced if the child was interested in the narrative context which the problem occurred in.&lt;ref name=Renninger228238&gt;{{harvnb|Renninger|1998|pp=222&amp;ndash;238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Program characteristics ====
* Clarity of presentation - the degree to which the information is clearly presented will decrease required resources for processing information.
* Explicitness of content - whether or not the content is clearly identifiable as educational material or if it hidden beneath the narrative will affect amount of cognition.

=== Distance ===
Distance is the final component of this model. The idea of distance separates this model from other cognitive processing models such as Limited Capacity. Distance referrers to the degree to which the educational content is integrated into the narrative. This concept has been dubbed "content on the plotline" by the Children's Television Workshop.&lt;ref name=FischEtAl&gt;{{harvnb|Fisch|Goodman|McCann|Rylander|Ross|1995|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HallWilliams&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Williams|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is best described as the role the content has in the story of events. Distance is not binary, but is best described in length as small or large.
* Small distance suggests that the narrative and educational content are related to one another and that the educational content is causally embedded into the plot.
* Large distance suggests that educational content is not involved in the story line and does not assist in moving the story forward. It may only be featured at low levels in the story hierarchy.

Understanding the effect distance has on processing will explain how certain content competes for attention. Large distances will require more resources due to the increase in competition, however resources are limited. The process used to encode, store, and retrieve narrative content is the same as educational content. When the narrative and educational content are intertwined, then it is said to be a small distance, thus reducing the amount of competition for limited resources. The parallel process responsible for comprehending narrative and educational content complement one another, thus increasing information retention.
- This model predicts that educational content will be better attended to when the distance from the narrative is small and has been shown in previous studies&lt;ref name=FischEtAl/&gt;

== Factors which influence processing of narrative and educational content ==
There are several factors that will influence the processing of narrative and educational content.
* Cognitive maturity of the child - studies have shown that cognitive capabilities develop in children at different ages.
* Prior exposure to the material - if the child has been exposed to the educational material before, cognitive demand will be lessened.
* Complexity of formal features - as mentioned previously, television has the opportunity to provide several audio and video features. Studies have shown that features such as fast program pacing may decrease processing capabilities.

== Governing principles ==
This theory is governed by several broad principles detailing the allocation of resources among the two content types.

===Narrative dominance===
This principle suggests that priority is given to comprehension of the narrative content over the educational content assuming all things are equal. This primarily occurs when the distance between the educational content and narrative content is large. Working memory will be devoted to narrative before educational content. This is largely due to the fact that people typically select television content for its entertainment value before its educational value. Secondly, narrative content is featured as the primary or “surface” contents, whereas educational content is secondary or “deep” content.

=== Relative availability of resources ===
Each individual will have various levels of resource ability. As with any type of content the individual is exposed to, there will always be a competition for resources. Several factors can increase or decrease the demands required for processing, such as pacing, graphics, audio, and other production features. When high demands are required for processing the narrative content of educational programming, then less resources will be available for educational content. This demand to process both sources can be reduced if the educational content and narrative content are closely related.

=== Voluntary allocation ===
Individuals will select media to achieve certain goals or objectives. As a result, an individual may choose to watch an educational program and consciously attempt to allocate more resources to the educational content rather than the narrative content. Studies have consistently shown that viewer’s reason for watching can affect at which level the narrative is recalled and understood.&lt;ref name=KwaitekWatkins&gt;{{harvnb|Kwaitek|Watkins|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SalomanLeigh&gt;{{harvnb|Saloman|Leigh|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research using this model has revealed that the same has been shown to occur with educational content. It should be understood that this model does not assume that the attention paid to the educational content will cause the viewer to abandon resources to the narrative.

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''code''' is a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or sub-codes currently in use to communicate meaning. The most common is one's [[spoken language]], but the term can also be used to refer to any [[narrative]] form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] in [[chess]]).

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[value (semiotics)|value]] when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.

[[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see [[Semiosis]]).

==Discussion==
To that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] and [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the [[message]]s. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the [[denotation (semiotics)|denotational]] to the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotational]], the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] of the medium, the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]], e.g. [[academic]], [[literature|literary]], [[genre fiction]], etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a [[literal and figurative language|literal]] representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegorical]] interpretation [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Distinctions of [[Social class|class]] or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] or as a [[dialect]]) or written (i.e. in sentences or in [[Short message service|SMS]] format), the place of residence (see [[American English|Americanisms]]), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]s as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of [[socialisation]] is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an [[ideological]] quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[belief]]s. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.
The other code forms rely upon [[knowledge]] held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of [[vocabulary]] and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and [[ideological]] codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and a piece of [[bubblegum pop]], and a painting by [[Rembrandt]] and a [[comic book]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.
In communication research and [[Media studies|media research]], the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: 
* In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Communication access real-time translation (CART)''', also called '''open captioning''' or '''real-time stenography''', or simply real-time captioning, is the general name of the system that [[court reporters]], [[closed captioning|closed captioners]] and voice writers, and others use to convert speech to text.  A trained operator uses keyboard or [[stenography]] methods to transcribe spoken speech into written text. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART.

While real-time speech-to-text serves many with hearing loss and deafness, it is also useful for people whose first language is different from the language being used, to understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations (at work, in education, community events), to have a "transcript', and for learning languages. CART professionals have qualifications for added expertise (speed and accuracy) as compared to court reporters and other stenographers. 

'''Remote CART''' is done with the trained operator at a remote location.  A voice connection such as a telephone, cellphone, or computer microphone is used to send the voice to the operator, and the [[real-time text]] is transmitted back over a modem, Internet, or other data connection.

Some people use CART as the short form of computer assisted realtime transcription.  The service is identical.

In some countries, CART may be referred to as Palantype, Velotype, STTR (speech to text reporting).

'''Encomium''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word deriving from the [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] ἐγκώμιον (''enkomion'') meaning "the praise of a person or thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)gkw/mios|ἐγκώμιον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Encomium'' also refers to several distinct aspects of [[rhetoric]]:

* A general category of [[Public speaking|oratory]]
* A method within rhetorical [[pedagogy]]
* A [[figure of speech]] praising a person or thing, but occurring on a smaller scale than an entire speech
* The eighth exercise in the [[progymnasmata]] series
* A literary genre that included five elements: prologue, birth and upbringing, acts of the person's life, comparisons used to praise the subject, and an epilogue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Examples==
* [[Gorgias]]' famous ''[[Encomium of Helen]]'' offers several justifications for excusing [[Helen of Troy]]'s adultery
* In [[Erasmus]]' ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', Folly composes an encomium to herself
* ''[[De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica]]'' is a medieval encomium of the victory of [[Pepin of Italy]] over the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]]
* ''[[Encomium Emmae Reginae]]'' is a medieval encomium of Queen [[Emma of Normandy]]
* ''[[Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis]]'' or ''Versum de Mediolano civitate'' is a medieval encomium of [[Milan]]
* ''[[Versus de Verona]]'' is a medieval encomium of [[Verona]]
* ''[[Polychronion]]'' is chanted in the liturgy of Churches which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]]
* The Christian writer Paul uses a kind of encomium in his praise of love, in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 13; the prologue is verses 1–3, acts are v. 4–7, comparison is v. 8–12, and epilogue is 13:13–14:1.&lt;ref&gt;[[David E. Garland]], Baker Exegetical Commentary, 1 Corinthians, 606,  based on the work of Sigountos.&lt;/ref&gt;

# A [[shot (filming)|shot]] is a single continuous [[Video recording|recording]] made by a [[camera]]. It is [[analogy|analogous]] to a [[word]].
# A [[scene (filming)|scene]] is a series of related shots. It is analogous to a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The study of transitions between scenes is described in [[film punctuation]].
# A [[sequence (filming)|sequence]] is a series of scenes which together tell a major part of an entire [[Narrative|story]], such as that contained in a complete [[film|movie]]. It is analogous to a [[paragraph]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for these specific analogies. I'd argue that a shot is a sentence and a scene is a paragraph or even chapter.

He was particularly influential in popularizing "[[cross-cutting]]"&amp;mdash;using [[film editing]] to alternate between different events occurring at the same time&amp;mdash;in order to build [[suspense]]. He still used many elements from the "primitive" style of movie-making that predated [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]]'s [[Continuity editing|continuity]] system, such as frontal staging, exaggerated gestures, minimal camera movement, and an absence of [[point of view shot]]s.  Some claim, too, that he "invented" the [[close-up]] shot for filming.

Credit for Griffith's cinematic innovations must be shared with his cameraman of many years, [[Billy Bitzer]].  In addition, he himself credited the legendary silent star [[Lillian Gish]], who appeared in several of his films, with creating a new style of acting for the cinema.

The '''Fraser alphabet''' or '''Old Lisu Alphabet''' is an [[artificial script]] invented around 1915 by Sara [[Ba Thaw]], a [[Karen people|Karen]] preacher from [[Myanmar]], and improved by the [[missionary]] [[James O. Fraser]], to write the [[Lisu language]]. It is a single-[[Case (orthography)|case]] ([[Unicase|unicameral]]) [[alphabet]].  It was also used for the [[Naxi language]], e.g. the 1932 Naxi Gospel of Mark.&lt;ref&gt;[https://socidoc.com/queue/m-ko-te-dna-hsi-mark-1932-_5a02b933d64ab2e82e1e3176_pdf?queue_id=5a1b047ed64ab2e8253d9734 Naxi Gospel of Mark 1932] &lt;/ref&gt;, and used in the Zaiwa or [[Atsi language]] e.g. the 1938 Atsi Gospel of Mark.

The alphabet uses uppercase letters from the [[Latin script]], and rotated versions thereof, to write [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s. [[Tonal language|Tone]]s and [[nasalization]] are written with Roman [[punctuation]] marks, identical to those found on a typewriter. Like the Indic [[abugida]]s, the vowel {{IPA|[a]}} is not written. However, unlike those scripts, the other vowels are written with full letters.

The [[China|Chinese]] government recognized the alphabet in 1992 as the [[official script]] for writing in Lisu.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Tones==

Tones are written with standard punctuation. Lisu punctuation therefore differs from international norms: the comma is {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|꓾}}}} (hyphen period), and the full stop is {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|꓿}}}} (equal sign).

|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;It is not clear how the {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓻ}}}} mid tone differs from the unmarked mid tone.
The tones {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓸ}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓹ}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓺ}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓻ}}}} may be combined with {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓼ}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓽ}}}} as compound tones. However, the only one still in common use is {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ꓹꓼ}}}}.

The apostrophe indicates [[nasalization]]. It is combined with tone marks.

The understrike (optionally a low [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) indicates the Lisu "A glide", a contraction of {{IPA|[ɑ̂]}} without an intervening glottal stop. The tone is not always falling, depending on the environment, but is written {{angle bracket|{{script|Lisu|ˍ}}}} regardless.

==Unicode==
{{Main|Lisu (Unicode block)}}

The Fraser alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.

An additional character which is the inverted Y used in the [[Naxi language]] is not in Unicode.

The Unicode block for the Fraser alphabet, called Lisu, is U+A4D0&amp;ndash;U+A4FF:

'''Galach''' is the universal [[lingua franca]] in the fictional [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]], described in the "Terminology of the Imperium" appendix of ''Dune'' as "Hybrid Inglo-Slavic with strong traces of cultural-specialization terms adopted during the long chain of human migrations," indicating that the language likely has [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] origins. As the official language of the Imperium, Galach is used in official texts and in the Royal Court on [[Kaitain (Dune)|Kaitain]]. 

It also appears as the universal language in other novels by Herbert, such as ''[[Whipping Star]]'' and ''[[The Dosadi Experiment]]''.

[[Willis E. McNelly]]'s ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'' has an article on Galach that consists entirely of summaries of phonological, morphological, and syntactic changes from "Proto-Galach" (modern English) through various stages of development to "Atreidean Galach," the state of the language at the time of Herbert's novels. The names of various contributors to the ''Encyclopedia'' had the phonological alterations applied to their names for use in the fictional context; for example, "Gwilit Mignail" appears as a name in the text, the Galach version of "Willis McNelly".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9901">In [[historical linguistics]], the '''Germanic parent language (GPL)''' includes the reconstructed languages in the [[Germanic languages|Germanic group]] referred to as '''Pre-Germanic Indo-European (PreGmc)''', '''Early [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] (EPGmc)''', and '''Late Proto-Germanic (LPGmc)''', spoken in the 2nd and 1st millennia BC.

The less precise term ''Germanic'', that appears in [[etymologies]], [[dictionary|dictionaries]], etc., loosely refers to a language spoken in the 1st millennium AD,{{citation needed|reason=This, even, is too specific to be common knowledge|date=August 2016}} proposedly at that time developing into the group of [[Germanic languages]]—a stricter term for that same proposition, but with an alternative [[chronography]], is ''[[Proto-Germanic language]]''.
As an identifiable [[neologism]], ''Germanic parent language'' appears to have been first used by [[Frans Van Coetsem]] in 1994. It also makes appearances in the works of Elzbieta Adamczyk, [[Jonathan Slocum]], and [[Winfred P. Lehmann]].

==Absolute chronology==
Several historical linguists have pointed towards the apparent material and social continuity connecting the cultures of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (1800 – 500 BC) and the [[pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe]] (500 BC – 1 AD) as having implications in regard to  the stability and later development of the Germanic language group.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann (1977), for example, writes: "Possibly the most important conclusion based on archeological evidence with relevance for linguistic purposes is the assumption of 'one huge cultural area' which was undisturbed for approximately a thousand years, roughly from 1500 – 500 BC. Such a conclusion in a stable culture permits inferences concerning linguistic stability, which are important for an interpretation of the Germanic linguistic data." From: ''Language Contact and Inference in the Germanic Period'' In: Kolb-Lauffer, et al. (eds). ''Sprachliche Interferenz'' 278–91. Quoted from Van Coetsem (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging consensus among scholars is that the [[Grimm's law|First Germanic Sound Shift]], long considered to be ''the'' defining mark in the development of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], happened as late as 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2006) p. 40; Van Coetsem (1994) 145&amp;ndash;46; Gutenbrunner (1986) pp. 182–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Research conducted over the past few decades displays a notable interest in exploring the linguistic and sociohistorical conditions under which this sound shift occurred, and often formulates theories and makes reconstructive efforts regarding the periods immediately preceding Proto-Germanic as traditionally characterised.&lt;ref&gt;"On setting the upper boundary of a comprehensive description of Proto-Germanic grammar, Lehmann (2005) wrote: (...) a grammar of Proto-Germanic must be a description of the language from approximately 2500 BC to the beginning of the common era (...)." {{cite book|first=Winfred|last=Lehman|title=A Grammar of Proto-Germanic|publisher=Linguistics Research Center, University of Texas|location=Austin|date=2007|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/pgmc00.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108232818/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/pgmc00.html|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The notion of the Germanic parent language is thus used to encompass both the Pre-Proto-Germanic stage of development preceding the First Germanic Sound Shift (assumed to be contemporary with the Nordic Bronze Age) and that stage traditionally identified as Proto-Germanic up to the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Northwest Germanic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical boundaries==
The '''upper boundary''' assigned to the Germanic parent language is described as "dialectal Indo-European".&lt;ref&gt;Van Coetsem (1994) pp. 17; 72–73; 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of both Van Coetsem and Voyles, attempts are made to reconstruct aspects of this stage of the language using a process the former refers to as ''inverted reconstruction''; i.e. one using the data made available through the attested daughter languages in light of and at times in preference to the results of the ''comparative reconstruction'' undertaken to arrive at [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Coetsem (1994) p. 42. See also Voyles (1992) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The results are not strictly standard in terms of traditional Proto-Indo-European reconstruction, but they are instead presented as characteristic of the incipient predecessor to Early Proto-Germanic, hence the terms Pre-Germanic Indo-European (Voyles) or Pre-Proto-Germanic (Van Coetsem) for this stage.&lt;ref&gt;Antonsen refers to this stage as "Late Proto-Indo-European". Cf. Antonsen (2002:17-18).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lower boundary''' of the Germanic parent language has been tentatively identified as that point in the development of the language which preceded permanent fragmentation and which produced the Germanic daughter languages.&lt;ref&gt;Van Coetsem (1994) p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonological boundaries==
In his work entitled ''The Vocalism of the Germanic Parent Language'', Frans Van Coetsem lays out a broad set of phonological characteristics which he considers to be representative of the various stages encompassed by the Germanic parent language:
*Pre-[[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]]: [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] reduction;
*Early Proto-Germanic: (1) ā/ă, ō/ŏ mergers; (2) dissolution of the syllabic liquids and nasals; (3) the initiation of fricativization or the [[Grimm's law|First Consonant Shift]] (also known as Grimm's Law or Erste Lautverschiebung)
*Late Proto-Germanic: (1) accent modification in two stages: (a) intensification in dominance followed by [[Verner's law]]; (b) fixation on the first syllable: umlaut- and accent-conditioned raising and lowering changes; reduction in non-accented position; (3) /s/ → /z/.&lt;ref&gt;Van Coetsem (1994) pp. 193–94. See also [[Proto-Germanic#Phonology|Proto-Germanic Phonology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Koivulehto (2002) further defines Pre-Germanic as "[the] language stage that followed the depalatalization of IE palatals (e.g. IE  ''ḱ'' &gt; PreGmc ''k'') but preceded the Gmc sound shift "Lautverschiebung", "Grimm's Law", (e.g. ''k'' &gt; PGmc ''χ'')."&lt;ref&gt;Koivulehto (2002:585)&lt;/ref&gt; Other rules thought to have affected the Pre-Germanic stage include Cowgill's Law, which describes the process of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeal loss]] known to have occurred in most post-PIE (IE) dialects, and [[Osthoff's law]], which describes rules for the shortening of long vowels, known to have applied in western dialects such as [[Proto-Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Latin]], and [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]], but not in [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] or [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]]. Ringe (2006) suggests that it is likely that Osthoff's Law also applied to Germanic, and that the loss of laryngeals such as h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must have preceded the application of Grimm's Law.&lt;ref&gt;Ringe (2006:68–93)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hu''' ({{zh|户语}}), also '''Angku''' or '''Kon Keu''', is a [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic language]] of [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. Its speakers are an unclassified ethnic minority; the Chinese government counts the Angku as members of the [[Blang people|Bulang]] nationality, but the Angku language is not intelligible with Bulang.&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{e18|huo|Hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Li (2006:340), there are fewer than 1,000 speakers living on the slopes of the "Kongge" Mountain ("控格山") in Na Huipa village 纳回帕村, Mengyang township 勐养镇, [[Jinghong]] 景洪市 (a [[county-level city]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=201692 |title=景洪市勐养镇昆格村委会纳回帕 |publisher=Ynszxc.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hu speakers call themselves the ''{{IPA|xuʔ˥}}'', and the local [[Dai people]]s call them the "black people" (黑人), as well as ''xɔn55 kɤt35'', meaning 'surviving soul' (Yan &amp; Zhou 2012:152).&lt;ref&gt;Yan Qixiang [颜其香] &amp; Zhou Zhizhi [周植志] (2012).

'''Israel Joshua Singer''' ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: ישראל יהושע זינגער ; November 30, 1893, [[Biłgoraj]], [[Congress Poland]] — February 10, 1944 [[New York City|New York]]) was a Polish American novelist who wrote in Yiddish.

==Biography==
He was born Yisruel Yehoyshye Zinger, the son of Pinchas Mendl Zinger, a rabbi and author of rabbinic commentaries, and Basheva Zylberman. He was the brother of author [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] and novelist [[Esther Kreitman]]. He married Genia Kuper. His eldest son, Yasha, died of influenza before the family's emigration to America. His younger son, Joseph Singer was the translator for both his father's works and his uncle, Isaac Bashevis Singer. Joseph a painter and writer like his father married June Flaum Singer who went on to become a writer. They had four children: Sharon Salinger, Brett Singer, IJ Singer and Valerie Singer. The three daughters followed in the family business and are also published poets and novelists.

Singer contributed to the European Yiddish press from 1916. In 1919 he with his wife Genia went to the Soviet Union, where he found work on a newspaper, The New Times, and was considered one of the "Kiev Writers". Then they moved to Moscow, where he published articles and stories. After two hard years, in 1921, they returned to Warsaw. In 1921, after [[Abraham Cahan]] noticed his story ''Pearls'', Singer became a correspondent for the American Yiddish newspaper ''[[The Forward]]''. His short story ''Liuk'' appeared in 1924, illuminating the ideological confusion of the Bolshevik Revolution. He wrote his first novel, ''Steel and Iron'', in 1927. In 1934 he emigrated to the United States to write for ''[[The Forward]]''.
Eventually, Israel Joshua invited his younger brother, future Nobel prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer to the United States and engineered for him a job position in ''[[The Forward]]''. 
"Had it not been for Joshua, [[Abraham Cahan]] would have fired him", - Singer's wife Genia later confessed to Bashevis' son [[Israel Zamir]].
He died of a heart attack at age 50 in [[New York City, 258 Riverside Drive]] on February 10, 1944.

==Works==
His memoir ''Fun a velt vos iz nishto mer'' (English: ''[[Of a World That is No More]]'') was published posthumously in 1946. His other works include:
* ''Shtol un Ayzn'' (1927); translated into English as ''[[Blood Harvest (Israel Joshua Singer novel)|Blood Harvest]]'' (1935)&lt;ref&gt;Sorrel Kerbel -  The Routledge Encyclopedia of Jewish Writers 1135456070 2004 -"The repeated attacks made on Singer's anti-communist attitudes embittered him, and after the appearance of his first novel, Shtol un ayzn (Steel and Iron), "&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Nay Rusland]]'' (Eng: ''New Russia) (1928)
* ''[[Yoshe Kalb]]'' (1932). Also titled ''The Sinners'', Liveright Pub., NY (1933) 
* ''[[The Brothers Ashkenazi]]'' (1936)
* ''[[Friling]]'' (1937)
*  ''East of Eden,'' (originally titled ''Khaver Nachman'') published by Alfred J. Knopf (1939)

* ''[[The River Breaks Up]]'' published by Alfred Knopf (1938); republished by Vanguard Press, NY (1966)
* ''[[Dertseylungen]]''  (English: ''Stories''); published posthumously, 1949

In the introduction to ''A Treasury of Yiddish Stories'', [[Irving Howe]] and Eliezer Greenberg stated that Singer's books are organized "in a way that satisfies the usual Western expectations as to literary structure. His novels resemble the kind of family chronicle popular in Europe several decades ago [that is, the turn of the century]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Howe |editor1-first=Irving |editor1-link=Irving Howe |editor2-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Eliezer |title=A treasury of Yiddish stories |location=New York |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |year=1954 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Oskar Sverre Lucien Henri Guillou''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈjɑːn ɡɪˈjuː}}, {{IPA-fr|ɡiju|lang}}; born 17 January 1944) is a French-Swedish author and journalist. Among his books are a series of [[spy fiction]] novels about a spy named [[Carl Hamilton (fictional character)|Carl Hamilton]], and a trilogy(+) of [[historical fiction]] novels about a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]], [[Arn Magnusson]]. He is the owner of one of the largest publishing companies in Sweden, [[Piratförlaget]] (''Pirate Publishing''), together with his wife, publisher [[Ann-Marie Skarp]], and [[Liza Marklund]].

Guillou's fame in Sweden was established during his time as an investigative journalist. In 1973, he and co-reporter [[Peter Bratt]] exposed a secret intelligence organization in Sweden, ''[[Informationsbyrån]]'' (IB). He is still active within journalism as a column writer for the Swedish evening [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Aftonbladet]]''.

In October 2009, the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Expressen]]'' accused Guillou of having been active as an agent of the Soviet spy organization [[KGB]] between 1967 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/International/nyhetssidor/arkiv.asp?ProgramID=2054&amp;Artikel=3193990 Guillou's Cold War Reports to the KGB]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

He studied at [[Vasa Real]] in Stockholm but was expelled from the school because of his bad behaviour; including [[physical abuse]], theft and [[blackmail]].&lt;ref name=hagen /&gt; He then went on to study for two years at the Solbacka [[boarding school]] in Södermanland.&lt;ref name=hagen /&gt; He finished his ''[[studentexamen]]'' (upper-secondary final examination) from the boarding school Viggbyholmsskolan, located in [[Viggbyholm]], in 1964.&lt;ref name=hagen /&gt; Guillou has described his upbringing, with the continuous physical abuse from his [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] stepfather and the harsh treatment at the Solbacka school, in the semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Ondskan (novel)|Ondskan]]'' (1981). According to the Swedish tabloid newspaper [[Expressen]], his mother, his sister, his teachers and his friends from the Solbacka school have contested his account and called the book a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/1.50142/skolkamraterna-jan-guillou-ljuger Skolkamraterna: Jan Guillou ljuger] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920141156/http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.50142/skolkamraterna-jan-guillou-ljuger |date=20 September 2011 }}.

===Family===
Guillou was married first to the author and translator Marina Stagh, with whom he has two children, Dan (born 1970) and Ann-Linn (born 1972) Guillou. His daughter Ann-Linn, a journalist and feminist commentator, lives in a [[civil union]] with Sandra Andersson, daughter of film director [[Roy Andersson]].&lt;ref name=ritzen /&gt;

He is now married to publisher Ann-Marie Skarp. He has an apartment in the [[Östermalm]] district of [[Stockholm]], where he has lived for most of his adult life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Agneta |last=Ullenius |title=Ridderliga Östermalm |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/artikel_37317.svd |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=21 September 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2008 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a country residence in Flybo, [[Östhammar Municipality]], northern [[Roslagen]], where he lives when he writes his books.&lt;ref name=hagen /&gt;

===Employment===
Guillou started his career as a journalist writing for the magazine ''[[FIB aktuellt]]'' from 1966 to 1967. He later co-founded the ''[[Folket i Bild/Kulturfront]]'' magazine, at which he worked from 1972 until 1977. He currently writes a column for Aftonbladet and   also comments occasionally in other news outlets on current events usually taking the left-wing and the Anti-American side, particularly the conflicts in the Middle East and miscellaneous domestic issues, including the United States' [[War on Terrorism]], Israeli policy towards the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], the [[Swedish Security Service]], Swedish courtroom procedures and public inquiries.

Guillou has served as the host of several television programmes: ''[[Magazinet (television programme)|Magazinet]]'' (1981–1984), ''[[Rekordmagazinet]]'' (last years together with [[Göran Skytte]]) and ''[[Grabbarna på Fagerhult]]'' (together with [[Pär Lorentzon]] and [[Leif G. W. Persson]]), all shown on [[Sveriges Television]].

He co-authored the crime/drama television series ''[[Talismanen]]'' ([[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], 2003). In the series, Guillou and co-author [[Henning Mankell]] both play the roles of themselves. Guillou also authored and narrated the history documentary series ''[[Arns rike]]'' (TV4, 2004) and ''[[Häxornas tid]]'' (TV4, 2005).

== The IB affair ==
{{Main|Informationsbyrån}}

In 1973, ''[[Folket i Bild/Kulturfront]]'', a left-wing magazine, published a series of articles  written by Guillou and [[Peter Bratt]], revealing a Swedish secret intelligence agency called ''[[Informationsbyrån]]'' ("The Information Bureau" or ''IB'' for short).&lt;ref&gt;Aid, Matthew M. and Cees Wiebes. ''Secrets of Signals Intelligence During the Cold War and Beyond''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7146-8182-2}}, p. 224-225.&lt;/ref&gt; The articles, based on information initially furnished by former IB employee Håkan Isacson,&lt;ref name="Bratt" /&gt; described the IB as a secret organization that gathered information on Swedish communists and others deemed to be "security risks". The organization operated outside of the framework of the defense and ordinary intelligence, and was invisible in terms of state budget allocations. The articles in ''Folket i Bild/Kulturfront'' accused the IB staff of being engaged in alleged murder, break-ins, wiretapping against foreign embassies in Sweden and spying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Bratt, Peter and Jan Guillou. [http://fib.se/fib_1/IB/svespi73.html "Sveriges spionage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107110551/http://fib.se/fib_1/IB/svespi73.html |date=7 November 2009 }}, FiB/Kulturfront, 2:9, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exposure of the IB in the magazine, which included [[headshots]] with names and social security numbers of some of the alleged staff published under the headline "Spies",&lt;ref&gt;Bratt, Peter and Jan Guillou. [http://fib.se/fib_1/IB/spioner.html "Spioner"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825220612/http://fib.se/fib_1/IB/spioner.html |date=25 August 2010 }}. FiB/Kulturfront 2:9, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; led to a major domestic political scandal known as the "IB affair" (''IB-affären''). The activities ascribed to this secret outfit and its alleged ties to the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] were denied by Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]], Defense Minister Sven Andersson and the chief of the Swedish defence forces, [[Stig Synnergren]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.regeringen.se/download/69ef2f13.pdf?major=1&amp;minor=449&amp;cn=attachmentPublDuplicator_0_attachment Det grå brödraskapet.

According to Bratt, the verdict required some stretching of established judicial practice on the part of the court since none of them were accused of having acted in collusion with a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;Bratt ibid p.169&lt;/ref&gt; After one appeal Guillou's sentence was lessened from one year to 10 months. Guillou and Bratt served part of their sentence in [[solitude|solitary cells]]. Guillou was kept first at [[Långholmen Prison]] in central Stockholm and later at [[Österåker Prison]] north of the capital.

==The CIA affair==
In 1976, two employees of Sveriges Radio contacted Guillou at Folket i Bild/Kulturfront with a story of a colleague that had been recruited by a CIA officer in Stockholm. They had earlier been turned down by a major newspaper, and now asked the journalist that had exposed IB if he could publish the story. The three worked out a scenario where the CIA recruiter could be legally accused of espionage, and instructed the recruit to collect evidence thereof. Unbelievable enough, the CIA officer agreed to give his spy written instructions of what information to retrieve, so the informal counter-intelligence group had only to stockpile these, take photographs of the two spies meeting, and discuss how much they needed before the final exposure would be made.

The recruited spy was at a later meeting instructed to go to Angola with orders to get information about both military and political conditions. The legally experienced within the group advised their double agent not to agree, but he went anyway. Afterwards, the group assembled to write a false report about the conditions in the civil war-ridden country. Before the three could finalize the entire story for publishing, the spy went to Angola a second time, now with additional tasks on his instruction sheet.

After the spy had returned to Sweden, Guillou in advance placed the article in a major newspaper and with a television news editor. He also contacted the Foreign Department in order to prevent official denials, and discuss the repercussions of the espionage exposure. The published article was a true 'scoop', and the CIA spy handler was ordered to leave Sweden together with a colleague. The spy himself, avoided prosecution thanks to the article's portrayal of him as a rather heroic journalist, exposing foreign illegal operations to the public. Afterwards, both he and Jan Guillou were interrogated by the Swedish Security Service, but for assumed political reasons, no criminal charges were made. This time, the system worked to the journalist's advantage.

==Swedish tabloid accusing Guillou of being a "secret agent for the Soviet Union"==
During a five-year period starting at 1967 Jan Guillou had a series of meetings with [[KGB]] representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/avslojar/1.1754572/jan-guillou-hemlig-agent-at-sovjet ''Expressen'', 24 October 2009: ''Jan Guillou hemlig agent åt Sovjet''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025082302/http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/avslojar/1.1754572/jan-guillou-hemlig-agent-at-sovjet |date=25 October 2009 }} ("Guillou secret agent for Soviet Union") {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 the Swedish news tabloid ''[[Expressen]]'' told this story under the headline "Guillou [[secret agent]] for Soviet Union". The Swedish security service Säpo at the time knew of the contacts from Guillou's colleague Arne Lemberg, who suspected the activities could be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/avslojar/1.1754572/jan-guillou-hemlig-agent-at-sovjet Jan Guillou hemlig agent åt Sovjet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025082302/http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/avslojar/1.1754572/jan-guillou-hemlig-agent-at-sovjet |date=25 October 2009 }} (Guillou secret agent for Soviet Union). ''Expressen'', 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jan Guillou his intention was to expose the KGB espionage journalistically through a scoop based on the activities he was being exposed to and the discussions he had with his KGB contact Jevgenij Gergel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_3700515.svd Svenska Dagbladet, 24 October 2009: ''Jan Guillou arbetade för KGB''] ("Jan Guillou worked for KGB") {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the journalists who wrote the articles later commented that he believed Guillou's explanation, "I do not doubt one word of what he has said".&lt;ref name="aftonbladet.se"&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article6860403.ab Expressens förlorade scoop om Guillou&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillou received payment from KGB for written reports on Swedish politics, and ''Expressen'' points to this fact when defending its choice to refer to Guillou as a [[secret agent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/international/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?nyheter=1&amp;programid=2054&amp;Artikel=3190190 Jan Guillou Admits KGB Contacts]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. SR International – Radio Sweden, 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/22848/20091024/ Writer Guillou admits KGB connection]. TT/The Local, 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Former KGB Colonel and defector [[Sergei Tretyakov (intelligence officer)|Sergey Tretyakov]] characterised Guillou as a "classic agent". "Because he accepted money and, worst of all, signed receipts, there's no question about it. The handling of him could be a schoolbook example at the KGB school in Moscow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/1.2009117/jan-guillou-var-kgb-agent |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603042532/http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/1.2009117/jan-guillou-var-kgb-agent |archive-date=3 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Espionage prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand wrote to PON that "[[Espionage#Agents in espionage|Agent]] and [[spy]] are not synonymous ideas .... an agent does not have to commit acts of espionage. An agent can perform assignments for his handler without crossing the line to what is prosecutable."

Säpo at the time was skeptical towards Lemberg's report and commented that it found nothing illegal in a newspaper man writing an article based on public information and delivering it to Jevgenij Gergel.&lt;ref name="aftonbladet.se" /&gt;

The public [[Ombudsman]] of the Swedish Press, [[Yrsa Stenius]], later concluded that ''Expressen'''s presentation of facts had been an example of irresponsible journalism. According to her, ''Expressen'' had not backed up its frontpage assertion, that "Jan Guillou [was a] Secret Soviet Agent", despite the fact that this had caused "massive" damage to Guillou's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article6792521.ab&lt;/ref&gt; Stenius's conclusion caused controversy, and a number of newspaper leader writers demanded that she resign her post.

On 1 June 2010 The Swedish Press Council [PON] acquitted ''Expressen'' of wrongdoing. ''Expressen'' denies having claimed that Guillou was guilty of the crime of "espionage", and PON agrees. The frontpage and headline assertions ("Guillou Secret Soviet Agent", "Confesses KGB mission", "Recruited by chief of espionage") according to PON "do not have well defined meanings". PON was also satisfied that the factual details of the story were fully covered in the text of the articles which also included Guillou's own account of the events.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio1" /&gt;

== Political views ==
During the 1960s and early 1970s, Guillou was associated with the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Clarté]] association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=IB-affären |url=http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p3/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2519&amp;Artikel=1435314 |series=P3 Dokumentär |credits=producer: Fredrik Johnsson |network=[[Sveriges Radio]] |station=[[Sveriges Radio P3|P3]] |location=[[Stockholm]] |airdate=2007-06-17 |season=4 |number=1 |minutes=21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228020811/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p3/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2519&amp;Artikel=1435314 |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Communist League Marxist-Leninists (Sweden)|Communist Party of Sweden]] (formerly known as the Communist League Marxists-Leninists), a minor Maoist party active mainly during the 1970s, for six months until he was expelled for refusing to pay the monthly member fee while he was living abroad. Today, he no longer considers himself a Communist or a Maoist, but describes himself as socialist with a position on the [[political spectrum]] "to the left of the [[Swedish Left Party|Left Party]]" (a Swedish party formerly known as "The Left Party, the Communists").&lt;ref name=hagen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/1.1760148/har-fortsatter-chatten-med-jan-guillou Här fortsätter chatten med Jan Guillou] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031085331/http://www.expressen.se/Nyheter/1.1760148/har-fortsatter-chatten-med-jan-guillou |date=31 October 2009 }} (The chat with Jan Guillou continues here). ''Expressen'', 28 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the Middle East===
Guillou is known for his support of the [[Palestinian people]], and he has over the years consistently criticized Israel. In 1976, he wrote, "[[Zionism]] is in its foundation [[Racism|racist]] because [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|the state of Israel is built upon an apartheid system]], exactly like [[South Africa under apartheid|South Africa]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guillou |first=Jan |year=1976 |title=Sionism är rasism |journal=[[Folket i Bild/Kulturfront]] |issue=1 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has repeatedly taken the stance that Israel is an "apartheid state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jan |last=Guillou |title=Så tystas kritik mot israelisk apartheid |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0104/16/guillou.html |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2001-04-16 |accessdate=2006-08-02 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' in 1977, Guillou wrote, "I'm an optimist, I believe that Israel will cease to exist prior to [[Armageddon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jan |last=Guillou |title=Jag är optimist |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=13 March 1977 |page=3 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Irak – det nya Arabien'' (''Iraq – The New Arabia''), written by Guillou and his then-wife Marina Stagh, was published in 1977. In the book, which deals with Iraq under the [[Baath Party]] before Saddam Hussein's presidency, it is argued that the "European idea of Iraq as a particularly violent country" is simply "a blend of political propaganda and racist fantasies" (p.&amp;nbsp;91). Guillou and Stagh did the research for the book in 1975 and they assert that, at this time, "the Baath regime is clearly popular and among the most stable in the [[Arab World]]" (pp.&amp;nbsp;168–169), the [[freedom of the press]] enjoyed in Iraq was more extensive than in most other countries in the world (p.&amp;nbsp;239) and it would come as no surprise to the authors if "well before the year 2000, Iraq will have surpassed European countries in [[Standard of living|living standards]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;174).

The conditions at the [[Abu Ghraib prison]], which Guillou claims to have visited as the first Western journalist, are described as excellent and even "better than Swedish prisons" (pp.&amp;nbsp;249–250).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Irak–det nya Arabian |last=Guillou |first=Jan |author2=Stagh, Marina |year=1977 |publisher=[[Norstedt]] |location=[[Stockholm]] |isbn=91-1-761371-X |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published two years before Saddam Hussein became President of Iraq in 1979. In his 2009 autobiography, ''Ordets makt och vanmakt'' (''The Power and Powerlessness of the Word''), Guillou states that quotes such as the ones cited could be considered true back then. He does however also write that Saddam Hussein, who at the time of publishing was the vice-president under President [[Ahmed Hassan Al Bakr]], was the actual leader of Iraq.

===On the United States===
Immediately following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Guillou caused controversy when he walked out of the [[Göteborg Book Fair]] in the midst of the three [[Moment of silence|minutes of silence]] observed throughout Europe to honour the victims of the attacks. In an article in ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', Guillou argued that the event was an act of hypocrisy, stating that "the U.S. is the great mass murderer of our time. The wars against Vietnam and its nearby countries alone [[Vietnam War casualties|claimed]] four million lives. Without a minute of silence in Sweden". He also criticised those who said that the attacks were "an attack on us all" by stating that the attacks were only "an attack on [[American imperialism|U.S. imperialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jan |last=Guillou |title=Vi blev tvångs- kommenderade att bli amerikaner |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,89840,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306140912/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0%2C2789%2C89840%2C00.html |archivedate= 6 March 2005 |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2001-09-17 |accessdate=2006-08-02 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He labeled the media's reaction to the [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]] and the measures taken to avoid havoc at the airports unnecessary since the suspects had already been caught. He argued that the media coverage was sensationalist and driven by profit considerations, and that the British government used the occasion to give an impression of success in the [[War on Terror]]ism. Pointing out that no explosives had been found, he wrote in a column headlined "Don't believe anything written about [[al-Qaida]]" that the reactions had resulted in a victimization of the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jan |last=Guillou |title=Tro aldrig på någonting som skrivs om al-Qaida (Don't believe anything written about al-Qaida) |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,874233,00.html |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2006-08-20 |accessdate=2006-08-02 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821194919/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,874233,00.html |archivedate=21 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On other issues ===
Ever since the [[Informationsbyrån|IB affair]] and the resulting prison sentence for espionage in 1973, Guillou has been a strong critic of the Swedish Security Service. According to Guillou, the Security Service has listed him as a terrorist, which has led to problems with security officials when visiting other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jan |last=Guillou |title=Väpnad kamp mot förtryck är ingen tebjudning |url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9807/27/guillou.html |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=1998-07-27 |accessdate=2008-03-03 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Guillou has repeatedly criticised some people and groups within the Swedish [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] movement.&lt;ref name=ritzen&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Ritzén |title=Räddad–av sin hjälte |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/bocker/intervjuer/article397956.ab |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2008-03-03 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he rejects being called an "[[Antifeminism|antifeminist]]".&lt;ref name=ritzen /&gt;

Guillou has also attracted controversy over his views on homosexuality. He has said that "homosexuality is more of a vogue phenomenon than something you're born into. It's something that has come and gone through history"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anna-Maria |last=Wiklund |title=Homosexualitet är snarare en trend |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,874233,00.html |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2002-08-02 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821194919/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,874233,00.html |archivedate=21 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "homosexuality didn't exist in the 17th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Therese |last=Garthman |title=Straffad machorebell |url=http://varnpliktsnytt.com/vemfan.php?id=534&amp;datum=2003-03-11 |publisher=Värnpliktsnytt |date=2003-03-11 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |language=Swedish }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial draft of an eleventh novel, along with Guillou's account on why it could not be completed, was published as ''[[Hamlon]]'' in 1995.  Guillou stated that ''En medborgare höjd över varje misstanke'' was the last book and in order to make sure that Hamilton would never return, Guillou "banished" him from Sweden through a life sentence. Since he only intended to write about Sweden, no other book would be possible. However, when he was working on ''Madame Terror'', he realised that he needed Hamilton to fill in a specific role.  After Hamilton had been revived as a character, he made another major appearance in ''Men inte om det gäller din dotter'', where his life sentence was lifted. Guillou thereby cleared the way for new appearances by Hamilton in future books.

=== Crusades trilogy ===
{{Main|Crusades trilogy}}

After finishing the [[Coq Rouge]] series, Guillou wrote a [[The Knight Templar (Crusades trilogy)|trilogy]] about Arn Magnusson, a fictional Swedish character from the Middle Ages forced to become a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]]. The series is an account of the life of Arn Magnusson, a fictional character who becomes a witness as well as a catalyst to many important historical events, both in his homeland of Sweden and in the crusades against the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Ballif Straubhaar, "A Birth Certificate for Sweden, Packaged for Postmoderns: Jan Guillou's Templar Trilogy," in ''The Year's Work in Medievalism'' 15 (2002), ed. Jesse Swan and Richard Utz.&lt;/ref&gt;
The trilogy, dubbed the ''Crusades trilogy'', consists of the following books:
* ''[[The Road to Jerusalem]]'', originally ''Vägen till Jerusalem'' (1998)
* ''[[The Knight Templar]]'', originally ''Tempelriddaren'' (1999), {{ISBN|0-7528-4650-7}}
* ''[[The Kingdom at the End of the Road]]'', originally ''Riket vid vägens slut'' (2000)

Guillou also wrote a follow-up novel about [[Birger Jarl]], founder of Stockholm, entitled ''[[The Heritage of Arn]]'' (''Arvet efter Arn'', 2001). In Guillou's fictional universe, Birger Jarl is the grandson of Arn Magnusson.

===''Ondskan''===
Guillou has written an autobiographical book about his school years, ''[[Ondskan (book)|Ondskan]]'' (1981), which also became a film, ''[[Evil (movie)|Evil]]'' (2003). The movie was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2003. Guillou, still listed as a terrorist by the US government, was unable to attend. He managed to get a visa, but it was linked to attending the Academy Award ceremony, and director [[Mikael Håfström]] had already given Guillou's ticket to his own wife instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Karin |last=Lindstedt |title=Guillou snuvad på Oscarsgalan |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/film/article10435829.ab |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2014-03-24 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dattatreya Balkrushna Kalelkar''' (1 December 1885 &amp;ndash; 21 August 1981), popularly known as '''Kaka Kalelkar''', was an [[India]]n independence activist, social reformer and journalist. He was a major follower of the philosophy and methods of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

==Life==
Kalelkar was born in [[Satara (city)|Satara]] on 1 December 1885. He was native of Kaleli village near [[Sawantwadi]] in [[Maharashtra]] which gave his surname Kalelkar. He matriculated in 1903 and completed B. A. in Philosophy from [[Fergusson College]], [[Pune]] in 1907. He appeared in the first year examination of LL.B. and joined Ganesh Vidyalaya in Belgaum in 1908. He worked for a while on the editorial staff of a nationalistic Marathi daily named ''Rashtramat'', and then as a teacher at a school named Ganganath Vidyalaya in [[Baroda]] in 1910. Within a few years, the British government forcibly closed down the school because of its nationalistic spirit in 1912. He traveled to Himalaya on foot and later joined [[Acharya Kripalani]] in visit to [[Burma]] ([[Myanmar]]) in 1913. He met [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=agsi&gt;{{cite book|title=અર્વાચીન ગુજરાતી સાહિત્યનો ઈતિહાસ : ગાંધીયુગ અને અનુગાંધીયુગ (History of Modern Gujarati Literature:Gandhi Era and Post-Gandhi Era)|language=gu|last=Brahmabhatt|first=Prasad|publisher=Parshwa Publication|pages=38–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was imprisoned several times due to his participation in [[Indian independence movement]]. He retired from Gujarat Vidyapith in 1939.&lt;ref name=agsi/&gt;

In 1935, Kalelkar became member of ''Rashtabhasha Samiti'', a committee whose objective was to popularize [[Hindi]]-[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] language as the national language of India. He was active with Gandhi Smarak Nidhi from 1948 to his death.&lt;ref name=agsi/&gt;

The [[LGBT slang]] terms '''lesbian until graduation''' ('''LUG'''),&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Rimer, Sara (June 5, 1993). [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/05/us/campus-lesbians-step-into-unfamiliar-light.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Campus Lesbians Step Into Unfamiliar Light"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''gay until graduation''' ('''GUG'''), and '''bisexual until graduation''' ('''BUG''') are used to describe women primarily of [[high school]] or [[college]] age who are assumed to be experimenting with or adopting a temporary [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] identity. The term suggests that the woman to whom it is applied will ultimately adopt a strictly [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] identity.

== Usage ==
In a 1999 article in the ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', A. Davis related her experimentation with [[same-sex relationship]]s, and how as a result, she experienced hostility from [[lesbian]] friends who pressured her to identify as a [[bisexuality|bisexual]], including one friend who urged her to do so as a political statement, despite the fact that Davis identifies as a [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] who merely experimented with women for a brief period.  Davis claimed that women who experienced same-sex relationships are more attuned to LGBT issues, and more likely to oppose discrimination.  She also claimed that if the same attitudes{{Which|date=August 2015}} were applied to men who experimented with [[homosexuality]], it would promote greater acceptance of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=SeattleWeekly&gt;Davis, A.

'''Lionel George Logue''', [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (26 February 1880 – 12 April 1953) was an Australian [[speech and language therapist]] and amateur [[stage actor]] who successfully treated, among others, [[George VI|King George VI]], who had a pronounced [[Stuttering|stammer]].

==Early life and family==
Lionel George Logue was born in [[College Town, South Australia|College Town]], [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], the oldest of four children. His grandfather Edward Logue, originally from [[Dublin]], in 1856 founded [[Logue's Brewery]], a predecessor of the [[South Australian Brewing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy|author1 =Logue, Mark |author2 =Peter Conradi|year=2010|publisher=Quercus, London|page=15|isbn=978-0-85738-110-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were George Edward Logue, an accountant at his grandfather's brewery who later managed the Burnside Hotel and Elephant and Castle Hotel, and Lavinia Rankin.&lt;ref name="Logue and Conradi, p. 16"&gt;Logue and Conradi, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a Catholic himself, he was reportedly related to [[Michael Logue]], who was the Roman Catholic [[Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'', Friday, 27 May 2011 [http://www.rte.ie/player/#v=1099454]&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Prince Alfred College]] between 1889 and 1896. Unable to decide what to study, Logue came across [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow's]] ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The poetical works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|author=Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth|year=1876|publisher=Osgood &amp; Co|location=Boston|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What inspired Logue was the rhythm and he decided to put his interest in voices to good use.&lt;ref name="Logue and Conradi, p. 16"/&gt; After leaving school at sixteen, he received [[elocution]] training from Edward Reeves. Reeves had moved to Adelaide in 1878 and taught elocution to his pupils by day and gave popular recitals to audiences in Victoria Hall by night. Logue worked for Reeves as a secretary and assistant teacher from 1902, while studying music at the [[University of Adelaide]]'s [[Elder Conservatorium]]. While working for Reeves, Logue began to give recitals of his own for which he was praised for his "clear, powerful voice."&lt;ref&gt;Logue and Conradi, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1896 South Australian Election.jpg|thumb|right|Adelaide, 1896]]
After his father died on 17 November 1902, Logue set up his own practice as a teacher of elocution. By 1904, he had gained a good reputation and was receiving praise from the local newspapers.&lt;ref name="Logue and Conradi, p. 19"&gt;Logue and Conradi, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he decided to take a contract with an engineering firm some {{convert|2000|km|mi}} westward in [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Western Australia]], installing an electricity supply at a gold mine.&lt;ref name="Logue and Conradi, p. 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150145b.htm|title=Logue, Lionel George (1880–1953)|first=Suzanne|last=Edgar|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
His professional career began in [[Perth]], where, in addition to teaching elocution, acting, and public speaking, he put on plays and recitations, and also founded a club for public speakers. He was also involved with Perth's [[Young Men's Christian Association]] and schools such as [[Methodist Ladies' College, Perth|Methodist Ladies' College]], [[Loreto Convent, Claremont|Loreto Convent]], [[Scotch College, Perth|Scotch College]], [[Old Perth Technical School|Perth Technical School]], and [[Claremont Teachers College]].

In 1911, Logue and his wife set out on a tour of the world to study methods of public speaking. Later he developed treatments for Australian [[First World War]] war veterans who had [[shell shock]]{{ndash}}induced [[Speech and language pathology|impaired speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stutteringhelp.org/default.aspx?tabindex=822&amp;tabid=835|title=Stuttering and The King's Speech |publisher=The Stuttering Foundation|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to physical exercises, which helped with patients' breathing, Logue's distinctive therapy emphasised humour, patience, and "superhuman sympathy".

In 1924, Logue took his wife and three sons to England, ostensibly for a holiday. Once there, he 
took jobs teaching elocution at schools around London, and in 1926 he opened a speech-defect practice at 146 [[Harley Street]]. Logue used fees paid by wealthy clients to subsidise patients unable to pay.  It was here that the Duke of York{{snd}}the future [[King George VI]]{{snd}}sought Logue's help.&lt;ref&gt;Logue and Conradi, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Logue became a founding fellow of the [[Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leader.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=2278981|title=Lionel Logue: A Pioneer in Speech-Language Pathology|first=Caroline|last=Bowen|work=The Asha Leader|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of George VI===
Before ascending the throne as George VI, the Duke of York dreaded public speaking because of a severe [[stammer]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stammering.org/publicspeech.html|title=Public Speech and Public Silence|authorlink=Margaret Drabble|first=Margaret|last=Drabble|publisher=The British Stammering Association|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; his closing speech at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] on 31&amp;nbsp;October 1925 proved an ordeal for speaker and listeners alike. Resolved to find some way to manage his stammer, the Duke engaged Logue in 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bousfield|first=Arthur|author2=Toffoli, Garry |title=Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, 1900–2002: The Queen Mother and Her Century|publisher=Dundurn Group (CA)|year=2002|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6PQ84ovPcMC&amp;pg=PA50|isbn=1-55002-391-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Lionel Logue|date=13 April 1953|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|page=8|accessdate=29 April 2011|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/archive/page/1953-04-13/8.html |url-access=subscription |issue=52,594}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being introduced to Logue by [[Lord Stamfordham]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-12607852 Note reveals story behind King's speech film], 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosing poor co-ordination between the Duke's [[larynx]] and [[thoracic diaphragm]], Logue prescribed a daily hour of vocal exercises. Logue's treatment gave the Duke the confidence to relax&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erickson|first=Carolly|title=''Lilibet: An Intimate Portrait of Elizabeth II''|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2005|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOeFJymoZQ4C&amp;pg=PA15|isbn=0-312-33938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avoid tension-induced muscle spasms. As a result, he suffered only the occasional hesitancy in speech. By 1927, he was speaking confidently and managed his address at the opening of the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/official-opening-canberra/clip2/|title=Official Opening of Canberra by His Royal Highness the Duke of York |date=1927 |publisher=Australian [[National Film and Sound Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; without stammering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shawcross|first=William|authorlink=William Shawcross|title=The Queen Mother: The Official Biography|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2009|page=460|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hH3ueeoWy2kC&amp;pg=PT460|isbn=1-4000-4304-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logue worked with the Duke through the 1930s and 40s. He used [[tongue-twister]]s&lt;ref&gt;According to Sreedharan (2007), p. 100, two of the tongue twisters were "Let's go gathering healthy heather with the gay brigade of grand dragons", and "She sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve".&lt;/ref&gt; to help his patient rehearse for major speeches, his [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation as King]] and his radio broadcasts to the [[British Empire]] throughout the [[Second World War]]. The two men remained friends until the King's death.

==Honours==
In 1944, King George VI appointed Logue a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO), elevating him from Member of the Order (MVO), which was conferred upon Logue at the time of George VI's Coronation.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34396|date=11 May 1937|page=3084 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36544|date=2 June 1944|page=2571 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[David Seidler]] (screenwriter)|date=2010|title=[[The King's Speech]]|medium=Motion picture|publisher=See-Saw Films|location=UK|time=1:51:43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King George VI died on 6 February 1952. On 26 February 1952, Logue wrote to the late king's consort, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], stating that since 1926 the king:

{{cquote|...honoured me, by allowing me to help him with his speech, and no man ever worked as hard as he did, and achieved such a grand result. During all those years you were a tower of strength to him and he has often told me how much he has owed to you, and the excellent result could never have been achieved if it had not been for your help. I have never forgotten your gracious help to me after my own beloved girl [Logue's wife, Myrtle] passed on.&lt;ref&gt;Logue to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, 26 February 1952, The National Archives (U.K.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Queen Mother replied two days later:  
{{cquote|...I think that I know perhaps better than anyone just how much you helped the King, not only with his speech, but through that his whole life and outlook on life. I shall always be deeply grateful to you for all you did for him. He was such a splendid person and I don't believe that he ever thought of himself at all. I did so hope that he might have been allowed a few years of comparative peace after the many anguished years he has had to battle through so bravely.  But it was not to be.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen Mother to Lionel Logue, 28 February 1952, The National Archives (U.K.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Walker|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/8182390/Queen-Elizabeths-posthumous-endorsement-of-Lionel-Logue.html|title=Queen Elizabeth's posthumous endorsement of Lionel Logue|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=6 December 2010|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Lionel Logue 1906.jpg|thumb|250px|Logue with Myrtle Gruenert at the time of their engagement in Perth in 1906]]

Logue married Myrtle Gruenert, a 21-year-old clerk, at [[St George's Cathedral, Perth|St George's Anglican Cathedral]], [[Perth, Australia|Perth]], on 20 March 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Logue and Conradi, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; They had three sons,&lt;ref&gt;Logue and Conradi, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine, Laurie, and Anthony—Valentine trained at [[King's College London]] and [[St George's Hospital]] and went on to become one of the most distinguished neurosurgeons of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E008745b.htm|title=Logue, Valentine (1913 - 2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionel Logue was a [[Freemason]], initiated, passed, and raised in 1908, and became [[Worshipful Master]] in 1919; he was a member of St. George's Lodge (now J.D. Stevenson St. George's Lodge No.6, Western Australian Constitution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.mastermason.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=9081&amp;title=film-the-kings-speech |work=Mastermason.com Forums |title=Film "The King's Speech" |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816152051/http://forum.mastermason.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=9081&amp;title=film-the-kings-speech |archivedate=16 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/ugle-sgc/ugle/item/286-the-kings-freemasonry|work=Freemasonry Today magazine|title=The King's Freemasonry|date= March 2011|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in a 25-room Victorian villa called Beechgrove in [[Sydenham]] from before 1933 until about 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydenham.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3932|title=Beachgrove, 111 Sydenham Hill|publisher=www.sydenham.org.uk|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/15/ian-jack-the-kings-speech|title=Lionel Logue and the king|authorlink=Ian Jack|first=Ian|last=Jack|date=15 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Myrtle died in June 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awesomestories.com/assets/lionel-logue-laurie-jo|title=Lionel Logue – At the End of his Life|work=Awesome Stories|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Logue died, in London, on 12 April 1953. His funeral was held 17 April in [[Holy Trinity, Brompton]] before his body was cremated.&lt;ref name="Deaths19530414"&gt;{{cite news|title=Deaths|date=14 April 1953|work=The Times|location=London|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] attended the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Circular|date=18 April 1953|work=The Times|location=London|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
With [[Peter Conradi]], Logue's grandson Mark wrote a book, ''[[The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy]]'', about his grandfather's relationship with the king.&lt;ref name="Logue and Conradi"&gt;{{cite book|title=The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy|author1 =Logue, Mark |author2 =Peter Conradi|year=2010|publisher=Quercus, London|isbn=978-0-85738-110-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short title was used for the 2010 British film ''[[The King's Speech]]'', a historical drama written by [[David Seidler]], in which Logue was played by [[Geoffrey Rush]] and his patient by [[Colin Firth]]. In February 2011, ''The King's Speech'' won four [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Firth. Rush was nominated for an Academy Award and won a 2010 [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] for his portrayal of Logue in the film.

In the West End stage adaptation of ''[[The King's Speech (play)|The King's Speech]]'' at [[Wyndham's Theatre]], Australian actor [[Jonathan Hyde]] played Lionel Logue.

Welsh actor Michael Elwyn played Logue in the 2002 television film ''[[Bertie and Elizabeth]]''.

Derek Lawson portrayed Logue in the 2015 comedy ''[[A Royal Night Out]]''.

[[File:Lupara.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A homemade lupara]]
'''Lupara''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] word used to refer to a [[sawn-off shotgun]] of the [[Break-action|break-open type]]. It is traditionally associated with [[La Cosa Nostra]], the [[Italy|Italian]] [[organized crime]] group dominant in [[Sicily]] for their use of it in [[Feud|vendetta]]s, defence —such as its use against [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] army when he decided to break up the Sicilian mafioso network—and [[hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chalker |first=Dennis| authorlink=Dennis Chalker |title=One Perfect Op : an Insider’s Account of the Navy Seal Special Warfare Teams |author2=Dockery  | year= 2002|publisher= Morrow|location=New York |isbn=0-671-02465-5| page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortened barrel (or barrels) of a lupara lend themselves to easier handling in wooded areas, or to easier concealment and indoor employment in urban areas. The absence of [[Shotgun#Pattern_and_choke|choke]] and the shortened barrel contribute to a wider spread of shot than that of a choked full length gun.

==Terminology==
The word ''lupara'' means literally "for the wolf", reflecting its traditional use in [[wolf hunting]].  The word achieved wider recognition through [[Mario Puzo]]'s bestselling novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' in which the lupara is used extensively by the mafia in Sicily, including [[Michael Corleone]]'s bodyguards.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;{{cite book |last=Puzo |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Puzo| title=The Godfather |year= 2002|publisher= NAL|location=New York |isbn=978-0-451-20576-6  |pages=192, 203, 329, 335, 337, 349}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

From the word ''lupara'' comes the Italian expression ''[[lupara bianca]]'' (white lupara), a term especially used by journalists to refer to a mafia-style slaying in which the victim's body is deliberately hidden.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/lupara/| title=Lupara|editor=[[Vocabolario Treccani]] online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous usage==
An early example of criminal use of the weapon in the United States was the assassination of the [[New Orleans]] [[chief of police]], [[David Hennessy]], in October 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Tom|title=The Crescent City Murders|year=2007|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=1-59228-901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chief Hennessy was shot in an ambush, four luparas were found at the murder scene.&lt;ref&gt;Reppetto, Thomas (2004). ''American Mafia.''Henry Holt and Company LLC. {{ISBN|0-8050-7210-1}}, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The murder punctuated a rivalry between gangs of Sicilian fruit company [[stevedore]]s whose contracts did not fall under the auspices of the local longshoreman's union. A pile of sawn-off shotguns was displayed after the murder, including a homemade gun with a folding iron stock, and another with a hook on its stock to brace against the arm when firing one armed. [[Anti-Italian]] provocation, following the failed prosecution of a group of suspected men, resulted in a mob assault on the New Orleans Parish Prison and the subsequent lynching of many Italian prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E1D81239E033A25756C1A9659C94609ED7CF Chief Hennessy avenged], The New York Times, March 15, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/la/orleans/newspapers/00000077.txt Anti-Italian Mood Led to 1891 Lynchings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219003506/http://files.usgwarchives.org/la/orleans/newspapers/00000077.txt |date=2012-02-19 }}, Times Picayune Newspaper, March 14, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Luparas figure prominently in ''[[The Godfather]]''; in the movie, they are carried by [[Michael Corleone]]'s bodyguards Calo ([[Franco Citti]]) and Fabrizio ([[Angelo Infanti]]).

'''Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth''' ({{lang-gu|મહીપતરામ રૂપરામ નીલકંઠ}}) was a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] educationist, reformer, novelist and biographer from 19th century India.

==Life==
He was born in [[Surat]] on 3 December 1829 to Vadnagara Nagar Brahmin family of Rupram Nilkanth and Girijagauri. He lost his mother when he was one and half years old. He was engaged, when four years old, to three years old girl Parvatikunwar. He completed elementary education of local 'village school' in Gopipura, [[Surat]] known as Pranshankar Mehtaji's school. Later he joined Government English school. During his school days, he was influenced by his teachers and reformers Durgaram Mehta and [[Dadoba Pandurang]], brother of [[Atmaram Pandurang]] who founded [[Prarthana Samaj]]. He also attended weekly meetings of Manav Dharma Sabha run by them.&lt;ref name="Raval2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

Later he joined his alma mater as an associated teacher in 1851. In 1852, he joined Highschool department of [[Elphinstone College|Elphinstone Institute]], [[Bombay]] and was appointed as an assistant teacher in 1854. He was closely associated with reformist organisations; Gyan Prasarak Sabha and Buddhivardhak Sabha in Bombay. He was later appointed as an acting headmaster at the Ahmedabad High School in 1857 and later made a deputy education inspector there. In 1859, he was appointed as a member of school textbooks committee, the textbooks known by [[Theodore Hope|T. C. Hope]]'s name as ''Hope Series'', and was sent to [[England]] on 27 March 1860 to experience training colleges by Education Department. After returning on 13 April 1861, he served as a principal of P. R. Training College in Ahmedabad until his retirement. He was excommunicated from community for twelve years by his Nagar Brahmin community for crossing the sea. He was not even allowed to perform last rites of his father. He had to seek compromise and went to several rituals to enter his community again.&lt;ref name="Raval2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/5396|title=Mahipatram|author=Raval|first=R.

He was an incharge of reformist weekly ''Satyaprakash'' for ten months in 1857.&lt;ref name="Raval2002"/&gt; In 1885, he was awarded Rao Saheb and [[Order of the Indian Empire|Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire]] (CIE) by the British government. He was associated with Ahmedabad [[Prarthana Samaj]] and [[Gujarat Vernacular Society]] as well several other organisations seeking social reforms like widow remarriage, prohibition of child marriage.

He died in [[Ahmedabad]] on 30 May 1891.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; His wife Parvatikunwar had supported and participated in his social reform activities.&lt;ref name="John 2013"/&gt; His son [[Ramanbhai Nilkanth]] was also writer and he also served as a mayor of Ahmedabad. An orphanage named Mahipatram Rupram Ashram is established on 17 December 1892 in Raipur, Ahmedabad in his memory which is now one of the largest and the oldest orphanages in India.&lt;ref name="John 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahipatram Rupram Ashram 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Us | website=Mahipatram Rupram Ashram | date=18 January 2017 | url=http://mahipatram.in/about-us.html | accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; British travel writer [[Pico Iyer]] is his great-great-grandson.&lt;ref name="Johnb 2013"/&gt;

==Works==
He wrote the first travelogue of Gujarati literature, ''Englandni Musafarinu Varnan'' (1862) in which he had described political, social, education condition of England then as well as descriptions of some popular places in England.&lt;ref name="Raval2002"/&gt; ''Uttam Kapol Karsandas Mulji Charitra'' (1877) is a biography of his public figure and friend [[Karsandas Mulji]]. ''Mehtaji Durgaram Manchharam Charitra'' (1879) is a biography based on diary of [[Durgaram Mehta]]. ''Parvatikunwar Akhyan'' (1881, second edition) is biography of his wife. ''Akbarcharitra'' (1887, second edition) is his historical biography of [[Akbar]] which is mostly based on English translation of ''[[Akbarnama]]''.&lt;ref name="Raval2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John 2013"/&gt;

His initial, basic and historically important three novels of Gujarati literature are as follows: ''Sasuvahuni Ladai'' (1866) is about family life with mild humour which is considered as the first social novel in Gujarati.&lt;ref name="Raval2002"/&gt; ''Sadhara Jesang'' (1880) and ''Vanraj Chavdo'' (1881) are basic historical novels on [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]] and [[Vanraj Chavda]] respectively. They are chiefly based on folklores and cultural history.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raval2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi]]|title=Gujarāta and Its Literature: A Survey from the Earliest Times|url=http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/245019|year=1935|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Company, Limited|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Meyer v. Nebraska''''', 262 U.S. 390 (1923),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Meyer v. Nebraska|262|390|1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case that held that a 1919 [[Nebraska]] law restricting foreign-language education violated the [[Due Process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

==Context and legislation==
[[World War I]] witnessed an extensive [[Anti-German sentiment#United States|campaign against all things German]], such as the performance of German music at symphony concerts and the meetings of German-American civic associations. Language was a principal focus of legislation at the state and local level. It took many forms, from requiring associations to have charters written in English to a ban on the use of German within the town limits. Some states banned foreign language instruction, while a few banned only German. Some extended their bans into private instruction and even to religious education. A bill to create a Department of Education at the federal level was introduced in October 1918, designed to restrict federal funds to states that enforced English-only education. An internal battle over conducting services and religious instruction in German divided the Lutheran churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Capozzola |title=Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen |location=NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |pages=176–85, 190–3 |isbn=978-0-19-533549-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 1919, Nebraska enacted a statute called "An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska," commonly known as the Siman Act. It imposed restrictions on both the use of a foreign language as a medium of instruction and on foreign languages as a subject of study. With respect to the use of a foreign language while teaching, it provided that "No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language." With respect to foreign-language education, it prohibited instruction of children who had yet to successfully complete the eighth grade.

==Facts and arguments==
On May 25, 1920, Robert T. Meyer, while an instructor in Zion Parochial School, a one-room schoolhouse in [[Hampton, Nebraska]], taught the subject of reading in the [[German language]] to 10-year-old Raymond Parpart, a fourth-grader.   The Hamilton County Attorney entered the classroom and discovered Parpart reading from the Bible in German. He charged Meyer with violating the Siman Act.&lt;ref name=capozzola94&gt;Capolzzola, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer was tried and convicted in the district court for [[Hamilton County, Nebraska|Hamilton County]], was and fined $25 USD (about ${{Inflation|US|25|1920}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). The [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] affirmed his conviction by a vote of 4 to 2. The majority thought the law a proper response to "the baneful effects" of allowing immigrants to educate their children in their mother tongue, with results "inimical to our own safety." The dissent called the Siman Act the work of "crowd psychology."&lt;ref name=capozzola94 /&gt;

Meyer appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. His lead attorney was Arthur Mullen, an Irish Catholic and a prominent Democrat, who had earlier failed in his attempt to obtain an injunction against enforcement of the Siman Act from the Nebraska State Supreme Court. Oral arguments expressed conflicting interpretations of the World War I experience. Mullen attributed the law to "hatred, national bigotry and racial prejudice engendered by the World War." Opposing counsel countered that "it is the ambition of the State to have its entire population 100 per cent. American."&lt;ref&gt;Capozzola, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majority opinion==
In his decision, [[James Clark McReynolds|Justice McReynolds]] stated that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process clause "[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men."

Analyzing in that context the liberty of the teacher and of parents with respect to their children, McReynolds wrote: "Practically, education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto. The calling always has been regarded as useful and honorable, essential, indeed, to the public welfare. Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful. Heretofore it has been commonly looked upon as helpful and desirable. Plaintiff in error taught this language in school as part of his occupation. His right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are within the liberty of the amendment." And further: "Evidently the Legislature has attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own."

And finally: "That the state may do much, go very far, indeed, in order to improve the quality of its citizens, physically, mentally and morally, is clear; but the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected. The protection of the Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution&amp;#8203;—&amp;#8203;a desirable end cannot be promoted by prohibited means."

He allowed that wartime circumstances might justify a different understanding, but that Nebraska had not demonstrated sufficient need "in time of peace and domestic tranquility" to justify "the consequent infringement of rights long freely enjoyed."

==Dissent==
Justices [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and [[George Sutherland]] dissented. Their dissenting opinion, written by Holmes, is found in the companion case of ''[[Bartels v. State of Iowa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bartels v. State of Iowa|link=|volume=262|page=404|pin=|year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes wrote that he differed with the majority "with hesitation and unwillingness" because he thought the law did not impose an undue restriction on the liberty of the teacher since it was not arbitrary, was limited in its application to the teaching of children, and the State had areas where many children might hear only a language other than English spoken at home. "I think I appreciate the objection to the law, but it appears to me to present a question upon which men reasonably might differ and therefore I am unable to say the Constitution of the United States prevents the experiment being tried."

==In later jurisprudence==

''Meyer'', along with ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925), is often cited as one of the first instances in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] engaged in [[substantive due process]] in the area of [[civil liberties]]. [[Laurence Tribe]] has called them "the two sturdiest pillars of the substantive due process temple". He noted that the decisions in these cases did not describe specific acts as constitutionally protected but a broader area of liberty: "[they] described what they were protecting from the standardizing hand of the state in language that spoke of the family as a center of value-formation and value-transmission...the authority of parents to make basic choices" and not just controlling the subjects one's child is taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Tribe |title=''Lawrence v. Texas'': The 'Fundamental Right' That Dare Not Speak Its Name |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue=6 |year=2004 |pages=1893–1955 [p. 1934] |jstor=4093306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantive due process has since been used as the basis for many far-reaching decisions of the Court, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''. [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] speculated in 2000 that both of those cases might have been written differently nowadays: "''Pierce'' and ''Meyer'', had they been decided in recent times, may well have been grounded upon First Amendment principles protecting freedom of speech, belief, and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Troxel v. Granville|link=|volume=530|page=57|pin=|year=2000|dissent=Kennedy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mulshankar Harinand Mulani''' (1 November 1867 – 14 December 1957) was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] playwright from the [[Gujarati theatre]] of India. After working as a village development officer and as an editor with a weekly newspaper, he joined the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, a theatre company, where he worked as a playwright for decades. He wrote more than fifty plays on social, mythological and historical subjects including commercially or critically successful plays like ''Rajbeej'' (1891), ''Ajabkumari'' (1899, 1912), ''Saubhagyasundari'' (1901), ''Nandbatrisi'' (1906) and ''Krishnacharitra'' (1906).

==Early life==
He was born on 1 November 1867 in [[Chavand, Gujarat|Chavand]]&lt;ref name="gog1972"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Amreli district|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCkbAAAAIAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|page=553}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now in [[Amreli district]], Gujarat, India) to the religious Prashnora [[Nagar Brahmin]] family of Harinand Dayanad and Mankunwar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was a descendant of Mula Bhatt who had served as a minister of [[Nawanagar State]] before 10 or 12 generations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He studied until the fourth standard in English medium and had read religious works and Sanskrit books at his home,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; later going on to study with a Sanskrit scholar for some time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mulani started a job as a village development officer in [[Dhari, Gujarat|Dhari]], for a salary of ten rupees, but subsequently left to go to [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai). After a period of struggles, he joined a [[Weekly newspaper|weekly]] ''Satyavakta'' as a [[proofreader]] for a salary of twenty rupees. He covered true stories in his column, Ghanghata and became popular. Later he served as an editor of the weekly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ગુજરાતી રંગભૂમિ: રિદ્ધિ અને રોનક (Gujarati Rangbhoomi: Riddhi Ane Ronak)|last=|first=|publisher=Gujarat Vishwakosh Trust|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Choksi|editor-first=Mahesh|location=Ahmedabad|pages=34, 117–119|trans-title=Compilation of Information regarding professional theatre of Gujarat|editor-last2=Somani|editor-first2=Dhirendra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre career==
He met Prabhurai Popatlal, who offered him a job as a play editor in the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, a theatre company, for a salary of five rupees. Eventually, he left the ''Satyavakta'' and his salary rose to thirty rupees. His first play ''Shakuntal'' (1889) and his second play ''Rajbeej'' (1891) starring [[Bapulal Nayak]] were performed in the Geity Theatre and were commercially successful. It was followed by ''Kundbala'' (1892) and ''Mansinh Abhaysinh'' (1893). ''Kundbala'' depicted a relationship between a [[princely state]] and the [[British Raj]]. Following it, the censorship by the British authorities was instituted. His health deteriorated and he returned to his native village where he wrote his successful plays, ''Mularaj Solanki'' (1895) and ''Karanghelo'' (1896, based on [[Nandshankar Mehta]]'s [[Karan Ghelo|''Karanghelo'']]). His salary rose to 35 rupees. After studying [[Shakespeare]] and [[Kalidasa]], he wrote ''Barrister'' (1897), which was  a play about a youth who was devastated due to his attraction to the [[western world]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; It became successful and his salary rose to 75 rupees. Later he was made a partner in the company.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Mulani introduced [[tragedy]] to the Gujarati theatre.&lt;ref name="gog1972" /&gt; His ''Jayraj'' (1898) and ''Ajabkumari'' (1899) were not initially successful, due to the occurrence of [[Third plague pandemic|plague in Bombay]]. They however, became hits when they were performed again in 1912–13.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Ajabkumari'' was praised by scholars like [[Govardhanram Tripathi]] but the audience did not like it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the financial condition of the company had deteriorated, his ''Vikramcharitra'' (1900), based on [[Shamal Bhatt]]'s ''Sinhasan Batrisi'', became a commercial hit and helped the company recover. He demanded his pending sum of 28,000 rupees with the company, but received only 10,000 rupees. Feeling hurt, he left the company. His contract terms, however, prohibited him from writing plays for other companies for another ten years. He subsequently founded the Kathiyawadi Natak Mandali in 1906 in the name of his son-in-law, Vishwanath Madhavji Bhatt. Viththaldas Bhojak and Bapulal Punjiram Nayak were its director and musician respectively.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

He rejoined Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali when [[Nathuram Shukla]] requested him to rewrite ''Saubhagyasundari'', which had failed to impress the owners and the director of the company. He rewrote the play and it premiered on 19 October 1901. Starring [[Bapulal Nayak]] and [[Jaishankar Bhojak]] in lead roles as well as Mohanlala in the role of Madhav, the play became a major success and Jaishankar became known for his female impersonator role of Sundari. The pairing of Bapulal Nayak and Jaishankar Sundari became popular with the audience and they starred together in many plays later on. Prabhashankar 'Ramani' acted in his several plays and rose to fame.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; ''Jugal Jugari'' (1902) was his social play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kathiyawadi Natak Mandali produced his ''Krishnacharitra'' (1906) which brought [[Krishna]], for the first time, on the Gujarati stage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Devotional in nature, it was based on stories from the [[Bhagavata Purana|''Bhagavata'']], depicting the relationship between Krishna and Gopi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His plays influenced Urdu as well as Marathi plays. He had written ''Veermandal'' in just a day. In addition, he had written scripts for films.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; In debt in 1909, he sold Kathiyawadi Natak Mandali, and in 1915, he left the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali.&lt;ref name="Hansen2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7Q1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237|title=Stages of Life: Indian Theatre Autobiographies|author=Hansen|first=Kathryn|date=1 December 2013|publisher=Anthem Press|year=|isbn=978-1-78308-098-4|location=|pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Ek Ja Bhool'' (1919), written for Royal Natak Mandali, had a discussion on a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] in its script.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1920s, he worked with Aryasubodh Gujarati Natak Mandali.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After retirement, he lived in [[Kanpur]] and [[Bhavnagar]]. He died on 14 December 1957.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Narasimhiah Seshagiri|title=Encyclopaedia of Cities and Towns in India: Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhsoAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-212-0981-6|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mung''' is [[computer]] [[jargon]] for a series of potentially destructive or irrevocable changes to a piece of data or a file.&lt;ref name=jargon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raymond |first1=Eric S. |title=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/mung.html |website=catb.org |accessdate=15 June 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615165058/http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/mung.html |archivedate=June 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used for vague data transformation steps that are not yet clear to the speaker.&lt;ref name="perl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=David|title=Data Munging with Perl|date=2001|publisher=Manning|location=Greenwich, CT|page=4|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common munging operations include removing punctuation or html tags, data parsing, filtering, and transformation.&lt;ref name="perl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1958 in the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="jargon"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 the [[backronym]] "Mash Until No Good" was created to describe Mung, and a while after it was revised to "Mung Until No Good", making it one of the first [[recursive acronym]]s.{{citation needed|reason=The claim for first needs a source|date=June 2015}} It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].&lt;ref name="os8"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gesswein |first1=David |title=OS/8 Help File |url=http://www.pdp8.net/os/os8/os8_cmd.shtml |accessdate=15 June 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615181221/http://www.pdp8.net/os/os8/os8_cmd.shtml |archivedate=June 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from the very similar term [[munged password|munge]], because munging usually implies destruction of data, while mungeing usually implies modifying data in order to create protection related to that data.

Munging may also describe the constructive operation of tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate.  Munging can also describe the processing or filtering of raw data into another form.&lt;ref name="perl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As the "no good" part of the acronym implies, munging often involves irrevocable destruction of data.&lt;ref name="jargon"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hence in the early text-adventure game ''[[Zork]]'', also known as ''Dungeon'',{{Relevance inline|date=May 2018|discuss=How is being called ''Dungeon'' significant to the issue of "munging"?}} the user could mung{{how|date=May 2018|title=Was this part of the game's puzzles or a bug? How did the game present the word "mung" to the user in describing this scenario?}} an object and thereby destroy it (making it impossible to finish the game if the object was an important item).

'''''Municipalidad''''' ({{IPA-es|munisipaliˈðað}}) is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for [[municipality]] used in many [[Latin America]]n countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. It refers to the governing body of a particular territory and not to the territory, which is often referred to as "municipio".

In Chile the territory governed is called a "[[comuna]]", which is the third-level administrative division of the country.

==Critique==
The use of the term ‘non-heterosexual’ to refer to [[LGBTQ]] people as a blanket term could perpetuate [[heterosexuality]] as the [[norm (social)|norm]]. It implies that any identity that cannot be defined as ‘[[hetero]]’ is abnormal. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The term means the opposite of heterosexual, thus implying a deviance from the social norm.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Historically the term was used to force people into one of two distinct identities; the “normalization of a sex that was ‘hetero' proclaimed a new heterosexual separatism — an erotic apartheid that forcefully segregated the sex normals from the sex perverts.” &lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heterosexual-homosexual binary that is implied by using the term ‘non-heterosexual’ as a variation of ‘[[homosexual]]’ is often interpreted as a stand in for ‘the opposite of heterosexual’ rather than a description of various identities.&lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ignores those who identify as [[bisexual]], [[pansexual]], [[queer]], etc. The term ‘heterosexual’ is a relatively new term that was created to separate the majority from the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], and the continued use of ‘non-heterosexual’  as an umbrella term for those in the LGBTQ community perpetuates the notion of the normal versus the Other. Non-heterosexual is also rather problematically used as a catch-all term, encompassing [[gender identity]] as well as [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ‘non-heterosexuality’ continues the erasure of bisexuality from discussions around sexuality and identity because of its roots in the heterosexual-homosexual binary. Sexuality and gender are different concepts and by labelling the entire LGBT+ community as being within the category of non-heterosexual it prioritizes certain groups as the term is sexuality specific.&lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encompassment of identities leads to the erasure of differing gender identities in the conversations around ‘non-heterosexual’ communities.

By referring to LGBTQ people as non-heterosexual, it enforces the idea of “[[compulsory heterosexuality]]” and that anyone who does not fit into that category is going against the [[norm (social)|norm]].&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; “As Patrick Hopkins has argued, [[heterosexism]] and [[homophobia]] are founded on and sustained by binary gender categories, specifically the assumption that there are distinct and proper masculine and feminine gender roles and identities against which deviation is measured.” &lt;ref name="Denike"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denike|first1=Margaret|title=Religion, Rights, and Relationships: The Dream of Relational Equality|journal=Hypatia|date=2007|volume=22|issue=1|pages=71–91|jstor=4640045|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2007.tb01150.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term non-heterosexual indicates a departure from what is acceptable in society while highlighting the juxtaposition between the ideal heterosexual and unideal non-heterosexual. “Heterosexism is about dominance, and the practices that support it are often replicated, reinforced, and reflected by the attitudes, behaviors, and practices of even [the] best-intentioned allies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feigenbaum|first1=Erika Faith|title=Heterosexual Privilege: The Political and the Personal|journal=Hypatia|date=2007|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–9|jstor=4640040|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting heterosexuality as the norm frames ‘non-heterosexuality’ as the abnormal. Heterosexuality as a categorization  and as a term, was not created until the late nineteenth century, prior to this relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual. In the [[Victorian era]] sex was seen as an act between “manly men and womanly women, [as] procreators, not specifically as erotic beings or heterosexuals.” &lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division between the heterosexual and the non-heterosexual came in the 1860s after the “growth of the consumer economy also fostered a new pleasure ethic,” &lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the erotic became a commodity to be bought and sold. At the same time the ”rise in power and prestige of medical doctors allowed those upwardly mobile professionals to prescribe a healthy new sexuality.” &lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women were now meant to  enjoy sex. Relations between those of the ‘opposite sexes’  was seen as healthy and encouraged by medical professionals. This creation and celebration of the ‘Normal Sexual’ ultimately resulted in its counterpart: the ‘Sexual Pervert,’ anyone who fell outside the heterosexual ideal. “In its earliest version, the twentieth-century heterosexual imperative usually continued to associate heterosexuality with a supposed human ‘need,’ ‘drive,’ or ‘instinct’ for propagation, a procreant urge linked inexorably with carnal lust… giving praise to vent to heteroerotic emotions was thus praised as enhancing baby-making capacity, marital intimacy and family stability.” &lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic oppositeness of the sexes was seen as the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. The term heterosexuality was created as a way to subjugate and other anyone who did not confirm to mainstream ideals of sexuality. It was a term that created a sense of validation that heterosexuality was the normal, healthy version of human sexuality.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=231–142|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of non-heterosexual today continues this history of othering people based on a belief that anyone who is not heterosexual is inherently abnormal.

Although “non-heterosexuality” is considered a blanket term for all LGBTQ identities, it is often interpreted as another word for homosexual which contributes to the continuation of systematic bisexual erasure. [[Bisexuality]] has a long history of being overshadowed and ignored in favour of the belief in [[monosexuality]], it “[represents] a blind spot in sex research.” &lt;ref name="A History of Bisexuality"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelides|first1=Steven|title=A History of Bisexuality|journal=The University of Chicago Press Chicago and London|date=2001|pages=1–19|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Angelides/publication/290436980_A_History_of_Bisexuality/links/56a06e2c08ae21a56428a537.pdf.|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term non-heterosexual suggests a division between heterosexual and homosexual, the heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy, rather than the [[heterosexual-homosexual continuum]], which  accounts for identities that are not exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. By separating identities into [[either/or]], bisexual identities are left in a place of ambiguity, “bisexuals transgress boundaries of sexually identified communities and thus are always both inside and outside a diversity of conflicting communities.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daumer|first1=Elisabeth D|title=Queer Ethics; Or, The Challenge of Bisexuality to Lesbian Ethics|journal=Hypatia|date=1992|volume=7|issue=4|jstor=3810080|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1992.tb00720.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implied homosexual-heterosexual dichotomy that the term puts in place negates its use as a truly inclusive term; “[the] categories are constructed in such a way as to allow everyone access to one and only one, and to insist that anyone who is not already neatly situated in one category or the other had best be on the way to one.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Held|first1=Lisa|title=In Praise of Unreliability|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=12|issue=3|pages=174–182|jstor=3810228|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00011.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on either/or logic, heterosexuality or non-heterosexuality, where non-heterosexuality is closely associated with homosexuality rather than general queerness, slights those that the term attempts to describe; “where bisexuality does rate a mention, it is almost always rendered an epistemological and incidental by-product, aftereffect, or definitional outcome of the opposition of hetero/homosexuality.” &lt;ref name="A History of Bisexuality"/&gt;

Non-heterosexuality is often used to describe those in the LGBT+ community with non-cisgender identities. This is seen as problematic as sexual orientation and gender identity are different. However the distinction between the two is relatively modern. Historically “[transgender people] were classified as homosexuals by everyone, including the physicians who specialized in their treatment, and it is only in the past fifty years or so that transgender has been theorized as different in kind from homosexuality.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=Jillian Todd|title=GL vs. BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within   the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community|journal=The Journal of Bisexuality|date=2004|pages=25–55|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=1649428|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people still fail to understand or make the distinction between gender minorities and sexual minorities.&lt;ref name="GLvBT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=Jillian Todd|title=GL vs. BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community|journal=The Journal of Bisexuality|date=2004|pages=25–55|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=1649428|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself is sexuality specific as it contains the word “sexual” with no mention of “gender.” &lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much in the way the term non-heterosexuality erases sexual minorities through its implied notion of the hetero/homosexual binary, it also ignores gender minorities. While trans people and people with non-binary gender identities are part of the LGBTQ community, having been subjected to many of the same injustices,&lt;ref name="The 'T' Within LGBT"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'T' Within LGBT+|url=http://www.lgbt.cusu.cam.ac.uk/resources/trans/the-t-within-lgbt/|website=CUSU LGBT+|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; labelling trans and genderqueer identities under the term non-heterosexual blurs the important differences between sexual orientation and gender identity. Not all trans people would identify their sexuality as being non-heterosexual, many trans people are attracted to the ‘opposite’ sex and therefore identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="The 'T' Within LGBT"/&gt; Additionally “those with non-binary gender identities are likely to place [themselves] in a position in which heterosexuality is nonsensical, due to there being no “opposite” gender to their identities” &lt;ref name="The 'T' Within LGBT"/&gt; While a non-binary person is less likely to identify as heterosexual, the assumption that as someone with a ‘non-heterosexual’ identity, they must be homosexual is also problematic as it ignores sexual orientations that are not dictated by the gender of the person but rather who they are (or are not) attracted to such as bisexual, pansexual, queer, [[androsexual]], [[gynesexual]], [[skoliosexual]], or [[asexuality|asexual]].&lt;ref name="The 'T' Within LGBT"/&gt;

Queer people “are often expected to account for [their] sexual identifications by either proving [their] normality (that is, [they] are inside the sphere of heteronormativity), or by accepting that [their] difference from the heterosexual norm constitutes some form of essence.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riggs|first1=Damien W|title=Reassessing the Foster-Care System: Examining the Impact of Heterosexism on Lesbian and Gay Applicants|journal=Hypatia|date=2007|volume=22|issue=1|pages=132–148|jstor=4640048|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term non-heterosexual is used to highlight the absolute difference between heterosexual and queer identities. The language needs to change to describe LGBTQ people as autonomous beings “rather than considering [them] solely as sexual beings constituted within a heterosexual logic of sameness or difference.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The implied binary that the term non-heterosexual perpetuates erases those whose identities fall in the spectrum between heterosexuality and homosexuality. The hetero/homosexual dichotomy continues the systematic erasure of bisexual identities by emphasizing an assumed oppositeness with nothing allowed in between.&lt;ref name="GLvBT"/&gt; Although non-heterosexual is meant to encompass the entire LGBTQ community it has a continued use outside the community as another word for homosexual.&lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes sexual orientation over gender identity because the term itself is sexuality specific although it is used for identities that are unrelated to sexuality.&lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of the term continues a history of gender identity being overlooked in discourse surrounding the LGBTQ community in favour of prioritizing sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="The 'T' Within LGBT"/&gt; It ignores those who identify as non-binary, as the term non-heterosexuality has been interpreted as categorizing those who are sexually attracted to people of the ‘same sex’ as opposed to those who are attracted to those of the ‘opposite sex.’&lt;ref name="GLvBT"/&gt; Because if the broad spectrum encompassed by the term, general use favours sexual orientations that are defined by their reliance of the gender binary such as gay or lesbian rather than promoting orientations that are not dictated by the gender of the person identifying their sexuality. Non-heterosexual also implies that one can not be part of the LGBT+ community and identify as heterosexual as it ignores the differences between sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name="The 'T' Within LGBT"/&gt; The term “non-heterosexual” is too broad yet at the same time it is routinely interpreted as pertaining to a minority category of people within the intended group of identities. Because it is so non-specific it is open to interpretation by those outside the LGBTQ community or by those who are not as educated about the spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities leading to a greater emphasis on the identities that are already well known and an erasure of the identities that are already not a large part of mainstream dialogues.&lt;ref name="Killerman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killerman|first1=Sam|title=4 Reasons You Should Stop Saying 'Non-Straight'|url=http://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/reasons-you-should-stop-saying-non-straight-and-say-queer/|website=It’s Pronounced Metrosexual,|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Tibetan''' refers to the period of [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan language]] reflected in documents from the adoption of writing by the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the mid-7th century to works of the early 11th century.

In 816 CE, during the reign of [[Sadnalegs]], literary Tibetan underwent a thorough reform aimed at standardizing the language and vocabulary of the translations being made from Indian texts, and this resulted in what we now call [[Classical Tibetan]].{{sfn|Hodge|1993|p=vii}}

Old Tibetan is characterised by many features that are lost in Classical Tibetan, including ''my-'' rather than ''m-'' before the vowels ''-i-'' and ''-e-'', the cluster ''sts-'' which simplifies to ''s-'' in Classical Tibetan, and a reverse form of the "i" vowel letter (''gi-gu'').{{sfn|Hill|2010a}}

Hill makes a distinction between &lt;g.y&gt; and &lt;gy&gt; since there is a minimal pair of ''g.yaṅ'' 'sheep' and ''gyaṅ'' 'also, and'. He argues for a distinction between &lt;g.y&gt; /gj/ and &lt;gy&gt; /gʲ/.{{sfn|Hill|2012b}}

==Case system==
[[grammatical case|Case]] morphology is affixed to entire noun phrases, not to individual words (i.e. ''Gruppenflexion''). Old Tibetan distinguishes the same ten cases as [[Classical Tibetan]]:{{sfn|Hill|2012a}}

* [[absolutive case|absolutive]] (morphologically unmarked)
* [[genitive case|genitive]] (གི་ -''gi'',  གྱི་ -''kyi'', ཀྱི་ -''gyi'', འི་ ''-'i'', ཡི་ -''yi'')
* [[agentive case|agentive]] (གིས་ -''gis'', གྱིས་ -''kyis'', ཀྱིས་ -''gyis'', ས་ -''sa'', ཡིས་ -''yis'')
* [[locative case|locative]] (ན་ -''na'')
* [[allative case|allative]] (ལ་ -''la'')
* [[terminative case|terminative]] (རུ་ -''ru'', སུ་ -''su'', ཏུ་ -''tu'', དུ་ -''du'', ར་ -''ra'')
* [[comitative case|comitative]] (དང་ -''dang'')
* [[ablative case|ablative]] (ནས་ -''nas'')
* [[elative case|elative]] (ལས་ -''las'')
* [[comparative case|comparative]] (བས་ -''bas'')

However, whereas the locative, allative, and terminative gradually fell together in Classical Tibetan (and are referred to the indigenous grammatical tradition as the ''la don bdun''), in Old Tibetan these three cases are clearly distinguished.{{sfn|Hill|2011}}

Traditional Tibetan grammarians do not distinguish case markers in this manner, but rather distribute these case morphemes (excluding ''-dang'' and ''-bas'') into the eight cases of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

==Personal pronouns==
Old Tibetan has three first person singular pronouns ང་ ''nga'', བདག་ ''bdag'', and ཁོ་བོ་ ''kho-bo'', and three first person plural pronouns ངེད་ ''nged'', བདག་ཅག་ ''bdag-cag'', and འོ་སྐོལ་ '' 'o-skol''. The second person pronouns include two singulars ཁྱོད་ ''khyod'' and ཁྱོ(ན)་འདའ་  ''khyo(n)-'da''' and a plural ཁྱེད་ ''khyed''.{{sfn|Hill|2010b}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12962">'''Onomasiology''' (from {{lang-el|ὀνομάζω}} (onomāzο)—to name, which in turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question "how do you express X?" It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of [[lexicology]], the study of words (although some apply the term also to [[grammar]] and conversation). 

Onomasiology, as a part of lexicology, starts from a concept which is taken to be prior&lt;ref&gt;OED: "The study of language which deals with the identification of a preconceived
meaning or concept by name or names"&lt;/ref&gt;
(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an activity etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as [[semasiology]]: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" (answers: ''french fries'' in the US, ''chips'' in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., "what is the meaning of the term ''chips''?" (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).

Onomasiology can be carried out [[wikt:synchronic|synchronically]] or [[wikt:diachronic|diachronically]], i.e. historically.

==Definition==

Onomasiology was initiated in the late 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in [[Romance languages]]. And it was in Romance linguistics that the most important onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and [[Hugo Schuchardt]] started the "[[Wörter und Sachen]]" movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the "dame phonétique" (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the "dame sémantique" (justify semantic changes).

Another branch that developed from onomasiology and, at the same time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable [[linguistic atlas]]es. The first ones are ''Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches'' of [[Georg Wenker]] and [[Ferdinand Wrede]], published beginning in 1888, the ALF (''[[Atlas Linguistique de la France]]'') by [[Jules Gilliéron]] (1902–1920), the AIS (''Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz'') by [[Karl Jaberg]] and [[Jakob Jud]] (1928–1940), the DSA (''Deutscher Sprachatlas'') by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927–1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) by means of a questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, onomasiology as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by [[Hans Kurath]], the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).

In 1931 the German linguist [[Jost Trier]] introduced a new method in his book ''Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes'' which is known as the [[lexical field theory]]. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by [[Cecil H. Brown]], [[Stanley R. Witkowski]], [[Brent Berlin]]). But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of [[Dirk Geeraerts]], Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical ''Onomasiology Online'', which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by [[Joachim Grzega]], Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic onomasiology (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.

==Instruments for the historical onomasiologist==

The most important instruments for the historical onomasiologist are:
* the [[linguistic atlas]]
* the [[etymological dictionary]]
* the dialect dictionary
* [[thesaurus|thesauri]]
* diachronic [[text corpus|text corpora]]

==Lexical change==
===Explanations===

When a speaker has to name something, they first try to categorize it. If the speaker can classify the referent as member of a familiar concept, they will carry out some sort of cognitive-linguistic cost-benefit-analysis: what should I say to get what I want. Based on this analysis, the speaker can then either fall back on an already existing word or decide to coin a new designation. These processes are sometimes more conscious, sometimes less conscious.

The coinage of a new designation can be incited by various forces (cf. Grzega 2004):
* difficulties in classifying the thing to be named or attributing the right word to the thing to be named, thus confusing designations
* fuzzy difference between superordinate and subordinate term due to the monopoly of the prototypical member of a category in the real world
* everyday contact situations
* institutionalized and non-institutionalized linguistic pre- and proscriptivism
* flattery
* insult
* disguising things (i.e. [[euphemism|euphemistic]] language, [[doublespeak]])
* taboo
* avoidance of words that are phonetically similar or identical to negatively associated words
* abolition of forms that can be ambiguous in many contexts
* wordplay/puns
* excessive length of words
* morphological misinterpretation (creation of transparency by changes within a word = [[folk-etymology]])
* deletion of irregularity
* desire for plastic/illustrative/telling names for a thing
* natural prominence of a concept
* cultural-induced prominence of a concept
* changes in the world
* changes in the categorization of the world
* prestige/fashion (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion)

The following alleged motives found in many works have been claimed (with corresponding argumentation) to be invalid by Grzega (2004): decrease in salience, reading errors, laziness, excessive phonetic shortness, difficult sound combinations, unclear stress patterns, cacophony.

===Processes===

In the case of intentional, conscious innovation, speakers have to pass several levels of a word-finding or name-giving process: (1) analysis of the specific features of the concept, (2) onomasiological level (where the semantic components for the naming units are selected ["naming in a more abstract sense"]), (3) the onomatological level (where the concrete morphemes are selected ["naming in a more concrete sense"]). The level of feature analysis (and possibly the onomasiological level) can be spared if the speaker simply borrows a word from a foreign language or variety; it is also spared if the speaker simply takes the word s/he originally fell back to and just shortens it.

If the speaker does not shorten an already existing word for the concept, but coins a new one, s/he can select from several types of processes. These coinages may be based on a model from the speaker's own idiom, on a model from a foreign idiom, or, in the case of root creations, on no model at all. In sum, we get the following catalog of formal processes of word-coining (cf. Koch 2002):

* adoption of either
# an already existing word of speaker's own language ([[semantic change]]) or (b)
# a word from a foreign language ([[loanword]])
* [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] (e.g. ''to e-mail'' from the noun ''e-mail'')
* composition (in a broad sense, i.e. [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and derivations, which are, very consciously, not further subclassified)
* [[elliptical construction|ellipsis]] (i.e. morpheme deletion, e.g. the noun ''daily'' from ''daily newspaper'')
* [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] (i.e. morpheme shortening, e.g. ''fan'' from ''fanatic'')
* [[acronym]]s (e.g. ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* [[Blend word|blend]]ings (including [[folk-etymology|folk-etymologies]], although these come up non-intentionally, e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* [[back-derivation]] (e.g. ''to baby-sit'' from ''babysitter'')
* [[reduplication]] (e.g. ''goody-goody'')
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] alteration (e.g. number change as in ''people'' as a plural word instead of a singular word)
* [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] compounds (e.g. ''peacock'' for original ''pea'', which already meant 'peacock')
* wordplaying/[[pun]]s
* stress alteration (e.g. stress shift in E. ''ímport'' vs. ''impórt'')
* graphic alteration (e.g. E. ''discrete'' vs. ''discreet'')
* [[Phraseology|phraseologism]]
* [[Root (linguistics)|root creation]] (including [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] and expressive words)

The name-giving process is completed with (4) the actual phonetic realization on the morphonological level.

In order to create a new word, the speaker first selects one or two physically and psychologically salient aspects. The search for the motivations ([[iconeme]]s) is based on one or several cognitive-associative relations. These relations are:

*contiguity relations (= "neighbor-of" relations)
*similarity relations (= "similar-to" relations)
*partiality relations (= "part-of" relations)
*contrast relations (= "opposite-to" relations)
These relations can be seen between forms, between concepts and between form and concept. 

A complete catalog reads the following associative relations (cf. also Koch 2002):

* identity (e.g. with loans)
* "figurative", i.e. individually felt, similarity of the concepts (e.g. ''mouse'' for a computer device that looks '''like''' a mouse)
* contiguity of concepts (e.g. ''a Picasso'' for a painting '''by''' Picasso or ''glass'' for a container made '''out of''' glass)
* partiality of concepts (e.g. ''bar'' 'place of an inn where drinks are mixed' for the '''entire''' inn)
* contrast of concepts (e.g. ''bad'' in the sense of "good")
* "literal" or "figurative" similarity between the forms of a sign and the concept (e.g. with onomatopoetic words like ''purr'')
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. with generalization of meaning, e.g. ''Christmas tree'' for any kind of fir tree or even any kind of conifer)
* strong relation between contents of signs and contrast of concepts (e.g. with ''learn'' in the sense of "teach" in some English dialects)
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. ''corn'' in the English sense of "wheat" or Scottish sense of "oats" instead of "cereal")
* ("literal") similarity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* contiguity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''brunch'' from ''breakfast + lunch'', ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* "literal", i.e. objectively visible, similarity and contiguity of concepts (e.g. with the transfer of names among spruce and fir in many dialects)
* "literal" similarity of referents and strong relation between contents of signs
* multiple associations (e.g. with certain forms of word-play)

The concrete associations can or cannot be incited by a model which may be of speaker's own idiom or a foreign idiom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2638">The '''Phaedra complex''' is primarily the [[sexual desire]] of a [[Stepfamily|stepmother]] for her stepson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490046 Alfred Messer, 'The "Phaedra Complex"]&lt;/ref&gt; though the term has been extended to cover difficult relationships between stepparents and stepchildren in general.&lt;ref&gt;W. Hicks, ''English for Journalists'' (2013) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Hyppolitus készlet.jpg|thumb|Hyppolytus set]]
The complex takes its name from [[Greek mythology]]. 
[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] was the daughter of [[Minos]] and [[Pasiphaë]], wife of [[Theseus]], sister of [[Ariadne]], and the mother of [[Demophon of Athens]] and [[Acamas (son of Theseus)|Acamas]]. Though married to Theseus, Phaedra fell in love with [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], Theseus' son born by either [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], or [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], her sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490046 Alfred Messer, 'The "Phaedra Complex"]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hippolytus refused Phaedra's advances, she falsely accused him of propositioning her. Phaedra eventually killed herself in remorse after his subsequent death.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1894) p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==
* [[Amata]] in the [[Aeneid]] has been seen as cognate to Phaedra in her love for her future son-in-law [[Turnus]] and her eventual suicide at the news of his death.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Harrison, ''Generic Enrichment in Vergil and Horace'' (2007) p. lxxvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the  [[Hebrew Bible]] [[Potiphar's wife|Zuleikha]] made a pass at her adoptive son [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], but Joseph refused her. So, Zuleikha accused Joseph of rape and he was put in prison, but eventually released. According to the tradition, Zuleikha made advances at many other foster children before Joseph.
* In the ballad [[Child Owlet]], Lady Erskine propositions her nephew, and upon rebuttal accuses him of attempting to seduce her, leading to his murder.

==Other use==
French philosopher [[Georges Bataille]] used the same term in a very different sense to describe the [[Abjection|morbid desire]] for a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Gilbert, ''"The Horror, the Horror"'' (2008) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''''Psi hit''''' and '''''psi miss''''' are terms used in discussion of [[parapsychological]] experimentation to describe the success or failure of the subject in achieving the desired result more often than could be expected through chance alone.&lt;ref name=parasoc1&gt;[http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Psi-Missing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }} - Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology, Parapsychology Association (2007-04-13)&lt;/ref&gt; Used only when the results are notably better than chance.&lt;ref name="parasoc1"/&gt;

A psi ''miss'' is specifically used to refer to instances where the subject has failed to achieve the result through psi, rather than where they have a non-significant negative score gained through random guessing.&lt;ref name=parasoc1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varvoglis"&gt;Varvoglis, Mario, Ph.D. "[http://www.parapsych.org/sheep_goat_effect.htm The Sheep - Goat Effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229033805/http://www.parapsych.org/sheep_goat_effect.htm |date=2007-12-29 }}", Parapsychological Association (2006-12-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1942, [[Gertrude Schmeidler]], a professor of psychology at [[City University of New York]], used a questionnaire to discover the beliefs of test subjects concerning psi. She called those who thought psi existed "sheep," and those who did not think psi existed (or did not believe it could influence the tests) she called "goats."  When she compared the results of the questionnaire to the results of the psi test, she found that the "sheep" scored significantly above chance, and the "goats" scored significantly below chance.&lt;ref name="Varvoglis"/&gt;  Schmeidler's results have since been confirmed by many other researchers. In 1992, a meta-analysis of 73 experiments by 37 different researchers confirmed that subjects who believe psi is real average higher results than those who do not believe in it.&lt;ref name="Varvoglis"/&gt; According to Mario Varvoglis, Ph.D., President of the [[Parapsychological Association]] from 2001 to 2002:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parapsych.org/members/m_varvoglis.html ''Who is Mario Varvoglis?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229030014/http://www.parapsych.org/members/m_varvoglis.html |date=2007-12-29 }} from the website
of the [[Parapsychological Association]], retrieved December 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Skeptics are justified in stating that those who believe firmly in psi will tend to see its occurrence everywhere, even to the point of confusing their own interpretations with the actual events. On the other hand, disbelievers will also tend toward the complementary fallacy, always finding some so-called "rational" explanation for a psi experience, even when it happens to them. But the sheep-goat effect suggests that the differences run deeper than mere interpretation: one's attitudes toward psi affects the likelihood that such phenomena will occur in the first place. The more an individual harbors a reductionistic view of the world, the less chance such phenomena will emerge (let alone be witnessed by them); the more one is interested in interconnectedness, and open to psi experiences, the more likely the world will "respond" by creating such experiences.&lt;ref name="Varvoglis"/&gt;

'''Q'anjob'al''' (also '''Kanjobal''')&lt;ref&gt;Other variant names include ''Santa Eulalia Kanjobal'', ''Kanhobal'', ''Qanjobal'', ''Conob'', and ''Eastern Kanjobal''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Mayan language]] spoken primarily in [[Guatemala]] and part of [[Mexico]]. According to 1998 estimates compiled by [[SIL International]] in ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there were approximately 77,700 native speakers, primarily in the [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] Department of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Centered around the ''municipio'' of [[Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango|Santa Eulalia]]; owing to recent emigrations there are communities of Q'anjob'al speakers in the United States (see Gordon (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities where the Q'anjob'al language is spoken include [[San Juan Ixcoy]] (''Yich K'ox''), [[San Pedro Soloma]] (''Tz'uluma' ''), [[Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango|Santa Eulalia]] (''Jolom Konob' ''), [[Santa Cruz Barillas]] (''Yalmotx''), [[San Rafael La Independencia]], and [[San Miguel Acatán]] (Pedro Mateo Pedro 2010). Q'anjob'al is taught in public schools through [[Intercultural bilingual education in Guatemala|Guatemala's intercultural bilingual education programs]].

==Classification==
Q'anjob'al is a member of the Q'anjob'alan branch of the Mayan language family. The Mayan language family includes 31 languages, two of which are now extinct. The Q'anjob'alan branch includes not only Q'anjob'al itself but also [[Chuj language|Chuj]], [[Akatek language|Akatek]], and [[Jakaltek language|Jakaltek]], also spoken in Guatemala. The Q'anjob'alan languages are noted for being among the most conservative of the Mayan language family, although they do include some interesting innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (1992), p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Q'anjob'al consists of 26 consonant sounds and 5 vowel sounds. The letters of the alphabet are as follows: 
&lt;center&gt;
a, b', ch, ch', d, e, h, i, j, k, k', l, m, n, o, p, q, q', r, s, t, t', tx, tx', tz, tz', u, w, x, xh, y, and ' ([[glottal stop]]).
&lt;/center&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; in ch', k', q', t', tx', and tz' represents an ejective or glottalic egressive, i.e., the consonant is accompanied by a puff of air from the glottis.  The letter ''r'' in Q'anjob'al has a limited distribution.  It is used mostly in borrowings, primarily in words borrowed from Spanish, such as ''roxax'', rose, from Spanish 'rosa'. It is also used in affect and positional words like ''k'arari'' 'noise of an old engine or the like', ''jeran'' 'to be in a broken position/form'. The letters ''tx'' and ''x'' represent [[retroflex consonant]]s, pronounced with the tongue curled backward in the mouth. It is believed such retroflection in Q'anjob'al is an influence from the [[Mam language|Mamean Mayan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (1992), p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===

Primary stress in Q'anjob'al is fairly simple. Words ''in isolation and in final phrase boundaries bear stress on the last syllable''. However, ''words within a phrasal unit (not in final phrase boundary) bear stress on their first syllable''.

==Morphology and syntax==

As in all Mayan languages, Q'anjob'al classifies all [[verb]]s as either inherently ''intransitive'' (calling up only one argument) or as inherently ''transitive'' (calling up two arguments).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (1992), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'anjob'al is an [[ergative–absolutive language]], in which the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[transitive verb]] takes an ergative affix, while the subject of an [[intransitive verb]], as well as the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb, takes an absolutive affix. Ergative affixes are also used for [[possession (grammar)|possession]].  There are two sets of [[affix]]es for ergative: the first set is used for those verbal roots beginning with a consonant, and the second set is used for those beginning with a vowel. However, there is only one set of absolutive affixes with two variations: pronounced like free words or attached to something else.

Below is the table of ergative prefixes for verbal roots beginning with a consonant:

Examples:

transitive (ergative)

''X-0-inmaq' naq winaq''. (Mateo 2008: p.c.)&lt;br /&gt;
COMP-A3S-E1S-hit CL:masc man&lt;br /&gt; 
'I hit the man.'

intransitive (absolutive)
 
''X-in way-i''. (Mateo 2008: p.c.)&lt;br /&gt; 
COMP-A1S sleep-STAT&lt;br /&gt; 
'I slept.'

possessive (ergative)

before vowel:&lt;br /&gt;
''w-aqan''&lt;br /&gt;
E1S-foot&lt;br /&gt;
'my foot'

before consonant:&lt;br /&gt;
''s-q'ab'''&lt;br /&gt;
E3S-hand&lt;br /&gt;
'his/her hand'

However, while verbs are classified as either ergative or absolutive and take their own respective sets of pronoun affixes, this rule is altered in certain cases, such as when a verb becomes progressive:

''Ch-in kuy-w-i''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
INC-A1S study-SFX-STAT&lt;br /&gt;
'I study'.

but,

''Ipan hin-kuy-w-i''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PROG E1S-study-SFX-STAT&lt;br /&gt;
'I am studying'.

In Q'anjob'al, [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (whether an action has been completed or not) is more important than [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. Thus, in most utterances, one will indicate whether the action is incompletive, or whether it is completed, or may happen in the future, in which case it is considered 'unreal', or of [[irrealis mood]], the event still only in the realm of thought or imagination.

''incompletive''&lt;br /&gt;
''Ch(i)'' is used to indicate that an event is incomplete or ongoing at some time:

''Chi-0 toj naq unin b'ay y-atut-al kuy-oj''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
INC-A3S go CL:masc child to E3S-house-ABS study-NZR&lt;br /&gt;
'The boy goes to school'.

'''Completive'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Max'' or ''x-'' (both forms are used in free variation) are used to indicate that an event is complete:

''Max-ex mulnaj-i''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
COM-A2P work-STAT&lt;br /&gt;
'You (pl.) worked.'

''X-0 way-i''.&lt;ref&gt;OKMA (2000), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
COM-A3S sleep-STAT&lt;br /&gt;
'He/she slept.'

'''Future/Irrealis'''&lt;br /&gt;
The prefix ''hoq-'' with the suffix ''-oq'' are used to indicate that the event spoken of has not yet happened, but remains only in the realm of the 'unreal' with only the potential for occurrence in the future:

''Hoq-0 saqch-oq heb'''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IRR-A3 play-IRR A3P&lt;br /&gt;
'They will play.'

'''Negative'''&lt;br /&gt;
Negative particles include ''k'am'' and ''manaq'':

''K'am chi-0 y-oche-j''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
NEG INC-A3S E3S-want-SFX&lt;br /&gt;
'He/she doesn't want it.'

''Manaq ix chi-0 toj kuy-oj''.&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
NEG she INC-A3S go study-NOM&lt;br /&gt;
'It is not she who goes to study.'

'''Interrogative'''&lt;br /&gt;
Questions can be formed simply by using rising intonation with declarative syntax:

''Ch-0-oche-j cha-ch kanal-w-i w-etoq''?&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Lingüística Q'anjob'al (2005), p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
INC-A3S-E2S-SFX INC-A2S dance-SFX-STAT E1S-with&lt;br /&gt;
'Do you want to dance with me?'

There is also a question particle, ''mi'':

''Watx' mi ha-kul''?&lt;br /&gt;
good INTER E2S-stomach&lt;br /&gt;
'Is your stomach good?'&lt;br /&gt; 
(Used as common form of greeting, like English 'How are you?')

'''Affixation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Many different affixes are used in Q'anjob'al, both prefixes and suffixes. Among these are aj-, used to denote the doer or leader of an action: ''ajtz'ib'', 'writer' (&lt; ''tz'ib''', 'write'), ''ajb'e'', 'spiritual guide' (&lt; ''b'e'', 'road'); ''-b'al'', used to indicate the location where something happens: ''tzomb'al,'' 'market' (&lt; ''tzon'', 'buy'); ''-al'', ''-alil'', ''-il'', used to derive abstract nouns from adjectives, adverbs, numerals, transitive verb roots, and nouns: ''syalixhal'', 'his/her smallness' (&lt; ''yalixh'', 'small'); ''swinaqil'', 'husband' (&lt; ''winaq'', 'man'); ''-k'ulal'', to derive nouns from intransitive verbs, adjectives, other nouns, etc.: ''watxk'ulal'', 'friendliness'; ''-oj'', nominalizer, turning verbs into nouns: ''kuyoj'', 'studying' (&lt; ''kuy'', 'study').

===Word order===

Q'anjob'al has a fixed [[word order]]. It follows a [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO) word order.  All changes to this word order are driven by pragmatic or syntactic factors like focus, negation, interrogation, relativization, etc.  These are subject to an ergative–absolutive pattern where arguments cross-referenced by ergative affixes must become absolutives prior to their fronting (focus, negation, etc.).  This results in some possible subject–verb (SV), [[object–verb–subject]] (OVS) orders.  However SVO, SOV and OSV are not possible (or, at least, not attested in any known corpus). The apparent exception is in reflexives and reflexive possessives, where the reflexive phrase ERG-b'a (noun) or reflexive possessive ERG-noun appears directly following the verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Family of Complex Predicates in Q'anjob'al (Maya); Their Syntax and Meaning|last = Mateo Toledo|first = Eladio|publisher = ProQuest|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classifiers===

Some Q’anjob’al nouns require that certain classifiers be used with them.  Among these are ''no''' (animals), ''te'' (trees/wood), ''ix'' (female), ''naq'' (male), ''ch'en'' (stone/metal), ''xim'' (corn), and ''an'' (plants).

''no’ chej''&lt;br /&gt;
CL-animal horse&lt;br /&gt;
'the horse'

''te’ na''&lt;br /&gt;
CL-wood house&lt;br /&gt;
'the house'

''ix unin''&lt;br /&gt;
CL-fem child (girl)&lt;br /&gt;
'the girl'

''naq unin''&lt;br /&gt;
CL-masc child (boy)&lt;br /&gt;
'the boy'

''ch’en tumin''&lt;br /&gt;
CL-metal money&lt;br /&gt;
'the money'

''an kaq''&lt;br /&gt;
CL-plant flower&lt;br /&gt;
'the flower'

===Reduplication===

Reduplication, or duplication of a root word, is a minor process in the formation of Q'anjob'al vocabulary, as in the following:

''tx'itam''&lt;br /&gt;
'pig'&lt;br /&gt; 
(onomatopoeic: based on the sound it makes)

''pux-pux''&lt;br /&gt;
'belly of animal'

''tx'a-tx'a''&lt;br /&gt;
'chewing gum'

==Vocabulary==
Q'anjob'al consists of groups of [[root]]s that can take affixes. Words are traditionally classified as [[nouns]], [[adjectives]], [[adverbs]], [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] and [[transitive verb|transitive]] [[verb]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s, and positionals. Positionals are a group of roots which cannot function as words on their own; in combination with affixes they are used to describe relationships of position and location. Particles are words that do not take affixes; they mostly function in adverbial roles, and include such things as [[interrogative particle]]s, affirmative/negative words, markers of time and location, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], [[preposition]]s and [[demonstrative]]s.

[[Locative]]s are often formed by placing a noun after a possessed body-part term: ''s-ti b'e'', 'edge of the road' &lt; 'its-mouth road' and ''s-jolom witz'', 'mountaintop' or 'summit' &lt; 'its-head mountain'. Similarly, compound nouns may be formed by placing a noun after another possessed noun: ''y-atutal kuyoj'', 'school' &lt; 'its-house studying'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7387">[[Image:REO example.jpg|250px|right|thumb|REO sale property in [[San Diego, California]]]]
'''Real estate owned''' or '''REO''' is a term used in the United States to describe a class of [[property]] owned by a [[lender]]—typically a [[bank]], government agency, or government loan insurer—after an unsuccessful sale at a [[foreclosure]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;
William Roark (2006), ''Concise Encyclopedia of Real Estate Business Terms''
{{ISBN|0-7890-2341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A foreclosing [[beneficiary]] will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high [[loan-to-value]] mortgage following a [[real estate bubble]]. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset. (See ''[[non-performing asset]]'').

==Origin==
The term '''' originates from the term ''other real estate owned'' (OREO), which is used on financial statements to classify real estate property owned by a financial institution but which is not directly related to its business.  These financial institutions are often the lender. Lenders are primarily in the business of making loans with the intent that nearly all of those loans will be repaid in full with interest.  Seizing, managing and reselling real property collateral to recover unpaid loan balances is secondary to lenders' primary line of business. Property management companies, for whom real estate management ''is'' their primary business, use the term OREO. 

In balance sheet terms, OREO assets are considered non-earning assets for purposes of regulatory accounting.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=Investopedia|title=Real Estate Owned - REO|access-date=4 June 2016|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestateowned.asp?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186&amp;lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://connectedinvestors.com/blog/find-bank-owned-reo-properties/| title= REO Properties }} Saturday, 6 January 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[national bank]]s in the U.S., the term OREO is legally defined by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] in regulations promulgated pursuant to {{USC|12|29}}, specifically in {{USCFR|12|34}} and {{USCFR|12|160|30}}.&lt;ref name="comptrollershandbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Comptroller's Handbook: A-OREO |url=https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications/publications-by-type/comptrollers-handbook/a-oreo.pdf |location= |publisher=Office of the Comptroller of the Currency |page=2|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
As soon as a property goes into a distressed status (the borrower/home owner misses mortgage payments) the beneficiary will want to determine the amount of equity that the property has. A popular method to determine the equity is to obtain a [[Broker's Price Opinion]] (BPO) or order an [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]]. Based on the amount of equity that is determined from the BPO, the bank will decide whether to allow a [[Short sale (real estate)|short sale]] (if requested by the homeowner). If no short sale is requested by the home owner, the beneficiary will continue the foreclosure process. If the beneficiary is unable to sell the property through a short sale or at a foreclosure auction it will now become an REO property. 

After a repossession from which the property becomes classified as REO, the beneficiary will go through the process of trying to sell the property on its own or obtain the service of an REO Asset Manager. The beneficiary will remove the liens and other debts on the home and try to resell it to the public, either through future auctions, direct marketing through a real estate broker, or by itself. The asset manager may also try to contact REO realtors that specialize in certain [[ZIP code]]s to help sell this bank owned property. [[Real estate]] [[investor]]s will often purchase these properties because of discounts offered to compensate for the condition of the property.

Many larger banks and government institutions have REO/[[asset management]] departments that field bids and offers, oversee up keep, and handle sales. Some REO properties on the open market will be listed in [[Multiple Listing Service|MLS]] by the [[broker]] who performed the BPO. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Property preservation ==
Bank REO properties are generally in poor condition and need repairs and maintenance, both to satisfy property upkeep laws and to preserve and prepare the property for sale. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the [[mortgage servicer]]&lt;ref name="fannie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbaa.org/ServicerContacts.htm Property Preservation Servicer Contacts], Mortgage Bankers Association&lt;/ref&gt; and is often in turn provided by a specialized '''property preservation company'''. These ''property preservation services'' include: securing a property (changing locks, [[boarding up]]), debris removal, property maintenance (winterizing, cutting grass, repairing or tarping roof leaks), and [[Architectural conservation#Current treatments|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="fannie" &gt;"[https://www.efanniemae.com/sf/guides/ssg/relatedservicinginfo/pdf/ppmatrix.pdf Property Maintenance &amp; Management: Property Preservation Matrix]", 2010, [[Fannie Mae]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/banking-lending-credit/10204456-1.html Cleaning house]" by Kristen Hampshire, ''Inside Business,'' May 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to preventing damage to the property, securing a property is used to prevent or discourage re-entry by former occupants or by [[squatter]]s, which can both damage the property and require legal proceedings to remove, further complicating a sale. [[Swimming pool]]s must also be secured to prevent deaths or injuries from [[drowning]] and falls.

Lenders may purchase "real estate owned" insurance to protect against loss and liability relating to lender-owned properties. REO insurance differs from "forced placed" insurance (also "lender placed" insurance), which a lender purchases for borrower-owned property when the borrower does not insure the property.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scc.virginia.gov/boi/pubs/fp_ins.pdf Forced Placed insurance]'', Virginia State Corporation Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulk real estate owned==
Bulk REO or bulk real estate owned, from a [[real estate investor]]’s point of view, is like investing on [[wholesale real estate]] properties. On the other hand, [[bank]]s or lenders sell or open their assets in group for [[auction]] at a very low price compared to their [[market value]]. &lt;ref name="Whitney2003"&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Russ|author-last=Whitney|title=Millionaire Real Estate Mentor|publisher=Dearborn Trade Publishing|publication-date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name="Kollen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Melissa|author-last=Kollen-Rice|title=Buying Real Estate Foreclosures|edition=3rd|publisher=McGraw-Hill|publication-date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}}

'''Retail loss prevention''' is a set of practices employed by [[retail]] companies to preserve profit. Profit preservation is any business activity specifically designed to reduce preventable losses. A preventable loss is any business cost caused by deliberate or inadvertent human actions, colloquially known as "shrinkage".&lt;ref name="sennewald"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Charles A. Sennewald| author2=John H. Christman| title=Retail Crime, Security, and Loss Prevention: An Encyclopedic Reference| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_KyHUtfYIEC| year=2008| publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann| isbn=978-0-12-370529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberate human actions that cause loss to a retail company can be theft, fraud, vandalism, waste, abuse, or misconduct. Inadvertent human actions attributable to loss are poorly executed business processes, where employees fail to follow existing policies or procedures – or cases in which business policies and procedures are lacking. Loss prevention is mainly found within the retail sector but also can be found within other business environments.

Since retail loss prevention is geared towards the elimination of preventable loss&lt;ref&gt;Alan Greggo and Millie Kresevic, ''Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions'' (2011), Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and the bulk of preventable loss in retail is caused by deliberate human activity, traditional approaches to retail loss prevention have been through visible security measures matched with technology such as CCTV and electronic sensor barriers. Most companies take this traditional approach by either having their own in-house loss prevention team or using external security agencies. Charles A. Sennewald and John H. Christman state, "Four elements are necessary for a successful loss prevention plan: 1) Total support from top management, 2) A positive employee attitude, 3) Maximum use of all available resources, 4) A system which establishes both responsibility and accountability for loss prevention through evaluations that are consistent and progressive."&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Sennewald and John H. Christman (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=y_KyHUtfYIEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Charles+Sennewald+John+Christman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bBB5Ua3GMI2DqQGfk4DgAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=four%20elements&amp;f=false ''Retail crime, security and loss prevention'']. Oxford: Butterworth / Heinemann. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrink==
Periodically retail business inventories all of the merchandise in the store. Items that are unaccounted for compared to what the inventory system believes the store should have are losses or "shrink". Shrink is caused by operational errors, internal theft, and external theft. Retail loss prevention is responsible for identifying these causes and following up with training, preventing, investigating, responding to and resolving them. According to the 2018 National Retail Federal National Retail Security Survey, the average Shrink % for US Retailers is 1.33%.&lt;ref&gt;National Retail Federation, 2018 National Retail Security Survey, https://nrf.com/system/tdf/Documents/retail%20library/NRF-NRSS-Industry-Research-Survey-2018.pdf?file=1&amp;title=National%20retail%20security%20survey%202018&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Operational errors===
Operational errors are inadvertent [[human error]]s. Operational errors occur when associates do not follow existing business best practices and policies or a company lacks the proper best practices and policies to ensure work is performed with minimal human error. Operational errors also occur due to a lack of proper training for associates.

===External theft===
External theft is when customers intentionally cause shrink by theft, fraud, or vandalism. 80% of customers who steal merchandise are opportunists and do not walk into the store with the intent to steal. They find that one thing they did not expect to find, cannot afford to pay for it, and will steal it if they have the opportunity. Others are desperate who will steal essentials for their family, but only if they have the opportunity. A few steal because they like the adrenaline rush and will steal, regardless of how much money they have if they have the opportunity. The remainder are "boosters" who are thieves for a living, walk in with the full intent to steal and sell their goods for a profit, on their own, or to a "fence" that sells stolen merchandise.

The vast majority of thieves have one thing in common, they will steal only if they have the opportunity. So theft prevention is fairly easy. Constant and great customer service will eliminate most opportunity to steal. However, there are those who are not as easily deterred. Prevention techniques commonly used are customer service, Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) with inventory control devices, uninformed or plain-clothed security or loss prevention personnel, surveillance systems, dummy cameras, locked display cases, etc.

Retail loss prevention uses several prevention techniques because, like most things, there is no one answer for everything. Once all prevention measures are in place, resolving external theft in many companies includes apprehending shoplifters. State laws vary and allow business owners or representatives of the company to detain shoplifters with "reasonable force" for a "reasonable amount of time" until law enforcement arrives. Several companies have designated trained individuals who are allowed to detain shoplifters according to company policy. Modern retail loss prevention teams use surveillance techniques with camera systems or on the sales floor or a combination. Working in teams has its advantages since one person can man the cameras while the rest of the team observes on the sales floor as individual shoppers in disguise or male and female loss prevention agents posing as a couple.

Policy from company to company varies, but are basically the same. There are very specific elements that Loss Prevention must observe before detaining a shoplifter.

Some of the typical elements are:
* Observe the subject enter the store or department
* Observe the subject select merchandise
* Observe the subject conceal merchandise
* Know what the subject selected and where it was concealed
* Maintain unbroken observation of the subject

In some companies, entering a restroom or fitting room is broken surveillance and elements must start over. Observe the subject pass all points of sale. In some states, the point of sale may be the line of cash registers or the front door. One must observe the subject exit the store.

If any of the elements used by the company are not observed, Loss Prevention may not detain the subject according to company policy. The use of force or detain the shoplifter varies from company to company and take local and state laws into consideration.

Detaining an individual who did not take merchandise is referred to as a "bad stop", and depending on the severity of the situation and if force was used against the innocent business patron will depend on the severity of the consequences for the loss prevention agent. Consequences for a bad stop may include a civil lawsuit, corrective action from the company up to and including termination, criminal prosecution for kidnapping is possible if an innocent customer is moved and detained against their will, etc. So mistakes are not an option and the fear of making mistakes can be very stressful.

===Internal theft===
In cases of internal theft, company employees intentionally cause shrink by theft, fraud, vandalism, waste, abuse, or misconduct. Because associates have access to the entire building and during non-business hours, they are capable of costing the company substantial losses over a longer period of time. Internal theft is typically identified by reporting systems, first-hand visual/CCTV surveillance or tips from coworkers.

Unauthorized price markdowns on a computerized inventory system or dishonest operation of a computerized cash register will be evident on several store reports. Item markdowns, overrides, line item voids, suspended transactions, hand-keyed merchandise, refunds outside of normal transaction perimeters, cash over/shorts, and other reports will record dishonest behavior, which can be identified by an experienced user. Many companies hire a third-party to run algorithms on cash register reports to search for specific patterns and behaviors to recognize dishonest behavior. When these patterns are identified, loss prevention is notified to investigate if the behavior is intentional theft, policy violation or an inadvertent error that can be solved with additional training.

Associate merchandise theft that does not involve a computer or cash register is more difficult to identify because the offender must be witnessed directly. Whether prompted by suspicious behavior or expression, an anonymous tip, or intuition, internal theft cases are usually investigated with the use of video surveillance systems or a plainclothes loss prevention worker that the associate has not been introduced to. Because offending employees tend to adhere to a single method of theft, the installation of hidden surveillance cameras in a work area (provided company policy and local/state laws allow it) generally gives loss prevention an advantage in resolving the situation.

Once the internal theft has been proven, all required evidence has been collected, and approval is given by appropriate loss prevention or human resource management, loss prevention will bring the associate to the office for interview or interrogation. There are a few scenarios where a certified loss prevention agent will pull an associate based on a tip, rumor, or intuition and conduct a "cold interview" to attempt to acquire a verbal admission, but most companies do not allow cold interviews, as the implementations of the interview may be perceived by the associate to be an accusation of theft and have issues with civil liabilities that may result. It is often wiser to wait and complete a thorough investigation before conducting an interview unless you have a Certified Forensic Interrogator (CFI) attached to the name.

Once the interview is complete, Loss Prevention may proceed in several ways depending on the information gathered during the investigation and during the interview. Again, the investigation should identify if the associate's behavior was intentional theft, a policy violation or an inadvertent error that can be solved with additional training. If intentional theft is discovered, the police may be called and criminal charges filed. The severity of the criminal punishment will depend on the amount of property/cash/merchandise the company has lost due to the associate's dishonest/illegal behavior. To file criminal charges, the exact dollar amount stolen/lost must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to hold up in a criminal trial. Termination of employment due to theft will most likely be an outcome of the investigation.

In addition to criminal prosecution, companies have the option to seek civil restitution. In a lot of theft cases, the company loses property that cannot be returned or recovered. Since the dishonest associate represented the company, the reputation of the company may have been tarnished, relationships with business partners may suffer or terminate, and the possibility of lost business opportunities with new clients. The company also uses a lot of resources, technology, and payroll to investigate internal theft, and any other possible losses or "damages" incurred by the company due to the associate's dishonest behavior allow the company to partner with a legal firm or their own legal department to demand civil restitution from the former associate in the amount determined by a case-by-case basis. Failure of the former associate to pay the civil restitution may result in the company filing a civil lawsuit.

==Electric article surveillance==
[[File:A3tag.jpg|thumb|EAS hard tag 'a3tag']]
The development of [[electronic article surveillance]] (a magnetic device attached to the merchandise that would trigger an alarm if removed from the store, also called EAS) led to an increase in arrests; however, many cases have been dismissed due to lack of observation of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Horan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IcMtQoCeVpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Retail+loss+prevention%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eilpcYaEwT&amp;sig=OG_odZWz-LOP78tBLeQGSY7NOFs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YXqFUNjxA_KvygHwsoHgAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=EAS&amp;f=false ''The Retailer's Guide to Loss Prevention and Security''].&lt;/ref&gt; A later effort, called "benefit denial" by Read Hayes, was intended to reduce the incentives for people to take the items by destroying the usefulness of items that were improperly removed from stores through the use of measures such as exploding dye packs ([[ink tag]]s).&lt;ref name="sennewald" /&gt;

==Internal loss==
Internal loss, as with other forms of shrinkage, can be classified as either "malicious" or "non-malicious".

The malicious internal loss is shrinkage caused by individuals from within the business such as staff members and cleaning staff and anyone else involved internally in the company. Internal shrink accounted for 35 percent of shrink to businesses in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Retail Research, 2011. "The Global Retail Theft Barometer 2011", Newark, Centre for Retail Research&lt;/ref&gt; Internal shrink is caused by methods such as staff members stealing products, cashiers not ringing sales through the tills and keeping the payment for themselves, [[package pilferage]], staff selling products to friends and family at discounted prices, "sweethearting" by giving products for free to friends and family by staff, colluding with maintenance staff or external contractors to steal products, and under-ringing merchandise on the tills for friends or family so they end up paying less for the items.

Internal theft traditionally causes more loss to a business than external theft due to the increased opportunity available to internal staff members. "A well-informed security superintendent of a nationwide chain of retail stores has estimated that it takes between forty and fifty shoplifting incidents to equal the annual loss caused by one dishonest individual inside an organization."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. Fennelly (1999). ''Handbook of loss prevention and crime prevention''. 3rd ed. Woburn: Butterworth / Heinemann. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-malicious shrinkage can result from a number of operational failures within the business structure. The processing of returned or damaged stock, for example, can cause articles to be removed from inventory and discarded (which contributes directly to shrinkage) rather than sold at a discount, donated, returned to vendors for credit, or otherwise removed from inventory in a manner that minimizes financial loss.

==Civil recovery==
{{main|Civil recovery}}

The image of retail loss prevention has become linked with the controversial practice of [[civil recovery]].

In the United States, laws were enacted in the 1970s allowing merchants to be awarded damages from those who removed merchandise without paying.  Some say{{who|date=November 2013}} this law then began the development of departments that focused on retail loss prevention.&lt;ref name="sennewald"/&gt; In more modern times, merchants expanded "recovery" to include larger monetary damage awards. The controversy surrounds large retailers suing thieves in civil court for up to ten times the replacement cost of the merchandise stolen.  These recovery amounts, argued by merchants, are for the costs associated with the detection, prevention, and prosecution of theft.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In most cases, these recovery claims are secured voluntarily, in conjunction with criminal charges. Judges like to see a penitent thief repaying merchants for their crimes. It is more likely that people caught for stealing would voluntarily pay these claims rather than endure them appearing on their credit report as judgments.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">'''Same-store sales''' is a [[business]] term which refers to the difference in [[revenue]] generated by a retail chain's existing outlets over a certain period (often a [[fiscal year|fiscal quarter]] or a particular shopping season), compared to an identical period in the past, usually in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investopedia.com/terms/s/samestoresales.asp|title=Same-Store Sales|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing sales data from existing outlets (that is, by excluding new outlets or outlets which have since closed), the comparison is like-to-like, and avoids comparing data that are fundamentally incomparable. This financial and operational metric is expressed as a percentage.

Same-store sales are also known as '''comparable store sales''', '''identical store sales''' or '''like-store sales'''.

Same-store sales are widely reported by publicly owned retail chains as a key element of their operational results. For chains that are growing quickly by opening new outlets, same store sales figures allow analysts to differentiate between revenue growth that comes from new stores, and growth from improved operations at existing outlets.

By comparing how well existing outlets perform during a particular week compared to that same week in the previous year, business trends can be measured more accurately. Seasonal and geographical variations are removed from the measurement: instead of collecting an average over spans of time and location, annual changes in performance are revealed.

Growing same store sales can be explained by a number of reasons, including: marketshare gains in a retailer's trade areas; higher average purchases and/or more frequent customer visits; and successfully [[cross-selling]] into a broader product range or [[upselling]] to more expensive ones.

Sustained negative same store sales is a sure telltale that a retailer is in trouble. As large retail chains expand geographically they eventually run out of prime locations and often end up cannibalizing their existing stores to some extent, which leads to a relative decline in this metric. A rapid expansion in the number of stores followed a few years later by weak same store sales numbers shows (in hindsight) that the store additions might have been careless or rushed.

Specific store sales can also be compared. For example, a retail chain's finding that its same store sales at location '''A''' for the week-long shopping rush before Christmas are greater than those at location '''B''' is a useful piece of data. That data would have been less useful if only chain-wide sales for that week were known (with all stores averaged together), or if only year-long sales were known for that particular store. This makes same store sales a useful metric not only for external assessments of a retailer's performance, but also for internal benchmarking guiding store opening, remodelling and closing decisions.

==Calculating Comp Store Growth==
There are numerous approaches to calculating comp store sales growth with most of these falling into two broad methodologies:
# Comp Growth based only on '''stores''' that satisfy comp criteria
# Comp Growth based only on '''store-periods''' that satisfy comp criteria

The criteria used to include or exclude stores from comp growth is also widely varied and often driven by the convenience and availability of data. 

*Comp store growth reporting to the market is often generated by commercial roles having a strong connection to fiscal periods.  This tends to drive comp criteria where store sales are assessed in monthly buckets.
*Retail operations however, tend to manage in weekly time buckets which correspond to consumer shopping cycles.  Operational reporting thus tends to use comp criteria where store sales are assessed in weekly buckets.  
*With most retail trade subject to seasonal cycles, most comp growth sales looks at year-on-year (YOY) comparisons
*Comp Growth can also be considered for different time periods such as
** Week
** Month-on-Month
** Half-to-Date (HTD)
** Year-to-Date (YTD)

===Method 1 - Stores Satisfying Comp Criteria===
This methodology looks at a store's trading history and if the store has sufficient history to satisfy the current and prior comparative period (PCP), then the store is flagged as a comp store.  Trading results are then filtered for comp stores only and then measures such as Comp Sales Growth, Comp Profit Growth, etc can be evaluated.  Mathematically the length of trading history required to satisfy comp criteria will vary depending on the type of period being reported as per the following examples:
* Month-on-Month requires 13 months of trading results to qualify as a comp store
* Year-to-Date requires current and full prior year trading results to qualify as a comp store
For simplicity, some organisations simply classify stores as comp only after they have had two full years of trading.  The downside of this approach is that a store could be excluded even though there are relevant YOY results that could provide insight.

===Method 2 - Store Periods Satisfying Comp Criteria===
This methodology considers individual store periods (such as weeks or months) and classifies these as either comp or non-comp.  For example, assume we are in week 12 of the retail year and a store opened in week 5 of the prior retail year.  
* in a week-on-week report, the comp store growth would look at week 12 of current year vs week 12 of prior year
* in a year-to-date report, the comp store growth would look at weeks 5 to 12 of current year vs weeks 5 to 12 of prior year
* in year-on-year reporting once the current year has completed, the comp store growth would look at weeks 5 to 52 of current year vs weeks 5 to 52 of prior year.  This demonstrates the key difference between Method 1 and Method 2 since method one would have excluded all data for this store since the store did not fully satisfy comp criteria.  Method 2 only excludes non-comp periods resulting in a richer data set being used for comp growth measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4240">[[File:Mthomebrew maceration.JPG|right|thumb|400px|In red wine production, the [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] process was traditionally done in large vats where the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process would begin ''(in the picture this is noted by the presence of carbon dioxide bubbles)''. Secondary fermentation would take place when the wine is transferred to a second container such as a carboy or oak barrel.]]

'''Secondary fermentation''' is a process commonly associated with [[winemaking]],&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 618"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 618 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which entails a second period of [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] in a different vessel than the one used to start the fermentation process. An example of this would be starting fermentation in a [[carboy]] or stainless steel tank and then moving it over to [[oak barrels]]. Rather than being a separate, second fermentation, this is most often one single fermentation period that is conducted in multiple vessels. However, the term does also apply to procedures that could be described as a second and distinct fermentation period.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 618"/&gt;

==In wine production==
[[File:Undegorgierter Champagner.jpg|left|thumb|200px|With [[sparkling wine]]s, the by product of secondary fermentation is the containment of the carbon dioxide bubbles which makes the wine "sparkling" as well as dead [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] cells known as [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] ''(visible in the picture)'' that must be removed in a process known as ''disgorgement'' that happens prior to corking.]]

In [[sparkling wine production]], the secondary fermentation often takes places in the wine bottle that the wine will be sold in. This is most commonly known as the ''méthode champenoise'' or "[[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] method" after the [[Champagne (wine region)|region]] most noted for sparkling wine production. When the base wine (or ''[[cuvee]]'') has been produced from single [[grape (variety)|grape]] [[varietal]]s or a blend, the wine is bottled with a mixture of yeast and fresh sugar known as the ''"liqueur de tirage"''. This secondary fermentation, also known as bottle fermentation, is the process that makes the wine "bubbly" due to the containment of [[carbon dioxide]] which is normally released as a by product in regular fermentation. 

In still wine production, particularly of red wines and some white wines like [[Chardonnay]], the secondary fermentation process can also usher in the use of [[malolactic fermentation]] (or MLF) where the hard, green apple-like [[malic acid]] is converted into softer, butter-like [[lactic acid]]. In the case of a [[stuck fermentation]], a winemaker may wish to transfer the [[must]] to a second vessel and use stronger, more aggressive yeasts with high fermentation temperatures to re-initiate the fermentation process. A similar process known as ''[[governo]]'' has been used by [[Tuscany (wine)|Tuscan winemaker]]s since the 14th century with the isolation after [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] of a batch of grapes that can be added later to the wine to help prevent (or recover from) a stuck fermentation.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 618"/&gt;

'''Sorin Stati''' was a Romanian linguist, born in [[Bucharest]] on 1 February 1931, and  died in [[Paris]] in 2008. 

He held for a number of years the chair of linguistics at the [[University of Bucharest]]; then, due to a conflict with the official regime, which imposed a brutal control over academics, he moved to Italy where he obtained temporary lectureships at the [[University of Pavia]] and [[University of Venice]]. He then obtained the chair of linguistics at the [[University of Messina]] and then migrated to the [[University of Bologna]] where he held the chair of linguistics.

Sorin Stati obtained his BA in 1954 in the subject of   Classical Philology from the Faculty of Letters, University of Bucharest.  He later obtained   two doctorates in [[linguistics]]: In  1967 he received the  doctorate in general linguistics with the thesis: "Théorie et méthode en syntaxe," published in éditions de l’Académie Roumaine; translated into Italian as "Teoria e metodo nella sintassi," Bologna il mulino, 1972. In 1978 he received a doctorate at [[Sorbonne University]] with the thesis: "Le système sémantique des adjectifs dans la langue roumaine", published by Jean Fayard (1979).

== Honors ==

He was vice-President of the SILF and President of the IADA (International Association for Dialogue Analysis) until he retired due to old age. In 1993, he was elected to honorary membership in the [[Romanian Academy of Sciences]]. 
He held visiting professorships at the University of Paris (France), Aarhus University (Denmark), Lund University (Sweden), Innsbruck University (Austria), Lugano University (Switzerland).

A Festschrift was published for him in 1997: ''Dialogue analysis: units, relations and strategies beyond the sentence: contributions in honour of Sorin Stati's 65th birthday'' ed. by Edda Weigand; Eckhard Hauenherm. Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1997 {{ISBN|9783484750135}}.&lt;ref name=wc1&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/dialogue-analysis-units-relations-and-strategies-beyond-the-sentence-contributions-in-honour-of-sorin-statis-65th-birthday/oclc/37631327&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat item record]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A memorial volume was published in his honor in 2010: ''Perspectives on language use and pragmatics : a volume in memory of Sorin Stati'' ed. Alessandro Capone. Munich: Lincom Europa, 2010  {{ISBN|9783929075724}} &lt;ref name=wc2&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/perspectives-on-language-use-and-pragmatics-a-volume-in-memory-of-sorin-stati/oclc/555636797&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat item record]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

He was author or editor of a number of books in Romanian and Italian, some translated also into Spanish.&lt;ref name=wc3&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=Sorin%20Stati WorldCat author record]&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be of interest to readers that Sorin Stati's paper on pragmatics and argumentation was published in A. Capone, F. Lo PIparo, M. Carapezza, eds. 2013. Perspectives on linguistic pragmatics. Cham, Springer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5851">In [[mathematical logic]], a [[logical system]] has the '''soundness property''' [[if and only if]] every [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] that can be proved in the system is logically valid with respect to the [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] of the system.

The [[Converse (logic)#Categorical converse|converse]] of soundness is known as [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/ProofSystems.pdf |title=Types of proof system |last=Smith |first=Peter |date=2010 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, this comes down to its rules having the property of ''preserving [[truth]]''.

== Definition ==
A system with syntactic [[Logical consequence#Syntactic consequence|entailment]] &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; and [[Logical consequence#Semantic consequence|semantic entailment]] &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; is '''sound''' if for any [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ..., A_n&lt;/math&gt; of [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in its language, if &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\vdash C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\models C&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a system is sound when all of its [[Theorem|theorems]] are [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

== Logical systems ==

Soundness is among the most fundamental properties of mathematical logic. The soundness property provides the initial reason for counting a logical system as desirable. The [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] property means that every validity (truth) is provable. Together they imply that all and only validities are provable.

Most proofs of soundness are trivial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} For example, in an [[axiomatic system]], proof of soundness amounts to verifying the validity of the axioms and that the rules of inference preserve validity (or the weaker property, truth). Most axiomatic systems have only the rule of [[modus ponens]] (and sometimes substitution),{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} so it requires only verifying the validity of the axioms and one rule of inference.

Soundness properties come in two main varieties: weak and strong soundness, of which the former is a restricted form of the latter.

===Soundness===

Soundness of a [[deductive system]] is the property that any sentence that is provable in that deductive system is also true on all interpretations or structures of the semantic theory for the language upon which that theory is based. In symbols, where ''S'' is the deductive system, ''L'' the language together with its semantic theory, and ''P'' a sentence of ''L'': if ⊢&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P'', then also ⊨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P''.

===Strong soundness===

Strong soundness of a deductive system is the property that any sentence ''P'' of the language upon which the deductive system is based that is derivable from a set Γ of sentences of that language is also a [[logical consequence]] of that set, in the sense that any model that makes all members of Γ true will also make ''P'' true. In symbols where Γ is a set of sentences of ''L'': if Γ&amp;nbsp;⊢&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P'', then also Γ&amp;nbsp;⊨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P''. Notice that in the statement of strong soundness, when Γ is empty, we have the statement of weak soundness.

===Arithmetic soundness===

If ''T'' is a theory whose objects of discourse can be interpreted as [[natural numbers]], we say ''T'' is ''arithmetically sound'' if all theorems of ''T'' are actually true about the standard mathematical integers.  For further information, see [[ω-consistent theory]].

==Relation to completeness==

The converse of the soundness property is the semantic [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]] property. A deductive system with a semantic theory is strongly complete if every sentence ''P'' that is a [[semantic consequence]] of a set of sentences Γ can be derived in the [[deduction system]] from that set. In symbols: whenever {{nowrap|Γ &lt;big&gt;⊨&lt;/big&gt; ''P''}}, then also {{nowrap|Γ &lt;big&gt;⊢&lt;/big&gt; ''P''}}. Completeness of [[first-order logic]] was first [[Gödel's completeness theorem|explicitly established]] by [[Gödel]], though some of the main results were contained in earlier work of [[Skolem]].

Informally, a soundness theorem for a deductive system expresses that all provable sentences are true. Completeness states that all true sentences are provable.

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]] shows that for languages sufficient for doing a certain amount of arithmetic, there can be no effective deductive system that is complete with respect to the intended interpretation of the symbolism of that language. Thus, not all sound deductive systems are complete in this special sense of completeness, in which the class of models (up to [[isomorphism]]) is restricted to the intended one. The original completeness proof applies to ''all'' classical models, not some special proper subclass of intended ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8323">'''Trevor Steele''' (born 1940) is an [[Australia]]n [[Esperantist]] who has written numerous short stories and novels in Esperanto. Steele's work is strongly influenced by his travel experiences in [[Germany]], [[Western Europe]] and elsewhere, and is further enriched by experiences in [[Asia]] and Australia, mainly concerning [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous people]]'s problems, which were his concern during his year and a half of working at the [[Department of Education (Australia)|Australian education department]]. He wrote two important books about relationships between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, ''Flugi kun kakatuoj'' (2010) — published in English as ''Soaring with cockatoos'' (2012) and in French as ''Comme un vol d'oiseaux sacrés'' (2013) — and ''Paradizo ŝtelita'' (''Paradise stolen'', 2012). His autobiography, ''Konvinka kamuflaĵo'' ("Convincing camouflage"), was published in 2014.

Steele's books are grounded in authenticity, to which he adds a bit of fantasy. Except for ''Apenaŭ papilioj en Bergen-Belsen'', originally written in English as "No butterflies in Bergen-Belsen", all his published books were written originally in Esperanto, after which he translated them for possible publication in English. He once told [[Chuck Smith (Esperantist)|Chuck Smith]] that while his Esperanto books sold steadily and found a ready publisher, he had many more difficulties in marketing his English works.&lt;ref name="tlblog"&gt;Chuck Smith, [http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/author-interview-trevor-steele/ Author interview: Trevor Steele], 3 February 2014, Esperanto language blog, Transparent Language. Accessed 27 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Essays==
Steele has contributed essays to ''[[Beletra Almanako]]'', the three-times-a-year periodical of Esperanto [[belles-lettres]]. One piece, ''Aurelius skribis a. P.'', appeared in the March 2008 issue, and ''Aventuroj de naivulo en la oceano de literatura 'business''' ("Adventures of a simpleton"), appeared in the September 2008 issue. The first of these imagines Aurelius, a sympathetic but skeptical Roman, writing a biography of [[Jesus]] after interviewing witnesses to his life from before the time of [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], and thereby provides background to Steele's later book ''Reluctant Messiah.''

The second essay tells of Steele's attempts to have some of his English-language manuscripts published. [[University of Queensland Press]], an honest publisher, showed him their stacks of manuscripts reaching to the ceiling and poignantly told him they could only publish six books peer year. He happened to fall victim to a [[vanity press]] scheme, which bilked him and then declared bankruptcy before it was exposed as fraudulent. He once tried publishing through [[Lulu (company)|Lulu.com]], but found that their service resulted in his books having a prohibitively high [[Fixed book price agreement|cover price]]. Later, he tried to deal with a [[literary agent]].

==Esperanto activities==
At the 82nd [[World Congress of Esperanto]] in [[Adelaide]], Steele delivered a lecture about the life and work of the late [[Patrick White]] (1912–1990), an accomplished fellow Australian who had won the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. The Esperanto text of that lecture is available on line.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20051129082923/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/Homepages/profcon/a_steele.htm Patrick White - Vivo kaj verko]" ("Life and work"), 6 April 2001. Accessed at archive.org, 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of 2002 until April 2004 Steele worked as [[Director general of the UEA|director general]] of the [[World Esperanto Association]]'s [[Central office of the UEA|central office]]. However, he had little previous administrative experience, a fact he freely admits,&lt;ref name="tlblog"/&gt; and after criticism from other people within the office and in the association in general, he announced his resignation in October 2003. "One reason was that I felt that as the director general in [[Rotterdam]] I was, paradoxically, not able to do much for Esperanto," he laments. "When I was in [[Lithuania]], for example, I taught the language to probably a thousand people, but in Rotterdam there was nothing doing in that regard."&lt;ref name="tlblog"/&gt;

Returning to Australia, Steele taught [[German language|German]] and [[medieval history|mediaeval]] and [[modern history]] at a [[Waldorf education|Steiner school]] before his retirement from teaching.&lt;ref name="tlblog"/&gt; Until 2010 Steele was an elected member of the [[Akademio de Esperanto]], the independent body of language scholars who shepherd the evolution of the planned language [[Esperanto]].

==Translations==
In 2014 Steele's English translation of [[Brazil]]ian Esperantist [[Gersi Alfredo Bays]]'s work ''"La Profeto el Pedras"'' (2000) appeared under the title ''The prophet from Pedras'' (Mondial, 192 pages, {{ISBN|978-1595692702}}). ''Loving Nora'', his English translation of [[Anja Saskia Beyer]]'s German-language ''Himbeersommer'' was also e-published that year (Amazon Digital, 228 pages, ASIN B00IFVXK3U)

[[File:HWDP Part.jpg|thumb|Heavy-weight drill string part due to stress cracking]]
'''Tripping pipe''' (or "Making a round trip" or simply "Making a trip") is the physical act of pulling the [[drill string]] out of the [[wellbore]] and then running it back in. This is done by physically breaking out or disconnecting (when pulling out of the hole) ''every other 2 or 3 joints of [[drill pipe]]'' at a time (called a [[stand (drill pipe)|stand]]) and racking them vertically in the [[derrick]]. When feasible the [[Driller (oil)|driller]] will start each successive trip on a different "break" so that after several trips fresh [[pipe dope]] will have been applied (when running back in the hole) to every segment of the drill string.

The most typical reason for tripping pipe is to replace a worn-out [[drill bit]]. Though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe. Downhole tools such as [[Measurement while drilling|MWD]] (measurement while drilling), [[Logging while drilling|LWD]] (logging while drilling) or [[mud motor]]s break down quite often. Another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe. It is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap.

==Bit trip==
[[File:Vertical Drill Bit.JPG|thumb|Vertical Drill Bit]]
Drill bits wear and tear like most any other piece of equipment. Once a bit becomes too worn to drill at an adequate rate or make a full-gauge hole, or if the bearings are thought to be near failure, a trip is undertaken to replace the bit. A trip is not considered a bit trip when the purpose of replacing the bit is to change sizes. This is only done when the crew "sets surface, intermediate or longstring" as appropriate.

==Fishing trip==
A fishing trip is when a crew is forced to trip pipe to retrieve loose items in the [[wellbore]]. This can result from something being dropped in the hole, i.e. a tool, that would cause damage to the bit if the crew attempted to drill with it on bottom. 

===Twisting off===
Another major cause is known as a "twist off". Twisting off is when the drill string parts by failing catastrophically under the torsional stress.  This may happen if the drill string below is pinched in the wellbore, or as the result of a structural weakening of the pipe caused by a washout or a crack in a threaded connection member.

===Broken string or broken bit===
When pipe snaps or a part of the bit breaks off, the crew has to recover all of the separated items from the wellbore. Recovering snapped pipe usually involves placing a specialized tool (an "overshot") with grips set inside of it over the broken pipe in an attempt to capture it. The grip works in a manner similar to [[Chinese fingercuffs]]. Sometimes the jagged top of the fish must be milled back to a round outside shape before the overshot can slip over it.  The overshot contains a packoff device to make a pressure seal so circulation can be reestablished through the bit to facilitate recovery of the fish.  For a broken bit, a magnet is commonly used to remove all of the broken parts.

===Cracked pipe or collar===
A cracked pipe can lead to a broken string. Extra care is taken when tripping for one so that too much pull does not cause the cracked pipe to snap. Cracked pipes (i.e., washouts) are usually noticed by a sudden drop in pressure. The crew will usually pump "fastline" (small lengths of manila rope taken from unraveled catline) down the drill string to make a temporary plug and time the pressure to see when it rises back to normal. This enables the crew to know how far down to expect the cracked pipe to be within a few stands; also strands of these rope segments may be seen at the point of washout. Most trips for a cracked pipe are not complete trips like a fishing trip or a bit trip. These can be as simple as only going a few stands down, to pulling the drill collars.

==Logging==
[[Well logging|Logging]] of the open hole may take place at various depths while drilling, and almost always at the end of the drilling operation. The drill string will be removed from the wellbore to allow a logging crew to conduct a survey of the well. After the logging is completed at total depth, the crew will run the drill string back into the well and then proceed to lay it down when coming out of the hole prior to installing the final set of casing (the "production casing").

==Setting surface, intermediate and longstring==
These trips are routinely expected by the crew. Setting surface occurs after the wellbore is drilled to the predetermined surface depth (e.g., after drilling below fresh water strata). The crew will remove the entire drill string to allow surface casing to be emplaced. The procedure is similar for setting intermediate, only that it typically involves a much longer drill string to be removed. Setting longstring is usually a one time operation combining both surface and intermediate casing. This saves the time of only having to undertake one pipe trip as opposed to two pipe trips.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">A '''woodwind doubler''' (or reed doubler) is a musician who can play two or more instruments from the five [[woodwind]] families ([[clarinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[bassoon]]s and [[flute]]s) or other folk or ethnic woodwind instruments (e.g., [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[panflute]], [[irish flute]]), and can play more than one instrument during a performance. A player who plays two instruments from the same family (e.g., oboe and [[English horn]], clarinet and [[bass clarinet]], flute and [[piccolo]]) is also often considered a woodwind doubler, but is usually paid  less than a player who plays instruments from different families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpopa.org/PDFS/MOA%200409.pdf Memorandum of Agreement: Denver Musicians Association, Local 20-623, AFM/Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra (April 13, 2009)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Longtime [[classical music]] practice has expected the non-principal player in a section to double the common auxiliary instrument (e.g., 2nd flute and piccolo; 2nd oboe and English horn). In commercial work, including [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[film scores]] and—most notably—[[Broadway musicals]], the practice gradually evolved, with some specialists developing great expertise with multiple members of three, four, or even all five of the woodwind families noted above. In such commercial work, players are paid an additional (percentage) premium for each additional double—but hiring four or five proficient "reed doublers" is still more cost-effective to the production than hiring numerous additional players. Even before 1940, Broadway reed players were commonly expected to double three, four, or five instruments; one of the most notorious mid-century examples was the Reed III book for ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), requiring flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and [[Tenor saxophone|tenor]] &amp; [[baritone saxophone]]s.

The term "doubler" applies no matter how many instruments the musician plays. Someone who plays saxophone, flute, and clarinet is not a "tripler".
