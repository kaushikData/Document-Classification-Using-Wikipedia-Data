      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5345">'''All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch''' ('''AIDMAM''') is a platform for women from the [[Dalit]] community to raise their voices for justice. This platform has raised several struggles and movements for self-respect and dignity. AIDMAM is a movement which was initiated by the [[National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights]] (NCDHR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asha Kowtal|url=http://idsn.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/Profiles/Asha_Kowtal_Profile_2014.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the movement is to recognize how the [[class (social)|class]], [[caste]], and [[gender identity]] of a dalit woman overlap and place them at the very bottom of the [[social hierarchy]]. They work to empower dalit women to challenge these caste, class, and gender hierarchies and move forward in their struggle for justice. They do so through networking, enhancing skills and leadership at the state and district level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2017/11/23/interview-anju-singh-aidmam/|title=Interview With Anju Singh From AIDMAM|last=Banerji|first=Mahika|date=2017-11-23|work=Feminism In India|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings and organisation ==
AIDMAM was founded in 2006 by [[convener]], [[Vimal Thorat]] and general secretary, [[Asha Kowtal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2801526761.html|title='Untouchability Is an Instrument in the Hands of the Upper Castes'|last=|first=|date=30 October 2012|work=Tehelka|access-date=13 August 2018|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dalit-womens-rights-activists-to-present-accounts-of-caste-violence-at-unhrc-5223007/|title=Dalit women’s rights activists to present accounts of caste violence at UNHRC|last=Nair|first=Shalini|date=2018-06-19|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They primarily work in North India and have intervened in six states: [[Haryana]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Bihar]], [[Madhya Pradesh|MP]] and [[Rajasthan]]. As a movement they are constantly networking with dalit, women and human rights organisations and facilitate the building of dalit women's perspective. They monitor violence against dalit women and also conduct research on these issues which facilitated their advocacy efforts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Building on the capacities of dalit women connected with the movement is one of their main activities.

In 2009, AIDMAM started a programme which worked with dalit women who were elected representatives of [[panchayats]] in five states. The aim was to train these women to act upon issues of violence against women. They also started a dalit women's self-respect [[yatra|''yatra'']], which was a monthlong ''yatra'' in 2014 where they traveled across states and organised the dalit community and campaigned against violence against dalit women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalit women's self-respect yatra|url=https://madmimi.com/p/c487a4|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, AIDMAM traveled in the [[United States]] and spoke to [[Black people|black]] activists in that country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AIDMAM held additional marches in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/jun/24/dalit-women-to-march-across-seven-haryana-districts-against-caste-violence-1832746.html|title=Dalit women to march across seven Haryana districts against caste violence|last=Mitra|first=Ritwika|date=24 June 2018|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2018, they presented a "side event" at the 38th session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] which included testimonies of caste-based violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-women-s-group-bats-for-rights-at-united-nations-forum/story-HkAmMbvna4sB6M78NMv3CI.html|title=Dalit women’s group bats for rights at United Nations forum|last=Ratnam|first=Dhamini|date=2018-06-22|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social media]] campaign, called #DalitWomenFight, is used by AIDMAM to increase support for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/aYFKgQWoIz0GxJYPDlczjK/Dalit-women-are-brewing-their-own-social-revolution.html|title=Dalit women are brewing their own social revolution|last=Masoodi|first=Ashwaq|date=2018-07-18|work=Live Mint|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2015/10/22/dalit-women-fight-caste-apartheid-black-lives-matter/43025|title=Connecting the movements for Dalit and Black lives - The Seattle Globalist|date=2015-10-22|work=The Seattle Globalist|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/dalitwomenfight-brings-fight-against-caste-based-violence-u-s-n454056|title=#DalitWomenFight Brings Fight Against Caste-Based Violence to U.S.|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angolans in Portugal''' form the country's second-largest group of African migrants, after [[Cape Verdeans in Portugal|Cape Verdeans]].&lt;ref name="Oien"&gt;{{harvnb|Øien|2007|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2006}}, official statistics showed 28,854 legal Angolan residents in Portugal.&lt;ref name="Ine2007" /&gt; However, this number is likely an underestimate of the true size of the community, as it counts neither illegal migrants nor people of Angolan origin who hold [[Portuguese nationality law|Portuguese citizenship]].&lt;ref name="Oien" /&gt;
==Migration history==
Large-scale migratory flow from Angola to Portugal began in the 1970s, around the time of Angolan independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grassi|2007|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this early flow consisted largely of ''retornados'', [[Portuguese Angolans|white Portuguese born in Angola]]. The bulk of mixed-race or black African migrants came later.&lt;ref name="Oien_a" /&gt; After the 2002 peace agreement which ended the [[Angolan Civil War]], many Angolan migrants in Portugal returned to Angola. By 2003, statistics of the Angolan embassy in Portugal showed that between 8,000 and 10,000 had already returned, and that 400 people a week were flying from Portugal to the Angolan capital [[Luanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Angola: Thousands Return from Portugal to a Homeland at Peace|periodical=Inter Press Service|last=de Queiroz|first=Mario|date=2003-03-04|accessdate=2009-03-16|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-72233214.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, statistics of the [[Instituto Nacional de Estatística]] showed that the population of Angolan legal residents did not decrease from 2001 to 2003, but instead grew by 12.6% (from 22,751 to 25,616 people).&lt;ref name="Ine2007" /&gt;

==Culture==
Angolan migrants in Portugal do not have a particularly homogeneous culture. However, two important elements of their self-described common identity are ''calor humano'' (human warmth) and ''convivência'' (living together), part of "African hospitality" and "African solidarity" which they feel is an important difference between Angolan and Portuguese social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Øien|2007|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angolan migrants in Portugal have had a significant influence on the popularisation of the ''[[kuduro]]'' musical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.analoguemagazine.com/interviews/buraka-som-sistema/ |periodical=Analogue Magazine |title=Buraka Som Sistema |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2009-03-16 |last=Solon |first=Dermot |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006234749/http://www.analoguemagazine.com/interviews/buraka-som-sistema/ |archivedate=2009-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinematic portrayals include [[Leonel Vieira]]'s 1998 blockbuster ''[[Zona J (film)|Zona J]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreira|2007|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bisphenol A''' ('''BPA''') is an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; belonging to the group of [[diphenylmethane]] derivatives and [[bisphenol]]s, with two hydroxyphenyl groups. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in [[Organic compound|organic]] solvents, but poorly soluble in water (0.344 wt % at 83 °C&lt;ref name="Fiege"/&gt;). 

BPA is a starting material for the synthesis of [[plastic]]s, primarily certain [[polycarbonate]]s and [[epoxy resin]]s, as well as some [[polysulfone]]s and certain niche materials. BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is made into a variety of common consumer goods, such as [[plastic bottle]]s including [[water bottle]]s, sports equipment, [[Compact disc|CDs]], and [[DVD]]s. Epoxy resins containing BPA are used to line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans and in making [[thermal paper]] such as that used in sales receipts.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pivnenko|first=K.|last2=Pedersen|first2=G.

BPA is a [[xenoestrogen]], exhibiting estrogen-mimicking, [[hormone]]-like properties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egan|first=Michael|date=March 2014|title=Sarah A. Vogel. Is It Safe?

Since 2008, several governments have investigated its safety, which prompted some retailers to withdraw [[polycarbonate]] products. The  U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has ended its authorization of the use of BPA in [[baby bottle]]s and infant formula packaging, based on market abandonment, not safety.&lt;ref name="FDA Regulations No Longer Authorize the Use of BPA in Infant Formula Packaging Based on Abandonment; Decision Not Based on Safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm064437.htm#regulations |title=Bisphenol A (BPA): Use in Food Contact Application  |publisher=Fda.gov |date=November 2014 |accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union and Canada have banned BPA use in baby bottles.

== Production ==
World production capacity of BPA was 1&amp;nbsp;million tons in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="Fiege" /&gt; and more than 2.2&amp;nbsp;million tons in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65L6JN20100622?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a49:g43:r3:c0.084942:b35124310:z0 |title=Experts demand European action on plastics chemical |agency=Reuters |date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[high production volume chemical]]. This compound is synthesized by the [[condensation reaction|condensation]] of [[acetone]] (hence the suffix A in the name)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Uglea | first1=Constantin V. |first2=Ioan I. |last2=Negulescu | title=Synthesis and Characterization of Oligomers | year=1991 | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | page=103 | isbn=978-0-8493-4954-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two [[equivalent (chemistry)|equivalents]] of [[phenol]]. The reaction is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by a strong acid, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) or a [[sodium polystyrene sulfonate|sulfonated polystyrene resin]]. Industrially, a large excess of phenol is used to ensure full condensation; the product mixture of the [[cumene process]] (acetone and phenol) may also be used as starting material:&lt;ref name="Fiege" /&gt;

===Polycarbonates===
{{further|Polycarbonate}}
Bisphenol A and [[phosgene]] react to give [[polycarbonate]]. The reaction is conducted under biphasic conditions; the hydrochloric acid is scavenged with aqueous base:&lt;ref name=UllmannPolyC&gt;Volker Serini "Polycarbonates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[File:Polycarbonatsynthese.svg|500px]]

Million tonnes (8&amp;nbsp;billion pounds) of BPA are consumed for this purpose yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancepoly.com/polycarbonate.asp|title=Polycarbonate (PC) Polymer Resin|publisher=Alliance Polymers, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921084954/http://www.alliancepoly.com/polycarbonate.asp|archivedate=21 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epoxy and vinyl ester resins===
It is a precursor in production of major classes of [[resin]]s, specifically the [[vinyl ester resin]]s.  This application usually begins with alkylation of BPA with [[epichlorohydrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kroschwitz|first=Jacqueline I.|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|edition=5|volume=5|page=8|isbn=978-0-471-52695-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialized derivatives===
BPA is a versatile building block from which many derivatives have been prepared. [[Nitration]] give [[dinitrobisphenol A]].  Bromination gives [[tetrabromobisphenol A]] (TBBPA), which exhibits [[fire retardant]] properties.&lt;ref name=UllmannBr&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Dagani, M. J.; Barda, H. J.; Benya, T. J.; Sanders, D. C. | title = Bromine Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPA is also used in the synthesis of [[polysulfone]]s and some [[Polyether ether ketone]]s.  It is an [[antioxidant]] in some [[plasticizer]]s, and as a [[polymerization]] inhibitor in [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Several drug candidates have been developed from bisphenol A, including [[Ralaniten]], #[[Ralaniten acetate]], and [[EPI-001]].

==Identification in plastics==
[[File:Plastic-recyc-07.svg|thumb|100px|Some [[Plastic identification code#Plastic identification code|type 7]] plastics may contain bisphenol&amp;nbsp;A|right]]
{{Main|Resin identification code}}

In the U.S., plastic packaging is split into seven broad classes for recycling purposes by a [[Plastic identification code]].  As of 2014 there are no BPA labeling requirements for plastics in the U.S. "In general, plastics that are marked with Resin Identification Codes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are very unlikely to contain BPA. Some, but not all, plastics that are marked with the Resin Identification Code 7 may be made with BPA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/safety/bpa/ |title=Bisphenol A (BPA) Information for Parents |publisher=Hhs.gov |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type 7 is the catch-all "other" class, and some type 7 plastics, such as [[polycarbonate]] (sometimes identified with the letters "PC" near the [[recycling symbol]]) and epoxy resins, are made from bisphenol&amp;nbsp;A monomer.&lt;ref name="Fiege" /&gt;&lt;!--When such plastics are exposed to hot liquids, bisphenol&amp;nbsp;A leaks out 55 times faster than it does under normal conditions.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}--&gt;&lt;!-- Unit incomplete.

Bisphenol A was discovered in 1891 by Russian chemist [[Aleksandr Dianin]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

In 1934 workers at [[I.G. Farbenindustrie]] reported the coupling of BPA and [[epichlorohydrin]].  Over the following decade, coatings and resins derived from similar materials were described by workers at the companies of DeTrey Freres in Switzerland and DeVoe and Raynolds in the US. This early work underpinned the development of epoxy resins, which in turn motivated production of BPA.&lt;ref name="UllmannEpox"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pham|first1=Ha Q.|last2=Marks|first2=Maurice J.|title=Epoxy Resins|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2012|location=Weinheim|publisher=Wiley-VCH|doi=10.1002/14356007.a09_547.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The utilization of BPA further expanded with discoveries at [[Bayer]] and [[General Electric]] on polycarbonate plastics.  These plastics first appeared in 1958, being produced by Mobay and General Electric, and Bayer.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Volker Serini "Polycarbonates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the endocrine disruption controversy, the British biochemist Edward [[Charles Dodds]] tested BPA as an artificial estrogen in the early 1930s.  He found BPA to be 37,000 times less effective than estradiol.&lt;ref name=Vogel2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vogel SA | year = 2009 | title = The Politics of Plastics: The Making and Unmaking of Bisphenol A "Safety | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 99 | issue = S3| pages = S559–S566 | pmc=2774166 | pmid=19890158 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.159228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dodds EC, Lawson W | year = 1936| title = Synthetic Œstrogenic Agents without the Phenanthrene Nucleus| journal=Nature| volume = 137| issue =3476| page = 996|bibcode=1936Natur.137..996D| doi=10.1038/137996a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W.

BPA has been found to bind to both of the [[nuclear receptor|nuclear]] [[estrogen receptor]]s (ERs), [[estrogen receptor alpha|ERα]] and [[estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]].&lt;ref name="HejmejKotula-Balak2011" /&gt; It is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol.&lt;ref name="HejmejKotula-Balak2011" /&gt; BPA can both mimic the action of estrogen and antagonize estrogen, indicating that it is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM) or [[partial agonist]] of the ER.&lt;ref name="HejmejKotula-Balak2011" /&gt; At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR).&lt;ref name="HejmejKotula-Balak2011" /&gt; In addition to receptor binding, the compound has been found to affect [[Leydig cell]] [[steroidogenesis]], including affecting [[CYP17A1|17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase]] and [[aromatase]] expression and interfering with [[LH receptor]]-ligand binding.&lt;ref name="HejmejKotula-Balak2011" /&gt;

In 1997, adverse effects of low-dose BPA exposure in laboratory animals were first proposed.&lt;ref name="C&amp;ENews"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Erickson BE | date = 2 June 2008 |title=Bisphenol A under scrutiny|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|volume=86|issue=22|pages=36–39|url=http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/86/i22/html/8622gov1.html|doi = 10.1021/cen-v086n022.p036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern studies began finding possible connections to health issues caused by exposure to BPA during pregnancy and during development. See [[Bisphenol A#US public health regulatory history|US public health regulatory history]] and [[Bisphenol A#Chemical manufacturers reactions to bans|Chemical manufacturers reactions to bans]]. As of 2014, research and debates are ongoing as to whether BPA should be banned or not.

A 2007 study investigated the interaction between bisphenol&amp;nbsp;A's and [[estrogen-related receptor gamma|estrogen-related receptor γ]] (ERR-γ). This [[orphan receptor]] (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ ([[dissociation constant]] = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER.&lt;ref name="matsushima" /&gt; BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity.&lt;ref name="matsushima" /&gt; It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM [[4-hydroxytamoxifen]] (afimoxifene).&lt;ref name="matsushima"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matsushima A, Kakuta Y, Teramoto T, Koshiba T, Liu X, Okada H, Tokunaga T, Kawabata S, Kimura M, Shimohigashi Y | title = Structural evidence for endocrine disruptor bisphenol A binding to human nuclear receptor ERR gamma | journal = J.

BPA has also been found to act as an [[agonist]] of the [[GPER]] (GPR30).&lt;ref name="ProssnitzBarton2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prossnitz|first1=Eric R.|last2=Barton|first2=Matthias|title=Estrogen biology: New insights into GPER function and clinical opportunities|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=389|issue=1–2|year=2014|pages=71–83|issn=0303-7207|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2014.02.002|pmid=24530924|pmc=4040308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[European Food Safety Authority]] "BPA poses no health risk to consumers of any age group (including unborn children, infants and adolescents) at current exposure levels".&lt;ref name="efsa2015"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |year=2015 |title=Bisphenol A |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/bisphenol |laysummary=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150121}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2017 the [[European Chemicals Agency]] concluded that BPA should be listed as a substance of very high concern due to its properties as an [[endocrine disruptor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://echa.europa.eu/-/msc-unanimously-agrees-that-bisphenol-a-is-an-endocrine-disruptor|title=MSC unanimously agrees that Bisphenol A is an endocrine disruptor - All news - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the United States' [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) banned the use of BPA in [[baby bottle]]s.&lt;ref name="Mirmira2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mirmira|first1=P|last2=Evans-Molina|first2=C|title=Bisphenol A, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus: genuine concern or unnecessary preoccupation?| journal=Translational Research: The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine|volume=164|issue=1|pages=13–21|pmid=24686036|pmc=4058392| doi=10.1016/j.trsl.2014.03.003|type=Review|year=2014|hdl=1805/8373}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also holds the position that BPA is not a health concern.  In 2011, Andrew Wadge, the chief scientist of the United Kingdom's [[Food Standards Agency]], commented on a 2011 U.S. study on dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA,&lt;ref name="Teeguarden"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teeguarden JG, Calafat AM, Ye X, Doerge DR, Churchwell MI, Gunawan R, Graham MK | title = Twenty-four hour human urine and serum profiles of bisphenol A during high-dietary exposure | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 123 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–57 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21705716 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfr160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "This corroborates other independent studies and adds to the evidence that BPA is rapidly absorbed, detoxified, and eliminated from humans – therefore is not a health concern."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.food.gov.uk/science/entry/small_pond_same_big_issues |title=Small pond, same big issues |publisher=[[Food Standards Agency|FSA]] |first=Andrew |last=Wage |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910101158/http://blogs.food.gov.uk/science/entry/small_pond_same_big_issues |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Endocrine Society]] said in 2015 that the results of ongoing laboratory research gave grounds for concern about the potential hazards of [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting chemicals]]&amp;nbsp;– including BPA&amp;nbsp;– in the environment, and that on the basis of the [[precautionary principle]] these substances should continue to be assessed and tightly regulated.&lt;ref name=endosoc&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gore AC, Chappell VA, Fenton SE, Flaws JA, Nadal A, Prins GS, Toppari J, Zoeller RT |title=Executive Summary to EDC-2: The Endocrine Society's Second Scientific Statement on Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals |journal=Endocr.

== Environmental effects ==
In 2010, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] reported that over one million pounds of BPA are released into the environment annually.&lt;ref name="Erler_Novak_2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Erler C, Novak J | title = Bisphenol a exposure: human risk and health policy | journal = J Pediatr Nurs | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 400–7 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20816563 | doi = 10.1016/j.pedn.2009.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPA can be released into the environment by both pre-consumer and post-consumer leaching. Common routes of introduction from the pre-consumer perspective into the environment are directly from chemical plastics, coat and staining manufacturers, foundries who use BPA in casting sand, or transport of BPA and BPA-containing products .&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrales|first=Jone|last2=Kristofco|first2=Lauren A.|last3=Steele|first3=W.

BPA has a low rate of evaporation from water and soil, which presents issues, despite its [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] and low concern for bio-accumulation. BPA has low [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] in the atmosphere and a low [[vapor pressure]] between 5.00 and 5.32 Pascals.  Aqueous solutions of BPA absorbs at wavelengths greater than 250&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abo|first=Rudy|date=September 2016|title=Optimized photodegradation of Bisphenol A in water using ZnO, TiO2, and SnO2 and photocatalysts under UV radiation as a decontamination procedure|url=https://www.drink-water-eng-sci.net/9/27/2016/dwes-9-27-2016.pdf|journal=Drinking Water Engineering and Science|volume=9|issue=2|pages=27–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ubiquitous nature of BPA makes the compound an important pollutant.

At low doses of BPA, the growth of roots were improved, the amount of nitrate in roots increased, the amount of ammonium in roots decreased, and the nitrate and nitrite reductase activities remained unchanged. However, at considerably higher concentrations of BPA, the opposite effects were seen for all but an increase in nitrate concentration and a decrease in nitrite and nitrate reductase activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Hai|last2=Wang|first2=Lihong|last3=Zhou|first3=Qing|date=January 2013|title=Effects of bisphenol A on growth and nitrogen nutrition of roots of soybean seedlings|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|volume=32|issue=1|pages=174–180|doi=10.1002/etc.2042|issn=1552-8618|pmid=23109293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrogen is both a plant nutritional substance, but also the basis of growth and development in plants. 

The amount of absorbed BPA on sediment was also seen to decrease with increases in temperature, as demonstrated by a study in 2006 with various plants from the [[XiangJiang River|Xiangjiang River]] in Central-South China. In general, as temperature increases, the water solubility of a compound increases. Therefore, the amount of sorbate that enters the solid phase will lower at the [[equilibrium point]]. It was also observed that the adsorption process of BPA on sediment is exothermic, the molar formation [[enthalpy]], [[Enthalpy|ΔH°]], was negative, the free energy [[Gibbs free energy|ΔG°]], was negative, and the molar [[entropy]], [[Entropy|ΔS°]], was positive. This indicates that the [[adsorption]] of BPA is driven by enthalpy. The adsorption of BPA has also been observed to decrease with increasing [[pH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Guangming|last2=Zhang|first2=Chang|last3=Huang|first3=Guohe|last4=Yu|first4=Jian|last5=Wang|first5=Qin|last6=Li|first6=Jianbing|last7=Xi|first7=Beidou|last8=Liu|first8=Hongliang|date=2006-11-01|title=Adsorption behavior of bisphenol A on sediments in Xiangjiang River, Central-south China|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653506004541|journal=Chemosphere|volume=65|issue=9|pages=1490–1499|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.04.013|pmid=16737729|bibcode=2006Chmsp..65.1490Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPA affects growth, reproduction, and development in aquatic organisms. Among freshwater organisms, fish appear to be the most sensitive species. Evidence of endocrine-related effects in fish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles has been reported at environmentally relevant exposure levels lower than those required for acute toxicity. There is a widespread variation in reported values for endocrine-related effects, but many fall in the range of 1μg/L to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref name="epa-action-plan" /&gt;

A 2009 review of the biological impacts of [[plasticizer]]s on wildlife published by the [[Royal Society]] with a focus on aquatic and terrestrial [[annelids]], [[molluscs]], [[crustaceans]], insects, fish and [[amphibian]]s concluded that BPA affects reproduction in all studied animal groups, impairs development in crustaceans and amphibians and induces genetic aberrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oehlmann J, Schulte-Oehlmann U, Kloas W, Jagnytsch O, Lutz I, Kusk KO, Wollenberger L, Santos EM, Paull GC, Van Look KJ, Tyler CR | title = A critical analysis of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1526 | pages = 2047–62 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19528055 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0242 | pmc=2873012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

===Environmental consulting ===
The company offers environmental consulting services related to the implementation and revision of environmental management systems but mainly focusing on organisational GHG management, carbon footprinting, reduction and offsetting and life-cycle assessment.

=== GHG emission reduction projects development ===

====  The  "Clear Plate" project ====
The company leads the development of the ’Clear Plate’ project [[climate protection project]] in cooperation with the Gold Standard Foundation since 2012. This project aims to reduce agricultural [greenhouse gas] emissions. Spanning around 150 000 hectares of farmland in Northern Hungary and the Transdanubian region the farmers use alga and bacteria based fertilisers in conjunction with climate smart soil cultivation methods to increase the soil carbon content which in turn results in a reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. The sale of the carbon credits generated are used to fund the biological nutrients and the technological innovations for the farmers involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldstandard.org/winning-in-social-value |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711185741/http://www.goldstandard.org/winning-in-social-value |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  The Fénykör Project  ==== 
{{Main |Fénykör}}
CSG participates in the Hungarian "Fénykör' project which is a virtual power plant consisting of several grid-connected photovoltaic plants that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by replacing conventional electricity generation technologies.

=== Accuvio ===
The company is the exclusive distributor in Hungary and Romania of an Irish corporation's [[carbon management]] software called Accuvio. Carbon management software are used to monitor organisational greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, to store and process measurement data, and to prepare  customised carbon management reports and statistics to assist in long-term carbon management and decision-making any strategic planning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/manageco2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing consultancy ===
Besides the environmental management and reporting services, Carbon Solutions Global also provides green marketing solutions and services related to the communication of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR).
Within this marketing service the company grants Zero CO2 trade mark usage rights for those who offset their greenhouse gas emissions through Carbon Solutions Global.

'''Child pornography laws in Canada''' forbid the production, distribution, and possession of [[child pornography]] and is punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment or fine of $5000.

==Visual and written representations==
Prohibition covers the visual representations of [[child sexual abuse]] and other sexual activity by persons (real or imaginary) under the age of 18 years or the depiction of their [[sexual organ]]/anal region for a sexual purpose, unless an [[artistic merit|artistic]], educational, scientific, or medical justification can be provided and the court accepts that. 

It also includes the written depictions of persons or characters (fictional or non-fictional) under the age of 18 engaging in sexual activity.&lt;ref name = "CC 163.1"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-87.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 163.1], as enacted by SC 1993, c 46, s 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in Canada can also issue orders for the deletion of material from the internet from any computer system within the court's jurisdiction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BILL C-15A: AN ACT TO AMEND THE CRIMINAL CODE AND TO AMEND OTHER ACTS |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/LS/371/371c15a-e.htm#4.%A0%20Court-Ordered |accessdate=2008-05-09 |author= Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current law criminalizes possession of purely fictional material and has been applied in the absence of any images of real children, including to possession of fictional stories with no pictures at all, or vice versa, cartoon pictures without any stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2005/april/C41354.htm R. v. Beattie] (8 April 2005). Retrieved March 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Internet==
Laws that address child pornography on the Internet regulate the nature of live-time chatting and email communications that may relate to [[Child grooming|grooming]] children for pornographic (e.g., web cam) or other sexual purposes has passed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Government of Canada |url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/news/nr/2002/doc_30529.html |title=STRONGER CHILD PORNOGRAPHY LAWS RECEIVE ROYAL ASSENT |date=2002-06-10 |accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also criminalizes the intentional access of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Parliament of Canada |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/Bills_ls.asp?Parl=37&amp;Ses=1&amp;ls=C15A |title=BILL C-15A: AN ACT TO AMEND THE CRIMINAL CODE AND TO AMEND OTHER ACTS |date=2002-09-30 |accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal Code provisions==
Canadian laws addressing child pornography are set out in Part V of [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] dealing with Sexual Offences, Public Morals and Disorderly Conduct: Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals. Section 163.1 of the Code defines child pornography to include "a visual representation, whether or not it was made by electronic or mechanical means", that "shows a person who is or is depicted as being under the age of eighteen years and is engaged in or is depicted as engaged in explicit sexual activity", or "the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen years."&lt;ref name = "CC 163.1"/&gt;

The current minimum penalty for possession of, or "accessing," child pornography is six months of imprisonment.&lt;ref name = "CC 163.1"/&gt;

==Cases==

===Eli Langer Art Show Trial===
{{Main|Eli Langer}}
One early application of this law was the [[Eli Langer]] case. In 1993, this Toronto artist had an exhibition at the Mercer Gallery. His drawings included images of children in sexual positions. Police raided the gallery and confiscated the works. Langer was eventually acquitted after a trial because his work was considered artistic enough to be justified as protected speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Tyler | first=Tracey | title = Artist backs right to paint sexual work | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | pages = | date = October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole law against simple possession of child pornography was declared void for two years in [[British Columbia]] following a 1998 ruling (''R v Sharpe'') by the Supreme Court of British Columbia but this decision was subsequently overturned by the Canadian Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = R v Sharpe |date = January 13, 1999 |court = Supreme Court of British Columbia |quote = As s-s.(4) is in violation of s.2(b) of the Charter and is not justified under s.1, s-s.(4) must be and is declared void. |url=http://www.cyber-rights.org/reports/rvsharpe.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definitive 2001 Supreme Court ruling on the case interprets the child pornography statute to include purely fictional material even when no real children were involved in its production.

'''Chinese people in the Netherlands''' form one of the largest [[overseas Chinese]] populations in [[continental Europe]].&lt;ref name="Pieke1999" /&gt; {{As of|2012}}, official statistics showed 80,198 people originating from the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) or the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]] (ROC), or people with at least one such parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CBS|2012}}; [[#Demographic characteristics|see detailed breakdown]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, these statistics do not capture the whole size of the Chinese community, which since its earliest days has included not just migrants from China, but people of Chinese ethnicity drawn from among [[overseas Chinese]] communities as well.&lt;ref name="Li2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2002|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Early Chinese labour migration to the Netherlands was drawn primarily from two sources: peddlers from [[Qingtian]], [[Zhejiang]] who began arriving in the country after [[World War I]], and seamen of [[Guangdong]] origin drawn from among the [[British Chinese]] community; the latter had initially been brought in as [[strikebreakers]] in 1911. During the [[Great Depression]], many of the seamen were laid off and also took to street peddling, especially of ''pindakoekjes'' (peanut cakes); the Dutch referred to them as "''pindaman''" ("peanut man"). Their numbers dropped as a result of voluntary outmigration and deportations; by [[World War II]], fewer than 1,000 remained.&lt;ref name="Pieke1999" /&gt;

Another group of early ethnic Chinese in the Netherlands were students; they were largely not from China, however, but were instead drawn from among [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese communities in the Dutch East Indies]]. From a group of 20 in 1911, their numbers continued to increase, interrupted only by [[World War II]]; in 1957, out of the roughly 1,400 ethnic Chinese from Indonesia in the Netherlands, 1,000 were students.&lt;ref name="Li2002" /&gt; In 1911, these students established the Chung Hwa Hui, which was in contact with various Chinese organizations and political parties in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Stutje 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Largely of [[Peranakan]] origin, the students tended to speak [[languages of Indonesia|Indonesian local languages]] as their mother tongues, and had already done their early education at Dutch-medium schools.&lt;ref name="Pieke1999" /&gt; However, with increasing tensions in [[Indonesia–Netherlands relations]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the number of students dropped off sharply.&lt;ref name="Li2002" /&gt; 

Though the number of Chinese students from Indonesia dropped off, tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese were forced to leave the country due to the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|violent political situation in Indonesia in 1965]]. Most went to China, the United States, or Australia, but those who had been educated in Dutch preferentially chose the Netherlands as their destination; there are no exact statistics, but the migrants themselves estimate that about 5,000 arrived during this period. As with the students, these migrants tended to speak no Chinese, with Indonesian languages as their mother tongues and Dutch as their academic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|1998|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[Hong Kong]] also became a significant source of Chinese migrants to the Netherlands, with about 600 to 800 per year, falling off to around 300 to 400 per year by the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Pieke1999a"&gt;{{harvnb|Pieke|1999|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1980s, the Netherlands began to become a popular choice for students from [[mainland China]]. Factors which influenced this popularity included the tuition fees, which were relatively lower than those in the United Kingdom, and the ease of obtaining a student visa as compared to the United States. In the beginning, these were PRC government-financed students, consisting of top students selected by examination, and gained admission at prestigious Dutch universities such as [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2002|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1990s, more privately financed students, students on Dutch scholarships, and short-term exchange students began to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2002|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, embassy figures showed roughly 4,000 PRC students in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2002|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic characteristics==
{{As of|2012}}, figures from the [[Netherlands]]' [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] showed:
*Persons born outside of the Netherlands:
**41,533 mainland China-born persons (19,466 men, 22,067 women)
**9,757 Hong Kong-born persons (4,808 men, 4,949 women)
**83 Macau-born persons (31 men, 52 women)
**2,254 Taiwan-born persons (830 men, 1,424 women)
*Persons born in the Netherlands:
**17,564 persons with at least one parent born in China (9,002 men, 8,562 women)
**8,440 persons with at least one parent born in Hong Kong (4,300 men, 4,140 women)
**36 persons with at least one parent born in Macau (18 men, 18 women)
**531 persons with at least one parent born in Taiwan (273 men, 258 women)
Totalling 80,198 persons. This represents growth of 92.8% compared to the population in 1996, the earliest year for which statistics are available. However, the various groups within the population show sharply differing growth trends. The number of persons of mainland Chinese background grew by 152% over that same period, with both overseas-born and Dutch-born segments showing a similar level of growth. In contrast, the number of persons of Hong Kong background has shown only mild growth, entirely due to natural increase rather than additional migration; in fact the stock of Hong Kong migrants fell by 5.6% during the same period.&lt;ref name="CBS2012"/&gt;

There is also migration of Surinamese Hakkas to the Netherlands who constitute about 10% of the Chinese population.

The Chinese in the Netherlands are not particularly geographically concentrated; more than half work in the restaurant trade, and because they prefer to open [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]]s where they have less competition, they tend to spread out to towns all over the country. [[Amsterdam]] has a [[Chinatown]], but it is purely a commercial district, rather than a mixed-use residential/commercial district as in Chinatowns in other countries.&lt;ref name="Pieke1999a" /&gt; [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]] also have similar districts.&lt;ref&gt;Den Haag: https://denhaag.com/en/location/179/chinatown Rotterdam: http://chinatownology.com/chinatown_rotterdam.html &lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and community==
[[File:2015 0221 CNY celebration The Hague.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese New Year]] celebrations in the [[Chinatown, The Hague|Chinatown of The Hague]], at the start of the [[Goat (zodiac)|Year of the Goat]]]]
Chinese students themselves, comparing the Netherlands to the United States, state that the Netherlands offers a peaceful and not-particularly-challenging life, but fewer opportunities; one popular saying among them is that excellent students find the Netherlands too small to fulfill their ambitions, and leave of their own volition, while average and below-average students are forced out of the country entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2002|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese in the Netherlands are often perceived to be "snakeheads", participating in smuggling Chinese migrants from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Staring 2008 p=165"&gt;{{harvnb|Staring|2008|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the Dutch government, considering the poor Dutch language abilities and lack of integration by many members of the Chinese community, began to consider officially recognising them as a disadvantaged minority, similar to Moroccan or Turkish migrants. This proved to be extremely controversial among the Chinese community; the widespread discussions in Dutch media of the problems in the community led to public perception of the Chinese as illegal migrants working for low pay and incapable of solving their own community problems, strongly embarrassing members of older generations who had stressed "invisibility and self-reliance". In the end, the government didn't grant the Chinese official minority status as the Chinese didn't want government subsidies and minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pieke|1999|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, stereotypical mainstream views only strengthened, especially as a result of several heavily publicised tragedies such as the [[2000 Dover incident]] in which 58 Chinese migrants suffocated in a [[refrigerated container]] on their way from the Netherlands to [[Dover]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="Staring 2008 p=165"/&gt;

There are also some intra-community tensions between recent expatriates, especially students, and the older [[overseas Chinese]]. The latter are largely [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]-speaking, while the former use [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as their ''[[lingua franca]]''. The divide shows up most clearly in the education of children; few international students send their children to the schools established by the old overseas Chinese, deriding them as low-quality schools "for the children of the restaurant families" and employing low-quality teachers. In contrast, the old overseas Chinese describe the students as arrogant, and view themselves as the "real representatives of the Chinese community in the Netherlands".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2002|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descendents of [[Chinese Indonesian|Indonesian-speaking Chinese]] tend to stay out of such conflict; having largely entered the liberal professions  they also look down on the "restaurant Chinese", but in return other Chinese often view them as not "really Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|1998|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rarely join any of the associations set up by other Chinese migrants or their descendants, instead preferring their own associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|1998|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act, which may be [[taboo]] in some instances, stands in stark contrast to the normal policy of [[first come, first served]] that governs most [[queue area]]s.

==Reaction==
A negative response from the rear of the line is expected when someone has cut in line up ahead. According to one study, a person cutting in line has a 54% chance that others in the line will object. With two people cutting in line, there is a 91.3% chance that someone will object. The proportion of people objecting from anywhere behind the cutter is 73.3%, with the person immediately behind the point of intrusion objecting most frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tastyresearch.wordpress.com/2006/09/21/cutting-in-line/ |title=Cutting in Line |accessdate=2007-05-15 |date=2006-09-21 |publisher=Tasty Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, physical altercation resulting from cutting is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070416/COLUMN44/704160649/1008/COLUMN |title=Line jumping – next time maybe a bribe |accessdate=2007-05-15 |date=2007-04-16 |newspaper=Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette |author=Clive McFarlane}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that an 18-year-old National Serviceman in [[Malaysia]] was bludgeoned to death after he attempted to jump the queue at a food counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/murder-at-national-service-camp |title=Murder at National Service camp |accessdate=2013-09-24 |date=2013-09-24 |newspaper=The Malaysian Insider |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925204359/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/murder-at-national-service-camp |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable incident occurred in [[New York City]] at [[The Halal Guys]] food cart, resulting in the death of the man who cut in line. The man who killed him was found not guilty by reason of self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gothamist.com/2006/10/29/street_food_sta.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812035137/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/29/street_food_sta.php |archivedate=2015-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of cutting==

Cutting is also present on roadways, especially [[Limited-access road|restricted access highways]], where traffic queues build up at merge locations. Drivers who bypass traffic by waiting until the last possible moment before merging are sometimes considered to be "cutters," and are frequent instigators of [[road rage]]. This behavior is not usually illegal in the US, unless the driver crosses a solid white line or uses dangerous merging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002192177_lanecheaters28m.html |title=Hey, no cutting in line! |accessdate=2007-06-13 |date=2005-03-02 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |author=Mike Lindblom |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618133025/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002192177_lanecheaters28m.html |archivedate=2007-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Belgium and Austria, using the [[Merge (traffic)|merging]] lane until the last moment is required by law as doing so is safer because of more uniform speeds of merging cars and reduces the length of backed up cars. (However, it does not affect the speed through the bottleneck.)

==Sanctioned line cutting==
In some instances cutting in line is sanctioned by the authority overseeing the queue. For example amusement park operators such as [[Cedar Fair]] ([[Fast Lane (Cedar Fair)|Fast Lane]]), [[Six Flags]] ([[Flash Pass]]), and [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Walt Disney]] ([[FastPass]]) have [[Virtual queue]] programs whereby a limited number of patrons can pay for the privilege of cutting the line for an attraction by arriving at a pre-designated time. Common penalties for cutting the line without this privilege range from being forced to the back of the line to ejection from the park without a refund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themeparks.about.com/cs/sixflagsparks/a/blfastlanea.htm Six Flags guests get out of line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119000325/http://themeparks.about.com/cs/sixflagsparks/a/blfastlanea.htm |date=November 19, 2016 }}, [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

At airports, it is customary &amp;ndash; for the sake of efficiency &amp;ndash; to allow pregnant women, adults accompanying small children, the elderly and the [[physically disabled]] to board an airplane first, regardless of their seat, class or assignment. However, the priority afforded wheelchair-using passengers has reportedly given rise to a practice in the United States, whereby some passengers who do not normally use a wheelchair request one, to pass through security checks quickly and to be among the first to board an aircraft. At the conclusion of the flight, these passengers walk off the aircraft, instead of waiting for a wheelchair and thus being among the last to disembark. The [[neologism]] "miracle flight" has been coined to describe this behavior, as passengers apparently needing a wheelchair before boarding the aircraft are "miraculously" able to walk afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/nyregion/a-few-passengers-use-wheelchairs-to-avoid-airport-lines.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Rolling Past a Line, Often by Exploiting a Rule |accessdate=2012-11-20 |date= 2012-10-03 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Sarah Maslin Nir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National attitudes==
In former [[Communist]] countries, where waiting in long queues was a near-daily occurrence for some, especially at times of rationing, the act of waiting in line and the code of conduct associated with it is much more institutionalized and regimented to this day (''See'' [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union#Consumer supply in the 1980s|Consumer supply in the Soviet Union in the 1980s]]). In Russia, for example, the art of queuing is finely-honed: it is acceptable for a person to leave the queue to use the bathroom (or similar brief diversion) and then return to their original place without having to ask permission. It is also common for a person to be allowed to jump to the front of the queue in special cases, like the need to purchase a ticket for an imminently departing train. This can also be seen in [[Cuba]], including notably at the Coppelia ice cream stores, and in [[Spain]] where an arriving patron asks "''¿Quién es el último?''" (Who is last?) and is then behind that person in the queue, which is not always a physical line, but may be merely a jumble of people with the same objective.

Legislators in the US state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] passed a bill that makes cutting in line to catch a [[ferry]] illegal. Cutters can be fined $101 and forced to return to the end of the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=William Yardley |title=No Cutting in Line for Puget Sound Ferries, Under Penalty of Law |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A1FF73E5B0C728DDDAD0894DF404482 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A-13 |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The gameplay consists of six levels and can be played by up to three people. Users can choose to play as Sal "The Butcher", "Anferny", or "Wheelz", a handicapped prisoner. The ultimate goal of the game is for the player to make [[parole]] without dropping the soap in the prison shower. If a prisoner "drops the soap", they must return to the beginning of the game.

==Reaction==
The [[National Prison Rape Elimination Commission]], a [[United States|U.S.]] [[bipartisan]] panel aimed at curbing prison rape, criticized the game and stated that the title made light of "a serious and all-too-pervasive violent sex crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIPARTISAN PANEL CONDEMNS "DON'T DROP THE SOAP" BOARD GAME (press release)|url=http://www.nprec.us/Press/press%20statements/1.29.08.STMT.DontDroptheSoapGame.pdf|publisher=NPREC|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'' criticized Sebelius, labelling him "The Idiot Son of an Elected Official."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Idiot Son: A Board Game|url=http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/the-idiot-son-a-board-game/Content?oid=2188761|publisher=Pitch|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politician [[Tim Huelskamp]] requested that the game be investigated and voiced concerns that the game was being marketed and stored at [[Cedar Crest (mansion)|Cedar Crest]], the Governor's mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawmaker critical of Sebelius’ son’s game|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2008/feb/23/lawmaker_critical_sebelius_sons_game/|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebelius responded to the criticism, explaining that he meant for the game to be a lighthearted spoof and was not an endorsement of prison rape.&lt;ref name=christopher&gt;Christopher, Hearne, Jr. "[http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/columnists/hearne_christopher_jr/story/474481.html Soap game has some lather]", ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', February 3, 2008, accessed June 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msnbc /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4793">The '''empty diagonal''' ([[French language|French]]: ''diagonale du vide'') is a long band of [[France|French]] territory. Stretching from the department of the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] to [[Landes (department)|Landes]], its [[population density]] is very low, compared to the rest of France.

== Description ==

The low population density (less than 30/mi², or 78/km²) is caused largely by the [[rural exodus]] and urbanisation of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jean-Claude Bontron|title=La France des faibles densités, II : Documentation bibliographique, Analyses d'études|year=1976|publisher=SEGESA-ACEAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; prefer to speak of a "low-density diagonal" (''diagonale des faibles densités'') and regard the term "empty diagonal" as both pejorative and exaggerated, but the latter remains the more common term and was used by [[Délégation interministérielle à l'aménagement du territoire et à l'attractivité régionale|DATAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilles Fumey |url=http://cafe-geo.net/wp-content/uploads/france-en-diagonales.pdf |format=PDF |title=La France en diagonales|date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The pattern is more readily apparent at the [[departments of France|departmental]] level than at the [[regions of France|regional]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avenirural.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/le-massif-central-au-coeur-de-la-diagonale-du-vide-2/ |title=Le Massif Central: au coeur de la ''diagonale du vide''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geoconfluences.ens-lyon.fr/doc/territ/FranceMut/FranceMutVoc.htm| title=La France : des territoires en mutation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a broader pattern of low population density that extends into [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] and is known as the [[continental diagonal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rozenblat, C.|url=http://www.mgm.fr/PUB/Mappemonde/M495/MAILLE.pdf |title=Tissu d'un semi de villes européennes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Yoann Doignon, Sébastien Oliveau, Isabelle Blöss-Widmer|title=L’Europe méridionale depuis 20 ans : dépeuplement, dépopulation et renouveau démographique|url=http://eps.revues.org/6171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and evolution ==

Before the emergence of the empty diagonal, an earlier demographic feature was the [[Saint-Malo]]-[[Geneva]] line, which divided the industrial northeast from the agrarian southwest. It was identified by [[Charles Dupin]] in his 1837 treatise ''Forces productives et commerciales de la France''.

In 1947 the geographer [[Jean-François Gravier]] wrote of a "French desert" that corresponds, more or less, to the modern notion of the empty diagonal. 

[[Hervé Le Bras]] and [[Emmanuel Todd]] argue that the concept is no longer valid in the 21st century because of growth that is observed in some departments like [[Indre]] and [[Gers]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Le Bras, Emmanuel Todd, ''Le Mystère français'', seuil, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to their analysis, the zone of negligible or negative population growth extends is only from the [[Massif Central]] to [[Lorraine]]. However, an analysis at the level of cantons and communes indicates that the zone of decline extends beyond the Massif-Lorraine axis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Yoann Doignon, Sébastien Oliveau|title=La diagonale se vide ? Analyse spatiale exploratoire des décroissances démographiques en France métropolitaine depuis 50 ans|date=20 January 2016|url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/27439}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the growth observed by Le Bras and Todd is fragile and driven by a temporary influx of retirees.

== Literature ==

''La diagonale du vide'' is the title of a 2009 novel by [[Pierre Péju]]&lt;ref&gt;La diagonale du vide, {{ISBN|9782070781034}}, Éditions Gallimard, Collection Blanche&lt;/ref&gt; in which an urban businessman seeks solitude in a cottage in [[Ardèche]]. 

From 2015 to 2016, the author and blogger Mathieu Mouillet spent 18 months exploring the empty diagonal and meeting its inhabitants. His "exotic voyage" is presented by notes and photographs on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La diagonale du vide|url=http://www.lesvoyagesdemat.com/diagonale-du-vide/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eritreans in Germany''' are citizens and residents of [[Germany]] who are of [[Eritrea]]n descent. According to the [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]], as of 2016, there are a total 59,800 Eritrea-born immigrants living in Germany. Of those, 28,050 individuals were granted asylum status.&lt;ref name="Popt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ausländische Bevölkerung und Schutzsuchende nach Regionen und Herkunftsländern|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/Schutzsuchende/Tabellen/StaatsangehoerigkeitSchutzstatus.html|publisher=Statistics Germany|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eucharist}}

The '''Eucharist''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|k|ər|ɪ|s|t}}; also called '''Holy Communion''' or the '''Lord's Supper''',&lt;!-- Along with "Eucharist" these two names are the most common and should appear here. Do not add other names to the lead --&gt; among other names) is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[rite]] that is considered a [[sacrament]] in most churches, and as an [[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]] in others. According to the [[New Testament]], the rite was instituted by [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] during the [[Last Supper]]; giving his disciples bread and wine during the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|meal]], Jesus commanded his followers to "do this in memory of me" while referring to the bread as "my body" and the cup of wine as "the new covenant in my blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke 22:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Do not capitalise pronouns--&gt;&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Eucharistic celebration [[Christian]]s&lt;!--link to Christians as a people, not Christianity the religion--&gt; remember both [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's sacrifice]] of himself on the cross and his commission of the apostles at the Last Supper.&lt;ref name="Methcat"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Catechism for the use of people called Methodists|date=2000|publisher=Methodist Publishing House|location=Peterborough, England|isbn=978-1858521824|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements of the Eucharist, [[sacramental bread]] (leavened or unleavened) and [[sacramental wine]] (or by  some [[Grape#Juice|grape juice]]), are consecrated on an [[altar]] (or a [[communion table]]) and consumed thereafter. Communicants, those who consume the elements, may speak of "receiving the Eucharist", as well as "celebrating the Eucharist".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christianity: Eucharist|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/eucharist_1.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=22 May 2017|date=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] believe that their [[Substance theory|substances]] actually become the body and blood of Christ ([[transubstantiation]]). [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present "in, with, and under" the forms of the bread and wine ([[sacramental union]]).&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A. G.|title=Changing Churches: An Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Theological Conversation|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English |isbn=9780802866943|page=54|quote=In this "sacramental union," Lutherans taught, the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calvinism|Reformed Christians]] believe in a [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|real spiritual presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist.&lt;ref name="McKim1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=Major Themes in the Reformed Tradition|date=11 March 1998|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781579101046|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper and a memorial.

In spite of differences among Christians about various aspects of the Eucharist, there is, according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence, the effects of the Eucharist, and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated".&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist Encyclopædia Britannica, s.v.

Other [[Protestant]] or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominations rarely use this term, preferring either "Communion", "the Lord's Supper", "Memorial", "Remembrance", or "the Breaking of Bread". [[Latter-day Saints]] call the ordinance, "Sacrament".

===Lord's Supper===
{{anchor|Supper}}
The Lord's Supper, in [[Greek language|Greek]] Κυριακὸν δεῖπνον (''Kyriakon deipnon''), was in use in the early 50s of the 1st century,&lt;ref name=LaV/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schr/&gt; as witnessed by the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:20|11:20–21]]): &lt;blockquote&gt;When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Those who use the term "Eucharist" rarely use the expression "the Lord's Supper", but it is the predominant term among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] ([[Baptists]] and  [[Pentecostals]] churches, who generally avoid using the term "Communion". They also refer to the observance as an "ordinance". Those Protestant churches generally avoid the term "sacrament".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher A. Stephenson, ''Types of Pentecostal Theology: Method, System, Spirit'', OUP US, 2012, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Olson, ''The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology'', Westminster John Knox Press, UK, 2004, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Hindson, Daniel R. Mitchell, ''The Popular Encyclopedia of Church History: The People, Places, and Events That Shaped Christianity'', Harvest House Publishers, US, 2013, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Last-supper-from-Kremikovtsi.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]] fresco (15th century) depicting the [[Last Supper]] celebrated by Jesus and his disciples. The early Christians too would have celebrated this meal to commemorate Jesus' death and subsequent resurrection.]]

===Holy Communion===
{{anchor|Communion}}
'Holy Communion' (or simply 'Communion') are used by some groups originating in the [[Protestant Reformation]] to mean the entire Eucharistic rite. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements; they speak of receiving Holy Communion even outside of the rite, and of participating in the rite without receiving Holy Communion. The term "Communion" is derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''communio'' ("sharing in common"), which translates Greek κοινωνία (''koinōnía'') in {{bibleref2|1cor|10:16||1 Corinthians 10:16}}:&lt;blockquote&gt; The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the ''communion'' of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the ''communion'' of the body of Christ?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other terms===
====Breaking of Bread====
The phrase ({{lang-gr|κλάσις τοῦ ἄρτου}} ''klasis tou artou'' "breaking of the bread"; in later Greek liturgical language also ἀρτοκλασία ''artoklasia'') appears in various related forms five times in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Luke|24:35}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|2:42}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:46}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:7}} and {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:11}}) in contexts which, according to some, may refer to the celebration of the Eucharist, in either closer or symbolically more distant reference to the Last
Supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Richardson| first=Alan| title=Introduction to the Theology of the New Testament| location=London| publisher=SCM| page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the term used by the [[Plymouth Brethren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; Nature| editor1-last=Cross| editor1-first=F.

====Sacrament or Blessed Sacrament====
The "[[Blessed Sacrament]]" and the "Blessed Sacrament of the Altar" are common terms used by Catholics, Lutherans and some Anglicans ([[Anglo-Catholicism]]) for the consecrated elements, especially when reserved in a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]]. "Sacrament of the Altar" is in common use also among Lutherans. In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] the term "[[Sacrament (Mormonism)|The Sacrament]]" is used of the rite.

====Mass====
[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is used in the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]] (especially in the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]), by many Anglicans (especially those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship), and in some other forms of [[Western Christianity]].  At least in the Catholic Church, the Mass is a longer rite which always consists of two main parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist, in that order. The Liturgy of the Word consists mainly of readings from scripture (the Bible) and a [[homily]] preached by a priest or deacon and is essentially distinct and separate from the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which comprises the entirety of the Liturgy of the Eucharist, so the Eucharist itself is only about one half of the Mass. (It is also possible and permissible in the Latin Rite for a priest to consecrate and distribute the Eucharist outside the ritual structure of the Mass—such an event is often called a communion service—but it is much more common to celebrate a full Mass.) Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are "Holy Mass", "the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord", the "Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", and the "Holy Mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=2006 |title=Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church | page=275 | publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana }}, and {{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=1997 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church | pages=1328–32 | isbn=978-1574551105 |url =http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Y.HTM }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''mass'' derives from post-classical Latin ''missa'' "dismissal", found in the concluding phrase of the liturgy, "[[Ite, missa est]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/114665 "mass"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''missa'' has come to imply a 'mission', because at the end of the Mass the congregation are sent out to serve Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concluding Rites |url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/order-of-mass/concluding-rites/index.cfm |website=www.usccb.org |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Divine Liturgy and Divine Service====
The term [[Divine Liturgy]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Θεία Λειτουργία}}) is used in [[Byzantine Rite]] traditions, whether in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or among the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. These also speak of "the Divine Mysteries", especially in reference to the consecrated elements, which they also call "the Holy Gifts".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Within [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the "Oblation" is the term used in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] churches, while "Consecration" is used in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. "Oblation" and "Consecration" are of course used also by the Eastern Catholic Churches that are of the same liturgical tradition as these churches. Likewise, in the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] language of Ireland and Scotland the word "Aifreann", usually translated into English as "Mass", is derived from [[Late Latin]] "Offerendum", meaning "oblation", "offering".&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]] ([[German language|German]]: Gottesdienst) is used in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]], in addition to the terms "Eucharist", "Mass" and "Holy Communion".&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Routledge|language=English |isbn=978-1351921169|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term reflects the Lutheran belief that God is serving the congregants in the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fblcchicago.org/worship/the-lutheran-way-of-worship|title=The Lutheran Way of Worship|last=Kellerman|first=James|publisher=First Bethlehem Lutheran Church|language=English|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Origin of the Eucharist}}
[[File:Juan de Juanes 002.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Christ with the Eucharist'', [[Vicente Juan Masip]], 16th century.]]

===Biblical basis===
The [[Last Supper]] appears in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]]: [[Gospel according to Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel according to Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel according to Luke|Luke]]. It also is found in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]],&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale Bible Dictionary / editors, Philip W. Comfort, Walter A. Elwell, 2001 {{ISBN|0842370897}}, article: ''Lord's Supper, The''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L. Cross &amp; E. A. Livingstone 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}, article ''Eucharist''&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests how early Christians celebrated what [[Paul the Apostle]] called the Lord's Supper. Although the [[Gospel of John]] does not reference the Last Supper explicitly, some argue that it contains theological allusions to the early Christian celebration of the Eucharist, especially in the chapter 6 [[Bread of Life Discourse]] but also in other passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "A Hard Saying" : The Gospel and Culture|last = Moloney|first = Francis|publisher = The Liturgical Press|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 109–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paul the Apostle and the Lord's Supper====
In his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (c. 54–55), [[Paul the Apostle]] gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus' [[Last Supper]]: "The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.'{{Bibleref2c|1cor|11:23–25||1 Cor. 11:23–25}}   Those interested might note that the Greek word for remembrance is ἀνάμνησιν or "[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]", which itself has a much richer theological history than the English word for "remember".

====Gospels====
The synoptic gospels, {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22–25}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26–29|NIV}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:13–20|NIV}}, depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper prior to his crucifixion. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical,&lt;ref&gt;Heron, Alisdair &gt;I.C. ''Table and Tradition'' Westminster Press, Philadelphia (1983) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; but Luke's Gospel presents a textual problem in that a few manuscripts omit the second half of verse 19 and all of v.20 ("given for you … poured out for you"), which are found in the vast majority of ancient witnesses to the text.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M. ''A Textual Commentary on the New Testament'' UBS (1971) pp. 173ff&lt;/ref&gt; If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke's account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark. If the majority longer text comes from the author of the third gospel, then this version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians, being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper,&lt;ref&gt;Heron, Alisdair &gt;I.C. ''Table and Tradition'' Westminster Press, Philadelphia (1983) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.&lt;ref&gt;Caird, G.B. ''The Gospel of Luke'' Pelican (1963) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniquely, in the one prayer given to posterity by Jesus, the [[Lord's Prayer]], the word [[epiousios]]—which does not exist in Classical Greek literature—has been interpreted as meaning to mean "super-substantial", and most literally interpreted as a reference to the [[Bread of Life]], the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2a3.htm |website=www.vatican.va |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the gospel of John, however, the account of the Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and "the cup" and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak of the importance of the unity of the disciples with him, with each other, and with the Father.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale Bible Dictionary / editors, Philip W. Comfort, Walter A. Elwell, 2001 {{ISBN|0842370897}}, article: "John, Gospel of"&lt;/ref&gt; Some would find in this unity and in the washing of the feet the deeper meaning of the Communion bread in the other three gospels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vatikos.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/eucharist-and-gospel-of-john/|title=Eucharist and Gospel of John|date=2013-10-11|work=VatiKos Theologie|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Bibleref2|John|6:26–65|NIV}}, the evangelist attributes a long discourse to Jesus that deals with the subject of the living bread and in {{Bibleref2|John|6:51–59|NIV|verses 52–59}} contains echoes of Eucharistic language. The interpretation of the whole passage has been extensively debated due to theological and scholarly disagreements.{{why|date=May 2015}} [[Sir Edwyn Hoskyns, 13th Baronet|Sir Edwyn Hoskyns]] notes three main schools of thought: (a) the language is metaphorical, and verse 63: "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life" gives the author's precise meaning; (b) vv 51–58 are a later interpolation that cannot be harmonized with the context; (c) the discourse is homogeneous, sacrificial, and sacramental and can be harmonized, though not all attempts are satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskyns, Sir Edwyn, ''The Fourth Gospel'', Faber and Faber, 1940, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agape feast====
[[File:Agape feast 07.jpg|thumb|right|Early Christian painting of an Agape feast.]]
The expression ''The Lord's Supper'', derived from [[St. Paul]]'s usage in {{bibleref2|1cor|11:17–34||1 Cor. 11:17–34}}, may have originally referred to the [[Agape feast]] (or love feast), the shared communal meal with which the Eucharist was originally associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=J.C. |title=''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. |year=1978 |edition=reprint |isbn=0802880452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agape feast is mentioned in {{Bibleref2|Jude|12|NIV}} but ''The Lord's Supper'' is now commonly used in reference to a celebration involving no food other than the sacramental bread and wine.

===Early Christian sources===
The [[Didache]] (Greek: Διδαχή "teaching") is an early Church treatise that includes instructions for [[Baptism]] and the Eucharist. Most scholars date it to the late 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]. The canon of the New Testament. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and distinguish in it two separate Eucharistic traditions, the earlier tradition in chapter 10 and the later one preceding it in chapter 9.&lt;ref&gt;"There are now two quite separate Eucharistic celebrations given in Didache 9–10, with the earlier one now put in second place". Crossan. The historical Jesus. Citing Riggs, John W. 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;9.1 Concerning the thanksgiving (tēs eucharistias) give thanks thus: 9.2 First, concerning the cup: "We give thanks to you, our Father, For the holy vine of David your servant which you have revealed to us through Jesus your servant. To you be glory for ever". 9.3 And concerning the fragment: "We give thanks to you, our Father, For the life and knowledge, which you have revealed to us through Jesus your servant". But let no one eat or drink of your Eucharist, unless they have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has said, "Give not that which is holy to the dogs". 10.1 After you have had your fill, give thanks thus: 10.2 We give thanks to you holy Father for your holy Name which you have made to dwell in our hearts and for the knowledge, faith and immortality which you have revealed to us through Jesus your servant. To you be glory for ever. 10.3 You Lord almighty have created everything for the sake of your Name; you have given human beings food and drink to partake with enjoyment so that they might give thanks; but to us you have given the grace of spiritual food and drink and of eternal life through Jesus your servant. 10.4 Above all we give you thanks because you are mighty.
To you be glory for ever. 10.5 Remember Lord your Church, to preserve it from all evil and to make it perfect in your love. And, sanctified, gather it from the four winds into your kingdom which you have prepared for it. Because yours is the power and the glory for ever. ...&lt;/ref&gt; The Eucharist is mentioned again in chapter 14.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;14.1 But every Lord's day do ye gather yourselves together, and break bread, and give thanksgiving after having confessed your transgressions, that your sacrifice may be pure. 14.2. But let no one that is at variance with his fellow come together with you, until they be reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be profaned. 14.3. For this is that which was spoken by the Lord: In every place and time offer to me a pure sacrifice; for I am a great King, saith the Lord, and my name is wonderful among the nations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatius of Antioch (born c. 35 or 50, died between 98 and 117), one of the Apostolic Fathers,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The tradition that Ignatius was a direct disciple of the [[Apostle John]] is consistent with the content of his letters ({{cite web |url=http://www./ |title=Introduction to the Roberts-Donaldson translation of his writings |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229052738/http://www./ |archivedate=29 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}.)&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the Eucharist as "the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
" ... (t)he eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins, and which in His loving-kindness the Father raised up. ... Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is under the bishop or him to whom he commits it. ... It is not lawful apart from the bishop either to baptize, or to hold a love-feast. But whatsoever he approves, that also is well-pleasing to God, that everything which you do may be secure and valid". [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html Letter to the Smyrnaeans, 6, 8] "Give heed to keep one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup unto union with His blood. There is one altar, as there is one bishop, together with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants; that whatsoever you do, you may do according unto God. "[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/philadelphians.html Letter to the Philadelphians, 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin Martyr]] speaks of it as more than a meal: "the food over which the prayer of thanksgiving, the word received from Christ, has been said ... is the flesh and blood of this Jesus who became flesh ... and the deacons carry some to those who are absent."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxv.html First Apology], 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paschasius Radbertus]] (785–865) was a Carolingian theologian, and the abbot of [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]], whose most well-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist written around 831, entitled ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''.
He was canonized in 1073 by [[Pope Gregory VII]]. His works are edited in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol. 120 (1852).

==Eucharistic theology==
{{Main|Eucharistic theology}}
Most Christians, even those who deny that there is any real change in the elements used, recognize a special presence of [[Christ]] in this rite. But Christians differ about exactly how, where and how long Christ is present in it.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]] teach that the reality (the "substance") of the elements of bread and wine is wholly changed into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, while the appearances (the "species") remain. The Orthodox use various terms such as Transelementation, but no 'explanation' is official as they prefer to leave it a mystery; transubstantiation is rejected as a philosophical definition and suspect because of the idea of substances smacks of magic.  [[Transubstantiation]] (change of the reality) is the term used by Catholics to denote ''what'' is changed, not to explain ''how'' the change occurs, since the Roman Catholic Church teaches that "the signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333] (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran]]s and Reformed Christians believe that the whole Christ, including the body and blood of Jesus, are present in the supper, a concept known as the [[sacramental union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horton |first=Michael S. |author-link=Michael Horton (theologian) |title=People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology |year=2008 |location=Louisville, KY |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |isbn=978-0664230715 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans specify that Christ is "in, with and under" the forms of bread and wine.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; [[Anglicans]] adhere to [[Anglican eucharistic theology|a range of views]] although the teaching in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] holds that body of Christ is received by the faithful only in a heavenly and spiritual manner. Some Christians reject the concept of the real presence, believing that the Eucharist is only a ceremonial remembrance or [[memorialism|memorial]] of the death of Christ.

The ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document of the [[World Council of Churches]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text?set_language=en Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (Faith and Order Paper no. 111, the "Lima Text")]&lt;/ref&gt; attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as "essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit", "Thanksgiving to the Father", "Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ", "the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us", "the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|real presence]]", "Invocation of the Spirit", "Communion of the Faithful", and "Meal of the Kingdom".

==Ritual and liturgy==
Many Christian denominations classify the Eucharist as a [[sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, "Anglo-Catholic" Anglicans, Old Catholics; and cf. the presentation of the Eucharist as a sacrament in the [http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry. html#c10499 ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the [[World Council of Churches]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Protestants]] (though not all) prefer to instead call it an ''[[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]]'', viewing it not as a specific channel of [[divine grace]] but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ.

The consecration of the bread (known as the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]]) and wine represents the separation of Jesus' Body from his Blood at [[Calvary]]. However, since he has risen, the Church teaches that his Body and Blood can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion]]) says "The Body of Christ" when administering the Host and "The Blood of Christ" when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire.

[[File:BentoXVI-51-11052007 (frag).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] celebrates a Mass.]]
The Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26–28|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22–24|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:19–20|NAB}}) and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul's]] {{bibleref2|1cor|11:23–25||1&amp;nbsp;Cor.&amp;nbsp;11:23–25}}) recount that in that context Jesus said of what to all appearances were bread and wine: "This is my body … this is my blood." The Catholic understanding of these words, from the Patristic authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ's words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101210092453/http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/eucharist2.html "Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Prophetic Foundations of the Eucharist". ''Inside the Vatican'' 16, no. 4 (2008): 102–105.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1551, the [[Council of Trent]] definitively declared, "Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he was offering under the species of bread,{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|6:51}} it has always been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares again that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called [[transubstantiation]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.html ''CCC 1376'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct13.html Session XIII, chapter IV]; cf. canon II)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215 had spoken of "Jesus Christ, whose body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of the altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread being changed (''transsubstantiatis'') by divine power into the body and the wine into the blood."&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Canon 1.] A misprint in this source gives "transubstantiatio" in place of "transubstantiatis" of the original: "Iesus Christus, cuius corpus et sanguis in sacramento altaris sub speciebus panis et vini veraciter continentur, transsubstantiatis pane in corpus, et vino in sanguinem potestate divina" ([http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxw#bo5 Denzinger 8020.]&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt by some twentieth-century Catholic theologians to present the Eucharistic change as an alteration of significance ([[transignification]] rather than transubstantiation) was rejected by [[Pope Paul VI]] in his 1965 encyclical letter ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]''. In his 1968 ''[[Credo of the People of God]]'', he reiterated that any theological explanation of the doctrine must hold to the twofold claim that, after the consecration, 1) Christ's body and blood are really present; and 2) bread and wine are really absent; and this presence and absence is ''real'' and not merely something in the mind of the believer.

On entering a church, [[Latin Church]] Catholics [[genuflect]] to the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] that holds the consecrated host in order to respectfully acknowledge the presence of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]], a presence signalled by a [[sanctuary lamp]] or [[votive candle]] kept burning close to such a tabernacle. (If there is no such burning light, it indicates that the tabernacle is empty of the special presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.)  Catholics will also often kneel or sit before the tabernacle, when the sanctuary light is lit, to pray directly to Jesus, materially present in the form of the Eucharist. Similarly, the consecrated Eucharistic host—the unleavened bread—is sometimes exposed on the altar, usually in an ornamental fixture called a [[Monstrance]], so that Catholics may pray or contemplate in the direct presence and in direct view of Jesus in the Eucharist; this is sometimes called "exposition of the Blessed Sacrament", and the prayer and contemplation in front of the exposed Eucharist are often called "adoration of the Blessed Sacrament" or just "adoration".  All of these practices stem from belief in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, which is an essential Article of Faith of the Catholic Church.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy.]]
{{Main|Divine Liturgy}}
Within [[Eastern Christianity]], the Eucharistic service is called the ''Divine Liturgy'' ([[Byzantine Rite]]) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the ''Liturgy of the Catechumens'' which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the [[Gospels]] and, often, a [[homily]]; the second is the ''Liturgy of the Faithful'' in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the ''[[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], '' literally: "offering" or "carrying up" ({{lang|grc|ἀνα- + φέρω}}). In the [[Rite of Constantinople]], two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to Saint [[John Chrysostom]], the other to [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil the Great]]. In the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]], a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil's is offered on the Sundays of [[Great Lent]], the eves of [[Christmas]] and [[Theophany]], [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Holy Saturday]], and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the Body and Blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSXu17g7BRwC&amp;pg=PA90 |first=Steven |last=Runciman |title=The Great Church in Captivity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1968 |isbn=0521313104 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], like the Latin Church, uses unleavened bread, whereas the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] utilizes leavened bread in their celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.orthodoxanswers.org/why-do-the-orthodox-use-leavened-bread-since-leaven-is-a-symbol-of-sin-is-not-christs-body-sinless/ Why do the Orthodox use leavened bread since leaven is a symbol of sin? Is not Christ’s body sinless? ] - orthodoxanswers.org. Retrieved 26 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventionally this change in the elements is understood to be accomplished at the ''[[Epiclesis]]'' ("invocation") by which the [[Holy Spirit]] is invoked and the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine as the true and genuine Body and Blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can be readily singled out.

===Protestant===
====Anglican====
{{Main|Anglican eucharistic theology}}
Anglican eucharistic theology is not merely [[Memorialism|memorialist]] (the belief that nothing special happens at the Lord's Supper other than devotional reflection on Christ's death). Editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] from 1559 onwards repeatedly refuse to define the Presence most often referred to as the spiritual food of the Most Precious Body and Blood.  The Words of Administration allowed for a Real Presence interpretation. Consecration effects a change, Christ is present objectively which does not depend on the faith of the recipient,  but the Church refused to define the 'how' (and still does) asking that the bread and wine 'be' the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ rather than 'become.'

The so-called 'Black Rubric' in the 1552 Prayer Book which allowed kneeling for communion but denied the real and essential presence of Christ in the elements was omitted in the 1559 edition. It was re-instated in the 1662 Book modified to deny any corporeal presence to suggest Christ was present in his natural Body. The bread and wine are held to be outward symbols of an inward and spiritual grace received by the faithful as the instruments of God's grace and Jesus' self-offering to the communicant.

In most parishes of the [[Anglican Communion]] the Eucharist is celebrated every Sunday, having replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service. The rites for the Eucharist are found in the various prayer books of the Anglican churches. Wine and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread is used. Daily celebrations are the norm in many [[cathedral]]s and parish churches sometimes offer one or more services of Holy Communion during the week. The nature of the liturgy varies according to the theological tradition of the priests, parishes, [[diocese]]s and regional churches.

====Baptist groups====
[[File:Communion Baptist.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|Serving of elements individually, to be taken in unison, is common among Baptists.]]
The bread and "fruit of the vine" indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the ''Lord's Supper''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Matthew|26:26–29}}, {{bibleref|Mark|14:22–25}}, {{bibleref|Luke|22:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; are interpreted by many [[Baptists]] as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, [[grape juice]], which they commonly refer to simply as "the Cup".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book | first=J. R. | last=Graves | year=1928 | title=What is It to Eat and Drink Unworthily | publisher=Baptist Sunday School Committee | oclc=6323560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ's breaking the bread and saying that it was his body. A [[saltine cracker|soda cracker]] is often used.

Most Baptists consider the Communion to be primarily an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment.

However, with the rise of [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], some Baptists have denied the Zwinglian doctrine of mere memorialism and have taken up a Reformed view of Communion.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Confessional Baptists believe in [[Eucharistic_theology#Pneumatic_presence|pneumatic presence]], which is expressed in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Baptist Confession]], specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7. This view is prevalent among [[Southern Baptists]], those in the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement within the some [[Independent Baptists]], [[Freewill Baptists]], and several individuals in other Baptist associations.

Communion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.

Some Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the church before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. It is rare to find a Baptist church where The Lord's Supper is observed every Sunday; most observe monthly or quarterly, with some holding Communion only during a designated Communion service or following a worship service.  Adults and children in attendance, who have not made a profession of faith in Christ, are expected to not participate.

====Lutheran====
[[File:EucharistELCA.JPG|right|thumb|Table set for the Eucharist in an ELCA service]]
{{Main|Eucharist in Lutheranism}}
{{see also|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}
[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] believe that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in this [[Lutheran sacraments|sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Augsburg Confession]], Article 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the "[[sacramental union]]". It has been called "[[consubstantiation]]" by non-Lutherans.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Cross, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', second edition, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 ''sub loco''.&lt;/ref&gt; This term is specifically rejected by Lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine and subjects the doctrine to the control of a non-biblical philosophical concept in the same manner as, in their view, does the term "[[transubstantiation]]".&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Mueller, &lt;cite&gt;''Christian Dogmatics: A Handbook of Doctrinal Theology''&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: CPH, 1934), 519; cf. also Erwin L. Lueker, &lt;cite&gt;''Christian Cyclopedia''&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: CPH, 1975), under the entry "consubstantiation".&lt;/ref&gt;

While an official movement exists in Lutheran congregations to celebrate Eucharist weekly, using formal rites very similar to the Catholic and "high" Anglican services, it was historically common for congregations to celebrate monthly or even quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingwordmedina.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=8 What Lutherans Believe About Holy Communion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320044022/http://www.livingwordmedina.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=8 |date=20 March 2011 }}.

====Mennonites and Anabaptists====
Traditional [[Mennonite]] and German Baptist Brethren Churches such as the [[Church of the Brethren]] churches and congregations have the Agape Meal, footwashing and the serving of the bread and wine two parts to the Communion service in the [[Lovefeast]]. In the more modern groups, Communion is only the serving of the Lord's Supper. In the communion meal, the members of the Mennonite churches renew their covenant with God and with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/O745ME.html |title=Ordinances |publisher=GAMEO |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren====
Among [[Open Brethren|Open]] assemblies, also termed [[Plymouth Brethren]], the Eucharist is more commonly called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. It is seen as a symbolic memorial and is central to the worship of both individual and assembly.&lt;ref name="Darby"&gt;Darby, J.N., quoted in Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the service is open to all [[baptism|baptized]] Christians, but an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting&lt;ref&gt;Muller, G. (1860) ''A Narrative of some of the Lord's dealings with George Muller'', pp. 279–81&lt;/ref&gt; and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm Brethren Online FAQs] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518150855/http://brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm |date=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Exclusive Brethren]] follow a similar practice to the [[Open Brethren]]. They also call the Eucharist the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper.&lt;ref name="Darby" /&gt;

====Reformed/Presbyterian====
{{Main|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}
In the [[Reformed Churches]] the Eucharist is variously administered. The Calvinist view of the Sacrament sees a real presence of Christ in the supper which differs both from the objective ontological presence of the Catholic view, and from the real absence of Christ and the mental recollection of the memorialism of the Zwinglians&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E. ''Reformation Thought'' Oxford: Blackwell (2003) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; and their successors.

[[File:South Leith communion token reverse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Many Presbyterian churches historically used [[communion token]]s to provide entrance to the Lord's Supper.]]
The bread and wine become the means by which the believer has real communion with Christ in his death and Christ's body and blood are present to the faith of the believer as really as the bread and wine are present to their senses but this presence is "spiritual", that is the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Hendry, George S. ''The Westminster Confession for Today'' SCM (1960) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; There is no standard frequency; John Calvin desired weekly communion, but the city council only approved monthly, and monthly celebration has become the most common practice in Reformed churches today.

Many, on the other hand, follow [[John Knox]] in celebration of the Lord's supper on a quarterly basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one's own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament as a means of grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.opc.org/OS/html/V6/4l.html|title=The Lord's Supper: How Often?|author=D. G. Hart and John R. Muether|journal=Ordained Servant|volume=6|issue=4|date=October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some churches use bread without any raising agent (whether [[leaven]] or [[yeast]]), in view of the use of [[matzo|unleavened bread]] at [[Passover seder|Jewish Passover meals]], while others use any bread available.

The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], for instance, prescribes "bread common to the culture". Harking back to the [[regulative principle of worship]], the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Over the last half a century it is much more common in Presbyterian churches to have Holy Communion monthly or on a weekly basis. It is also becoming common to receive the elements by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it) Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Most Reformed churches practice open communion", i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament.

====Methodist====
[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|A United Methodist minister consecrating the elements]]
The ''Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists'' states that, "[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|present]] with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour".&lt;ref name="Methcat" /&gt; Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in one of the fathers of the movement, [[Charles Wesley]], who wrote a Eucharistic hymn with the following stanza:&lt;ref name="AbrahamWatson2013"/&gt;
:We need not now go up to Heaven,
:To bring the long sought Saviour down;
:Thou art to all already given,
:Thou dost e’en now Thy banquet crown:
:To every faithful soul appear,
:And show Thy real presence here!&lt;ref name="AbrahamWatson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Watson|first2=David F.|title=Key United Methodist Beliefs|year=2013|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English |isbn=978-1426756610|pages=103–04|quote=Charles Wesley wrote a marvelous collection of hymns that offer an amazing vision of Christ's mysterious, yet real, presence in the bread and the wine. Here is a stanza from one of them: We need not now go up to Heaven, To bring the long sought Saviour down; Thou art to all already given, Thou dost e’en now Thy banquet crown: To every faithful soul appear, And show Thy real presence here!}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 December 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Reflecting [[Wesleyan covenant theology]], Methodists also believe that the Lord's Supper is a sign and seal of the [[covenant of grace]].&lt;ref name="Crowther1815"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowther|first=Jonathan |title=A Portraiture of Methodism|year=1815|language=English|page=224|quote=The Methodists believe, that the covenant of grace has been administered and renewed in different ages of the world. ... Under the gospel, Christ the substance, prefigured by these shadows, being exhibited, the ordinances in and by which this covenant is dispensed, are ''the preaching of the word'', and the administration of the sacraments of ''baptism'' and the ''Lord's Supper'': which ordinances, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity, and less external glory, yet hold forth this covenant in greater fulness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson1852"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Richard|title=An exposition of the gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark: and some other detached parts of Holy Scripture|year=1852|publisher=George Lane &amp; Levi Scott|language=English|page=282|quote=This covenant, the blood of Christ, that is, the pouring forth of his blood as a sacrficial victim, at once procured and ratified; so that it stands firm to all truly penitent and contrite spirits who believe in him: and of this great truth, the Lord's Supper was the instituted sign and seal; and he who in faith drinks of the cup, having reference to its signification, that blood of Christ which confirms to true believers the whole covenant of grace, is assured thereby of its faithfulness and permanence, and derives to himself the fulness of its blessings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In many [[List of Methodist denominations|Methodist denominations]], non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) is used, so as to include those who do not take alcohol for any reason, as well as a commitment to the Church's historical support of [[Temperance movement|temperance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcohol|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/who-we-are/views-of-the-church/alcohol|publisher=[[Methodist Church of Great Britain]]|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/why-do-most-methodist-churches-serve-grape-juice-instead-of-wine |title=... the use of unfermented grape juice by The United Methodist Church ... expresses pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enables the participation of children and youth, and supports the church's witness of abstinence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the [[Eucharistic Prayer]] are provided for various occasions, including communion of the sick and brief forms for occasions that call for greater brevity. Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist.

[[John Wesley]], a founder of Methodism, said that it was the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as [[communion cup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product Communion Cups, 1000] from Broadman / Holman Church Supply. Christianbook.com. Accessed 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Methodist Church]] practices open communion, inviting "all who intend a Christian life, together with their children" to receive Communion.&lt;ref&gt;UMC 1992, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nondenominational and other Christians====
[[File:Lord's cup and Bread.JPG|thumb|right|Communion elements: [[matzo]] is sometimes used for bread, emphasising the "re-creation" of the Last Supper.]]
Many non-denominational Christians, including the [[Churches of Christ]], receive communion every Sunday. Others, including [[Evangelical]] churches such as the [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]], [[Calvary Chapel]], and many forms of [[Baptist]], typically receive communion on a monthly or periodic basis. Many non-denominational Christians hold to the Biblical [[autonomy]] of local churches and have no universal requirement among congregations.

Some [[Churches of Christ]], among others, use [[grape juice]] and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.

'''Holy Qurbana''' or '''Qurbana Qadisha, ''' the "Holy Offering" or "Holy Sacrifice", refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the [[East Syrian Rite|East Syrian]] and [[West Syrian Rite|West Syrian traditions]] of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The main [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] of the East Syrian tradition is the [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari]], while that of the West Syrian tradition is the [[Liturgy of Saint James]]. Both are extremely old, going back at least to the third century, and are the oldest extant liturgies continually in use.

====Seventh-day Adventists====
In the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] the Holy Communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The service includes the ordinance of [[footwashing]] and the Lord's Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. [[Open communion]] is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.&lt;ref&gt;Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual, 17th edition, 2005, pp. 81–86. Published by the secretariat, [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seventh-day Adventists Believe: An exposition of the fundamental beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 2nd edition, 2005. Copyright Ministeral Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Chapter 16: The Lord's Supper&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] commemorates Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient [[Jewish calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; They refer to this observance generally as the "Lord's Evening Meal" or the "Memorial of Christ's Death".  They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah is a God of Covenants", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, p. 8, "Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians—the Memorial of his death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|only 144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the "anointed" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized "[[other sheep]]" of Christ's flock also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving everlasting life in Paradise restored on a "New Earth".&lt;ref name=jwbh&gt;{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as "emblems") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms denoting spiritual and sacred realities.&lt;ref name=jwbh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Discerning What We Are – At Memorial Time", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the "Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper",&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book |first= B. H. |last= Roberts |year= 1938 |title= [[Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |publisher= Deseret News Press |oclc= 0842503005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more simply referred to as the Sacrament, is administered every Sunday (except General Conference or other special Sunday meeting) in each [[Ward (LDS Church)|LDS Ward]] or branch worldwide at the beginning of [[Sacrament meeting]]. The Sacrament, which consists of both ordinary bread and water (rather than wine or grape juice), is prepared by [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] holders prior to the beginning of the meeting. At the beginning of the Sacrament, [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]] say specific prayers to bless the bread and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/20/75-84#75 |title= Doctrine and Covenants 20:75 |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sacrament is passed row-by-row to the congregation by priesthood holders (typically [[Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|deacons]]).&lt;ref name="lds. org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng&amp;query=passing+sacrament#204 |title= Handbook 2: Administering the Church, Chapter 20.4.3 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer recited for the bread and the water is found in the [[Book of Mormon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Moroni 4 |url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/4?lang=eng |website=www.lds.org |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Moroni 5 |url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/5?lang=eng |website=www.lds.org |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Doctrine and Covenants.

==Non-observing denominations==
While the [[Salvation Army]] does not reject the Eucharistic practices of other churches or deny that their members truly receive grace through this sacrament, it does not practice the sacraments of Communion or [[baptism]].  This is because they believe that these are unnecessary for the living of a Christian life, and because in the opinion of Salvation Army founders William and Catherine Booth, the sacrament placed too much stress on outward ritual and too little on inward spiritual conversion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbeachsalvationarmy.org.uk/what-to-know-more/why-does-the-salvation-army-not-baptise-or-hold-communion/ Why Does the Salvation Army Not Baptize or Hold Communion Services?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasizing the inward spiritual experience of their adherents over any outward ritual, [[Quakers]] (members of the Religious Society of Friends) generally do not baptize or observe Communion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgcquaker.org/explore/faqs-about-quakers#Sacraments How do Quakers Practice Baptism and Communion?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice and customs==
===Open and closed communion===
{{Main|Open communion|Closed communion|Full communion}}
[[File:Eucharist001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In the [[Latin Church|Western]] [[Catholic Church]], the administration of the Eucharist to children requires that they have sufficient knowledge and careful preparation to receive the body of Christ with faith and devotion.]]

[[Christianity|Christian]] denominations differ in their understanding of whether they may receive the Eucharist with those with whom they are not in [[full communion]]. The famed apologist [[Saint|St.]] [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 150) wrote: "No one else is permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true...." For the first several hundred years, non-members were forbidden even to be present at the sacramental ritual; visitors and [[catechumen]]s (those still undergoing instruction) were dismissed halfway through the Liturgy, after the Bible readings and sermon but before the Eucharistic rite. This ancient custom is still evident in the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], where the Mass is divided into two parts: the Mass of the Catechumens, and the Mass of the Faithful; and likewise in the [[ordinary form of the Roman Rite]], where the Mass is divided into the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. The [[Divine Liturgy]] of St. John Chrysostom, used in the [[Byzantine Rite]], still has a formula of dismissal of catechumens (not usually followed by any action) at this point. Likewise, the ordinary form of the Roman Rite permits{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} the dismissal of catechumens at the usual opportunity,{{Clarify|date=July 2018|reason=What is the "usual opportunity"?}} but makes this wholly optional; it is no longer essential to the rite.

Churches such as the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Churches]] practice [[closed communion]] under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Church of the East]]) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the [[Holy See]] judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Protestant]] communities exclude non-members from Communion.

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) practices open communion, provided those who receive are baptized,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionresourcesonline.org/different-types-of-religion/evangelical-lutheran.php Evangelical Lutheran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222431/http://www.religionresourcesonline.org/different-types-of-religion/evangelical-lutheran.php |date=7 July 2011 }}.

Retrieved 2016–12–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]], the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], the [[Church of Sweden]], and many other [[Lutheran]] churches outside of the US also practice open communion.
Some use the term "close communion" for restriction to members of the same denomination, and "closed communion" for restriction to members of the local congregation alone.

Most [[Protestant]] communities including [[Congregational churches]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], the [[Assemblies of God]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], most [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and [[Churches of Christ]] and other [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]] practice various forms of [[open communion]].  Some churches do not limit it to only members of the congregation, but to any person in attendance (regardless of Christian affiliation) who considers himself/herself to be a Christian.  Others require that the communicant be a baptized person, or a member of a church of that denomination or a denomination of "like faith and practice". Some Progressive Christian congregations offer communion to any individual who wishes to commemorate the life and teachings of Christ, regardless of religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;In most United Church of Christ local churches, the Communion Table is "open to all Christians who wish to know the presence of Christ and to share in the community of God's people". (Book of Worship). [http://www.ucc.org/worship/communion/ Holy Communion: A Practice of Faith in the United Church of Christ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], those who do not receive Holy Communion may enter the communion line with their arms crossed over their chest, in order to receive a [[blessing]] from the priest, instead of receiving Holy Communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Episcopal Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C_s5hetFBYoC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Anglican+Cross+Arms+over+Chest+communion#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|quote=Pastoral blessings are often available for children or adults who are not communing. Simply cross your arms over your chest if you wish to receive a blessing.|isbn=978-0819223296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a matter of local convention, this practice can also be found in Roman Catholic churches in the United States for Catholics who find themselves, for whatever reason, not in a position to receive the Eucharist itself, as well as for non-Catholics, who are not permitted to receive it. 

Most Latter-Day Saint churches practice closed communion; one notable exception is the [[Community of Christ]], the second-largest denomination in this movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/communion.asp Community of Christ: Communion] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140609170303/http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/communion.asp |date=9 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the largest of the LDS denominations) technically practice a closed communion, their official direction to local Church leaders (in Handbook 2, section 20.4.1, last paragraph) is as follows: "Although the sacrament is for Church members, the bishopric should not announce that it will be passed to members only, and nothing should be done to prevent nonmembers from partaking of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=20.

====Eastern Orthodox====
Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox church has required its members to have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this will be at least Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior to partaking of communion, and to fast from all food and water from midnight the night before.  In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one's particular priest),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/communion.htm Preparing to Receive Holy Communion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721004058/http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Communion.htm |date=21 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they must be at peace with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone.&lt;ref name="How to Prepare for the Eucharist"&gt;[http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/eucharist.html How to Prepare for the Eucharist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063618/http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/eucharist.html |date=9 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one is expected to attend [[Vespers]] or the [[All-Night Vigil]], if offered, on the night before receiving communion.&lt;ref name="How to Prepare for the Eucharist"/&gt; Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlukeorthodox.com/html/parishinfo/preparation.cfm Preparation for Holy Communion]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestant confessions====
Many Protestant congregations generally reserve a period of time for self-examination and private, silent confession just before partaking in the Lord's Supper.

====Footwashing====
Seventh-day Adventists, [[Mennonites]], and some other groups participate in "[[foot washing]]" (cf. {{Bibleref2|John|13:3–17}}) as a preparation for partaking in the Lord's Supper. At that time they are to individually examine themselves, and confess any sins they may have between one and another.

===Adoration===
{{Further|Eucharistic adoration}}
[[File:Eucharistic Adoration.jpg|thumb|upright|The Eucharist displayed in a [[monstrance]], flanked by candles]]
Eucharistic adoration is a practice in the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and some Lutheran traditions, in which the [[#Other terms|Blessed Sacrament]] is exposed to and adored by the faithful. When this exposure and adoration is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called ''Perpetual Adoration''. In a parish, this is usually done by volunteer parishioners; in a [[monastery]] or convent, it is done by the resident [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s. In the ''Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament'', the Eucharist is displayed in a [[monstrance]], typically placed on an altar, at times with a light focused on it, or with candles flanking it.

===Health issues===

The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be wheaten bread and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true wheaten bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur47.htm |title=Gluten-free Hosts |accessdate=2008-04-22 |last=McNamara |first= Father Edward |date=2004-09-14 |work= ZENIT International News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread. It also permits Holy Communion to be received under the form of either bread or wine alone, except by a priest who is celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant.&lt;ref&gt;The same 24 July 2003 letter of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many Protestant churches offer communicants gluten-free alternatives to wheaten bread, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread.&lt;ref&gt;Jax Peter Lowell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRhm1A2_EkkC#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Gluten-Free Bible''], p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Christianity and alcohol}}
The Catholic Church believes that grape juice that has not begun even minimally to ferment cannot be accepted as wine, which it sees as essential for celebration of the Eucharist. For alcoholics, but not generally, it allows the use of [[mustum]] (grape juice in which fermentation has begun but has been suspended without altering the nature of the juice), and it holds that "since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons, this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1390] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616060732/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |date=16 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. The water that in the [[Latin Church]] is prescribed to be mixed with the wine must be only a relatively small quantity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 924 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204185953/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM |date=4 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of the [[Coptic Church]] is that the mixture should be two parts wine to one part water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/4_eucharist.html Sacrament of the Eucharist: Rite of Sanctification of the Chalice]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Protestant churches allow clergy and communicants to take [[mustum]] instead of wine. In addition to, or in replacement of wine, some churches offer grape juice which has been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes; de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains), or water.&lt;ref&gt;Compare John Howard Spahr, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 I Smell the Cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921224625/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 |date=21 September 2008 }}, ''Christian Century'', 12 March 1974, pp. 257–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in [[Baptist]] churches, the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], [[Churches of Christ]], [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)]] some [[Lutherans]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], the [[Christian Missionary Alliance]], and other American [[Nondenominational Christianity|independent]] Protestant churches.

====Fear of transmission of diseases====
Risk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup is low, to the point of being undetectable. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the [[common cold]], but a study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Risk of Infectious Disease Transmission from a Common Communion Cup |first=Lilia P. |last=Manangan |first2=Lynne M. |last2=Sehulster |first3=Linda |last3=Chiarello |first4=Dawn N. |last4=Simonds |first5=William R. |last5=Jarvis |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |date=October 1998 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=538–39 |url= http://www.ntnl.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/470-common-cup-cdc |doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70029-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pellerin | first1 = J. | last2 = Edmond | first2 = M.

In influenza epidemics, some churches suspend the giving of communion under the form of wine, for fear of spreading the disease. This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/archbishops.advise.against.sharing.chalice.during.swine.flu.pandemic/23882.htm Archbishops advise against sharing chalice during swine flu pandemic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or "pillow packs" (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not accepted in Catholic Church parishes, one such church provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to communicate to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Sumathi |last=Reddy |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704415104576065982762908782 |title= Hands Off After Wafer Scare| publisher= Wall Street Journal| date=7 January 2011| accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Finnish language]] names in [[Norway]]. The first list contains all [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Kven language|Kven]] names that are officially recognised by the [[Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority]]. The second lists further Finnish names of towns in the general area (most of these names do not have official status).

Kven is closely related to Finnish and was recognised as an official minority language of Norway in 2005. It is one of three official languages of [[Porsanger|Porsanger municipality]] in [[Finnmark]].

'''''Gipsy Love''''' ([[German language|German]] title ''Zigeunerliebe'') is an [[operetta]] in three acts by [[Franz Lehár]] with a [[libretto]] by [[Alfred Maria Willner|Alfred Willner]] and [[Robert Bodanzky]], provided with English translations and revisions by several hands. The story centres on the daughter of a Romanian landowner who is engaged to a man of her own class but is attracted to a gipsy violinist at her engagement party. The brooding, romantic story featured dance music.&lt;ref name=Traubner&gt;Traubner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tkCTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA238 pp. 238–239]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original production, ''Zigeunerliebe'', had its premiere at the [[Carltheater]], Vienna, on 8 January 1910. A French version, ''Amour Tzigane'', toured France with great success in 1911, and the piece continues to be played in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Traubner/&gt; The English-language ''Gipsy Love'' opened at the [[Lunt–Fontanne Theatre|Globe Theatre]] on Broadway, on 17 October, 1911, with a libretto and lyrics by [[Harry B. Smith]] and [[Robert Bache Smith|Robert B. Smith]], and starring [[Marguerite Sylva]]. A new translation and revision by [[Basil Hood]] and [[Adrian Ross]] opened at [[Daly's Theatre]], London, on 1 June 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl]], ''Gänzl's Book of the Musical Theatre'' ({{ISBN|0-370-31157-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=September 2016}} For the London production, [[George Edwardes]] had Hood write into the new libretto the comic part of Lady Babby for [[Gertie Millar]]. He also imported Hungarian operetta star [[Sári Petráss]] for the romantic role of Ilona (renamed from the original Zorika), with [[W. H. Berry]] as Dragotin, her father. The piece was a flop in New York, but a success in London, running for 299 performances and then touring Great Britain in 1913,&lt;ref name=Traubner/&gt; featuring [[Daisy Burrell]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodway, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inari''' or '''Aanaar Sami''' are a group of [[Sami people]] who inhabit the area around [[Lake Inari]], [[Finland]]. They speak the [[Inari Sami language | Inari (Aanaar) Sami language]], which belongs to the eastern [[Sami languages]]. There are an estimated 700–900 ethnic Inari Samis in Finland, of whom approximately 300 speak Inari Sami. They are the only group of Sami who live within one state and one municipality. Inari Sami are [[indigenous peoples]] of their area.&lt;ref name="anaras - The Inari Samis"&gt;[http://www.siida.fi/anaras/english/yleistietoa/yleistietoa.html Anaras - The Inari Sami]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inari Sami homeland==
[[image:Inari lake 2003.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Lake Inari]]
The traditional homeland of Inari Sami is the shores of the Lake Inari and the surrounding areas. Historically they are believed to have inhabited a much wider area. According to historic sources and place names, they have inhabited the area which borders [[Saariselkä]] and [[Ivalo River]] in the south; [[Lemmenjoki]], [[Vaskajoki]] and [[Aksujärvi]] in the west; [[Syysjärvi]], [[Säytsjärvi]] and [[Lake Iijärvi (Inari)|Iijärvi]] in the northeast; and Lake Inari in the east. The northernmost border has possibly been at the [[Norway|Norwegian]] side of the [[Inari River]]. Their traditional homeland was divided to 11 family areas. Today their traditional homeland is in [[Inari, Finland|Inari municipality]], where they form a minority of the population.&lt;ref name="anaras - The Inari Samis" /&gt;

==History==
The first traces of human activity in the Inari area are dated to 8000–7000 BC. The first inhabitants are believed to have belonged to the [[Komsa culture]]. Most of the artifacts found from early inhabitants are linked to hunting and fishing. The [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] in [[Fennoscandia]] lasted from 2000 BC. to 1300 AD. There is only one discovery of bronze items from Inari. It was found on [[Lusman Island]] in Lake Inari, and it is dated to 900–700 BC. Similarly, there is only one finding of an iron item from the early Iron Age. Most of the findings from the later Iron Age were imported. There were active trading connections with the east, west and south. In the Middle Ages, Norway, Sweden and Novgorod started competing for control of Lapland. Joint areas of taxation were born after the border treaty between Norway and Novgorod in 1326. The first written documents about Inari Sami are from the 1550s.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.siida.fi/anaras/english/historia/historia.html Anaras - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity begun spreading among Inari Sami in 17th century; the first church was built in the area in 1642. During the Christian mission many old traditions disappeared. Some [[shaman]]s were executed for practicing witchcraft.&lt;ref name="SHYT"&gt;Lehtola, Veli-Pekka. ''Saamelaiset : historia, yhteiskunta, taide''. Jyväskylä : Gummerus, 1997 (Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finns|Finnish]] migration to Lapland began in the 17th century and Finnish settlement reached Inari in the late 18th century. There were also some Northern Sami immigration after Norway and Russia closed their borders in 1852, and eastern Sami immigration from south when Finnish settlement crawled northward. In 1920s [[Spanish Flu]] killed 190 people in the Inari area, which constituted one-tenth of the population. After the [[Second World War]] [[Skolts]] from [[Pechenga River|Pechenga]] area were evacuated and settled to Inari. Till the 1950s most Inari Samis lived in natural economy, but this was changed rapidly and during this process the use of Inari Sami language decreased.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==Culture==
Unlike most of other Sami groups, Inari Sami didn't historically practice large-scale reindeer husbandry. The more descriptive feature of Inari Sami culture was fishing and hunting. Fishing lost its importance because Lake Inari was being overfished in the 20th century. The main hunting game was [[Finnish forest reindeer]], but their numbers collapsed in the 18th century. Inari Sami moved between winter and summer homes, though this practice disappeared quite early.&lt;ref name="siida"&gt;[http://www.siida.fi/anaras/english/kulttuuri/puku.html Anars - Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inari Sami mythology had some of the same gods as Finnish mythology did. Most important of them was ''Äijih'', who had similar characteristics as Finnish [[Ukko]] had. Other gods included ''Piäiváž'' and ''Čäcialmai''. Holy sites of Inari Sami (''Sieidi'') were often on islands of Lake Inari. Most important of them was [[Ukonsaari]]. Only men were allowed to go into these holy sites, though women could go in if they dressed as men.&lt;ref name="SHYT" /&gt;

The Inari Sami costume is seen as important part of their identity, and it has been used in the Inari area uninterruptedly. The background of costumes is black or dark-blue with red, yellow and green used in the decor. Traditionally there was a winter garment (''peski'') which was made out of reindeer coat, but it has largely been replaced with modern snowmobile suits.&lt;ref name="siida" /&gt;

'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD''') is celebrated on March 8 every year.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html | title=UN WomenWatch: International Women's Day –  | publisher=UN.org | accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- LINK PARTIALLY BROKEN: UN put up a redirection with JavaScript, avoidable with "stop loading" button in browsers --&gt; It is a focal point in the movement for [[women's rights]].

After the [[Socialist Party of America]] organised a Women's Day on February 28, 1909 in [[New York (city)|New York]], the [[International Socialist Women's Conferences|1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference]] suggested a Women's Day be held annually. After women gained suffrage in [[Soviet Russia]] in 1917, March 8 became a national [[holiday]] there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the [[United Nations]].

Today, International Women's Day is a public holiday in some countries and largely ignored elsewhere.&lt;ref name=RFE100 /&gt; In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.

In August 1910, an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Copenhagen 1910|International Socialist Women's Conference]] was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012"&gt;Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, "From West to East: International Women’s Day, the First Decade”, ''Aspasia: The International Yearbook of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European Women's and Gender History'', vol. 6 (2012): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist [[Luise Zietz]] proposed the establishment of an annual Women's Day and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader [[Clara Zetkin]], supported by [[Käte Duncker]], although no date was specified at that conference.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Temma Kaplan, "On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day", Feminist Studies, 11/1 (Spring, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including [[suffrage]] for women.&lt;ref name="iwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About|title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1917 |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year on March 19, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt; In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; In Vienna, women paraded on the [[Ringstrasse]] and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Women demanded that they be given the [[right to vote]] and to hold public office.

In 1913 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Saturday in February (by the [[Julian calendar]] then used in Russia).&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;

In 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8 in Germany, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries.&lt;ref name="mmf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March – International woman's day: in search of lost memory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archivedate=March 13, 2011|deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London there was a march from Bow to [[Trafalgar Square]] in support of women's suffrage on March 8, 1914. [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was arrested in front of [[Charing Cross]] station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffragist Disorders|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|accessdate=May 9, 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=March 9, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1917, on the [[Gregorian calendar]], in the capital of the [[Russian Empire]], [[Petrograd]], women textile workers began a demonstration, covering the whole city. This marked the beginning of the [[February Revolution]], which alongside the [[October Revolution]] made up the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/revolution_postup/20170306/1489217048.html|title=February Revolution|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for "Bread and Peace"&amp;nbsp;– demanding the end of World War I, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of czarism.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets."&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; Seven days later, the [[Emperor of Russia]], [[Nicholas II]] abdicated and the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] granted women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] made it an [[Public holiday|official holiday]] in the Soviet Union, but it was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the [[USSR]] [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."

From its official adoption in Soviet Russia following the Revolution in 1917, the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|website=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist leader [[Dolores Ibárruri]] led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] began celebrating International Women's Day in the [[International Women's Year]], 1975. In 1977, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the [[UN Day]] for [[women's rights]] and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|title=International Women's Day |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, however, the day was a step back for women. In Egypt's [[Tahrir Square]], hundreds of men came out not in support, but to harass the women who came out to stand up for their rights as the police and military stood by watching the events unfold in front of them, doing nothing to stop the crowds of men.

On the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/women-day-news-2012.htm Helping women take matters into their own hands] International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;

On this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives&amp;nbsp;– friends, mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc.&amp;nbsp;– flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name="agentia.org" /&gt; In Russia, the day has lost all political context through the time, becoming simply a day to honor women and feminine beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Гуриев, Сергей Маратович|Сергей Гуриев]]''. [http://www.forbes.ru/forbes/issue/2007-03/12253-v-zashchitu-8-marta (in Russian) In defense of 8 March] // Forbes, 03.03.2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]] in 2004&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/1284/1356 |title=Reinstating International Women's Day in the Czech Republic: Feminism, Politics and the Specter of Communism |author= Karen Kapusta‐Pofahl |publisher=Washburn University |access-date= February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the proposal of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communists]]. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.&lt;ref name="Kapusta‐Pofahl" /&gt;

International Women's Day sparked violence in [[Tehran]], Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. (A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555610/international_womens_day_rally_in/ "Iranian Women Rally to Demand Equal Social, Political Rights"] ''Index-Journal'' (March 9, 2003): 9. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6426087.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iranian women struggle for equality |publisher=BBC News |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadi Sadr]], [[Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh]] and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/03/07/iran15452.htm |title=Iran: Release Women's Rights Advocates &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, actress and human rights activist [[Beata Pozniak]] worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, H. J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. [[Maxine Waters]], along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.&lt;ref name="billsummary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:h.j.res.00316: |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 103rd Congress (1993–1994) H.J.RES.316 |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese Cubans''' are [[Cuban people|Cuban]] citizens of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ancestry.

== History ==
The group of Japanese Cubans are called '''Nikkei'''. The start of Japanese immigration to Cuba was when there was a noteworthy "peak" in immigration. In 1915, it was estimated that there were fewer than 60 Japanese living in Cuba. They established an agricultural society in Carmelina. Later in 1916, 262 Japanese arrived. Most decided to get a job by harvesting cane. But the conditions were very hard for the Japanese, and some returned to Japan. Some made it to the Isle of Youth, where some families established fruit and vegetable farms. In 1926, immigration to Cuba slowed down.

On December 9, 1941, after Japan [[attacked Pearl Harbor]], President [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] declared war on Japan, along with its fascist allies, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Communist Party of Italy|Italy]]. A few days later, on December 12, all Japanese descendants living in Cuba were declared "enemy aliens". Most Japanese Cubans were seized. There was also 114 [[German people|Germans]], and 13 [[Italian people|Italians]]. As of 1943 a total of about 1,200 Japanese had immigrated to Cuba, including about 200 Okinawans. Later, over 6,000 Germans, Italians, or Japanese ancestry were deported to the [[United States]]. Some found new jobs when they arrived. Some worked as cooks, servants, and other forms of support. The prisoners were not released when the war ended. The last group was released on March 1946; over six months after Japan surrendered. After World War II, some left for Japan. Friendship between the two countries provided women to build a new community. During the 1959 revolution, and the Cuban revolution, more nikkei left for Japan.

Today it is estimated that 1,100 Japanese descendants live in Cuba; they make up 0.01% of the population.&lt;ref name="MOFA"/&gt; In 2008, the Japanese government conferred the [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun with gold and silver rays]] on Francisco Shinichi Miyasaka Machida in recognition of his contribution to the welfare of the descendants of Japanese emigrants in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)]]: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/ICSFiles/afieldfile/2008/11/04/conferment_2008_autumn.pdf  ''2008 Autumn Conferment of Decorations on Foreign Nationals,'' p. 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[Khoekhoe language]] is related to certain dialects spoken by foraging [[San people|''San'' peoples]] of the Kalahari, such as the [[Khwe language|Khwe]] and [[Tshwa language|Tshwa]], forming the [[Khoe languages|Khoe]] language family.
The two main Khoikhoi subdivisions today are the [[Nama people]] of  Namibia, Botswana and South Africa  (with numerous subtribes) and the [[Damara people|Damara]] of Namibia. Their total number is estimated at close to 300,000 people.{{year needed|date=May 2018}}

The [[Griqua people]] are a mixed-raced population in South Africa, of partial Khoikhoi and partial European ancestry. They developed their own ethnic identity in the 19th century and settled in ''[[Griqualand]]''.

[[File:Hombre khoikhoi.jpg|thumb|upright|A Khoikhoi man]]

===Early history===
The Khoikhoi, originally part of a pastoral culture and language group to be found across Southern Africa, originated in the northern area of modern [[Botswana]]. This ethnic group steadily migrated southward, eventually reaching the Cape approximately 2,000 years ago. Khoikhoi subgroups include the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] to the west, the Korana of mid-South Africa, and the Khoikhoi in the south. Their husbandry of sheep, goats and cattle grazing in fertile valleys across the region provided a stable, balanced diet, and allowed the Khoikhoi to live in larger groups in a region previously occupied by the [[San people|San]], who were subsistence hunter-gatherers. [[Bantu expansion|Advancing Bantu]] in the 3rd century AD encroached on the Khoikhoi territory, pushing them into more arid areas. There was some intermarriage between migratory Khoi bands living around what is today [[Cape Town]] and the San. But the two groups remained culturally distinct, as the Khoikhoi continued to graze livestock and the San to subsist on hunting-gathering.

===Arrival of Europeans===
The Khoi first encountered [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] explorers and merchants around AD 1500. The ongoing encounters were often violent. Local population dropped after the Khoi were exposed to [[smallpox]] by Europeans, who carried it as an endemic disease. The Khoi suffered high mortality as they had no acquired immunity to the new infectious disease. The Khoi waged more frequent attacks against Europeans when the [[Dutch East India Company]] enclosed traditional grazing land for farms. Over the following century, the Khoi were steadily driven off their land, which effectively ended their traditional life.

Khoikhoi social organisation was profoundly damaged and, in the end, destroyed by colonial expansion and land seizure from the late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, some Khoikhoi people settled on farms and became bondsmen (bondservants) or farm workers; others were incorporated into existing clan and family groups of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] people. Georg Schmidt, a [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Brother from [[Herrnhut]], Saxony, now Germany, founded [[Genadendal]] in 1738, which was the first mission station in southern Africa,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pear Tree Blossoms'', Bernhard Krueger, Hamburg, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; among the Khoi people in Baviaanskloof in the [[Riviersonderend Mountains]].

[[File:Adam Kok III - Griqua Captain - 1848.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Adam Kok, leader of the Griqua nation]]

===Griqua===
{{See also|Griqua people}}
Early European settlers sometimes intermarried with indigenous Khoikhoi women, resulting in a sizeable [[mixed-race]] population now known as the Griqua. They were known at the time as "[[Baster]]s" and in some instances are still so called, e.&amp;nbsp;g., the [[Bosluis Basters]] of the [[Richtersveld]] and the Baster community of [[Rehoboth, Namibia]].

Another group were the Griqua. Like other mixed-race peoples and the Khoikhoi, they left the [[Cape Colony]] and migrated into the interior. Responding to the influence of missionaries, they formed the states of [[Griqualand West]] and [[Griqualand East]]; these were later absorbed into the [[Cape Colony]] of the [[British Empire]].

===Kat River settlement (1829–1856) and the Khoi in the Cape Colony===
[[File:Kat River Khoi - Cape Colony 1800s.jpg|thumb|Khoi marksmen played a key role in the [[Xhosa Wars|Cape Frontier Wars]]]]
By the early 1800s, the remaining Khoi of the Cape Colony suffered from restricted civil rights and discriminatory laws on land ownership. With this pretext, the powerful Commissioner General of the Eastern Districts, [[Andries Stockenstrom]], facilitated the creation of the "Kat River" Khoi settlement near the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. The more cynical motive was probably to create a buffer-zone on the Cape's frontier, but the extensive fertile land in the region allowed the Khoi to own their land and build communities in peace. The settlements thrived and expanded, and Kat River quickly became a large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less autonomously. The people were predominantly [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans-speaking]] Gonaqua Khoi, but the settlement also began to attract other Khoi, Xhosa and mixed-race groups of the Cape.

The Khoi were known at the time for being very good marksmen, and were often invaluable allies of the Cape Colony in its [[Xhosa Wars|frontier wars]] with the neighbouring [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]. In the [[Xhosa Wars|Seventh Frontier War]] (1846–1847) against the Gcaleka Xhosa, the Khoi gunmen from Kat River distinguished themselves under their leader [[Andries Botha]] in the assault on the "[[Amatola Mountains|Amatola]] fastnesses". (The young [[John Molteno]], later Prime Minister, led a mixed Commando in the assault, and later praised the Khoi as having more bravery and initiative than most of his white soldiers.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= P.

G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape |location= London |publisher= Smith, Elder &amp; Co. |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However harsh laws were still implemented in the Eastern Cape, to encourage the Khoi to leave their lands in the Kat River region and to work as labourers on white farms. The growing resentment exploded in 1850. When the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] rose against the [[Cape Colony|Cape Government]], large numbers of Khoi joined the Xhosa rebels for the first time.&lt;ref name=oster&gt;{{cite book

===Massacres in German South-West Africa===
{{See also|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}
From 1904 to 1907, the Germans took up arms against the Khoikhoi group living in what was then [[German South-West Africa]], along with the [[Herero people|Herero]]. Over 10,000 Nama, more than half of the total Nama population at the time, may have died in the conflict.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The [[Khoikhoi mythology|religious mythology of the Khoikhoi]] gives special significance to the [[Moon]], which may have been viewed as the physical manifestation of a supreme being associated with heaven. [[Khoikhoi mythology#Tsui/Tsui'goab|Tsui'goab]] is also believed to be the creator and the guardian of health, while [[Gunab (god)|Gunab]] is primarily an evil being, who causes sickness or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://khoisan.org/religion.htm|title=Reconstructing the Past – the Khoikhoi: Religion and Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Khoikhoi have converted to Christianity and [[Islam in Namibia|Nama Muslim]]s make up a large percentage of the Namibia's Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=18129|title=Islam in Namibia, making an impact|publisher=Islamonline.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Heritage===
[[UNESCO]] has recognised Khoikhoi culture through its inscription of the [[Richtersveld]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. This important area is the only place where [[transhumance]] practices associated with the culture continue to any great extent.

The [[International Astronomical Union]] named the primary component of the [[binary star]] [[Mu1 Scorpii|Mu¹ Scorpii]] after the traditional Khoikhoi name ''Xami di mura'' ('eyes of the lion').&lt;ref name="iau1707"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1707/ |title=IAU Approves 86 New Star Names From Around the World |publisher=IAU.org |date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kidnapping in China''' has its history since the ancient times. Such issues have been heavily studied and discussed by investigators and researchers.

Since at least the 1980s, kidnapping has become a bigger issue than ever in the country.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy1"/&gt; Since the 1990s, tougher laws against the kidnapping have been established. Chinese authorities have also investigated in this regard.

==History==

Ancient Chinese text indicates the ransoming of hostages during the reign of [[Xia Dynasty]] (2070 BCE - 1600 BCE), they refer to the taking of princes and family members as hostages across the multiple dynastic periods as warrantor of negotiated treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kidnap for Ransom: Resolving the Unthinkable|page=3|first=Richard P.|last=Wright|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been number of historical incidents of kidnapping in China, In 1523, when two Japanese rival delegations had arrived in [[Ningbo]], they had looted and kidnapped Chinese civil servants. Due to such incident, the official relations with Japan were not restored until 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asian Mediterranean: Port Cities and Trading Networks in China, Japan and South Asia, 13th-21st Century|page=90|first=François|last=Gipouloux|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Opium War]], when an estimated of 18,000 British and French Soldiers had returned to the coastal forts, Chinese' response included the kidnapping of 38 Anglo-French negotiating party members, 26 of them died in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Wall: China Against the World, 1000 BC - Ad 2000|pages=283–284|publisher=Grove Press|first=Julia|last=Lovell|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Chinese government launched [[QGDGXQ]], a system for identifying and reuniting freed children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 September 2015|title=National database opens to bring abducted children home|publisher=China Daily|url=http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0921/c90882-8952940.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the Chinese government has notoriously kidnapped and imprisoned prominent businessmen including Yang Zhihui, Wu Xiaohui and Guo Guangchang. This is part of the crackdown on "market manipulation" yet critics condemn the actions of the Chinese government stating that they are breaking UN human rights regulations and censoring the freedom of speech in China.&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/24/investing/landing-casino-stock-fall-chairman-missing/index.html |title=Casino firm’s stock tanks as chairman goes missing &amp;#124; CNNMoney |publisher=edition.cnn.com |date=2018-08-24 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
During the 19th century, [[Johannes Von Gumpach]] had described the issue of kidnapping as "One of the most common crimes in China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Burlingame Mission: A Political Disclosure, Supported by Official Documents, Mostly Unpublished.

[[Carl Crow]], who traveled to China during the wars, he had described the prevalence of kidnapping in China as "well organized business in China carried out with a large degree of success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Carl Crow - A Tough Old China Hand: The Life, Times, and Adventures of an American in Shanghai|author=Paul French|page=118|year=2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==

Kidnapping has become a growing business in China. Steve Vickers of Kroll Associates has reportedly noted that some common scenarios of kidnapping in China includes the kidnapping for ransom, kidnapping of a foreigner(commonly in Hong Kong or Macau).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entering the Chinese Market: The Risks and Discounted Rewards|author1=John E. Dixon|author2=David Newman|page=90|publisher=Greenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child abductions===
An estimated 70,000 children are kidnapped in China every year,&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothkopf |first=David |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/06/china_missing_children |title=China's Missing Children |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-08/23/content_16916550.htm |title=The heartbreak of child abduction&amp;#124;Across America&amp;#124;chinadaily.com.cn |publisher=Usa.chinadaily.com.cn |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/131002/China-child-abductions-reunion |title=For sale: Chinese babies and children |publisher=GlobalPost |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Chinese government reported fewer than 10,000 kidnappings. According to the [[United States Department of State]], estimates are closer to 20,000.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy1"/&gt;

Some children are reported to have been sold into adoption overseas. The adoption agencies of China receive considerable donations from foreign parents when they adopt, sometimes as much as $5,000; such agencies have been known to purchase children from human traffickers, although such cases are usually rare.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy1"/&gt;

===Kidnapping of foreign businessmen===

In [[Guangdong]], during the year 1994, the "economic crimes" topped the list of criminal cases, about 46 debt related hosted cases were acknowledged and investigated by the authorities. The chief procurator, Wang Jun had noted that at least 171 hostages involved in debt-related incidents had been freed by the authorities of Guangdong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entering the Chinese Market: The Risks and Discounted Rewards|author1=John E. Dixon|author2=David Newman|page=91|publisher=Greenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crackdown==

From the period of 1991 to 1996, Chinese police freed and estimated of 88,000 kidnapped women and children. During this period, about 143,000 kidnappers were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Decoding International Law: Semiotics and the Humanities|pages=386–387|first=Susan|last=Tiefenbrun|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Chinese police asserted that they rescued over 13,000 children and 23,000 women in last two years. Government officials had noted that they would impose harsher punishments on those who purchase kidnapped children.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/28/china-rescues-92childrenarrests301suspectedofkidnapping.html |title=China rescues 92 children in crackdown on kidnapping ring &amp;#124; Al Jazeera America |publisher=America.aljazeera.com |date=2013-09-28 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Chinese security forces had rescued 92 children, and arrested 301 suspected kidnappers.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt;

According to a report from October 2013, Beijing has tried to combat kidnappings. According to Xinhua news agency, since 2009, police have rescued over 54,000 children and eliminated 11,000 traffickers.&lt;ref name="globalpost1"/&gt;

==Law==

Kidnapping is illegal in China. By 1991, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress addressed for acting against the kidnapping for sale of women and children, kidnapping for blackmailing, purchase of abducted women and children, as well as the abuse of office to inhibit the rescue of kidnapped women and children.&lt;ref name="Vitit"&gt;Vitit Muntarbhorn, The Nation. Bangkok; Section: Editorial Date: 1/7/98&lt;/ref&gt;

Such concerns led to the familiarization of a criminal law. Per Article 141, penalties for the abduction, purchase, sale, and trafficking of women and children have taken place. Later in 1997, the penalties were increased.&lt;ref name="Vitit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/action_plans/4 |title=China - Government Plans - Government of China's Plan of Action To Prevent, Protect, Prosecute and Reintegrate |work=humantrafficking.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812191322/http://humantrafficking.org/action_plans/4 |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korup''' is an ethnic group of forest people located in [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Province]] of [[Cameroon]] and in the adjacent [[Cross River State]] of [[Nigeria]]. There are currently four Korup villages in the Cameroonian side: Erat (a.k.a. Ekon II), Ekon I, Ikondokondo (also spelled Ekundukundu) and Akpassang (a.k.a. Ikondokondo II). The largest village of all is Erat, with an approximate population of ~450,&lt;ref&gt;Röschenthaler, U. (2000). Culture, history and perceptions on resettlement: a baseline study of the six villages in the Korup National Park. Korup Project Study, Mundemba, pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is located inside the [[Korup National Park]] - which has received its name from the Korup people inhabiting its forests. Ikondokondo used to be located inside the park, but in 2000 it was relocated in the park's support zone, north of the town of [[Mundemba]]. This is why Ikondokondo is nowadays also known as "the Resettlement". Akpassang and Ekon I are very close to, but outside, the park boundaries.

Nigerian Korup villages, such as Ekonanaku, are large but not solely inhabited by Korup people. Many of the younger people do not speak the Korup dialect, although they do identify themselves as of the Korup tribe.

The relationship of Korup villages with the other ethnic groups in the region (i.e. Oroko, Ejagham) is nowadays amiable, and there are often intercultural marriages, especially with the much larger Oroko ethnic group. In the past however, there were frequent clashes between villages of different ethnic groups over ownership of forests.

==Language==
The Korup language is a distinct local dialect that is not related to the neighbouring tribes. Cameroonian [[Pidgin]] is used as a local "[[lingua franca]]" between people of different ethnic groups in the region, as is the case for most of [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] Cameroon. (Note: Cameroonian Pidgin, though very similar to [[Nigerian Pidgin]], it is not exactly the same, although speakers of each are largely mutually understood).

The '''Republic of [[Paraguay]]''' is a mostly bilingual country, where both [[Spanish language|Spanish]], an Indo-European language, and [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], an indigenous language of the [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] family, have official status.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pa00000_.html#A140_|title=Paraguay - Constitution, Article 140 About Languages|publisher=International Constitutional Law Project|accessdate=2007-12-03|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} (see [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pa__indx.html translator's note)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish and Guaraní==
[[File:Sign in Guaraní and Spanish in Asunción.jpg|thumb|A government sign in [[Asunción]], bilingual in Guaraní and Spanish]]
Spanish is spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaraní is spoken by more than 90%, with about 4,650,000 speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaraní.&lt;ref name="ethnologue-list"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/gug Paraguayan Guaraní], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; 

Guaraní is the only [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language of the Americas]] whose speakers include a large proportion of non-indigenous people. This is an anomaly in the [[Americas]] where [[language shift]] towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other [[official language]] of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has otherwise been a nearly universal cultural and identity marker of [[mestizo]]s (people of mixed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Amerindian]] ancestry), and also of [[cultural assimilation|culturally assimilated]], upwardly-mobile [[Amerindian]] people.

==Other languages==
About 50,000 Paraguayans speak an indigenous language besides Guaraní:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=PY Languages of Paraguay], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Spanish, Guaraní and all other previous languages, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Plautdietsch]], [[Standard German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] are spoken as well.&lt;ref name="ethnologue-list" /&gt;

'''Latvians''' ({{lang-lv|latvieši}}; {{lang-liv|lețlizt}}) are a [[Balts|Baltic]] [[ethnic group]] and [[nation]] native to [[Latvia]] and the immediate geographical region, the [[Baltics]]. They are occasionally also referred to as '''Letts''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Lett|title=Lett - definition of Lett in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lett|title=Definition of LETT|website=Merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this term is obsolescent. Latvians share a common [[Latvian language]], [[Latvian culture|culture]] and [[History of Latvia|history]].

==History==
A [[Finnic languages|Finnic]]-speaking tribe known as the [[Livonian people|Livs]] settled among the Latvians and modulated the name to "Latvis", meaning "forest-clearers", which is how medieval [[Germany|German]], [[Teutons|Teutonic]] settlers also referred to these peoples. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers referred to the natives as "Letts" and the nation to "Lettland", naming their colony Livonia or Livland.

The Latin form, ''[[Livonia]]'', gradually referred to the whole territory of the modern-day Latvia as well as southern [[Estonia]], which had fallen under a minimal Germanic influence. Latvians and [[Lithuanians]] are the only surviving members of the [[Balts|Baltic]] branch of the [[Indo-European family]].

==Genetics==
Paternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|N1c-Tat]] and [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R1a]] are the two most frequent, reaching 39.9% each among ethnic Latvians.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kasperavicuite.2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225205400/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kasperavicuite.2004.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} Kasperaviciute et al. 2004 (link broken)&lt;/ref&gt; N1c-Tat mutation probably originated in South Siberia eight to nine thousand years ago and had spread through the Urals into the Europe where it is currently most common among Finno-Ugric and Baltic people. Balts, however, differ from Finno-Ugrics by the predominance of the N1c-L550 branch of N1c-Tat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dna2012.gerichtsmedizin.at/files/DNA_in_Forensics_2012.pdf|format=PDF|author1=Pamjav H|author2=Nemeth E|author3=Feher T|author4=Volgyi A|title=Genetic journey of the N1c haplogroup|website=Dna2012.gerichtsmedizin.at|accessdate=2017-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030045421/http://dna2012.gerichtsmedizin.at/files/DNA_in_Forensics_2012.pdf|archivedate=2012-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup R1a is associated with [[Proto Indo Europeans|the spread of Indo-European languages]].

A 2009 [[autosomal]] study has shown that among other European populations, Latvians are genetically related to Lithuanians, followed distantly by Estonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005472#pone-0005472-t002|author=Nelis et al|title="Genetic Structure of Europeans: A View from the North–East"|website=Plosone.org|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Influences===
[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|200px|In 1649, settlement of the Latvian speaking [[Kursenieki]] spanned from [[Klaipėda|Memel (Klaipėda)]] to [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]].]]
Latvians share a common language and have a unique culture with traditions, holidays, customs and arts. The culture and religious traditions have been somewhat influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Scandinavia]]n, and [[Russia]]n traditions. Latvians have an ancient culture that has been archaeologically dated back to 3000 BC. Latvians maintained a considerable connection and trade with their neighbors, and near ethnic cousins the [[Finno-Ugrians]], otherwise known contemporarily as [[Estonians]] and eventually [[Finns]] as well. The first indications of human inhabitants on the lands of modern Latvia date archaeologically to {{circa}} 9000 BC, suggesting that the first settlers were hunters that stayed almost immediately following the end of the last [[Ice Age]]. Colonizers from the south arrived quickly, driving many of the hunters northward as polar ice caps melted further, or east, into modern-day [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] author [[Tacitus]] remarked upon the "Aestii" peoples, thought to be inhabitants of the modern Baltic lands, suggesting that they were abound with formidable, yet peaceful and hospitable people. The Latvian peoples remained relatively undisturbed until [[Papal]] intervention via the [[Germanic Peoples|Germanic]], [[Teutonic Order]] colonized [[Kurzeme region|Kurzeme]] (Courland in English, Kurland in German), beginning in the first half of the 13th century. Papal decrees ordered the Teutonic Order to spread the "Word of the Lord" and the [[Gospel]] of [[Christianity]] throughout "uncivilized", "Pagan lands". Though these attempts to [[Christianize]] the population failed, and the Teutonic Order eventually redeployed southward, to the region of what was once known as [[East Prussia]].

South-Eastern Latvia ([[Latgale]]), due to having a relatively large ethnic Russian population, has maintained a large Russian influence.

===Religion===
[[File:Aglona Basilica.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Basilica of the Assumption, Aglona|Basilica of the Assumption]] in [[Aglona]], the most important [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Latvia]].]]
Most of the religious Latvians belong to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], but in Eastern Latvia ([[Latgale]]) the [[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Roman Catholic Church]] is predominant, a small minority of Latvians belong to the [[Latvian Orthodox Church]] and other religious congregations.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; In the late 18th century, a small but vibrant [[Moravian Church|Herrnhutist]] movement played a significant part in the development of Latvian literary culture before it was absorbed into the mainstream Lutheran denomination.

===Language===
The [[national language]] of the Latvian people is [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Latvian is part of a unique linguistic branch of Indo-European languages: the [[Baltic languages]]. A significant minority of Latvians can speak [[Russian language|Russian]].

[[File:bushduck.PNG|thumb|right|American President [[George W. Bush]] ducking a thrown shoe, while Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nouri al-Maliki]] attempts to catch it.&lt;ref name=BBC081214/&gt;]]
Shoe-throwing, or '''shoeing''', showing the sole of one's shoe or using shoes to [[insult]] are forms of protest in many parts of the world. Shoe-throwing as an insult dates back to ancient times, even mentioned at [[Psalm 108]]:9 in the [[Old Testament]]. Modern incidents where shoes were thrown at political figures have taken place in [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and most notably the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/3776970/Arab-culture-the-insult-of-the-shoe.html Arab culture: the insult of the shoe], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 15 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7783325.stm Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult], BBC, 16 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posters of [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] face have long appeared through the Middle East with shoes attached to them, and some people have called former [[Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] ''kundara'', meaning "shoe".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Shoeing received attention after [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi]] threw his shoes at then U.S. President George W. Bush in a 14 December 2008 press conference in [[Baghdad, Iraq]]. Since the al-Zaidi incident, [[Copycat crimes|copycat]] incidents in Europe, North America, India, China, Hong Kong, [[Iran]], [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091001/ap_on_re_eu/world_economy_protest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005102939/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091001/ap_on_re_eu/world_economy_protest|date=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia have been reported.

==Context==
{{further|Taharah|Islamic hygienical jurisprudence}}
Shoes are considered unclean in the [[Arab World]]. Matthew Cassel of ''[[The Electronic Intifada]]'' in the context of the "Bush shoeing" incident has expressed the opinion that the Western media overplayed the phenomenon as being "Arab" in particular.&lt;ref name=AAN&gt;[http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&amp;cat=World&amp;article=1801 The shoe heard round the world], Matthew Cassel, Arab-American News.com, 20 December 2008. Retrieved 21 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable incidents==
===359===
*[[Constantius II]], Roman Emperor, was giving a speech from a small hill to a group of [[Limigantes]] to ask for their loyalty, when he was hit by a shoe thrown by one of them. The thrower shouted 'Marha, marha!' in a "signal of war." &lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus Res Gestae XIX-XI-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History (p. 160) Peter Heather&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
* '''7 April:''' [[Arbab Ghulam Rahim]], the former Chief Minister of [[Sindh, Pakistan]], was leaving the back door of the Sindh assembly building after taking oath as a newly elected member when he was hit by a shoe thrown by [[Agha Javed Pathan]], a worker from the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]].&lt;ref name="paktribune"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Arbab Ghulam Rahim manhandled|url=http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?199225|work=Pakistan|publisher=Paktribune|date=8 April 2008|accessdate=4 March 2011|location=Karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bush Shoe Throw.jpg|thumb|A replica of the shoe thrown at President Bush during a press conference in Iraq in 2008. Photograph taken at the Museum in TriBeCa, New York City.]]
*'''14 December:''' During a press conference at the Prime Minister's Palace in [[Baghdad]], Iraq, journalist [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi]] threw his shoes at then United States President [[George W. Bush]].

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Madí''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Madí or Arte Madí) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Madí: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Madí movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Perón|Perón]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Madí artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Perón. According to [[Pérez-Barreiro]], Madí and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Perón made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Perón addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don’t want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.” The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Madí artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas Pèt, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''Ñusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Invención'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Madí work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Madí artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Madí artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Madí artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Madí Manifesto ==
The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madí Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Madí created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Madí dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M               &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Madícional'' [‘Madí-like’ or ‘of Madí origin’] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cuño.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected Artists and Artworks ==
Representatives of the Madí movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, include [[Martín Blaszko]], [[Waldo Longo]], [[Juan Bay]], [[Esteban Eitler]], [[Diyi Laañ]], and [[Valdo Wellington]], among others.

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 años después: exposición del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5913">The '''marginal budgeting for bottlenecks''' tool (MBB) is an analytical costing and budgeting tool that helps countries develop their health plans by taking into account the most effective interventions, cost and budget marginal allocations of their implementation to health services and assess their potential impact on health coverage, Health related [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and health outcomes of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;The oldest – although unpublished – concept note available on the topic: MARGINAL BUDGETING FOR BOTTLENECKS: A NEW COSTING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION PRACTICE TO BUY HEALTH RESULTS&lt;br&gt;Using health sector’s budget expansion to progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Sub-Saharan Africa; A Soucat, W Van Lerberghe, F Diop, S N Nguyen and R Knippenberg&lt;br&gt;Draft version: November 2002, please do not quote http://www.gavialliance.org/resources/14_MBB_Concept_paper.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626014402/http://www.gavialliance.org/resources/14_MBB_Concept_paper.pdf# |date=2010-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It builds on the High Impact Interventions to reduce mortality as published in various scientific articles including ''[[The Lancet]]'' series on [[Child survival|Child]], Maternal and neonatal survival. The tool has been developed in the context of [[Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative]] and [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper]]s

==Concept==
The MBB mainly addresses the following six questions:
* Who does what? Which high impact interventions can be integrated into existing providers/service delivery arrangements to accelerate progress towards the health MDGs?
* Equity
* What are the major hurdles or "bottlenecks" hampering the delivery of health services, and what is the potential for their improvement?
* How much money is needed for the expected results?
* How much can be achieved in health outcomes such as mortality reduction by removing the bottlenecks?
* Which amounts of financing is it possible to mobilize and how should these be allocated and channelled ?
It builds on theoretical knowledge:
* The Tanahashi model of evaluating the health service delivery performance by looking at 5 determinants of the health system &lt;ref&gt;Tanahashi 1978 bulletin of WHO_1978_56(2)_295-303 http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1978/Vol56-No2/bulletin_1978_56%282%29_295-303.pdf{{full|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The implementation of effective interventions also called High Impact Interventions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13811-1 |title=How many child deaths can we prevent this year? |journal=The Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9377 |pages=65 |year=2003 |last1=Jones |first1=Gareth |last2=Steketee |first2=Richard W |last3=Black |first3=Robert E |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Morris |first5=Saul S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fiscal space|Fiscal Space]] where governments can collect the money to implement the marginal cost required

==Development==
It has initially been developed by teams from the [[World Bank]]'s Africa Region, South Asia region and Health Nutrition and Population Anchor, jointly with [[UNICEF]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. It is a development of health systems performance monitoring tools that were used in the West African Region in the nineties. At a certain point,{{When|date=April 2014}} WHO left the boat to develop their own approach. Since 2008, the MBB has the possibility to use the LiST tool to calculate impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Lives Save Tools developed by Johns Hopkins University see http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/ih/IIP/list/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Currently,{{When|date=April 2014}} there are discussions going on to produce an integrated model that would reunify different models proposed by different agencies (UNICEF, WHO, UNAIDS? UNFPA into one comprehensive planning and budgeting tool. Since 2008, the tool is available in three languages.

Until now,{{When|date=April 2014}} the tool runs on ''Excel ₢'' which makes it vulnerable to users' ability to correctly input data. (MBB 5, the current version, runs on Excel 2007 ₢ or later&lt;ref&gt;as of July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;). [[DevInfo]] has been tasked to provide support to users; they have developed an online support platform where the latest version can be downloaded along with on-the-job support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Since its inception in 2002, the tool has been used at country and sub-country level in more than 17 countries across Africa and Asia. It has been used to prepare mid-term expenditures frameworks, investment cases, child survival strategic plans, national health plans,....

==Key steps==
The MBB consists of five key steps:&lt;ref&gt;The State of the World Children 2008 : Child Survival, p 70 http://www.unicef.org/sowc08/&lt;/ref&gt;
* An assessment of the key indicators of your health system at  the baseline
* Identification of system-wide supply and demand bottlenecks
* Selection of interventions and the estimation of the expected impact on survival rates for each of the interventions.
* Selection of the types, quantities and costs of additional inputs,
* Analysis of budgetary implications, and  the comparison of the marginal costs to the ’fiscal space’

'''''Mariposa''''' (2009) is a [[science fiction]] novel written by [[Greg Bear]] as both a sequel to [[Quantico (novel)|''Quantico'']] and a prequel to [[Queen of Angels (novel)|''Queen of Angels'']], featuring characters from both earlier works.  Set in 2021 America, whose government is more than fifty trillion dollars in debt, the novel follows an FBI investigation of the Talos Corporation (a thinly disguised Blackwater) which plans to disable the power grid across the entire Eastern seaboard in a simultaneous, coordinated attack of domestic terrorism, which will trigger the provisions of a law Congress passed authorizing Federal lands and resources as collateral to continue borrowing funds from overseas.  Unexpected help comes from a secret weapon in the Federal arsenal, non-nuclear EMP, as well as a mute Mind Design proto-AI named Jones, early precursor to Jill, who has a back door into Talos.

''Mariposa'' is the missing link that ties ''[[Quantico (novel)|Quantico]]'' (2005) together with ''[[Queen of Angels (novel)|Queen of Angels]]'' (1990) ''"/"'' (also known as ''Slant''; 1997), ''Heads'' (1990) and ''[[Moving Mars]]'' into a single unified future history.  Green Idaho has seceded from the Union. Mary Choi, the protagonist of ''Queen of Angels'' and ''/'' appears as an orphan of age two.  President Raphkind comes to power, beginning an administration that is still reviled by the time of ''Queen of Angels'' in 2047.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5202">The '''Open Game License''' ('''OGL''') is a [[public copyright license]] that may be used by [[tabletop role-playing game]] developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably [[game mechanics]]. However, they must [[share-alike]] copies and [[derivative work]]s.

==Language of the license==
The OGL describes two forms of content:

'''Open Game Content'''  (or ''OGC'')
:{{quotation|...the game mechanic and includes the methods, procedures, processes and routines to the extent such content does not embody the Product Identity and is an enhancement over the prior art and any additional content clearly identified as Open Game Content by the Contributor, and means any work covered by this License, including translations and derivative works under copyright law, but specifically excludes Product Identity....}}

'''Product Identity'''  (or ''PI'')
:{{quotation|...product and product line names, logos and identifying marks including trade dress; artifacts; creatures characters; stories, storylines, plots, thematic elements, dialogue, incidents, language, artwork, symbols, designs, depictions, likenesses, formats, poses, concepts, themes and graphic, photographic and other visual or audio representations; names and descriptions of characters, spells, enchantments, personalities, teams, personas, likenesses and special abilities; places, locations, environments, creatures, equipment, magical or supernatural abilities or effects, logos, symbols, or graphic designs; and any other trademark or registered trademark...}}
Use of another company's Product Identity is considered breach of the licensing agreement.

== Background ==

The OGL was originally published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 2000 to license portions of the third edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' as a [[System Reference Document]] (SRD) to allow third-party publishers to produce compatible material, a move spearheaded by [[Ryan Dancey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dancey | first = Ryan| authorlink = Ryan Dancey | title = The Most Dangerous Column in Gaming| work = Interview with Ryan Dancey| publisher = Wizards of the Coast| date = 2002-02-28| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/md/md20020228e| format = Interview |accessdate = 2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|last=Cook |first=Monte |authorlink=Monte Cook |title=The Open Game License as I See It |url=http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?mc_los_154 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501052435/http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?mc_los_154 |archivedate=2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers could use the separate [[d20 System Trademark License]] to include a logo indicating compatibility.

In June 2008, Wizards of the Coast transitioned to a new, more restrictive royalty-free license called the [[Game System License]] (GSL), which is available for third-party developers to publish products compatible with ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition.&lt;ref name=escapist&gt;{{cite web|last=Tito|first=Greg|title=The State of D&amp;D: Present|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9293-The-State-of-D-D-Present.2|work=The Escapist|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=D&amp;D 4th Edition Game System License | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4news/20080417a | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GSL is incompatible with the previous OGL. The OGL is irrevocable, however, and remains in widespread use.&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt;

On January 12, 2016, Wizards of the Coast released the 5th edition SRD under the original OGL marking a return to the Open Gaming format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd | title=System Reference Document (SRD) | accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those individuals, groups and publishing companies that license their works under the OGL and similar documents are sometimes collectively referred to as the "[[open gaming]] movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web  | last =Wizards of the Coast  | first =  | authorlink =Wizards of the Coast  | title =The Open Gaming Foundation: Frequently Asked Questions  |date=2004-01-26| url =http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/oglfaq/20040123e  | accessdate = 2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poles of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Poljaci u Hrvatskoj}}; {{lang-pl|Polacy w Chorwacji}}) are one of 22 national minorities in [[Croatia]]. According to the 2011 Census, there were 672 [[Poles]] living in Croatia, of which most lived in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name=DZS/&gt;

Croatian Poles have established two cultural societies, the Polish Cultural Association "[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Mikolaj Kopernik]]" that also includes the vocal and dance ensembles in [[Zagreb]] and the Polish Cultual Association "[[Frédéric Chopin|Fryderyk Chopin]]" in [[Rijeka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6301">The '''Proto-Philippine language''' is the reconstructed ancestral [[proto-language]] of the [[Philippine languages]], a proposed subgroup of the [[Austronesian languages]] which includes all languages of the Philippines (except for the [[Sama–Bajaw languages]]) as well as the languages of the northern part of [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=llamzon1975&gt;Llamzon, Teodoro A. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_1975_num_9_1_1214  "Proto-Philippine Phonology."] In: ''Archipel'', volume 9, 1975. pp. 29-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=charles1974&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3622751|title=Problems in the Reconstruction of Proto-Philippine Phonology and the Subgrouping of the Philippine Languages|first=Mathew|last=Charles|date=1974|publisher=|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=13|issue=1/2|pages=457–509|doi=10.2307/3622751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zorc1986&gt;Zorc, R.D.

Proto-Philippine is not directly attested to in any written work, but [[linguistic reconstruction]] by the [[comparative method]] has found regular similarities among languages that cannot be explained by coincidence or word-borrowing. Ancient forms of roots and words have been extrapolated from the similarities.

Proto-Philippine originated from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language|Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]] and ultimately from [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]].

The proto-phonemes *j and *R are not preserved as such in any Philippine language: *j became either *g or *d (e.g. *púsəj became [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] ''púsəg'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ''púsod''), whereas *R shifted to *r (e.g. in [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]]), *l (e.g. in [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]]), *g (e.g. in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) or *y (e.g. in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]).&lt;ref name=llamzon1975 /&gt;&lt;ref name=blust1991 /&gt;

The [[diphthong]]s are *ay, *aw, *uy, and *iw.

The proto-phoneme *ə was retained in many Philippine languages, especially in the northern and southern descendants of Proto-Philippine (e.g. in [[Ilocano language|Ilokano]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]], [[Gaddang language|Gaddang]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]], [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]]), and also in some peripheral lects in the central area (e.g. [[Rinconada Bikol]], [[Karay-a language|Kinaray-a Visayan]], [[Palawano language|Palawano]]). In most [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] and [[Bikol language|Bikol]] varieties, *ə merged with *u, whereas in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], *ə merged with *i (*u in certain environments).

'''Religious views on love''' vary widely between different religions. 

==Specific religious views==

===Bahá'í===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|"Love is the mystery of divine revelations! Love is the effulgent manifestation! Love is the spiritual fulfilment! Love is the light of the Kingdom! Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit inspired into the human spirit! Love is the cause of the manifestation of the Truth (God) in the phenomenal world!. Love is the necessary tie proceeding from the realities of things through divine creation!"|`Abdu'l-Bahá, ''Tablets of `Abdu'l-Bahá'' v3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1909 |title = Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Chicago, USA |pages=524–526 |id =  |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-573.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], taught that God created humans due to his love for them, and thus humans should in turn love [[God]]. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, wrote that love is the greatest power in the world of existence and the true source of eternal happiness.  The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that all genuine love is divine, and that love proceeds from God and from humans.  God's love is taught to be part of his own essence, and his love for his creatures gives them their material existence, divine grace and eternal life.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= love |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 227–228 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that human love is directed towards both God and other humans; that the love of God attracts the individual toward God, by purifying the human heart and preparing it for the revelation of divine grace.  Thus through the love of God, humans become transformed and become self-[[sacrifice|sacrificing]]. It is also stated that true love for other humans occurs when people see the beauty of God in other people's [[soul]]s. The Bahá'í teachings state that Bahá'ís should love all humans regardless of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or community, and also should love their enemies.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

===Buddhist===
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is sensuous,  love. The vast majority believe it to be an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], perceiving it as selfish.

''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom, and is necessary for enlightenment.

''[[Advesa]]'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from common conceptions of love which are often confused with attachment and sexual desire, and can be self-interested. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The Bodhisattva ideal in Tibetan Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish love for others.

===Christian===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Theological virtues]] --&gt;
Most Christians also believe that [[God]] is the source and essence of eternal [[Love of God (Christianity)|love]], even if in the [[New Testament]] the expression "God is love" explicitly occurs only twice and in two not too distant verses: [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] {{bibleref2-nb|1 John|4:8,16|NIV}} (NIV).

Most Christians believe that the greatest commandment is "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment"; in addition to the second, "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", these are what [[Jesus Christ]] called the two greatest commandments (see Mark 12:28–34, Luke 10:25–28, Matthew 22:37–39, Matthew 7:12; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5, Deuteronomy 11:13, Deuteronomy 11:22, Leviticus 19:18, Leviticus 19:34). See also [[Ministry of Jesus#General ethics]].

In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus said: "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], if you love one another." (NIV, John 13:34–35; cf. John 15:17). Jesus also taught "[[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|Love your enemies]]." (Matthew 5:44, Luke 6:27).

|quote="Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
|source=[[1 Corinthians]] 13:4–7 (NIV)|}}

The New Testament, which was written in Greek, only used two Greek words for love: ''[[agapē]]'' and ''[[philia]]''. However, there are several [[Greek words for love]].
*''Agapē''. In the New Testament, ''[[agapē]]'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love seen as creating goodness in the world, it is the way God is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for others.
*''Philia''. Also used in the New Testament, ''[[philia]]'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful.  Also known as "brotherly love".
*''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' (sexual love) is never used in the New Testament but is more prominent in the Old Testament.
*''[[Storge]]'' (needy child-to-parent love) only appears in the compound word ''philostorgos'' (Rom 12:10).

[[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] glorifies ''agapē'' in the quote above from [[1 Corinthians]] 13, and as the most important virtue of all: "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away." (13:8 [[NIV]]).

Christians believe that because of [[God]]'s ''agapē'' for humanity He sacrificed his Son for them. [[John the Apostle]] wrote, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17 [[KJV]])

In ''[[Works of Love]]'' (1847), [[Søren Kierkegaard]], a philosopher, claimed that Christianity is unique because love is a ''requirement''.

Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:

''“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.  He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?  Are not even the tax collectors doing that?  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?  Do not even pagans do that?  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”
- Matthew 5: 43-48''

Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: ''“Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies.  To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swartley | first=Willard M. | title=The Love of Enemy and Nonretaliation in the New Testament, Studies in peace and scripture; (As Scapulam I) cited by Hans Haas, Idee und Ideal de Feindesliebe in der ausserchristlichen Welt (Leipzig: University of Leipzig, 1927). | publisher= Westminster John Knox Press | year= 1992 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjbYqFHzg_EC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Our+individual,+extraordinary,+and+perfect+goodness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MFo5tSwfag&amp;sig=cB9PzBTiz9lzkMonKUmtXxpggpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc6KLEg9rLAhUUVWMKHRTlCFUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20individual%2C%20extraordinary%2C%20and%20perfect%20goodness&amp;f=false |page=24 | isbn=9780664253547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book of Mormon English Missionary Edition Soft Cover.jpg|150px|thumb|right|And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. ~ The ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', {{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|2|17}}   ]]

According to [[Russell M. Nelson]], there are examples of the love of [[Jesus]] in the [[Book of Mormon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/2011/10/what-the-book-of-mormon-teaches-about-the-love-of-god?lang=eng |title= What the Book of Mormon Teaches about the Love of God |first= Russell M. |last= Nelson |authorlink= Russell M. Nelson | date= October 2011 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First there is a [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with Christ. [[King Benjamin]] stated in the [[Book of Mosiah]]:

{{quote|And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.|{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}} }}

Then there are the [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] of the gospel. Jesus stated in the Book of Mormon in [[Third Nephi]]:

{{quote|Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.| {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|27|20}} }}

And at last Jesus exhorts us to follow his example:

{{quote|And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.| {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|27|27}} }}

[[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], the last prophet of the book, wrote about love:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/01/a-book-about-gods-love?lang=eng |title= A Book about God’s Love  |first= Lenet |last= Read |authorlink= Lenet Read | date= January 1988 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.|{{lds|Moroni|moro|7|47}} }}

===Islam===
{{religious text primary|section|date=June 2012}}
In the Sahih Muslim [[Hadith]], the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: “You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another.”

Muslims are directed by Allah ('God') in the ways to become close to Him and how to gain His love.

God loves those who:
*do good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|195|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|134|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|93|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are pure and clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|222|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|108|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are righteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|7|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|96|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are just and act rightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|42|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|49|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|60|8|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*trust Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|159|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are patient and persevering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|146|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*love Him and follow the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*fight in His cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|61|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an also says that God loved Moses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|20|39|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and God Himself will produce people He will love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|54|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here in this selection of verses we notice again the Arabic preference for the negative to state an opposite. While the following do not state that God hates, it certainly enforces the idea that the love of God is withheld from those who practice certain deeds or are described as manifesting a certain character. Several of the verses are repetitious and so we have the following categories.

God does not love:
*the mua'tadeen, those who overstep boundaries or limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|190|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|87|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|55|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the fasideen, those who spread corruption or mischief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|205|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|64|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|77|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the kafireen, the unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|32|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the dalemeen, the wrongdoers or oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|57|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|140|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|42|40|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the musarifeen, the wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|6|141|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the proud and boastful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|31|18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|57|23|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|23|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*those who boast in their riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the treacherous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|8|58|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*those who are given to crime and to evil speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|107|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmadiyya'''

According to the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims, love of the creatures of God is essential for all Muslims. Ahmadi Muslims express that the Qur'an was sent as a gift to mankind, and its teachings are filled with love, tolerance and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/reply/Love-for-All-Pamphlet.pdf | title=Love for All Pamphlet| publisher=alislam.org | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of the Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The task for which God has appointed me is that I should remove the malaise that afflicts the relationship between God and His creatures and restore the relationship of love and sincerity between them. Through the proclamation of truth and by putting an end to religious conflicts, I should bring about peace and manifest the Divine verities that have become hidden from the eyes of the world. I am called upon to demonstrate spirituality which lies buried under egoistic darkness. It is for me to demonstrate by practice, and not by words alone, the Divine powers which penetrate into a human being and are manifested through prayer or attention. Above all, it ismy task to re-establish in people’s hearts the eternal plant of the pure and shining Unity of God which is free from every impurity of polytheism, and which has now completely disappeared. All this will be accomplished, not through my power, but through the power of the Almighty God, Who is the God of heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/10547/the-purpose-of-the-advent-of-the-promised-messiah-2/| title=The Purpose of the Advent of the Promised Messiah | publisher=[[Review of Religions]] | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hindu===
In Hinduism ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, personified by the god [[Kama (Hinduism)|Kama]]. For many Hindu schools it is the third end in life.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prema (love)|prema]]'' or ''prem'' refers to elevated love. Love in Hinduism is sacrament. It preaches that one gives up selfishness in love, not expecting anything in return.

It also believes "God is love". A sacred text named Kanda Guru Kavasa quotes, " Oh holy Great flame, Grant me with love..
You said the spreading love is Para Brahma,
For the thing which is everywhere is only Love,
And Love is the only thing which is like a soul within us,
Love is Kumara, Love is Kanda" Simply means Love is God.


The love of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Avatar|deity]] [[Krishna]] with [[Radha]] and many other [[gopi]]s (milkmaids) of [[Vrindavana]] is highly revered. His amorous dance with the [[gopi]]s became known as the ''[[Rasa lila]]''&lt;ref name="golove"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gopīs' Love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa| last=Hanumanprasad| first=Poddar| year=1941| publisher=Gita Press| location=Gorakhpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were romanticised in the poetry of [[Jayadeva]], the author of [[Gita Govinda]]. These became important as part of the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping [[Radha]] [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote="And you shall love the &lt;small&gt;[[Tetragrammaton|LORD]]&lt;/small&gt; your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might."
|source=[[Deuteronomy]] 6:5|}}

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahava'' is the most Commonly used term for both interpersonal love of family and love of God. Other related but dissimilar terms are ''chen'' (grace, good will, kindness) and ''[[chesed]]'' (kindness, love), which basically combines the meaning of "affection" and "compassion" and is sometimes rendered in English as "loving-kindness" or "steadfast love."

As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: "See life with the wife you love" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The Biblical book [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] is considered a romantically-phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading reads like a love song.

===Polytheism===
Different cultures have deified love, typically in both male and female form. Even though in monotheistic religions, the God is considered to represent love, there are often [[angel]]s or similar beings that represent love as well.
* [[Áine]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of fertility and passionate love in [[Irish mythology]]
* [[Eros]] or [[Cupid]]&amp;nbsp;– god of passionate love in [[Roman mythology]]
* [[Antheia]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess in [[Crete mythology]] of love, flowers, gardens, and marshes
* [[Aonghus]] or ''Aengus''— god of beauty, youth, and sensual love in Irish mythology
* [[Aphrodite]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of beauty and passionate love in [[Greek mythology]]
* [[Astarte]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love in Canaanite mythology
* [[Eros (god)|Eros]]&amp;nbsp;– god of passionate love in Greek mythology
* [[Freyja]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love, fertility and war in [[Norse mythology]]
* [[Hathor]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]
* [[Inanna]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of sexual love in [[Sumerian mythology]]
* [[Ishtar]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love and war in [[Babylonian mythology]]
* [[Kama (Hinduism)|Kama]]&amp;nbsp;– god of sensual love in [[Hindu mythology]]
* [[Mithra|Mihr]]&amp;nbsp;– spirit of love in [[Persian mythology]]
* [[Rati]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of passionate love in Hindu mythology
* [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of beauty and passionate love in Roman mythology
* [[Xochipilli]]&amp;nbsp;– god in [[Aztec mythology]].

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]] Love  means love for the Lord and His creation. This is one of five virtues that is vigorously promoted by the Sikh Gurus. The other four qualities in the arsenal are: ''[[Truth]]'' (Sat), ''[[Contentment]]'' (Santokh), ''[[Compassion]]'' (Daya) and ''[[Humility]]'' (Nimrata). These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the [[Gurbani]] so that these virtues become a part of their mind set.

This is a very positive and powerful tool in the Sikhs arsenal of virtues. When one's mind is full of love, the person will overlook deficiency in others and accept them wholeheartedly as a product of God. Sikhism asks all believers to take on "god-like" virtues and this perhaps is the most "god-like" characteristic of all. Gurbani tells us that Waheguru is a "loving God", full of compassion and kindness. It is the duty of the Sikh to take on qualities of this nature and to easily forgive; to never hate anyone; to live in His Hukam - "Will" and to practise compassion and humility.

"jin prem keyo tin hee prab paeyo" &amp;nbsp;- "Only those who have love, will attain God" - Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

===Unificationism===

The concept of True Love is the most central part of Unificationist theology.

From "MAPPING KNOWLEDGE: THE UNIFICATION ENCYCLOPEDIA PROJECT" http://www.unification.net/misc/ency.html

"The central value in human life, which we may term "true love," means that which seeks the best for others and the betterment of human life in all its dimensions. True love means living for others, giving without thought of a return. Its source is transcendental, beyond the self; the person who practices true love taps into an inexhaustible reservoir of life. The various philosophies and religions of the world speak of this value with a variety of emphases, aspects, and concepts, such as: compassion, grace, justice, charity, liberation, righteousness, and agape love. While recognizing that certain of these aspects may sometimes be in tension (e.g., the well-known Jewish discussion of the dichotomy between divine justice and divine mercy), we may regard the positive tendency of all of them as aspects of a single divine and universal value. This value, true love, is the aspiration and hope of all human beings and the manifestation of the best in human nature. "

'''Romani people in Algeria''' are reported to include at least two groups: the Afrikaya, and the [[Xoraxane]].  The Afrikaya are possibly of [[Manouche]] origins, and speak [[French language|French]]. The Xoraxane are Muslim and their original language is [[Romani language|Romani]].  Roma in general ultimately come from [[South Asia]], particularly from [[North India|Northern]] [[India]], having reached the Mediterranean region in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=54gyRnhIugkC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=algeria+nawar+gypsies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G4w0VK3ZGNioyATqq4KwAg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=algeria%20nawar%20gypsies&amp;f=false Peoples on the Move: Introducing the Nomads of the World.

'''Romani people in Egypt''' speak the [[Domari language]]. They immigrated to the territory of the present day Egypt from [[South Asia]], particularly from [[India]], in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times. [[Romani people|Romani]] ([[Dom people|Dom]] or [[Nawar people|Nawar]]) people self-segregated themselves for centuries from the dominant culture of Egypt, who view Romani as dishonorable though clever. Historically, Gypsies in Egypt have provided musical entertainment at weddings and other celebrations. The Romani people or Gypsies in Egypt include subgroups like Nawar, Halebi and Ghagar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=54gyRnhIugkC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=egypt+nawar+gypsies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI5OfS5MS7xwIVSH6SCh269AMm#v=onepage&amp;q=egypt%20nawar%20gypsies&amp;f=false Peoples on the Move: Introducing the Nomads of the World.

'''Rutul''' is a language spoken by the [[Rutul people|Rutuls]], an ethnic group living in [[Dagestan]] ([[Russia]]) and some parts of [[Azerbaijan]]. It is spoken by 30,000 people in Dagestan (2010 census)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab6.xls Информационные материалы об окончательных итогах Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года]&lt;/ref&gt; and 17,000 (no date) in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=e17&gt;{{e17|rut}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Rutul'' derives from the name of a Dagestani village where speakers of this language make up the majority.&lt;ref name="rutetheo"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://etheo.h10.ru/rutu01.htm ETHEO: Rutul Language]&lt;/ref&gt;{{broken citation|date=January 2010}}

Rutul is [[endangered language|endangered]] in Russia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/chris.html Published in: Encyclopedia of the world’s endangered languages. Edited by Christopher Moseley. London &amp; New York: Routledge, 2007. 211–280.]&lt;/ref&gt; and classified as "definitely endangered" by [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNESCO Endangered Language Criteria: 1. Vulnerable, 2. Definitely Endangered, 3. Severely Endangered, 4. Critically Endangered, 5. Extinct--&gt;

==Classification==
Rutul belongs to the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic group]] of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] language family. The [[Rutul people|Rutuls]] call their language '''myxʼabišdy čʼel'''.

==History==
Rutul was not a written language until the writing system for it (based on [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]) was developed in 1990. A Latin alphabet was developed in 2013 based on the Shin-Shorsu dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/71/16/90/71169050965608079497039264944293532638/SILForum2015_002.pdf |title= Important Factors in the Development of an Orthography: Shin-Shorsu Rutul—a Case Study |last=Clarkson |first=Jonathan |last2=Iurkova |first2=Elena |series=SIL Forum for Language Fieldwork 2015-002 |publisher=SIL International |date= December 2015 |archive-url= http://www.sil.org/resources/archives/63843 |archivedate=2015 |access-date= 2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers are often bilingual or multilingual, having a good command of the [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and/or [[Russian language|Russian]] languages. There are 8 dialects and 2 subdialects of Rutul. The literary version of the language remains in the process of development. In the Rutul-populated regions of southern Russia, Rutul is taught in primary schools (grades 1 to 4).&lt;ref name="rutetheo"/&gt;{{broken citation|date=January 2010}}

==Related languages==
Among the languages of the Lezgic group, [[Tsakhur language|Tsakhur]] appears to be the closest relative of Rutul.&lt;ref name="tsketheo"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://etheo.h10.ru/tsax01.htm The Tsakhur language]. The ''ETHEO'' Project. Last updated 11 October 2005.

'''Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas''' (commonly known by its acronym, '''SEIFA''') is a product that enables the assessment of the welfare of [[Australia]]n communities. The indexes have been created by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], the national [[statistics|statistical]] [[government agency|agency]]. The source of the data is derived from the five-yearly [[Census in Australia|Census of Population and Housing]], and is calculated using [[Principal Component Analysis|principal component analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/2039.0/ |title=2039.0 - Information Paper: An Introduction to Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), 2006  |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |work=2006 Census |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domains and variables ==
First produced in 1971, SEIFA is primarily used to rank areas according to socio-economic advantage and disadvantage based on census data. The census variables used cover a number of domains and include [[household income]], education, employment, occupation, [[Home ownership in Australia|housing]] and other indicators of advantage and disadvantage. Combined,  the indexes provide more general measures of socio-economic status than is given by measuring one of the domains in isolation. SEIFA consists of four indexes, each being a summary of a different set of census variables:&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/72283F45CB86E5FECA2574170011B271/$File/2039055001_socio-economic%20indexes%20for%20areas%20(seifa)%20-%20technical%20paper_2006.pdf |format=PDF |author=Pink, Brian (Australian Statistician) |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |title=Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) - Technical Paper |work=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!colspan=3|SEIFA indexes
|-
|1. || Index of Advantage / Disadvantage || A composite index where lower scores indicate more disadvantaged areas and higher scores indicate more advantaged areas.&lt;br /&gt;This index is constructed using a number of different variables that indicate both advantage (i.e. high income, having a degree qualification) and disadvantage (i.e. unemployment status, low income, not enough bedrooms)
|-
|2. || Index of Disadvantage || Identifies areas with lower educational attainment, people in low-skilled occupations, low employment and other indicators of disadvantage.&lt;br /&gt;This index ranks areas from most disadvantaged to least disadvantaged
|-
|3. || Index of Economic Resources || Includes variables such as rent paid, income by family type, mortgage payments and rental properties
|-
|4. || Index of Education and Occupation || Includes education and occupation variables
|}

== Calculation method ==
Principal Component Analysis is used to create SEIFA. This method creates a summary measure of a group of variables, in this case related to socio-economic advantage and disadvantage.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;

In a paper presented by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland]] Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy at the Australian Population Association 2004 conference, it was claimed that SEIFA was not an accurate measure of social and economic disadvantage for [[indigenous Australians]], especially where SEIFA is used at a small area level, and the populations or households in each area are relatively homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://www.apa.org.au/upload/2004-4E_Kennedy.pdf |title=Indigenous SEIFA – revealing the ecological fallacy |publisher=Australian Population Association |date=September 2004 |location=Canberra, Australia |accessdate=12 November 2012 |author1=Kennedy, Bryan |author2=Firman, David |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
SEIFA is published every five years. Formerly available only to subscribers, SEIFA was made available for free on the Australian Bureau of Statistics website after changes in legislation relating to all Australian Bureau of Statistics electronic products in 2005-06. SEIFA is used by federal, state and local government agencies as well as community and business groups. The most recent issue is based on the 2011 Australian census which was released in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2011.0.55.001Main%20Features282011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=2011.0.55.001&amp;issue=2011&amp;num=&amp;view= |title=2011.0.55.001 - Information Paper: Census of Population and Housing -- Products and Services, 2011  |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |work=2011 Australian Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996,  [[Captain (naval)|Capt.]] Ashraf was promoted to [[One-star rank|one-star]] rank promotion, and was subsequently appointed as the [[Director-General|Director-General]] of the [[Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)|Naval Intelligence]] (DGNI).{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref name="Grosvenor House Publishing, Sehri, 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sehri|first1=Inam|title=Judges and Generals in Pakistan|date=2013|publisher=Grosvenor House Publishing|isbn=9781781482346|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgRnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT407&amp;dq=Shahid+Ashraf+navy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7ut2r_JfaAhVbHGMKHZGVCPIQuwUILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Shahid%20Ashraf%20navy&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this time, [[Commodore (rank)|Cdre.]] Ashraf was briefed by the [[Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)|Naval Intelligence]] led by Rear-Admiral Javed Iqbal on Navy [[Karachi affair|receiving the massive illegal financial credits]] from [[French Navy]] under the auspicious of the [[Mansurul Haq|Adm.

'''Sonjo''', or '''Temi''', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language spoken in northern [[Tanzania]], 30–40 miles west of [[Lake Natron]]. Ethnolinguistically, it is a displaced member of [[Malcolm Guthrie|Guthrie]]’s E50 group, most other members of which are found in Central Kenya. Within that group, it is most closely related to [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]]. The [[Sonjo people]] number about 30,000 (2002 SIL); many of them are bilingual in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the local language of education. Sonjo is largely undescribed. 

The [[Sonjo people|Sonjo]] have lived for centuries as an isolated enclave in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] territory.  They are known for their use of irrigation systems in agriculture, a rare trait which causes some historians to link them to the hitherto unexplained ruined irrigation systems of [[Engaruka]], 60 miles to the southeast. The term ''Sonjo'' is the name given to the people by the Maasai; they call themselves ''batɛmi'' (sg. ''motɛmi'') and their language ''ketɛmi''. Apart from inevitable Maasai ([[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]]) influence, Sonjo shows influence from [[Chaga language|Chaga]] (Bantu E40), various [[Southern Cushitic languages]], and from [[Datooga language|Datooga]].

A '''term of office''' is the length of time a person serves in a particular [[elected office]]. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to [[re-election]]. Some jurisdictions exercise [[term limits]], setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.

==United Kingdom==
Being the origin of the [[Westminster system]], aspects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s system of government are replicated in many other countries.
===Monarch===
The [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]] serves as head of state until his or her death or [[abdication]].

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] Members of Parliament (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution]] of the Parliament, a [[General elections (UK)|general election]] is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]]. An MP elected in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing [[re-election]] at the next general election.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the [[Prime Minister]]'s request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|1974]]), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.

Because the [[government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are effectively [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.&lt;ref name="Thatcher 3terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.biography.com/people/margaret-thatcher-9504796|website=Biography.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|quote="During her three terms…"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
[[Hereditary peer]]s and [[life peers]] retain membership of the [[House of Lords]] for life, though members can resign or be expelled. [[Lords Spiritual]] hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. [[George Carey]], made ''Baron Carey of Clifton'' the day after he ceased being [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]).
===Devolved administrations===
The [[devolution|devolved administrations]] in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are variations on the system of government used at [[Westminster]].

The office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] there are fixed terms for which the [[legislatures]] can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.
===Other elected offices===
Offices of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.

==United States==

===Federal===
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[president of the United States]] is elected indirectly through the [[United States Electoral College]] to a four-year term, with a [[term limit]] of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1951.

The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serves four-year terms. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] serve two-year terms. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] serve six-year terms. 

[[Federal judges]] have different terms in office. [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judges]]; such as those that sit on the [[United States bankruptcy court]]s, [[United States Tax Court]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]], and certain other [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and other forms of [[United States administrative law|adjudicative bodies]] serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeal]], and [[United States district court|federal district courts]]; serve for life.

===State and territories===
{{main|State governments of the United States}}
The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] and [[state law]].

The term for [[state governor]]s is four years in all states but [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]]; the [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] and [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire governors]] serve for two years.

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in January 2007 that among [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429232858/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legismgt/about/numoflegis.htm]:
*44 states had terms of office for the [[lower house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five ([[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama]], [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]], [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland]], [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Mississippi]], and [[North Dakota House of Representatives|North Dakota]]) had terms of office at four years. (The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is an exception and has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with members elected for four years.)
*37 states had terms of office for the [[upper house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. Twelve ([[Arizona Senate|Arizona]], [[Connecticut Senate|Connecticut]], [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia]], [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]], [[Maine Senate|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire Senate|New Hampshire]], [[New York State Senate|New York]], [[North Carolina Senate|North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island Senate|Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota Senate|South Dakota]], [[Vermont Senate|Vermont]]) had terms of office at two years.

Among [[territories of the United States]]:
*In the [[American Samoa Fono]], members of the [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House]] serve two-year terms while members of the [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] serve six-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] have four-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] have two-year terms.
*The [[Legislature of Guam]] and [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.

Members of [[Council of the District of Columbia]] serve a four-year term.

==Canada==
As a former British territory following the [[Westminster System]], there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.
===Monarch===
Being a [[Commonwealth realm]], Canada shares a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.

===Viceroys===
The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and serves [[At Her Majesty's Pleasure|for an indefinite term]], though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]], who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioners]], who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] (i.e. the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of Canada}}

Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in [[By-election|by-elections]] during the middle of a Parliament.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the [[39th Canadian Parliament|39th Parliament]], provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. 

As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.

===Senate===

Senators are appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1965]] served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.

===Provincial and Territorial Legislatures===
{{seealso|Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories}}

Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in [[Ontario]], MNAs in [[Quebec]], and MHAs in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] operate using a [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus]] model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.

All provincial legislatures except that of [[Nova Scotia]] have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.

Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where [[fixed-term election]]s are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. "[[Life tenure|Until removed from office]]" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as [[impeachment]]).

In cases where the [[head of government]] is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the [[lower house]] if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a [[vote of no confidence]].

'''''The Dinner Party''''' is an [[installation art]]work by [[feminist art]]ist [[Judy Chicago]].  Widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork, it functions as a symbolic history of women in Western civilization. There are 39 elaborate place settings arranged along a triangular table for 39 mythical and historical famous women. [[Sacajawea]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], [[Theodora (6th century)|Empress Theodora of Byzantium]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] are among the symbolic guests.

Each unique place-setting includes a hand-painted china plate, ceramic flatware and chalice, and a napkin with an embroidered gold edge. Each plate, except the ones corresponding to Sojourner Truth and [[Ethel Smyth]], depicts a brightly colored, elaborately styled vulva form. The settings rest upon elaborately embroidered runners, executed in a variety of needlework styles and techniques. The dinner table stands on ''The Heritage Floor'', made up of more than 2,000 white luster-glazed triangular-shaped tiles, each inscribed in gold scripts with the name of one of 998 women and one man who have made a mark on history (the man, [[Kresilas]], was mistakenly included as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla).

It was produced from 1974 to 1979 as a collaboration and was first exhibited in 1979. Subsequently, despite art world resistance, it toured to 16 venues in six countries on three continents to a viewing audience of 15 million. It was retired to storage until 1996, as it was beginning to suffer from constant traveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Maura|title=founding curator|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/tour_and_home.php|website=Brooklyn Museum.org|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, it has been on permanent exhibition in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York.

==About the work==
[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|''The Dinner Party'' at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
''The Dinner Party'' was created by artist [[Judy Chicago]], with the assistance of numerous volunteers, with the goal to "end the ongoing cycle of omission in which women were written out of the historical record."&lt;ref name="C10"/&gt;

Chicago said she got the idea for the work while attending a real dinner party in 1974. “The men at the table were all professors,” she recalled, “and the women all had doctorates but weren’t professors. The women had all the talent, and they sat there silent while the men held forth. I started thinking that women have never had a [[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]], but they have had dinner parties.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinner with Judy Chicago|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/judychicago|website=The Attic|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table is triangular and measures forty-eight feet (14.63&amp;nbsp;m) on each side.&lt;ref name="C10"&gt;Chicago, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 13 place settings on each of the three sides of the table making 39 settings in all. Wing I honors women from Prehistory to the Roman Empire, Wing II honors women from the beginnings of Christianity to the Reformation and Wing III from the American Revolution to feminism.&lt;ref name="C10"/&gt;

Each place setting features a [[table runner]] embroidered with the woman's name and images or symbols relating to her accomplishments, with a napkin, utensils, a glass or goblet, and a plate.  Many of the plates feature a butterfly- or flower-like sculpture as a [[vulva]] symbol. A collaborative effort of female and male artisans, ''The Dinner Party'' celebrates traditional female accomplishments such as [[textile arts]] (weaving, embroidery, sewing) and [[china painting]], which have been framed as [[craft]] or [[handicraft|domestic art]], as opposed to the more culturally valued, male-dominated [[fine arts]].&lt;ref name="C10"/&gt;

While this piece is composed of typical craft work such as needlepoint and china painting and normally considered low art, "Chicago made it clear that she wants ''The Dinner Party'' to be viewed as high art, that she still subscribes to this structure of value: 'I'm not willing to say a painting and a pot are the same thing,' she has stated. 'It has to do with intent. I want to make art.'{{-"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Amelia|title=The "Sexual Politics" of the Dinner Party|date=2005|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|pages=409–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white floor of triangular [[porcelain tile]]s, called the ''Heritage Floor'', is inscribed with [[List of women in the Heritage Floor|the names of a further 998 notable women]] (and one man, [[Kresilas]], mistakenly included as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla) each associated with one of the table place settings.&lt;ref name="C10"/&gt;

''The Dinner Party'' was donated by the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art|Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation]] to the [[Brooklyn Museum]], where it is now permanently housed within the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]], which opened in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/  Brooklyn Museum] Official website. Accessed Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Chicago created a limited edition set of functional plates based on the Dinner Party designs. The plate designs that were reproduced were [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], [[Greek primordial deities|Primordial Goddess]], [[Amazons|Amazon]], and [[Sappho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cascone|first1=Sarah|title=Judy Chicago Is Releasing a Line of Plates Inspired by Her Classic Feminist Work 'The Dinner Party'|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/judy-chicago-finally-making-plates-dinner-party-1259573|website=artnet News|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design details==
The completed ''Dinner Party'' took six years and $250,000 to complete, not including volunteer labor.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Lippard, Lucy. "Judy Chicago's Dinner Party". ''Art in America'' 68 (April 1980): 114–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The work began modestly as ''Twenty-Five Women Who Were Eaten Alive'', a way in which Chicago could use her "butterfly-vagina" imagery and interest in china painting in a high-art setting.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

Chicago soon expanded it to include the thirty-nine final women arranged in three groups of thirteen. The triangular shape has significance because it has long been a symbol of the female. It is also an equilateral triangle to represent equality. The number thirteen represents the number of people who were present at the Last Supper, an important comparison for Chicago, as the only people involved there were men.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Chicago developed the work on her own for the first three years before bringing in others. Over the next three years, over 400 people contributed to the creation of the work, most of them volunteers. About 125 were called "members of the project", suggesting long-term efforts, and a small group was closely involved with the project for the final three years, including ceramicists, needle-workers, and researchers.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; The project was organized according to what has been called "benevolent hierarchy" and "non-hierarchical leadership", as Chicago designed most aspects of the work and had the final control over decisions made.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 39 plates themselves start flat and begin to emerge in higher relief towards the very end of the chronology, meant to represent modern woman's gradual independence and equality, though it is still not totally free of societal expectations.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Koplos, Janet. "''The Dinner Party'' Revisited." Art in America 91.5 (May 2003): 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The work also uses supplementary written information such as banners, timelines, and a three-book exhibition publication to provide background information on each woman included and the process of making the work.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

==Women represented in the place settings==
The first wing of the triangular table has place settings for female figures from the goddesses of [[prehistory]] through to [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] at the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. This section covers the emergence and decline of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]].

The second wing begins with [[Saint Marcella|Marcella]] and covers the rise of [[Christianity]]. It concludes with [[Anna van Schurman]] in the seventeenth century at the time of the Restoration.

The third wing represents the [[Age of Revolution]]. It begins with [[Anne Hutchinson]] and moves through the twentieth century to the final places paying tribute to [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]].

The 39 women with places at the table are:

===Women represented in the ''Heritage Floor''===
{{Main|List of women in the Heritage Floor}}
The ''Heritage Floor'', which sits underneath the table, features the names of [[List of women in the Heritage Floor|998 women]] (and one man, [[Kresilas]], mistakenly included as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla) inscribed on white handmade porcelain floor tilings. The tilings cover the full extent of the triangular table area, from the footings at each place setting, continues under the tables themselves and fills the full enclosed area within the three tables. There are 2304 tiles with names spread across more than one tile. The names are written in the [[Palmer Method|Palmer cursive script]], a twentieth-century American form. Chicago states that the criteria for a woman's name being included in the floor were one or more of the following:&lt;ref name="Chicago 2007"/&gt;

# She had made a worthwhile contribution to society
# She had tried to improve the lot of other women
# Her life and work had illuminated significant aspects of women's history
# She had provided a role model for a more egalitarian future.

Accompanying the installation are a series of wall panels which explain the role of each woman on the floor and associate her with one of the place settings.&lt;ref name="Chicago 2007"&gt;Chicago, Judy. ''The Dinner Party: From Creation to Preservation''. London: Merrell (2007), Heritage panels, page 289. {{ISBN|1-85894-370-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

===Immediate critical response (1980–1981)===
''The Dinner Party'' prompted many varied opinions. Feminist critic [[Lucy Lippard]] stated, "My own initial experience was strongly emotional... The longer I spent with the piece, the more I became addicted to its intricate detail and hidden meanings", and defended the work as an excellent example of the feminist effort.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These reactions are echoed by other critics, and the work was glorified by many.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Caldwell, Susan H. "Experiencing ''The Dinner Party''." ''Woman's Art Journal'' 1.2 (Autumn 1980-Winter 1981): 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as adamant, however, were the immediate criticisms of the work. [[Hilton Kramer]], for example, argued, "''The Dinner Party'' reiterates its theme with an insistence and vulgarity more appropriate, perhaps, to an advertising campaign than to a work of art".&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Kramer, Hilton. "Art: Judy Chicago's Dinner Party Comes to Brooklyn Museum." ''The New York Times''. October 17, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He called the work not only a kitsch object but also "crass and solemn and singleminded", "very bad art,... failed art,... art so mired in the pieties of a cause that it quite fails to acquire any independent artistic life of its own".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;

[[Maureen Mullarkey]] also criticized the work, calling it preachy and untrue to the women it claims to represent.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; She especially disagreed with the sentiment she labels "turn ‘em upside down and they all look alike", an essentializing of all women which does not respect the feminist cause.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; Mullarkey also called the hierarchical aspect of the work into question, claiming that Chicago took advantage of her female volunteers.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Mullarkey, Maureen. "''The Dinner Party'' is a Church Supper: Judy Chicago at the Brooklyn Museum." Commonweal Foundation, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[Roberta Smith]] stated that "its historical import and social significance may be greater than its aesthetic value".&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Smith, Roberta. "Art Review: For a Paean to Heroic Women, a Place at History's Table." ''New York Times''. September 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mullarkey focused on several particular plates in her critique of the work, specifically [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], using these women as examples of why Chicago's work was disrespectful to the women it depicts. She states that Dickinson's "multi-tiered pink lace crotch" was opposite the woman it was meant to symbolize because of Dickinson's extreme privacy.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Woolf's inclusion ignores her frustration at the public's curiosity about the gender of writers, and O’Keeffe had similar thoughts, denying that her work had any gendered or sexual meaning.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

''The Dinner Party'' was satirized by Mammy [[Maria Manhattan]], whose counter-exhibit ''The Box Lunch'' at a SoHo gallery was billed as "a major art event honoring 39 women of dubious distinction", and ran in November and December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manhattan|first1=Maria|title=The Box Lunch|url=http://www.mariamanhattan.com/TheBoxLunch.htm|website=Maria Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Bill|title="The Box Lunch" By Maria Manhattan July, 1979|url=http://www.billwolf.org/0128.htm|website=Bill Wolf Installations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Bill|title=The Box Lunch Goes to New York!|url=http://www.billwolf.org/0128T.htm|website=Bill Wolf Installations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newkirk|first1=Walter|title=MemoraBEALEia|date=2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|pages=40–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tHsR3SuxtkYC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to ''The Dinner Party'' being a collaborative work, Amelia Jones makes note that "Chicago never made exorbitant claims for the 'collaborative' or nonhierarchical nature of the project. She has insisted that it was never conceived or presented as a 'collaborative' project as this notion is generally understood . . . The ''Dinner Party'' project, she insisted throughout, was ''cooperative'', not collaborative, in the sense that it involved a clear hierarchy but cooperative effort to ensure its successful completion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Amelia|title=The "Sexual Politics" of the Dinner Party|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New York Times'' art reviewer Roberta Smith declares that all the details are not equal. She believes that "the runners tend to be livelier and more varied than the plates. In addition, the runners grow strong as the work progresses, while the plates become weaker, more monotonous and more overdone, which means the middle two-thirds of the piece is more successful." With the runners becoming more detailed as the work progresses, Smith notes that the backs of the runners are difficult to see and they "may be the best and boldest parts of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Roberta|title=reporter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/20/arts/art-review-for-a-paean-to-heroic-women-a-place-at-history-s-table.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=September 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the place settings, Janet Koplos believes that the plates are meant to serve as canvases, and the goblets offer vertical punctuation. She feels, however, that the "standardized flatware is historically incorrect early on and culturally skewed. The settings would be stronger as plates and runners alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koplos|first1=Janet|title="The Dinner Party" Revisited|journal=Art in America|date=May 2003|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and identity ===
In 1984, Hortense J. Spillers published her critical article, "Interstices: A Small Drama of Words". wherein she critiques Judy Chicago and ''The Dinner Party'', asserting that, as a White woman, Chicago recreates the erasure of the Black feminine sexual self. Spillers calls to her defense the place setting of Sojourner Truth, the only Black woman. After thorough review, it can be seen that all of the place settings depict uniquely designed vaginas, except for Sojourner Truth. The place setting of Sojourner Truth is depicted by three faces, rather than a vagina. Spillers writes, "The excision of the female genitalia here is a symbolic castration. By effacing the genitals, Chicago not only abrogates the disturbing sexuality of her subject, but also hopes to suggest that her sexual being did not exist to be denied in the first place..."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7S29-ASD1HgC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=hortense+spillers+interstices#v=onepage&amp;q=hortense%20spillers%20interstices&amp;f=false Routledge Press], Spillers, Hortense j, "Interstices: a small drama of words", from ''Pleasure and Danger: Exploiting Female Sexuality'', ed. Carole Vance (London: Pandora, 1992), pp. 74–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Spillers's critique, Alice Walker published her critical essay in ''Ms.'' magazine noting "Chicago's ignorance of women of color in history (specifically black women painters), focusing in particular on ''The Dinner Party'''s representation of black female subjectivity in Sojourner Truth's plate. Walker states, "It occurred to me that perhaps white women feminists, no less than white women generally, can not imagine black women have vaginas. Or if they can, where imagination leads them is too far to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Amelia|title=The "Sexual Politics" of The Dinner Party|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Larger retrospective response===
Critics such as Mullarkey have returned to ''The Dinner Party'' in later years and stated that their opinions have not changed. Many later responses to the work, however, have been more moderate or accepting, even if only by giving the work value based on its continued importance.

[[Amelia Jones]], for example, places the work in the context of both art history and the evolution of feminist ideas to explain critical responses of the work.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Jones, Amelia. "The ‘Sexual Politics’ of ''The Dinner Party'': A Critical Context." ''Reclaiming Female Agency''. Eds. Norma Broude and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. 409–433.&lt;/ref&gt; She discusses Hilton Kramer's objection to the piece as an extension of Modernist ideas about art, stating, "the piece blatantly subverts modernist value systems, which privilege the ‘pure’ aesthetic object over the debased sentimentality of the domestic and popular arts" .&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt; Jones also addresses some critics’ argument that ''The Dinner Party'' is not high art because of its huge popularity and public appeal. Where Kramer saw the work's popularity as a sign that it was of a lesser quality, Lippard and Chicago herself thought that its capability of speaking to a larger audience should be considered a positive attribute.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

The "butterfly vagina" imagery continues to be both highly criticized and esteemed. Many conservatives criticized the work for reasons summed up by Congressman [[Robert K. Dornan]] in his statement that it was "ceramic 3-D pornography", but some feminists also found the imagery problematic because of its essentializing, passive nature.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt; However, the work fits into the feminist movement of the 1970s which glorified and focused on the female body. Other feminists have disagreed with the main idea of this work because it shows a universal female experience, which many argue does not exist. For example, lesbians and women of ethnicities other than white and European are not well represented in the work.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Jones presents the argument regarding the collaborative nature of the project. Many critics attacked Chicago for claiming that the work was a collaboration when instead she was in control of the work. Chicago, however, had never claimed that the work would be this kind of ideal collaboration and always took full responsibility for the piece.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Artist [[Cornelia Parker]] nominated it as a work she would like to see "binned", saying, "Too many vaginas for my liking. I find it all about Judy Chicago's ego rather than the poor women she's supposed to be elevating&amp;nbsp;– we're all reduced to vaginas, which is a bit depressing. It's almost like the biggest piece of victim art you've ever seen. And it takes up so much space! I quite like the idea of trying to fit it in some tiny bin&amp;nbsp;– not a very feminist gesture but I don't think the piece is either."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/17/michael-landy-art-bin Michael Landy: modern art is rubbish...], Hermione Hoby, ''The Observer'', Sunday 17 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy at the University of the District of Columbia==
In 1990, ''The Dinner Party'' was considered for permanent housing at the [[University of the District of Columbia]]. It was part of a plan to bring in revenue for the school, as it had proved to be very successful.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; The work was to be donated as a gift to the school, and it was to join an expanding collection of African-American art, including a large group of paintings by Washington abstractionist [[Sam Gilliam]] and works by [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[Romare Bearden]], [[Alma Thomas]], [[Hale Woodruff]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Lois Mailou Jones]], among others.  These - along with works by a group of local white Color Field painters and some white UDC faculty members also in the university collections - were to become the core of what was presented in early 1990 as a ground-breaking multicultural art center, a hopeful coalition between artists of color, feminists and other artists depicting the struggle for freedom and human equality.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Judy Chicago donated ''The'' ''Dinner Party'' with the understanding that one of the school's buildings would be repaired to house it. The money for these repairs had already been allocated and did not come from the school's working budget.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; On June 19, 1990, UDC trustees formally accepted the gift of ''The'' ''Dinner Party'' by a unanimous vote. Soon, however, news reporters from ''Washington Times'' began writing stories that claimed that ''The'' ''Dinner Party'' "had been banned from several art galleries around the country because it depicts women's genitalia on plates" and that the "Board of Trustees will spend nearly $1.6 million to acquire and exhibit a piece of controversial art."&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Misunderstandings about the monetary situation were emphasized and perpetuated by media sources.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Eventually, the plans were cancelled owing to concerns that the collection would negatively affect the school's working budget.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lippard|first1=Lucy R.|title=Uninvited Guests: How Washington Lost ''The Dinner Party''|journal=Art in America|date=December 1991|issue=79|pages=39–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volkmar Sigusch''' (born June 11, 1940) is a [[Germany|German]] sexologist, physician and sociologist. He was from 1973 to 2006 director of the ''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft'' (Institute for Sexual Science) at the clinic of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]].

Sigusch was born in [[Bad Freienwalde]]. He studied medicine, psychology and philosophy (student of [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]]) in Frankfurt am Main, [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]]. In 1966 and 1972 Sigusch got his German M. D. and [[Ph.D.]] at the university in Hamburg. He worked then since 1973 at the university in Frankfurt as professor.

Sigusch wrote several books in sociology, psychology and sexual medicine. Sigusch is founder and since 1988 co-editor of the scientific, peer-reviewed journal ''Zeitschrift für Sexualforschung'' (Thieme Verlag Stuttgart and New York) and wrote articles for different magazines.

[[File:Yeshwant Club, Indore.jpg|thumb|The Yeshwant Club, Indore. Established in 1934.]]
'''The Yeshwant Club''' in [[Indore]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]], came into existence in 1934 at the behest of late [[Tukojirao Holkar III|Maharaja Sir Tukoji Rao III Holkar of Indore]]. The club was established out of natural love and affection for his beloved son, [[Yeshwantrao Holkar II|Yuvraj Yeshwant Rao Holkar]]. Spread over an expanse of 14 acres, it is one of the living signatures of the rich [[Maratha]] legacy of the [[Holkar]] rulers of [[Indore State]] of the [[Maratha Confederacy]]. Initially the club was opened for [[Maratha]] royalty, nobility, aristocracy, and the officers (Indians and British) of the [[Indore State|Holkar State]]. Later, its doors were opened for the business elites. After Indian independence, the admission criteria were revised according to the changing times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yeshwantclub.in/|title=Home|work=yeshwantclub.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58151.html|title=Nehru Stadium - India - Cricket Grounds - ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8tW9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=yeshwat+club+indore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwj5qLy7uLjHAhXDSI4KHXVDDwE#v=onepage&amp;q=yeshwant%20club%20indore&amp;f=false|title=Stories of Our Lives|work=google.co.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cD1MAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=yeshwant+club+indore&amp;dq=yeshwant+club+indore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwj5qLy7uLjHAhXDSI4KHXVDDwE|title=Indian Information|work=google.co.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maharani Usha Devi, the daughter of late [[Yeshwantrao Holkar II|Major General Maharaja Shrimant Sir Yeshwant Rao II Holkar of Indore]], is the chief patron of the club, and the Honorary Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh is the president of the club.
The club offers a unique blend of culture, sports and entertainment, which makes it one of the best-managed clubs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yeshwantclub.in/|title=Home|work=yeshwantclub.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58151.html|title=Nehru Stadium - India - Cricket Grounds - ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8tW9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=yeshwat+club+indore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwj5qLy7uLjHAhXDSI4KHXVDDwE#v=onepage&amp;q=yeshwant%20club%20indore&amp;f=false|title=Stories of Our Lives|work=google.co.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cD1MAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=yeshwant+club+indore&amp;dq=yeshwant+club+indore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwj5qLy7uLjHAhXDSI4KHXVDDwE|title=Indian Information|work=google.co.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hqE8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=yeshwant+club+indore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMI1raHr7i4xwIVh46OCh2I5gjP#v=onepage&amp;q=yeshwant%20club%20indore&amp;f=false|title=Madhya Pradesh District Gazetteers: Hoshangabad|work=google.co.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/nm19/yeshwant-club-indore-sports-script-wins/article1-176966.aspx|title=Yeshwant Club, Indore Sports script wins|work=www.hindustantimes.com/|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bfi.net.in/maharaja-yeshwant-rao-holkar-tourney-concludes-successfully/|title=Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar tourney concludes successfully! – Bridge Federation of India|work=bfi.net.in|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Manjit-Sachdeva-elected-Yeshwant-club-chief/articleshow/37509215.cms|title=Manjit Sachdeva elected Yeshwant club chief|work=The Times of India|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/yashwant-club-budget-presented-amid-high-drama/|title=Yashwant Club budget presented amid high drama|date=11 July 2013|work=Free Press Journal|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoparoundindia.com/madhya-pradesh/entertainment/clubs/indore.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has a busy social calendar, with musical nights, tambola evenings, sports tournaments, exhibitions, etc. There are facilities for indoor and outdoor games like tennis, squash, basketball, badminton, table tennis. The club maintains a cricket ground, football ground, modern gym and swimming pool as well. Coaching camps are organised during the summers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mardian86.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/indore.html|title=Indore|work=mardian86's blog|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership to the club is extremely difficult to get these days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Clubs-are-all-the-rage-in-Indore/articleshow/13059082.cms|title=Clubs are all the rage in Indore|work=The Times of India|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Club has almost stopped granting new memberships due to a large member base. Memberships are bequeathed across generations by the members, much like family heirlooms.
