The '''1948 Sabena DC-4 Crash''' was the crash of a [[Douglas DC-4-1009]] of the Belgian airline [[Sabena]], 27&amp;nbsp;km South of [[Libenge]], [[Congo Democratic Republic|Congo]] (Democratic Republic) on 12 May 1948. It was the deadliest accident for [[Sabena]] at the time and the second of three deadly [[Sabena]] crashes in 1948. It was also the deadliest in Belgian [[Congo Democratic Republic|Congo]] before the country's independence in 1960, of the 32 people on board 31 were killed, leaving only 1 survivor.&lt;ref name=ESM&gt;{{cite book|title=Rampen in België|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dly9axBP4O4C&amp;pg=PA67|year=2005|publisher=Lannoo Uitgeverij|isbn=978-90-209-6216-1|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft==
The DC-4-1009 involved was built in 1946 and bought new from Douglas with serial number 42932 and registration ''OO-CBE'' and was used by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] airline company [[Sabena]] from 17 April 1946 until its destruction in 1948.&lt;ref name=NFR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.planelogger.com/Aircraft/View?Registration=OO-CBE&amp;DeliveryDate=08.04.46 |title=Registration Details For OO-CBE (Sabena) DC-4-1009 |publisher=planelogger.com |date=2015 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was mostly used in Belgian Congo and carried Regent [[Prince Charles of Belgium]] back to [[Belgium]] on 13 August 1947 after his official visit to Congo.&lt;ref name=WSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbap.be/archivalia/sabena/picturessab2.htm |title=Sabena part 2 |publisher=sbap.be |date=2014 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crash ==
The Sabena flight departed from [[Léopoldville-N'Djili Airport]], [[Congo Democratic Republic]] en route to [[Libenge Airport]], [[Congo Democratic Republic]] with 25 passengers and 7 crew members on board.&lt;ref name=VSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1948/1948-31.htm |title=OO-CBE |publisher=planecrashinfo.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probable cause==
While above the Congo [[rainforest]], 27&amp;nbsp;km South of [[Libenge]], at an altitude of 700 feet, the aircraft probably penetrated a very turbulent line of clouds or flew the aircraft into the active centre of a tornado at a low altitude. The aircraft was probably then forced to the ground by a down-ward gust.,&lt;ref name=GSM/&gt;

The aircraft hit the tree-tops and left a {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} trail through the forest until it finally crashed, killing all 7 crew members and 24 of the 25 passengers,&lt;ref name=GSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19480512-0 |title=Accident description |publisher=aviation-safety.net |date=1996 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sole survivor was an [[Egypt]]ian man named Moutafis.

==Aftermath==
The wreck was located the following day and the injured sole survivor was rescued. Rescuers searched for more survivors, but it quickly became clear that their efforts were in vain. This crash was the second deadly crash of three involving a [[Sabena]] aircraft in 1948, making 1948 the deadliest year in Sabena's history.&lt;ref name=NAM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1948/05/16/page/2/article/only-one-survivor-believed-on-plane-in-belgian-congo-crash |title=Only one survivor believed on plane in Belgian Congo crash |publisher=chicago Tribune |date=15 May 1948 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biochemistry and its [[biosynthesis]] are similar to those of [[choline]] and betaine.

Arsenobetaine is a common substance in marine biological systems and unlike many other organoarsenic compounds, such as [[dimethylarsine]] and [[trimethylarsine]], it is relatively non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharya | first1 = P. | last2 = Welch | first2 = A.

It has been known since 1920 that marine fish contain organoarsenic compounds, but it was not until 1977 that the chemical structure of the most predominant compound arsenobetaine was determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=Edmonds, J.

The '''Association of Issuing Bodies''' - the AIB &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aib-net.org The Association of Issuing Bodies website]&lt;/ref&gt; - promotes the use of a standardised system, based on harmonized environment, structures and procedures in order to ensure the reliable operation of international [[energy certificate]] systems. The standardized system is known as EECS - the [[European Energy Certificate System]] - and is set out in "''The EECS Rules''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aib-net.org/portal/page/portal/AIB_HOME/AIB_OPE/EECS The EECS Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; and its supporting documents.

Of the 28 countries of the [[European Union]], 18 are now active members, along with Norway and Switzerland. Since 2001, more than three billion (3,232 million) 1[[MWh]] certificates have been issued, of which 2,859 million have already been used ('''cancelled''') to guarantee to consumers the origin of the renewable energy they have purchased. In 2016, more than 531 million certificates were issued, and 387 million of these were cancelled.

The work of the AIB is of relevance to all electricity customers, as the Guarantee of Origin (the instrument created in the European Directive and standardised through EECS) is a cornerstone of providing reliable disclosure information on the origin of electricity supplied to consumers.

'''Astana''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ˈ|s|t|æ|n|ə}}; [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and {{lang-ru|Астана|translit=Astana}}; {{IPA-kk|ɑstɑˈnɑ|Kk-astana.ogg}}; {{IPA-ru|ɐstɐˈna}}) is the [[capital city]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. It is located on the banks of the [[Ishim River]] in the north portion of Kazakhstan, within the [[Akmola Region]], though administered separately from the region as a city with special status. The 2017 official estimate reported a population of 1,029,556 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in Kazakhstan, behind [[Almaty]].&lt;ref name="&lt;ref name="stat.gov.kz" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
Founded in 1830 as a settlement of ''Akmoly'' or ''Akmolinsky prikaz'' ({{lang-ru|Акмолинский приказ}}), it served as a defensive [[fortification]] for the [[Siberian Cossacks]]. In 1832 the settlement was granted a town status and renamed ''Akmolinsk'' ({{lang-ru|Акмолинск}}). On 20 March 1961 the city was renamed ''Tselinograd'' ({{lang-ru|Целиноград|lit=City of [[tselina]]}}) to mark the city's evolution as a cultural and administrative center of the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Current Digest of the Post-Soviet Press |date=1994 |publisher=Current Digest of the Soviet Press |page=20 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XNUMAQAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 it was renamed ''Akmola'', the modified original name meaning "white grave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= |title=Kazakhstan |date=7 September 2018 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides; Third edition |isbn=978-1784770921|pages= 71 |author1=Paul Brummell |author2=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1997 Akmola replaced [[Almaty]] as the capital of Kazakhstan. On 6 May 1998 it was renamed ''Astana'', which means "capital city" in Kazakh.

[[File:Akmolinsk Fortress Map.jpg|thumb|left|Akmolinsk Fortress map]]

=== Russian Imperial era (1830–1918) ===
The settlement of ''Akmoly'', also known as ''Akmolinsky prikaz'',{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} was established on the [[Ishim River]] in 1830 as the seat of an [[okrug]] by a unit of the [[Siberian Cossacks]] headed by [[Fyodor Shubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:"От центра окружного приказа до столицы Казахстана" (краткий исторический обзор истории столицы) |trans-title=From the centre of district order to the capital of Kazakhstan (short historical overview of the history of the capital) |url=http://www.uad.astana.kz/ru/node/41937 |publisher=Archive and Documentation Department of Astana |language=ru |accessdate=23 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123193140/http://www.uad.astana.kz/ru/node/41937 |archivedate=23 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was possibly given after a local landmark—''Akmola'' literally means "a white grave" in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]—although this theory is not universally accepted.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named ''Akmolinsk''.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} The fairly advantageous position of the town was clear as early as 1863 in an abstract from the Geographic and Statistical Dictionary of the [[Russian Empire]]. It describes how picket roads and lines connected this geographic centre to [[Kargaly]] in the East, [[Aktau]] fort in the South and through [[Atbasar]] to [[Kokshetau|Kokchetav]] in the West. In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by [[Kenesary Khan]], Akmolinsk fortress was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=Revolt of 1837—1847 under the leadership of khan Kenesary |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/272|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt. On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an [[uyezd]] town.&lt;ref name="History of Astana"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=History of Astana |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/380|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rapid development of the Russian capitalist market, the huge [[Saryarka — Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan|Saryarka areas]] were actively exploited by the colonial administration. To draft regulation governing the [[Kazakh Steppe]] the Government of the [[Russian Empire]] formed Steppe Commission in 1865.&lt;ref name="The social and economic relations in Kazakhstan in the second half of the XIX century"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=The social and economic relations in Kazakhstan in the second half of the XIX century |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/148|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 1868, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] signed a draft Regulation on governing [[Turgay Oblast (Russian Empire)|Turgay]], [[Ural Oblast (Russian Empire)|Ural]], [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk]] and [[Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russia|Semipalatinsk Oblast]]s.&lt;ref name="The social and economic relations in Kazakhstan in the second half of the XIX century" /&gt; In 1869, Akmolinsk external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the centre of the newly established [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]]. In 1879, Major General Dubelt proposed to build a railway between [[Tyumen]] and Akmolinsk to the Ministry of Communications of Russia. In the course of the first 30 years of its existence, the population of Akmola numbered a trifle more than 2,000 people. However, over the next 30 years the city's population increased by three times according to [[volost]]s and [[Human settlement|settlements]] of the Akmolinsk Oblast. In 1893, Akmolinsk was an [[uyezd]] with a 6,428 strong population, 3 [[church (building)|churches]], 5 [[school]]s and [[college]]s and 3 [[Factory|factories]].

=== Soviet era (1918–1991) ===
During [[World War II]], Akmolinsk served as a route for the transport of engineering tools and equipment from evacuated [[plant]]s in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] located in the [[oblast]]s of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. Local industries were appointed to respond to war needs, assisting the country to provide the battle and home fronts with all materials needed. In the post-war years, Akmolinsk became a beacon of economic revival in the west of the [[Soviet Union]] ruined by the war. Additionally, many [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Russian-Germans]] were resettled here after being [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=S. Kurmanova|title=Deportation of Volga Germans to Kazakhstan: Causes and Consequences|url=http://e-history.kz/media/upload/1488/2014/06/26/18cc9c944aa4adcf1f67b8f1f45826ca.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=e-history.kz|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts became a territory of the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], in order to turn the region into a second [[grain]] producer for the [[Soviet Union]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= |title=Kazakhstan |date=7 September 2018 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides; Third edition |isbn=978-1784770921|pages= 71|author1=Paul Brummell |author2=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Ian MacWilliam|title=In Virgin Lands, a Dream Ends|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1994/4/article/in-virgin-lands-a-dream-ends/213516.html|date=20 April 1994|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=The Moscow Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1960, [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] made a resolution to create the Tselinniy Krai, which comprised five regions of the Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} [[Akmola Region|Akmolinsk Oblast]] was ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} Its districts were directly subordinated to the new [[krai]] administration, and Akmolinsk became the krai capital, as well as the administrative seat of the new Virgin Lands economic region.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} On 14 March 1961, Khrushchev proposed to rename the city to name corresponding to its role in the Virgin Lands Campaign.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2010|p=739}} On 20 March 1961, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR renamed Akmolinsk to ''Tselinograd''.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2010|p=739}} On 24 April 1961, the region was reconstituted as ''Tselinograd Oblast''.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=293}} In the 1960s, Tselinograd was completely transformed. In 1963, work on the first three new high-rise housing districts began.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=295}} In addition, the city received a number of new monumental public buildings, including the Virgin Lands Palace, a Palace of Youth, a House of Soviets, a new airport, and several sports venues.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=296}} In 1971, the Tselinniy Krai was abolished and Tselinograd became the centre of the oblast.

=== Contemporary era (1991–present) ===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the consequent independence of Kazakhstan, the city's original form was restored in the modified form ''Akmola''.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} On 6 July 1994, the [[Mazhilis|Supreme Council of Kazakhstan]] adopted the decree "On the transfer of the capital of Kazakhstan".&lt;ref name="Astana - the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=Astana – the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan |url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/378 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capital of Kazakhstan was moved to Akmola on 10 December 1997, the city was consequently renamed Astana in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1298395.stm |title=Timeline: Kazakhstan |publisher=BBC News |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 1998, Astana was presented as the capital internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akorda.kz/en/category/astana |title=Astana – the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan |publisher=Official site of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan |accessdate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317063010/http://akorda.kz/en/category/astana |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 1999, Astana was awarded the medal and title of the City of Peace by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="Astana - the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan" /&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Astana (Kazakhstan), satellite image 2017-07-24.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Satellite image of Astana and vicinities]]

===Topography===

Astana is located in central Kazakhstan on the [[Ishim River]] in a very flat, semi-arid steppe region which covers most of the country's territory. It is at 51° 10' north latitude and 71° 26' east longitude. The city encompasses {{convert|722.0|sqkm|1}}. The elevation of Astana is {{convert|347|m}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]. Astana is in a spacious steppe landscape, in the transitional area between the north of Kazakhstan and the extremely thinly settled national centre, because of the Ishim River. The older boroughs lie north of the river, whilst the new boroughs are located south of the Ishim.

=== Time ===
The [[UTC offset|time offset]] from the [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] used by Astana is 6 hours after UTC, or [[UTC+06:00|UTC+6:00]]. This is also used by most of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Almaty]].

===Climate===
Astana is the second-coldest capital city in the world after [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia, a position formerly held by Canada's capital, [[Ottawa]], until Astana attained capital city status in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Mongolist|author=Brian White|title=Ulaanbaatar is the Coldest Capital |url=http://www.themongolist.com/blog/society/43-ulaanbaatar-is-the-coldest-capital.html|date=9 January 2013|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Canada.com |title=Still the third-coldest capital, despite balmy temperatures |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f23f6479-3274-493b-9f74-d8d8cb5418be |date=4 January 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606224805/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f23f6479-3274-493b-9f74-d8d8cb5418be |archivedate=6 June 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astana has an extreme continental climate with warm summers (featuring occasional brief rain showers) and long, very cold, dry winters. Summer temperatures occasionally reach {{convert|+35|C}} while {{convert|-30|to|-35|C}} is not unusual between mid-December and early March. Typically, the city's river is frozen over between the second week of November and the beginning of April. Astana has a well-deserved reputation among Kazakhs for its frequent high winds, the effects of which are felt particularly strongly on the fast-developing but relatively exposed Left Bank area of the city.

Overall, Astana has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''),&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:Asia Koppen Map.png|Updated Central, South, Southeast, and Eastern Asian and Siberian Map of the Köppen climate classification system.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature in Astana is {{convert|+3.5|C}}. January is the coldest month with an average temperature of {{convert|-14.2|C}} and record lowest is in January 1893's cold wave reaching temperatures down to {{convert|-51.6|C}}.&lt;ref name="pogoda"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/35188.htm | title = Weather and Climate-The Climate of Astana | accessdate = 8 February 2015 | language = Russian | publisher = Weather and Climate }}&lt;/ref&gt; July is the hottest month with an average temperature of {{convert|+20.7|C}}.

As of September 2017, the population of Astana was 1,029,556;&lt;ref name="stat.gov.kz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stat.gov.kz/getImg?id=ESTAT245798 |title=Об изменении численности населения Республики Казахстан с начала 2017 года до 1 декабря 2017 года (Citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan ... to 1 December 2017) |date=4 January 2018 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; over double the 2002 population of 493,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2009/0389/analit07.php|title=Население Астаны|website=www.demoscope.ru|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many argue that a drive to attract ethnic Kazakhs northward was the key factor in shifting the capital, which was officially put down to lack of space for expansion in the former capital, [[Almaty]], and its location in an earthquake zone. Astana would also be 'closer to the industrial centre of Kazakhstan' than Almaty.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Kazachstan. §5. Geschiedenis". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1999 Census, 40.5% of the population was Russian, 5.7% Ukrainian, 3.0% German, 2.6% Tatar, 1.8% [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] and 0.8% [[Poles|Polish]]. But at 41.8%, Kazakhs outnumbered Russians and formed the largest ethnic group, while Ingush and Korean each accounted for 0.6%. Others, mostly Uzbeks, accounted for 3.8%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=}}

In 1989, Astana had a population of 281,000. The ethnic mix was about 30% [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] and 70% [[Russians|Russian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Astana/Astana.html |title=Astana |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, Astana's population had more than doubled since becoming the capital, to over 600,000, and it topped 1 million in 2017. Migrant workers—legal and illegal—have been attracted from across Kazakhstan and neighbouring states such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and Astana is a magnet for young professionals seeking to build a career. This has changed the city's demographics, bringing more ethnic Kazakhs to a city that formerly had a Slavic majority. Astana's ethnic Kazakh population has risen to some 60%, up from 17% in 1989.&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav070907.shtml |title=Kazakhstan's Capital Holds a Lavish Anniversary Celebration |publisher=EurasiaNet.org |date=8 July 2007 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to preliminary figures, Astana had 700,000 inhabitants in late 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=}}

It contains accommodations for different religions: Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]] and other faiths. The pyramid-shaped building would express the spirit of Kazakhstan, where cultures, traditions and representatives of various nationalities coexist in peace, harmony and accord.

Astana is subdivided into three districts. [[Almaty District]] was created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|21,054|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=off}} with a population of 375,938 people. The district has five villages. [[Yesil District]], which is also called left bank of the city, was created on 5 August 2008 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|31,179|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of 119,929 people. [[Saryarka District]] was created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|19,202|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of 339,286 people.

In April 1998, the [[Government of Kazakhstan]] asked architects and [[urban planner]]s of international renown to participate in a design competition for the new capital. On 6 October 1998, Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] was awarded the First Prize.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} Summary of Kurokawa's Proposal, since the 1960s, pleaded for the [[paradigm shift]] from the age of the machine principle to the age of life principle.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} His work is the embodiment of [[Metabolism (architecture)|Metabolism]] and symbiosis, which are the two most important concepts of the age of life principle.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} Kurokawa's proposal aimed to preserve and redevelop the existing city, and create a new city at the south and the east sides of the [[Ishim River]], enabling the Symbiosis of the History and the Future.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}}

North of the railway line, which crosses Astana in an east-west direction, are industrial and poorer residential areas. Between the railway line and the Ishim river is the city centre, where at present intense building activity is occurring. To the west and east are more elevated residential areas with parks and the new area of government administration to the south of the Ishim River. Here many large building projects are under way; for example, the construction of a diplomatic quarter, and a variety of different government buildings. By 2030, these quarters are to be completed. Astana's current chief planner, [[Vladimir Laptev]], wants to build a [[Berlin]] in a [[Eurasia]]n style. He has stated that a purely administrative capital such as [[Canberra]] is not one of his goals.

=== Air ===
[[Astana International Airport]] {{airport codes|TSE|UACC}}, located {{convert|17|km}} south-east of the city centre, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aeroport.kz/city/astana |script-title=ru:Международный аэропорт Астаны |trans-title=Astana International Airport| publisher=Aeroport.kz |language=ru | accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-busiest airport in Kazakhstan, with 2,960,181 passengers passing through it in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.astanaairport.kz/?page_id=533 | title=Passenger traffic | publisher=Astana International Airport | accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport hosts 13 airlines operating regular passenger flights inside the country and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.astanaairport.kz/?page_id=581 | title=General information | publisher=Astana International Airport | accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air Astana]] maintains its second-largest hub at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/companies/No-Peoples-IPO-for-Air-Astana-in-near-future-Samruk-Kazyna-254903/ |title=No People's IPO for Air Astana in near future: Samruk Kazyna |publisher=Tengrinews.kz |date=31 July 2014 |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expected 50% increase in passenger traffic by 2017 has spurred construction of a new terminal with an area of about {{Convert|40000|m2|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astana.gov.kz/en/modules/material/295 |title=Passenger traffic in Astana airport to increase to 5 million passengers a year by 2017 |publisher=Akimat of Astana |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216002223/http://astana.gov.kz/en/modules/material/295 |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://astana.gov.kz/en/modules/material/6643 |title=New Passenger Terminal will be created after the Capitals Airport Reconstruction |publisher=Akimat of Astana |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railway and roads ===
Astana is located in the centre of the country, serving as a well-positioned transport node for rail and automotive networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://railways.kz/en/node/2210 | title="Astana" station | publisher=Kazakhstan Temir Zholy | accessdate=16 February 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215231758/http://railways.kz/en/node/2210 | archive-date=15 February 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Astana railway station]] is the city's main [[railway station]] and serves approximately 7,000 people each day. A new railway station, [[Astana Nurly Zhol railway station|Nurly Zhol]] was built during the [[Expo 2017]] event with a customer capacity of 12,000. [[Talgo|Tulpar Talgo]] is a daily express train to [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/industry_infrastructure/Kazakh-Spanish-trains-to-become-more-comfortable-258609/ |title=Kazakh-Spanish trains to become more comfortable |publisher=Tengrinews.kz |date=28 January 2015 |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term plans include construction of a new railway station in the industrial district; in the vicinity of CHPP-3 a new terminal will be erected for freight cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/industry_infrastructure/Astana-will-construct-new-railroad-station-for-EXPO-2017-16094/ |title=Astana will construct new railroad station for EXPO-2017 |publisher=Tengrinews.kz |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-36 Chelyabinsk-Almaty and A-343 Astana-Petropavlovsk highways are routed through the city. The strategic geographical positioning of Astana allows the city to serve as a transport and reload centre for cargoes formed at adjacent stations in the area.

==[[Expo 2017]]==
On 1 July 2010, at the 153rd General Assembly of [[Bureau International des Expositions]] held in Paris, representatives from Astana presented the city's bid to host the Specialised [[Expo 2017]].&lt;ref name="BIEtheme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Future energy – solutions for tackling mankind’s greatest challenge|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/expos/upcoming-expos/expo-astana-2017/future-energy-solutions-for-tackling-mankind-s-greatest-challenge|publisher=BIE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AEF1&gt;{{cite web|title=Expo2017: Future Energy and Impact on our Lives|url=http://blog.astanaforum.org/en/expo-2017-future-energy-and-its-impact-in-our-lives|publisher=Astana Economic Forum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723115354/http://blog.astanaforum.org/en/expo-2017-future-energy-and-its-impact-in-our-lives|archivedate=23 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision|url=https://expo2017astana.com/en/energy/zamyisel-proekta|website=expo2017astana.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505194547/https://expo2017astana.com/en/energy/zamyisel-proekta|archivedate=5 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhs concept for this exhibition relates to the impact of energy and social on the modern world.

Expo 2017 opened to much fanfare on June 10, with heads of state from 17 different nations in attendance. The two-millionth visitor was registered on August 7. It is the first world's fair to be held in Central Asia and its central pavilion, ''Nur Alem'', is the largest spherical building in the world.

More than 4 million people visited Expo 2017 in Astana, two times more than was expected. Recently it was announced that Expo pavilion will be opened again on 11 November. Entry will be free for all the visitors. The only places that will require additional fees for entry are "Nur Alem" and centre of art.

A '''burr puzzle''' is an [[interlocking puzzle]] consisting of notched sticks, combined to make one [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], usually [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] unit.
These puzzles are traditionally made of wood, but versions made of plastic or metal can also be found. Quality burr puzzles are usually precision-made for easy sliding and accurate fitting of the pieces.
In recent years the definition of "burr" is expanding, as puzzle designers use this name for puzzles not necessarily of stick-based pieces.

==History==

The term "burr" is first mentioned in a 1928 book by Edwin Wyatt,&lt;ref name="Wyatt28"&gt;{{ cite book | title = Puzzles in Wood | first = E. M. | last = Wyatt | publisher = Bruce Publishing Co | location =  Milwaukee, Wisc | year = 1928 | isbn = 0-918036-09-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the text implies that it was commonly used before. The term is attributed to the finished shape of many of these puzzles, resembling a seed [[burr (fruit)|burr]].
The origin of burr puzzles is unknown. The first known record&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | title =  New Findings on the History of the Six Piece Burr | first = Jerry | last = Slocum | publisher = Slocum Puzzle Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; appears in a 1698 [[engraving]] used as a [[title page]] of [[Chambers's Cyclopaedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Cyclopaedia, Chambers - Volume 1 - 0008.jpg|The title page of Chambers's Cyclopaedia]] on [[Wikimedia Commons]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later records can be found in [[Germany|German]] catalogs from the late 18th century and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | title =  Puzzles from Catel's Cabinet and Bestelmeier's Magazine, 1785 to 1823 | first = Jerry | last = Slocum | first2 = Dieter | last2 = Gebbardt | publisher = Slocum Puzzle Foundation | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are claims of the burr being a [[China|Chinese]] invention, like other classic puzzles such as the [[Tangram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | title =  Chinese Puzzles: Games for the Hands and Mind | first = Wei | last = Zhang | first2 = Peter | last2 = Rasmussen | publisher = Art Media Resources | year = 2008 | isbn = 1588861015 }} ([http://chinesepuzzles.org/burr-puzzles/ A page about burr puzzles in the book's website])&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kerala]], [[India]], these wooden problems are called Edakoodam.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=ഏടാകൂടം |url=https://olam.in/DictionaryML/ml/%E0%B4%8F%E0%B4%9F%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%95%E0%B5%82%E0%B4%9F%E0%B4%82 |work=Olam Dictionary |language =Malayalam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=നാലുകെട്ടല്ല ഇത് ഏടാകൂടം |url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/thrissur/nagaram/-malayalam-news-1.1495317 |work=Mathrubhumi Daily |language=Malayalam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six-Piece Burr==
[[File:SixPartWoodKnot.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An assembled six-piece burr]]
The six-piece burr, also called "Puzzle Knot" or "Chinese Cross", is the most well-known and presumably the oldest of the burr puzzles. This is actually a family of puzzles, all sharing the same finished shape and basic shape of the pieces. The earliest US [[patent]] for a puzzle of this kind dates back to 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | inventor1-last = Brown | inventor1-first = Oscar | title = Puzzle | issue-date = 1917 | patent-number = 1225760 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the six-piece burr was very common and popular, but was considered trite and uninteresting by enthusiasts. Most of the puzzles made and sold were very similar to one another and most of them included a "key" piece, an unnotched stick that slides easily out. In the late 1970s, however, the six-piece burr regained the attention of inventors and collectors, thanks largely to a computer [[analysis]] conducted by the [[mathematician]] [[Bill Cutler (mathematician)|Bill Cutler]] and its publication in [[Martin Gardner]]'s column on ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gardner | first = Martin | title = Mathematical Games | journal = Scientific American |date=January 1978 | pages = 14–26 |url=http://www.nature.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/scientificamerican/journal/v238/n1/pdf/scientificamerican0178-14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
All six pieces of the puzzle are square sticks of equal length (at least 3 times their width). When solved, the pieces are arranged in three perpendicular, mutually intersecting pairs. The notches of all sticks are located within the region of intersection, so when the puzzle is assembled they are unseen. All notches can be described as being made by removing [[cube|cubic]] units (with an edge length of half the sticks' width), as shown in the figure:
[[File:Six-Piece Burr - Cubic Units.svg|150px|none]]
There are 12 removable cubic units, and different puzzles of this family are made of sticks with different units removed. 4,096 [[permutation]]s exist for removing the cubic units. Of those, we ignore the ones that cut the stick in two and the ones creating identical pieces, and are left with 837 usable pieces.&lt;ref name="Cutler78"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Cutler | first1 = William H. | title = The Six-Piece Burr | journal = Journal of Recreational Mathematics | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | year = 1978 | pages = 241–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, these pieces can be combined to create over 35 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] possible assemblies, however it is estimated that less than 6 billion of them are actual puzzles, capable of being assembled or taken apart.&lt;ref name="Cutler94"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Cutler | first1 = Bill | url = http://home.comcast.net/~billcutler/docs/CA6PB/index.html | title = A Computer Analysis of All 6-Piece Burrs | year = 1994 | accessdate = February 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Six-Piece Burr - Nut Puzzle.svg|right|thumb|250px|The "Nut" puzzle from Hoffmann's 1893 book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Hoffmann | first1 = Professor | title = Puzzles old and new | place = London | publisher = Frederick Warne and Co. | year = 1893 | chapter = Chapter III, No. XXXVI }} ([https://archive.org/details/puzzlesoldnew00hoff Available for download] at the [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt; an example of a solid burr.]]

===Solid Burr===
A burr puzzle with no internal voids when assembled is called a '''solid burr'''. These burrs can be taken apart directly by removing a piece or some pieces in one move. Up until the late 1970s, solid burrs received the most attention and publications referred only to this type.&lt;ref name="Coffin92"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Coffin | first1 = Stewart | title = Puzzle Craft | year = 1992 | url = http://www.puzzleworld.org/PuzzleCraft/pc92.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 119,979 solid burrs are possible, using 369 of the usable pieces. To assemble all these puzzles, one would need a set of 485 pieces, as some of the puzzles include identical pieces.&lt;ref name="Cutler78" /&gt;

[[File:Six-Piece Burr - Burr 305.svg|right|thumb|250px|"Burr no. 305", named after its location in Cutler's analysis tables. It was found to be the most "interesting" of the 314 solid burrs of notchable pieces, because it is the only one containing no duplicate or symmetric pieces, and also having one unique solution that does not employ a common 2-piece key.]]

===Pieces Types===
For [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], but mostly practical reasons, the burr pieces can be divided into two types:
* '''Notchable''' pieces - with full notches that can be made with a [[saw]] or a [[milling machine]].
* '''Non-notchable''' pieces - with internal corners that have to be made with a [[chisel]] or by gluing parts together.
[[File:Six-Piece Burr - Piece Types.svg|none|thumb|450px|Right to left: a notchable piece, a non-notchable piece and a piece that is technically notchable, but cannot be used with other notchable pieces to create solid burrs]]
59 of the usable pieces are notchable, including the unnotched stick. Of those, only 25 can be used to create solid burrs. This set, often referred to as "The 25 notchable pieces", with the addition of 17 duplicates, can be assembled to create 221 different solid burr puzzles. Some of those puzzles have more than one solution, for a total of 314 solutions. These pieces are very popular, and full sets are manufactured and sold by many companies.

[[File:Six-Piece Burr - Philippe Dubois.svg|right|thumb|250px|A level-7 burr by the Israeli designer and maker Philippe Dubois who sold his puzzles under the name Gaby Games"]]

===Holey Burr===
For all solid burrs, one movement is required to remove the first piece or pieces. However, a '''holey burr''', which has internal voids when assembled, can require more than one move. The number of moves required for removing the first piece is referred to as the ''level'' of the burr. All solid burrs are therefore level 1. The higher the level is, the more difficult the puzzle.

During the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made by experts to find burrs of an ever-higher level. On 1979, the American designer and craftsman [[Stewart Coffin]] found a level-3 puzzle. In 1985, Bill Cutler found a level-5 burr&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dewdney | first = A. K. | title = Computer Recreations | journal = Scientific American | volume = 253 | issue = 4 |date=October 1985 | pages = 16–27 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1085-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly afterwards a level-7 burr was found by the [[Israel]]i Philippe Dubois.&lt;ref name="Coffin92" /&gt; In 1990, Cutler completed the final part of his analysis and found that the highest possible level using notchable pieces is 5, and 139 of those puzzles exist. The highest level possible for a six-piece burr with more than one solution is 12, meaning 12 moves are required to remove the first piece.&lt;ref name="Cutler94" /&gt;

==Three-Piece Burr==
A three-piece burr made from sticks with "regular" [[Right angle|right-angled]] notches (as the six-piece burr), cannot be assembled or taken apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.research.ibm.com/BurrPuzzles/Burr3.html | title = Three-piece burrs | accessdate = February 19, 2013 | publisher = [[IBM]] | year = 1997 | author = Jürg von Känel | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151627/http://www.research.ibm.com/BurrPuzzles/Burr3.html | archivedate = January 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some three-piece burrs with different kinds of notches, the best known of them being the one mentioned by Wyatt in his 1928 book, consisting of a rounded piece that is meant to be rotated.&lt;ref name="Wyatt28" /&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;File:Three Piece Burr Small.jpg|Three piece burr&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Known Burr Families==
[[File:PuzzleByAltekruse.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An Altekruse puzzle]]

===Altekruse===
The Altekruse puzzle is named after the grantee of its 1890 patent, though the puzzle is of earlier origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | inventor1-last = Altekruse | inventor1-first = William | title = Block Puzzle | issue-date = 1890 | patent-number = 430502 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Altekruse" is of [[Austria]]n-[[Germany|German]] origin and means "old-cross" in [[German language|German]], which led to the presumption that it was a [[pseudonym]], but a man by that name immigrated to America in 1844 with his three brothers to avoid being drafted to the [[Prussian Army]] and is presumed to be the one who filed this patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Coffin | first1 = Stewart | url = http://www.johnrausch.com/PuzzlingWorld/ | title = The Puzzling World of Polyhedral Dissections | chapter = The Altekruse Puzzle | chapter-url = http://www.johnrausch.com/PuzzlingWorld/chap06.htm#p4 | accessdate = February 19, 2013 | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic Altekruse consists of 12 identical pieces. In order to disassemble it, two halves of the puzzle have to be moved in opposite directions. Using two more of these pieces, the puzzle can be assembled in a different way. By the same principle, other puzzles of this family can be created, with 6, 24, 36 and so forth. Despite their size, those bigger puzzles are not considered very difficult, yet they require [[patience]] and [[dexterity]] to assemble.
[[File:Chuck Burr Puzzle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Chuck puzzle]]

===Chuck===
The Chuck puzzle was invented and patented by Edward Nelson in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | inventor1-last = Nelson | inventor1-first = Edward | title = Puzzle | issue-date = 1897 | patent-number = 588705 | country-code = US }}&lt;/ref&gt; His design was improved and developed by Ron Cook of the [[United Kingdom|British]] company ''Pentangle Puzzles'' who designed other puzzles of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pentangle-puzzles.co.uk/acatalog/WoodChuck_Puzzles.html | title = WoodChuck Puzzles | publisher = Pentangle Puzzles | accessdate = February 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chuck consists mostly of U-shaped stick pieces of various lengths, and some with an extra notch that are used as key pieces. For creating bigger Chuck puzzles (named Papa-chuck, Grandpapachuck and Great Grandpapachuck, by Cook) one would need to add longer pieces. The Chuck can also be regarded as an extension of a six-piece burr of very simple pieces called Baby-chuck, which is very easy to solve. Chuck pieces of different lengths can also be used to create asymmetric shapes, assembled according to the same principle as the original puzzle.

[[File:Pagoda Burr Puzzle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pagoda of size 5, with 51 pieces (crafted by Philippe Dubois)]]

===Pagoda===
The origin of the Pagoda, also called "Japanese Crystal" is unknown. It is mentioned in Wyatt's 1928 book.&lt;ref name="Wyatt28" /&gt; Puzzles of this family can be regarded as an extension of the "three-piece burr" (Pagoda of size 1), however they do not require special notches to be assembled or taken apart. Pagoda of size 2 consists of 9 pieces, and bigger versions consist of 19, 33, 51 and so forth. Pagoda of size &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt; 2n^2+1 &lt;/math&gt; pieces.

==Diagonal Burr==
[[File:Giant Star Burr Puzzle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A diagonal burr - Giant Star puzzle (manufactured by Gaya Games)]]
Though most burr puzzle pieces are made with square notches, some are made with [[diagonal]] notches. Diagonal burr pieces are square sticks with V-shaped notches, cut at an [[angle]] of 45° off the stick's [[Face (geometry)|Face]]. These puzzles are often called "Stars", as it is customary to also cut the sticks' edges at an angle of 45°, for aesthetic reasons, giving the assembled puzzle a [[Star (polygon)|Star]]-like shape.

In Marathi, the same word was also used for a unit of [[area]] of 120&amp;nbsp;[[bigha]]s (25&amp;nbsp;[[hectare]]s, very approximately), and it is also recorded as a unit of [[dry volume]].

The candy was generally one of the largest (if not ''the'' largest) unit in a given system of measurement. The name is thought to be derived from the [[Sanskrit]] खण्डन (root खुड्) ''khaṇḍ'', "to divide, break into pieces",&lt;ref name="Yule" /&gt; which has also been suggested as the root of the term [[Candy|(sugar-)candy]]. The word was adopted into several South Asian languages before the compilation of dictionaries, presumably through trade as several [[Dravidian language]]s have local synonyms: for example ఖండి ''kaṇḍi'' and పుట్టి ''puṭṭi'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]].&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{citation | url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?page=765&amp;table=brown&amp;display=utf8 | page = 770 | author = Brown, Charles Philip | title =  A Telugu-English dictionary | edition = 2nd | location = Madras | publisher = Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge | year = 1903}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit of mass ==
{{British Indian units of mass}}
The candy was equal to twenty maunds, but the value of the maund was not standardised across South Asia. There were at least three different approximate values for maund in early nineteenth century India, ranging from 11.34&amp;nbsp;kg to 37.32&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref name="Prinsep77"&gt;Prinsep (1840), p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; and values from outside India varied even wider. Much of our knowledge of the values of South Asian mass units comes from an 1821 study ordered by the [[British East India Company]] and subsequently published as ''Kelly's Oriental Metrology'',&lt;ref name="Prinsep81" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It seems unlikely that Kelly actually measured any standards for the candy, or even that such large physical standards even existed. However, it can be assumed that he accurately measured standards for the maund (or a similar mass unit). His results are quoted to a precision of 1&amp;nbsp;[[dram (unit)|dram avoirdupois]] ({{nowrap|1.771 845 195 3125 g}}).&lt;/ref&gt; although the approximate value of 500&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|pounds]] for the candy is attested as early as 1618.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; The earliest European reference to the candy (1563) puts its mass at 522&amp;nbsp;[[Arrátel|arráteis]]&lt;ref name="Yule" /&gt; (239.6&amp;nbsp;kg, 528.2&amp;nbsp;lbs.).

The three [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|Presidencies of British India]] had already undertaken a fair degree of standardisation of weights and measures by the time of Kelly's study.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This process of standardisation was not complete until 1833 in the Bengal Presidency.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Madras Presidency]], the maund was fixed at 25&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av. (11.340&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''The Anglo-Hindoostanee Handbook'' (1850) gives the Madras maund as 25&amp;nbsp;troy pounds (9.331&amp;nbsp;kg), in contradiction with the values quoted in Prinsep (1840) that are far more complete and closer in time to the original [[British East India Company]] study of local weight standards (1821). It would seem unusual to have used [[troy weight]] for such large commercial quantities, so Prinsep's value has been retained here.&lt;/ref&gt; making the candy equal to 500&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av.&lt;ref name="Prinsep77" /&gt; (226.796&amp;nbsp;kg). In the [[Bombay Presidency]], the maund was fixed at 28&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av. (12.701&amp;nbsp;kg), making the candy exactly equal to 5&amp;nbsp;[[hundredweight]]&lt;ref name="Prinsep77" /&gt; (560&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av., 254.012&amp;nbsp;kg). In Bombay itself (present-day [[Mumbai]]), a separate value of the candy was recorded for "grain", equal to 8&amp;nbsp;[[parah (unit)|parahs]] or 358&amp;nbsp;lbs. 6&amp;nbsp;oz. 4&amp;nbsp;dr.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84"&gt;Prinsep (1840), pp. 84–90.&lt;/ref&gt; (162.563&amp;nbsp;kg, [[#Unit of dry volume|see also below]]). In the [[Bengal Presidency]], where the candy was not traditionally used, the maund (or ''mun'') was a much larger unit, 100&amp;nbsp;[[Troy weight|troy pounds]]&lt;ref name="Prinsep65"&gt;Prinsep (1840), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The use of an exact figure in troy weight for the Bengal Presidency stems from the definition of the local measurement system, based on the [[tola (unit)|tola]]. The Bengal seer (1/80&amp;nbsp;of a Bengal maund) was exactly 72/35&amp;nbsp;pounds avoirdupois [Prinsep&amp;nbsp;(1840), p.&amp;nbsp;65], so the Bengal maund was exactly 1152/7&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av.&lt;/ref&gt; (37.324&amp;nbsp;kg, equivalent to a candy of 746.5&amp;nbsp;kg).

The effects of this standardisation can also be seen in other territories under direct British control. In [[Ceylon]], the candy (also known as the [[bahar (unit)|bahar]]) was 500&amp;nbsp;lbs (226.796&amp;nbsp;kg) as on the Continent.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; Use of the candy is also recorded in [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]], where it was the equivalent of 150&amp;nbsp;[[viss]]:&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; its equivalent in [[Imperial units]] was measured as 500&amp;nbsp;lbs. (226.796&amp;nbsp;kg) in [[Pegu]] and 550&amp;nbsp;lbs. (249.476&amp;nbsp;kg) in [[Rangoon]].

Perhaps the most striking example is from the [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]] in southwest India. At the British East India Company trading station of Anjengo,  (near modern-day [[Kadakkavoor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dgllnoida.gov.in/chennai/ANJENGO.html | title = Anjengo Light House | publisher = Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships | access-date = 2009-05-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813003111/http://dgllnoida.gov.in/chennai/ANJENGO.html# | archive-date = 2009-08-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;), the candy was equal to 35&amp;nbsp;[[telong]] and fixed at 560&amp;nbsp;lbs. (254.012&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; as in Bombay. At Colachy (modern-day [[Kolachal]]) however, less than 50&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s (80&amp;nbsp;km) to the south, the candy was measured at only 376&amp;nbsp;lbs. 1&amp;nbsp;oz. 2&amp;nbsp;dr.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; (170.583&amp;nbsp;kg).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In the region of the [[Central Provinces]], the maund was roughly 40&amp;nbsp;lbs.,&lt;ref name="Prinsep81" /&gt; which is probably about the value it had under the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Depending on the method of calculation, the Mughal ''mun'' can be estimated as either 34¾&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av. or 47&amp;nbsp;lbs.&amp;nbsp;av. [Prinsep (1840), p.&amp;nbsp;81].&lt;/ref&gt; The candy was not recorded as being in use as a unit of measurement in this region in 1821.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; Although not a part of the Central Provinces region, the unusually high value recorded for the candy in Baroda, [[Gujarat]] (modern-day [[Vadodara]]) – 892&amp;nbsp;lbs. 1&amp;nbsp;oz. 4&amp;nbsp;dr.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; (404.640&amp;nbsp;kg) – can be explained by this higher value of the Mughal maund. The candy in [[Surat]], the main port of Gujerat, is also consistently quoted as being much larger than the same unit further south.&lt;ref name="Yule" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Simmonds, P. L. | year = 1893 | title = The Commercial Dictionary of Trade Products | url = https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftrad00simm | location = London | publisher = George Routledge &amp; Sons | page = 65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit of area ==
The candy (खंडी, ''khaṇḍī'') is also recorded as a unit of [[area]] in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], equal to 120&amp;nbsp;[[bigha]]s.&lt;ref name="Molesworth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaze" /&gt; It is impossible to accurately convert this to modern units given the huge variability in the different values of the bigha in different locations. In particular, Kelly's 1821 study of South Asian metrology is completely silent on land measures in the [[Bombay Presidency]]. Molesworth defines the Marathi bigha (बिघा, ''bighā'') as equal to twenty [[panda (unit)|panda]]s (पांड, ''pāṇḍa'') or to 400&amp;nbsp;square [[kathy (unit)|kathy]]s (काठी, ''kāṭhī''), but also notes that it varies in different districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?page=336&amp;table=molesworth&amp;display=utf8 Molesworth (1857), p. 580].&lt;/ref&gt; The same author defines the kathy as "a land measure,—five cubits and five handbreadths […] also the measuring rod":&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?page=86&amp;table=molesworth&amp;display=utf8  Molesworth (1857), p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt; other authors are silent on the unit.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is a [[Nepal]]i unit of area called the [[kattha]] (कठ्ठा), approximately 338.57&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: this is implausibly large for the Marathi kathy, and there is no reason to assume that the two units are the same.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cubit]] is roughly equal to five [[Hand (unit)|handbreadths]], so the kathy can be taken to be roughly 25&amp;nbsp;square cubits: that is, 8100&amp;nbsp;square [[inch]]es or 6.25&amp;nbsp;square [[yard (unit)|yards]]. This would make the bigha roughly 2500&amp;nbsp;square yards, or half an [[acre]], in agreement with measurements in other areas of India. The candy, therefore, can be taken to be approximately 60&amp;nbsp;acres or 25&amp;nbsp;[[hectare]]s.

The celebrated Scottish orientalist [[Henry Yule|Sir Henry Yule]] gives a slightly larger value for the candy as a unit of area ("approximately 75&amp;nbsp;acres"), and describes it as the area of land which will produce one candy of grain.&lt;ref name="Yule" /&gt; The [[Telegu language|Telegu]] unit of the putty (పుట్టి, ''puṭṭi'') is also used in the same way: one putty of land is that area which will produce one putty of rice.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

== Unit of dry volume ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from within the article (#Unit_of_mass above) --&gt;
Several sources also describe the candy as a unit of [[dry measure]]. Again, it is difficult to give an accurate conversion to modern units, as most sources quote conversions to mass units for specific goods,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Prinsep (1840) goes as far as to assert that India had no true measures of dry volume, despite his description of the methods for determining the mass equivalent of dry measures (pp.&amp;nbsp;79–80).&lt;/ref&gt; and the few specific conversion factors that exist range from 8 to 25 [[bushel]]s.&lt;ref name="Yule" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AHH" /&gt; More plausible is that one candy of dry measure was the [[volume]] that would have been occupied by one candy (in mass) of water, that is about 254&amp;nbsp;litres (7&amp;nbsp;bushels) in Bombay (present-day [[Mumbai]]).
*One candy of "grain" (unspecified) in Bombay was recorded by Kelly as 8&amp;nbsp;[[parah (unit)|parahs]] or 358&amp;nbsp;lbs. 6&amp;nbsp;oz. 4&amp;nbsp;dr. (162.563&amp;nbsp;kg), compared to a standard Bombay candy of 560&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; (254.012&amp;nbsp;kg), a factor of 0.640. This factor is lower than the [[relative density]] of modern [[White rice|hulled rice]] (0.753) but higher than that of rough rice (0.577).&lt;ref name ="densities"&gt;{{citation | title = Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials | url = http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_materials.htm | publisher = SImetric.co.uk}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*One parah for salt measure for Bombay was reported as 1607.6&amp;nbsp;cubic [[inch]]es&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; (26.344&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]s), implying a candy for dry measure of salt as 210.8&amp;nbsp;litres: the factor (1.20, based on 254&amp;nbsp;litres for one candy of water) is identical to the relative density of caked salt.&lt;ref name ="densities" /&gt;
*The [[Ceylon]]ese standard parah was a cube of sides 11.57&amp;nbsp;inches, that is 25.41&amp;nbsp;litres.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authorlink=Robert Montgomery Martin| last=Martin | first=Robert Montgomery | title = History of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia... | url = https://books.google.com/?id=m-ouAAAAMAAJ | location = London | publisher = W. H. Allen &amp; Co. | year = 1843 | page = 396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Molesworth defines the Marathi palah (पल्ला, ''pallā'') as 120&amp;nbsp;[[seer (unit)|seers]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?page=280&amp;table=molesworth&amp;display=utf8 Molesworth (1857), p. 280].&lt;/ref&gt; implying a candy of 960&amp;nbsp;seers and a [[maund]] of 48&amp;nbsp;seers. The Bombay seer is given by Kelly as 11&amp;nbsp;oz. 3&amp;nbsp;dr.&lt;ref name="Prinsep84" /&gt; (317.2&amp;nbsp;g) for both grain and other commercial goods.

Not all grain measures in candies should be taken as dry measures. The [[United Nations]] Statistical Office reported that the candy was in use in the 20th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Statistical Office of the United Nations | title = World Weights and Measures. Handbook for Statisticians | id = ST/STAT/SER.M/21/rev.1 | location = New York | publisher = United Nations | year = 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*in east India for measuring [[rice]], with a value of approximately 210.636&amp;nbsp;kg compared to the old Madras standard candy of 226.796&amp;nbsp;kg;
*in Ceylon (later [[Sri Lanka]]) for measuring [[copra]], with a value of 560&amp;nbsp;lbs.
Both of these are obviously related to the candy as a unit of mass.

'''''Deploying Renewables 2011: Best and Future Policy Practice''''' is a 2011 book by the [[International Energy Agency]]. The book analyses the recent successes in [[renewable energy]], which now accounts for almost a fifth of all [[Electric energy consumption|electricity produced worldwide]], and addresses how countries can best capitalize on that growth to realise a [[sustainable energy]] future. The book says that [[renewable energy commercialization]] must be stepped up, especially given the world’s increasing appetite for energy and the need to meet this demand more efficiently and with low-carbon energy sources. [[Wind power]] and other [[renewable energy]] sources offer great potential to address issues of [[energy security]] and [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evwind.es/noticias.php?id_not=14883 |title=Renewables now fastest growing energy source |author= |date=November 27, 2011  |work=REVE }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/iea-book-offers-guidance-on-renewables-deployment/ |title=IEA Book Offers Guidance on Renewables Deployment |author= |year=2011 |work=Climate Change Policy and Practice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis updates and expands ''Deploying Renewables: Principles for Effective Policies'', published by the IEA in 2008, in light of events and trends in the last five years. It also "extends the analysis to a wider range of countries beyond the [[OECD]] and [[BRICS]] countries, focussing on 56 countries representative of each world region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/deployrenew2011SUM.pdf Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key findings==
[[Renewable energy commercialisation]] has been rapid. Growth rates are in line with those required for a sustainable energy future:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
• "The [[Renewable electricity|RE electricity]] sector, for example, has grown by 17.8% over the last five years (2005-09) and currently provides 19.3% of total power generation in the world."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
• "[[Hydropower|Hydro power]] is still the major source of renewable electricity (83.8% of RE generation, corresponding to about 16% of total generation in 2009), and the absolute growth in hydro generation over the last five years has been equivalent to that of all the other RE electricity technologies, mainly because of developments in China. Hydro will continue to be an important technology for years to come and must not be excluded from policy considerations." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
• "The other newer RE electricity technologies have also grown rapidly, by an impressive 73.6% between 2005 and 2009, a compound average growth rate ([[CAGR]]) of 14.8%. [[Wind power|Wind]] has grown most rapidly in absolute terms and has overtaken [[Biomass|bioenergy]]. [[Growth of photovoltaics|Solar PV has grown]] at a growth rate of 50.2% (CAGR), and installed capacity reached about 40 [[Gigawatt|GW]] by the end of 2010." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
• "Progress in RE electricity penetration was focused in the OECD and in Brazil, India and China. The OECD was the only region where the deployment of less mature technologies (such as [[Photovoltaic system|solar PV]], [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind]]) reached a significant scale, with capacities in the order of GWs." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
• "Renewable heat grew by 5.9% between 2005 and 2009. Although the use of biomass is still the dominant technology (and includes the use of “traditional” biomass with low efficiency for heating and cooking), growth in [[Solar thermal collector|solar heating]], and to a lesser extent [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] heating technologies, has been strong, with an overall growth rate of nearly 12% between 2005 and 2009. Growth was particularly driven by rapid increases in solar heating in China." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
• "The production and use of [[biofuel]]s have been growing rapidly, and in 2009 they provided 53.7 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]], equivalent to some 3% of road transport fuels (or 2% of all transport fuels). The biofuels sector has been growing very rapidly (26% CAGR in 2005-09). Biofuels production and consumption are still concentrated in Brazil, the United States and in the European Union. The main centres for [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] production and consumption are the United States and Brazil, while Europe produces and consumes mainly [[biodiesel]]. The remaining markets in other regions and the rest of the world account for only 6% of total production and for 3.3% of consumption. Trade in biofuels plays a limited, yet increasingly important role."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">'''Ingénieurs sans Frontières - Ingénieurs Assistance Internationale''' (ISF-IAI, more commonly known as ISF, Belgium) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[NGO]] assisting developing areas of the world with their engineering needs and whose fundamental purpose is to adapt technological development to the needs of those living in underprivileged areas.

== Overview ==

It should not be confused with [[Ingenieurs zonder Grenzen]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "Engineers Without Borders").

Founded on the initiative of a few engineers and with the support of the Associations of Schools for Engineers ([[FABI]]), ISF can count on the contribution of several hundred volunteers: engineers with varying qualifications and students willing to put their time and skills at the disposal of development projects.

Thanks to many contacts in both professional and associative environment, ISF can seek advice from engineers and technicians on specific problems in every sector of technology. All ISF work is done on a voluntary basis.

ISF, looking for collaboration with other Belgian NGOs, has formed the CHAKA group with CODEART and ADG, both Belgian associations. ISF is also a member of the Federation of the French and German speaking NGOs of Belgium (ACODEV) and is approved by the General Directorate for International Cooperation of the Belgian Federal Government (DGCI).

ISF is also a member of EWB-International ([[Engineers Without Borders]] International Network)

A '''generation II reactor''' is a design classification for a [[nuclear reactor]], and refers to the class of commercial reactors built up to the end of the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Jamasb" /&gt;  Prototypical generation II reactors include the [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]], [[CANada Deuterium Uranium|CANDU]], [[Boiling Water Reactor|BWR]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]], [[VVER]]&lt;ref name="Jamasb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jamasb|first=Tooraj |author2=William J.

These are contrasted to '''generation I''' reactors, which refer to the early prototype of power reactors, such as [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station|Shippingport]], [[Magnox]]/[[UNGG]], [[Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station|AMB]], [[Fermi 1]], and [[Dresden Generating Station|Dresden 1]].&lt;ref name="Jamasb" /&gt; The last commercial Gen I power reactor was located at the [[Wylfa Nuclear Power Station]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amacad.org/pdfs/nuclearreactors.pdf |title=Nuclear Reactors: Generation to Generation |author=Stephen M.

The nomenclature for reactor designs, describing four 'generations', was proposed by the US Department of Energy when it introduced the concept of [[generation IV reactor]]s.

The designation ''generation II+ reactor'' is sometimes used for modernized generation II designs built post-2000, such as the Chinese [[CPR-1000]], in competition with more expensive [[generation III reactor]] designs. Typically, the modernization includes improved safety systems and a 60-year design life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Generation II reactor designs generally had an original design life of 30 or 40 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} This date was set as the period over which loans taken out for the plant would be paid off. However, many generation II reactor are being life-extended to 50 or 60 years, and a second life-extension to 80 years may also be economic in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2057693 |title=No reason why NPPs cannot live beyond 60 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613091957/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2057693 |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 about 75% of still operating U.S. reactors had been granted life extension licenses to 60 years.&lt;ref name=wnn-20131219&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C_Renewal_a_bridge_to_replacement_1912131.html |title=Renewal a bridge to replacement |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Daiichi]]'s three destroyed reactors are Mark I Boiling water reactors (BWR) designed by [[General Electric]].
In 2016, unit 2 at the [[Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station]] came online and is likely to be the last generation II reactor to become operational in the [[United States]].

==Characteristics==

===Ballerina's skirt shape===
[[File:Parker spiral.gif|thumb|right|300px|The Parker Spiral]]

As the Sun rotates, its magnetic field twists into a Parker spiral, a form of an [[Archimedean spiral]], as it extends through the solar system. This phenomenon is named after [[Eugene Parker]]'s work:&lt;ref name="parker1958"&gt;Parker, E. N., "[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1958ApJ...128..664P Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields]", (1958) ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol. 128, p.664&lt;/ref&gt; he predicted the solar wind and many of its associated phenomena in the 1950s.
The spiral nature of the heliospheric magnetic field had been noted earlier by [[Hannes Alfvén]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957Tell....9...92A On the theory of comet tails]", H. Alfv&amp;eacute;n, Tellus 9, 92, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the structure of comet tails.

The influence of this spiral-shaped magnetic field on the [[interplanetary medium]] ([[solar wind]]) creates the largest structure in the Solar System, the heliospheric current sheet.
Parker's spiral magnetic field was divided in two by a [[current sheet]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v264/n5588/abs/264730a0.html;jsessionid=55DC5F768647B390C384E7AF83122081 Current Sheet Magnetic Model for the Solar Corona]", K. H. Schatten, Cosmic Electrodynamics, 2, 232-245, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematical model first developed in the early 1970s by Schatten. It warps into a wavy spiral shape that has been likened to a ballerina's skirt.&lt;ref name="rosenberg1969"&gt;Rosenberg, R. L. and P. J. Coleman, Jr., Heliographic latitude dependence of the dominant polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field, ''J. Geophys. Res.'', 74 (24), 5611-5622, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilcox1980"&gt;Wilcox, J. M.; Scherrer, P. H.; Hoeksema, J. T., "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1980STIN...8133113W&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c12139 The origin of the warped heliospheric current sheet]" (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The waviness of the current sheet is because of the magnetic field dipole axis' tilt angle to the solar rotation axis and variations from an ideal dipole field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owens|first1=M. J.|last2=Forsyth|first2=R. J.|title=The Heliospheric Magnetic Field|journal=Living Reviews in Solar Physics|date=2013|volume=10|issue=1|page=11|doi=10.12942/lrsp-2013-5|bibcode = 2013LRSP...10....5O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the familiar shape of the field from a bar [[magnet]], the Sun's extended field is twisted into an [[arithmetic spiral]] by the [[magnetohydrodynamic]] influence of the [[solar wind]]. The [[solar wind]] travels outward from the Sun at a uniform rate, but an individual jet of solar wind from a particular feature on the Sun's surface rotates with the [[solar rotation]], making a spiral pattern in space. Unlike the jet from a sprinkler, the solar wind is tied to the [[magnetic field]] by [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] effects, so that magnetic field lines are tied to the material in the jet and take on an arithmetic spiral shape.
The cause of the ballerina spiral shape has sometimes been called the "garden sprinkler effect" or "garden hose effect",&lt;ref name="Louise K. Harra 2004"&gt;Louise K. Harra, Keith O. Mason, ''Space Science'' 2004, Imperial College Press, {{ISBN|1-86094-361-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov"&gt;Smith, E., "[http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/handle/2014/18860?mode=simple The Sun, Solar Wind, and Magnetic Field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205054035/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/handle/2014/18860?mode=simple |date=2008-02-05 }}", Jul 1999, Proceedings of the International School of Physics Enrico FERMI Varenna, Italy&lt;/ref&gt; because it is likened to a [[irrigation sprinkler|lawn sprinkler]] with nozzle that moves up and down while it spins. The stream of water represents the solar wind.

The Parker spiral shape of the solar wind changes the shape of the Sun's magnetic field in the outer solar system: beyond about 10-20 [[astronomical units]] from the Sun, the magnetic field is nearly [[toroid (geometry)|toroid]]al (pointed around the equator of the Sun) rather than [[poloidal]] (pointed from the North to the South pole, as in a bar magnet) or [[wikt:radial|radial]] (pointed outward or inward, as might be expected from the flow of the solar wind if the Sun were not rotating).  The spiral shape also greatly amplifies the strength of the solar magnetic field in the outer solar system.

The Parker spiral may be responsible for the differential [[solar rotation]], in which the Sun's poles rotate more slowly (about a 35-day rotation period) than the equator (about a 27-day rotation period).  The solar wind is guided by the Sun's magnetic field and hence largely emanates from the polar regions of the Sun; the induced spiral shape of the field causes a drag torque on the poles due to the [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] force.

During [[solar maximum]] the entire magnetic field of the sun flips, thus alternating the polarity of the field every solar cycle.&lt;ref name="nasaSolarmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/solarmag.html|title=NASA's Cosmicopia -- Sun -- Sun's Magnetic Field|first=Beth|last=Barbier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetic field ===

The heliospheric current sheet rotates along with the Sun with a period of about 25 days, during which time the peaks and troughs of the skirt pass through the Earth's magnetosphere, interacting with it. Near the surface of the Sun, the magnetic field produced by the radial electric current in the sheet is of the order of 5×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; T.&lt;ref name="israelevich2001" /&gt;

The magnetic field at the surface of the Sun is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]. If the form of the field were a [[magnetic dipole]], the strength would decrease with the cube of the distance, resulting in about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; teslas at the Earth's orbit. The heliospheric current sheet results in higher order multipole components so that the actual magnetic field at the Earth due to the Sun is 100 times greater.

===Electric current===

The electric current in the heliospheric current sheet has a radial component (directed inward) as well as an [[azimuthal]] component, the radial circuit being closed by outward currents aligned with the Sun's magnetic field in the solar polar regions. The radial current in the circuit is on the order of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[ampere]]s.&lt;ref name="israelevich2001" /&gt; As a comparison with other astrophysical electric currents, the [[Birkeland current]]s that supply the Earth's [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] are about a thousand times weaker at a million amperes. The maximum current density in the sheet is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; A/m² (10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; A/km²).

==History==

The heliospheric current sheet was discovered by [[John M. Wilcox]] and [[Norman F.

A hybrid biological reactor (HBR) was developed which involved the introduction of a new phase of attached-biomass into a regular suspended-growth  system (activated sludge process) by addition of carriers to

the aeration tanks. A novel hybrid biological reactor which contained both suspended and attached-growth biomass was developed by introducing porous materials into a regular activated sludge unit and used for the treatment of domestic wastewater.  
:''See [[Hybrid nuclear fusion]] for the proposed nuclear reactor.''

A '''hybrid reactor''' is an [[anaerobic digester]] that combines a [[UASB]] reactor with an [[anaerobic filter]]. This combination is an advanced form enabling improved solid retention time in the treatment of waste water. This waste water can be built up in the secondary chamber and must be removed daily or an explosion is imminent to occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9887">'''I-III-VI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; semiconductors''' are solid [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] materials that contain three or more [[chemical element]]s belonging to [[Group (periodic table)|groups I, III and VI]] of the [[periodic table]]. They usually involve two [[metal]]s and one [[chalcogen]]. Some of these materials have a [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct bandgap]], E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, of ~ 1.5 eV, which makes them efficient absorbers of sunlight and thus potential [[solar cell]] materials. A fourth element is often added to a I-III-VI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material to tune the bandgap for maximum [[solar cell efficiency]]. A representative example is [[copper indium gallium selenide]] (CuIn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;(1–x)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.7–1.0 eV for x = 0–1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/pssa.2211240206|bibcode=1991PSSAR.124..427T| title = Phase Diagram and Optical Energy Gaps for CuIn&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−y&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Alloys| journal = Physica Status Solidi A| volume = 124| issue = 2| pages = 427–434| year = 1991| last1 = Tinoco | first1 = T.| last2 = Rincón | first2 = C.| last3 = Quintero | first3 = M.| last4 = Pérez | first4 = G.

The right inset shows the [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for the efficiency of a single-junction solar cell under unconcentrated sunlight.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;]]

==CuGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;==
CuGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exists in two main [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], α and β. The α form has the [[delafossite]] crystal structure and can be prepared by reacting [[Copper(I) oxide|Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] with [[Gallium(III) oxide|Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] at high temperatures. The β form has a [[wurtzite]]-like crystal structure ([[space group]] Pna2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;); it is metastable, but exhibits a long-term stability at temperatures below 300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ic502659e|pmid=25651414| title = Structural and Thermal Properties of Ternary Narrow-Gap Oxide Semiconductor; Wurtzite-Derived β-CuGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| journal = Inorganic Chemistry| volume = 54| issue = 4| pages = 1698–704| year = 2015| last1 = Nagatani | first1 = H.| last2 = Suzuki | first2 = I.| last3 = Kita | first3 = M.| last4 = Tanaka | first4 = M.| last5 = Katsuya | first5 = Y.| last6 = Sakata | first6 = O.| last7 = Miyoshi | first7 = S.| last8 = Yamaguchi | first8 = S.| last9 = Omata | first9 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be obtained by an [[ion exchange]] of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in a β-NaGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor with Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in [[Copper(I) chloride|CuCl]] under vacuum, to avoid the oxidation of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/16/2/024902| title = Wurtzite-derived ternary I–III–O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; semiconductors| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 16| issue = 2| pages = 024902| year = 2015| last1 = Omata | first1 = T. | last2 = Nagatani | first2 = H. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = I. | last4 = Kita | first4 = M. |bibcode = 2015STAdM..16b4902O |pmid=27877769|pmc=5036475}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most I-III-VI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[oxide]]s, which are transparent, electrically insulating solids with a bandgap above 2 eV, β-CuGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a direct bandgap of 1.47 eV, which is favorable for solar cell applications. In contrast, β-AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and β-AgAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have an indirect bandgap. Undoped β-CuGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[p-type semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AgAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;==
[[File:beta-AgGaO2-bandgap.png|thumb|Bandgap in AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZnO and CdO-ZnO alloys.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;]]
Similarly to CuGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, α-AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and α-AgAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have the [[delafossite]] crystal structure while the structure of the corresponding β phases is similar to wurtzite ([[space group]] Pna2a). β-AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is metastable and can be synthesized by ion exchange with a β-NaGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor. The bandgaps of β-AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and β-AgAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.2 and 2.8 eV respectively) are indirect; they fall into the visible range and can be tuned by alloying with [[zinc oxide|ZnO]]. For this reason, both materials are hardly suitable for solar cells, but have potential applications in [[photocatalysis]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Contrary to LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can not be alloyed with ZnO by heating their mixture because of the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction to metallic silver; therefore, [[magnetron sputtering]] of AgGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnO targets is used instead.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;==
[[File:beta-LiGaO2-bandgap.png|thumb|Bandgap in LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZnO alloys.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;]]
Pure single crystals of β-LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a length of several inches can be grown by the [[Czochralski method]]. Their cleaved surfaces have lattice constants that match those of ZnO and [[gallium nitride|GaN]] and are therefore suitable for [[epitaxy|epitaxial growth]] of thin films of those materials. β-LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a potential [[nonlinear optics]] material, but its direct bandgap of 5.6 eV is too wide for visible light applications. It can be reduced down to 3.2 eV by alloying β-LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ZnO. The bandgap tuning is discontinuous because ZnO and β-LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; do not mix but form a Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;LiGaO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; phase when their ratio is between ca. 0.2 and 1.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">An '''interstitial compound''', or '''interstitial alloy''', is a compound that is formed when an atom with a small enough radius sits in an interstitial “hole” in a metal [[Crystal system|lattice]]. Examples of small atoms are [[hydrogen]], [[boron]], [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The compounds are important industrially and include some [[transition-metal]] [[carbides]] and [[nitrides]].

==History==
The idea of interstitial compounds was started in the late 1930s and they are often called Hagg phases after Hägg.&lt;ref&gt;Wells 56486 (1962) ''Structural Inorganic Chemistry'' 3rd edition, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Transition metals generally crystallise in either the [[close packing|hexagonal close packed]] or [[cubic crystal system|face centered cubic]] structures, both of which can be considered to be made up of layers of hexagonally close packed atoms. In both of these very similar lattices there are two sorts of interstice, or hole:
*2 tetrahedral holes per metal atom, i.e. the hole is between four metal atoms
*1 octahedral hole per metal atom, i.e. the hole is between six metal atoms

It was suggested by early workers that:
*the metal lattice was relatively unaffected by the interstitial atom 
*the electrical conductivity was comparable to that of the pure metal
*there was a range of composition
*the type of interstice occupied was determined by the size of the atom

These were not viewed as compounds, but rather as solutions, of say carbon, in the metal lattice, with a limiting upper “concentration” of the smaller atom that was determined by the number of interstices available.

==Current== 
A more detailed knowledge of the structures of metals, and binary and ternary phases of metals and non metals shows that:
*generally at low concentrations of the small atom, the phase can be described as a solution, and this approximates to the historical description of an interstitial compound above.
*at higher concentrations of the small atom, phases with different lattice structures may be present, and these may have a range of [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometries]].

One example is the solubility of [[carbon]] in iron. The form of pure iron stable between 910&amp;nbsp;°C and 1390&amp;nbsp;°C, γ-iron, forms a [[solid solution]] with [[carbon]] termed [[austenite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46098">There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with [[biofuel]] production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], effect on [[water resources]], the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and efficiency. The [[International Resource Panel]], which provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of resource-related themes, assessed the issues relating to biofuel use in its first report ''Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing Biofuels''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing Biofuels] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513215416/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=2016-05-13 }}, 2009, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; In it, it outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another. It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their effect on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social effects need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.

==Social and economic effects==

===Oil price moderation===
The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''[[World Energy Outlook]] 2006'' concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. The report suggested that biofuels may one day offer a viable alternative, but also that "the implications of the use of biofuels for global security as well as for economic, environmental, and public health need to be further evaluated".&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite book | title=World Energy Outlook 2006 | publisher=IEA | author=various | year=2006 | pages=596 | url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist for [[Merrill Lynch]], crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.climateark.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=95429 |title=As Biofuels Catch On, Next Task Is to Deal With Environmental, Economic Impact |access-date=2008-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725181039/http://www.climateark.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=95429 |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Quaiattini, president of the [[Canadian Renewable Fuels Association]], argued that a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=e08c8e19-4a95-491c-9386-d30afeab5cdf&amp;sponsor= | title=Biofuels are part of the solution | publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | date=April 25, 2008 | accessdate=October 12, 2012 | author=Quaiattini, Gordon }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Food vs. fuel" debate===
{{Main article|Food vs fuel}}
''Food vs fuel'' is the debate regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production in detriment of the [[food supply]] on a global scale. Essentially the debate refers to the possibility that by farmers increasing their production of these crops, often through government subsidy incentives, their time and land is shifted away from other types of non-biofuel crops driving up the price of non-biofuel crops due to the decrease in production.&lt;ref name="babcock"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf The Impact of US Biofuel Policies on Agricultural Price Levels and Volatility], By Bruce A. Babcock, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University, for [[ICTSD]], Issue Paper No. 35. June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is not only that there is an increase in demand for the food staples, like corn and cassava, that sustain the majority of the world's poor but this also has the potential to increase the price of the remaining crops that these individuals would otherwise need to utilize to supplement their diets. A recent study for the [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development]] shows that market-driven expansion of [[ethanol]] in the US increased maize prices by 21 percent in 2009, in comparison with what prices would have been had ethanol production been frozen at 2004 levels.&lt;ref name="babcock" /&gt; A November 2011 study states that biofuels, their production, and their subsidies are leading causes of agricultural price shocks.&lt;ref&gt;"Even the U.N. Hates Ethanol." ''Wall Street Journal'', 14 June 2011, A14.&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-argument includes considerations of the type of corn that is utilized in biofuels, often field corn not suitable for human consumption; the portion of the corn that is used in ethanol, the starch portion; and the negative effect higher prices for corn and grains have on government welfare for these products.  The "food vs. fuel" or "food or fuel" debate is internationally controversial, with disagreement about how significant this is, what is causing it, what the effect is, and what can or should be done about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechlawandbusiness.com/cleanbeta/index.php/1608/biofuels-are-not-to-blame-for-high-food-prices-study-finds |title=Biofuels are not to blame for high food prices, study finds |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106190002/http://cleantechlawandbusiness.com/cleanbeta/index.php/1608/biofuels-are-not-to-blame-for-high-food-prices-study-finds |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7026105.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Will biofuel leave the poor hungry?|author=Maggie Ayre |date=2007-10-03|language=|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farmfutures.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=CD26BEDECA4A4946A1283CC7786AEB5A&amp;nm=News&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=BA3B97B230724D7C904E54CB50E9E9B5 |title=The Biofuel Smear Campaign |publisher=Farm Futures |author=Mike Wilson |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2008-04-28 |language= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1725975,00.html|title=The Clean Energy Scam|publisher=Time Magazine|author=Michael Grundwald|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty reduction===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have argued that biofuels could help to reduce poverty in the developing world, through increased [[employment]], wider [[economic growth]] multipliers and by stabilising oil prices (many developing countries are net importers of oil).&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Leturque, Henri and Wiggins, Steve (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2524&amp;title=biofuels-food-prices-south Biofuels: Could the South benefit?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this potential is described as 'fragile', and is reduced where feedstock production tends to be large scale, or causes pressure on limited agricultural resources: capital investment, land, water, and the net cost of food for the poor.

With regards to the potential for poverty reduction or exacerbation, biofuels rely on many of the same policy, regulatory or investment shortcomings that impede [[agriculture]] as a route to [[poverty reduction]]. Since many of these shortcomings require policy improvements at a country level rather than a global one, they argue for a country-by-country analysis of the potential poverty effects of biofuels. This would consider, among other things, land administration systems, market coordination and prioritizing investment in [[biodiesel]], as this 'generates more labour, has lower transportation costs and uses simpler technology'.&lt;ref name="biofuelsandpovreduction"&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=78&amp;title=biofuels-agriculture-poverty-reduction Biofuels, Agriculture and Poverty Reduction] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also necessary are reductions in the tariffs on biofuel imports regardless of the country of origin, especially due to the increased efficiency of biofuel production in countries such as Brazil.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Sustainable biofuel production===
{{Main article|Sustainable biofuel}}
Responsible policies and economic instruments would help to ensure that biofuel commercialization, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], is [[sustainable]].   Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

==Environmental effects==
{{see also|Environmental impact of biodiesel}}

===Soil erosion and deforestation===
Large-scale [[deforestation]] of mature trees (which help remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through [[photosynthesis]] — much better than [[sugar cane]] or most other biofuel feedstock crops do) contributes to [[soil erosion]], un-[[sustainable]] [[global warming]] atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]] levels, loss of [[habitat]], and a reduction of valuable [[biodiversity]] (both on land as in [[Dead zone (ecology)|oceans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icesjms/fsp047 |title=Global change and eutrophication of coastal waters |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=1528–37 |year=2009 |last1=Rabalais |first1=N.

A portion of the biomass should be retained onsite to support the soil resource.  Normally this will be in the form of raw biomass, but processed biomass is also an option.  If the exported biomass is used to produce [[syngas]], the process can be used to co-produce [[biochar]], a low-temperature charcoal used as a soil amendment to increase [[soil organic matter]] to a degree not practical with less recalcitrant forms of organic carbon. For co-production of biochar to be widely adopted, the soil amendment and carbon sequestration value of co-produced charcoal must exceed its net value as a source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/(xquef445kynlbt3pti5kdsr0)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,3,14;journal,5,231;linkingpublicationresults,1:102022,1]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Prehistorically modified soils of central Amazonia: a model for sustainable agriculture in the twenty-first century", by Bruno Glaser at the Institute of Soil Science and Soil Geography, University of Bayreuth (see the [http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ "Terra Preta Web Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170240/http://www.geo.uni-bayreuth.de/bodenkunde/terra_preta/ |date=2005-10-25 }}).

Some commentators claim that removal of additional cellulosic biomass for biofuel production will further deplete soils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1] "Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America", by Alice Friedemann, April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on water resources ===

Increased use of biofuels puts increasing pressure on water resources in at least two ways: water use for the irrigation of crops used as feedstocks for biodiesel production; and water use in the production of biofuels in refineries, mostly for boiling and cooling.

In many parts of the world supplemental or full irrigation is needed to grow feedstocks. For example, if in the production of corn (maize) half the water needs of crops are met through irrigation and the other half through rainfall, about 860 liters of water are needed to produce one liter of ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;To calculate this relationship, one has to take into account that irrigated corn needs about 560 cubic meters (2.1m gallons) of water per ton of corn (as quoted in [http://www.ecoworld.com/blog/2007/06/04/corn-ethanol-water/ Eco-World. Ed Ring:Is bio-fuel water positive? June 4, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924022648/http://ecoworld.com/blog/2007/06/04/corn-ethanol-water/ |date=September 24, 2008 }} using estimates from the University of Colorado and UNESCO, as well as a clarification by David Nielsen, Research Agronomist, USDA-ARS, Akron, Colorado, posted on July 19, 2007.) A good ethanol yield is about 480 gallons per acre per year, and a typical corn yield is 5.6 tons per acre per year. Assuming that half the crop water needs can be met through rainfall, this would mean that still 1,570 cubic meter (1.57m liter) - 280 cubic meter of water per ton, multiplied by 5.6 tons per acre - of irrigation water are needed per acre per year to produce 1,817 liter (480 gallons) of ethanol.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States only 5-15% of the water required for corn comes from irrigation while the other 85-95% comes from natural rainfall.

In the United States, the number of ethanol factories has almost tripled from 50 in 2000 to about 140 in 2008. A further 60 or so are under construction, and many more are planned. Projects are being challenged by residents at courts in Missouri (where water is drawn from the [[Ozark Aquifer]]), Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas (all of which draw water from the non-renewable [[Ogallala Aquifer]]), central Illinois (where water is drawn from the [[Mahomet Aquifer]]) and Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, March 1, 2008, Ethanol and water: don't mix, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the four ethanol crops: corn, sugarcane, sweet sorghum and pine yield net energy. However, increasing production in order to meet the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act mandates for renewable fuels by 2022 would take a heavy toll in the states of Florida and Georgia.  The sweet sorghum, which performed the best of the four, would increase the amount of freshwater withdrawals from the two states by almost 25%.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Cynthia. "Fueling worries: four ethanol crops under consideration in Florida are very thirsty.(NATURAL RESOURCES)." Florida Trend 52.4 (July 2009): 18(1). General OneFile. Gale. BENTLEY UPPER SCHOOL LIBRARY (BAISL). 6 Oct. 2009

===Pollution===
[[Formaldehyde]], [[acetaldehyde]] and other [[aldehydes]] are produced when alcohols are [[oxidized]]. When only a 10% mixture of ethanol is added to gasoline (as is common in American [[E10 fuel|E10]] [[gasohol]] and elsewhere), aldehyde emissions increase 40%. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Some study results are conflicting on this fact however, and lowering the sulfur content of biofuel mixes lowers the acetaldehyde levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/32206.pdf Issues Associated with the Use of Higher Ethanol Blends (E17-E24)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Burning biodiesel also emits aldehydes and other potentially hazardous aromatic compounds which are not regulated in emissions laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/reportsdatabase/reports/gen/19950101_gen-217.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aldehydes are toxic to living cells. Formaldehyde irreversibly cross-links [[protein]] [[amino acids]], which produces the hard flesh of embalmed bodies. At high concentrations in an enclosed space, formaldehyde can be a significant respiratory irritant causing nose bleeds, respiratory distress, lung disease, and persistent headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23168160/ CDC tests confirm FEMA units are toxic - Life - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Acetaldehyde, which is produced in the body by alcohol drinkers and found in the mouths of smokers and those with poor oral hygiene, is carcinogenic and [[mutagenic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sge-ssn.ch/science/scientific_publications/ssn_publications/alcool_and_health/documents/abstract_seitz.pdf Symposium &amp;#171;Alcohol and Health: an Update&amp;#187;, June 15, 2005, Abstract of H. K. Seitz, Departement of Medicine, Salem Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819214206/http://www.sge-ssn.ch/science/scientific_publications/ssn_publications/alcool_and_health/documents/abstract_seitz.pdf |date=August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has banned products that contain [[Formaldehyde]], due to its documented [[carcinogenic]] characteristics. The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] has labeled Formaldehyde as a probable cause of cancer in humans.

Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1352-2310(01)00136-4 |title=Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in Sao Paulo, Brazil |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=35 |issue=18 |pages=3075–83 |year=2001 |last1=Nguyen |first1=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical issues==

=== Energy efficiency and energy balance ===
Despite its occasional proclamation as a “green” fuel, first-generation biofuels, primarily ethanol, are not without their own GHG emissions. While ethanol does produce fewer overall GHG emissions than gasoline, its production is still an energy intensive process with secondary effects. Gasoline generally produces 8.91&amp;nbsp;kg CO2 per gallon, compared to 8.02&amp;nbsp;kg CO2 per gallon for E10 ethanol and 1.34&amp;nbsp;kg CO2 per gallon for E85 ethanol. Based on a study by Dias de Oliveira et al. (2005), corn-based ethanol requires 65.02 gigajoules (GJ) of energy per hectare (ha) and produces approximately 1236.72&amp;nbsp;kg per ha of carbon dioxide (CO2), while sugar cane-based ethanol requires 42.43 GJ/ha and produces 2268.26&amp;nbsp;kg/ha of CO2 under the assumption of non-carbon neutral energy production.  These emissions accrue from agricultural production, crop cultivation, and ethanol processing. Once the ethanol is blended with gasoline, it results in carbon-savings of approximately 0.89&amp;nbsp;kg of CO2 per gallon consumed (U.S. D.O.E., 2011a).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Anthony Gokianluy et al,. "A Cost And Benefit, Case Study Analysis Of Biofuels Systems". ''Harvard College Review of Environment and Society''. N.p., 2016. Web. 26 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic viability ===
From a production standpoint, miscanthus can produce 742 gallons of ethanol per acre of land, which is nearly twice as much as corn (399 gal/acre, assuming average yield of 145 bushels per acre under normal corn-soybean rotation) and nearly three times as much as corn stover (165 gal/acre) and switchgrass (214 gal/acre). Production costs are a big impediment to large-scale implementation of 2nd Generation bio-fuels, and their market demand will depend primarily on their price competitiveness relative to corn ethanol and gasoline. At this time, costs of conversion of cellulosic fuels, at $1.46 per gallon, were roughly twice that of corn-based ethanol, at $0.78 per gallon. Cellulosic biofuels from corn stover and miscanthus were 24% and 29% more expensive than corn ethanol, respectively, and switchgrass biofuel is more than twice as expensive as corn ethanol.

Biofuels and other forms of [[renewable energy]] aim to be [[carbon neutral]] or even carbon negative. Carbon neutral means that the carbon released during the use of the fuel, e.g. through burning to power transport or generate electricity, is reabsorbed and balanced by the carbon absorbed by new plant growth. These plants are then harvested to make the next batch of fuel. Carbon neutral fuels lead to no net increases in human contributions to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] levels, reducing the human contributions to [[global warming]]. A carbon negative aim is achieved when a portion of the biomass is used for [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref name="eprida04"&gt;[http://www.eprida.com/hydro/yahoo2004.htm] "Carbon negative energy to reverse global warming" (a posting to Energy Resources Group on Yahoo).

The carbon emissions ([[carbon footprint]]) produced by biofuels are calculated using a technique called [[Life Cycle Analysis]] (LCA). This uses a "cradle to grave" or "well to wheels" approach to calculate the total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted during biofuel production, from putting seed in the ground to using the fuel in cars and trucks. Many different LCAs have been done for different biofuels, with widely differing results. Several [[Life cycle assessment|well-to-wheel]] analysis for biofuels has shown that first generation biofuels can reduce carbon emissions, with savings depending on the feedstock used, and second generation biofuels can produce even higher savings when compared to using fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Wang2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/375.pdf|format=PDF|title=Updated Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emission Results of Fuel Ethanol |author=Michael Wang|publisher=Center for Transportation Research, [[Argonne National Laboratory]]|accessdate=2009-06-07}} ''Presented at the 15th [[International Symposium on Alcohol Fuels]], San Diego, California''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USEthanol&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Goettemoeller, Jeffrey |author2=Adrian Goettemoeller | title = Sustainable Ethanol: Biofuels, Biorefineries, Cellulosic Biomass, Flex-Fuel Vehicles, and Sustainable Farming for Energy Independence | year = 2007| publisher = Prairie Oak Publishing, Maryville, Missouri |pages=40–41 |language= | isbn = 0-9786293-0-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sperling, Daniel  |author2=Deborah Gordon | title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability | year = 2009 | pages= 98–99 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], New York | isbn = 0-19-537664-1}} ''For more detail see also the Notes 27 and 28 for Chapter 4, pp. 272''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/wtw.html Concawe European WTW study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207180809/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/wtw.html |date=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b822951c |author1=Oliver R.

Additionally the study showed that fossil fuels are not reduced when CTO is diverted to biofuel use and the substitute products consume disproportionately more energy.  This diversion will negatively affect an industry that contributes significantly to the world economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.pinechemicals.org/resource/collection/B1A5F7B5-8611-4EA8-BC9F-3E01A6F4F87B/ACC...Economic_Benefits_of_Pine_Chemicals_Industry_-_Dec12011_(2).pdf | format=PDF|title= The Economic Benefits of the Pine Chemicals Industry |publisher= American Chemistry Council |date= December 2011|accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; globally producing more than 3 billion pounds of pine chemicals annually in complex, high technology refineries and providing jobs directly and indirectly for tens of thousands of workers.

A paper published in February 2008 in [[Science (journal)|Sciencexpress]] by a team led by Searchinger from [[Princeton University]] concluded that once considered indirect land use changes effects in the [[life cycle assessment]] of biofuels used to substitute gasoline, instead of savings both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively.&lt;ref name=Searchinger0208&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1151861|title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change|author1=Timothy Searchinger |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.

===Engine design===
The modifications necessary to run internal combustion engines on biofuel depend on the type of biofuel used, as well as the type of engine used. For example, gasoline engines can run without any modification at all on [[biobutanol]]. Minor modifications are however needed to run on [[bioethanol]] or [[biomethanol]]. Diesel engines can run on the latter fuels, as well as on [[vegetable oil]]s (which are cheaper). However, the latter is only possible when the engine has been foreseen with [[indirect injection]]. If no indirect injection is present, the engine hence needs to be fitted with this.

==Campaigns==
A number of environmental NGOs campaign against the production of biofuels as a large-scale alternative to fossil fuels. For example, [[Friends of the Earth]] state that "the current rush to develop agrofuels (or biofuels) on a large scale is ill-conceived and will contribute to an already unsustainable trade whilst not solving the problems of climate change or energy security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/fuelling_or_fooling_europe.pdf |format=PDF|title= Friends of the Earth: Fueling or Fooling Europe}}February 2008 Retrieved November 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Some mainstream environmental groups support biofuels as a significant step toward slowing or stopping global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_position_eu_biofuels.pdf |format=PDF|title= WWF Position on Biofuels in the EU}}July 2007 Retrieved November 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/biofuels.asp |title= Move Over, Gasoline: Here Come Biofuels}}June 19, 2007 Retrieved November 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, supportive environmental groups generally hold the view that biofuel production can threaten the environment if it is not done sustainably. This finding has been backed by reports of the [[UN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/08/europe/EU-GEN-UN-Biofuels.php |title= U.N. raises possible negative impact of biofuels on environment, food security}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnp.nl/ipcc/ IPCC's Mitigation of Climate Change report negative on biofuels].&lt;/ref&gt; and some other smaller environmental and social groups as the [[European Environmental Bureau|EEB]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf Biofuels no panacea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052938/http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }} (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bank Sarasin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/2073.html Biofuels — Transporting Us to a Fossil-Free Future?].&lt;/ref&gt; which generally remain negative about biofuels.

As a result, governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/sustainablelorgbiofuel@sustainablelists.org/msg70965.html Governmental (OECD) organizations against unsustainable biofuels].&lt;/ref&gt; and environmental organizations are turning against biofuels made in a non-sustainable way (hereby preferring certain oil sources as [[jatropha]] and [[Cellulosic ethanol|lignocellulose]] over [[palm oil]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange2007/story/0,,2111985,00.html Friends of the Earth, Oxfam, ... preferring jatropha over palm oil].&lt;/ref&gt; and are asking for global support for this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/full6.asp?foldername=20060715&amp;filename=news&amp;sec_id=49&amp;sid=59 Environmental organizations against non-sustainable biofuels 1] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080119033803/http://www.downtoearth.org.in/full6.asp?foldername=20060715&amp;filename=news&amp;sec_id=49&amp;sid=59 |date=2008-01-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/Energy/ceo-press.07-09-21 Environmental organizations against non-sustainable biofuels 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830074101/http://www.eubusiness.com/Energy/ceo-press.07-09-21 |date=2008-08-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, besides supporting these more sustainable biofuels, environmental organizations are redirecting to new technologies that do not use [[internal combustion engine]]s such as [[Zero emission#Zero emission engines|hydrogen and compressed air]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zerocarbonnow.org/ Zero Carbon Environmental Organization].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several standard-setting and certification initiatives have been set up on the topic of biofuels. The "Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels" is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable is developing a series of principles and criteria for [[sustainable biofuel]]s production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgse.epfl.ch/page65660.html The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels: Ensuring Biofuels Deliver on their Promise of Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the [[Bonsucro]] standard has been developed as a metric-based certificate for products and supply chains, as a result of an ongoing multi-stakeholder initiative focussing on the products of [[sugar cane]], including ethanol fuel.&lt;ref name="BonsucroGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonsucro.com/site/a-guide-to-bonsucro/ |title=A guide to Bonsucro |publisher=Bonsucro | accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased manufacture of biofuels will require increasing land areas to be used for agriculture. Second and third generation biofuel processes can ease the pressure on land, because they can use waste biomass, and existing (untapped) sources of biomass such as crop residues and potentially even marine algae.

In some regions of the world, a combination of increasing demand for food, and increasing demand for biofuel, is causing deforestation and threats to biodiversity. The best reported example of this is the expansion of oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, where rainforest is being destroyed to establish new oil palm plantations. It is an important fact that 90% of the palm oil produced in Malaysia is used by the food industry;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140621/http://www.mpoc.org.za/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 Malaysian Palm Oil Council].&lt;/ref&gt; therefore biofuels cannot be held solely responsible for this deforestation. There is a pressing need for sustainable palm oil production for the food and fuel industries; palm oil is used in a wide variety of food products. The ''Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels'' is working to define criteria, standards and processes to promote sustainably produced biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgse.epfl.ch/page65660-en.html Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels website].&lt;/ref&gt; Palm oil is also used in the manufacture of detergents, and in electricity and heat generation both in Asia and around the world (the UK burns palm oil in coal-fired power stations to generate electricity).

Significant area is likely to be dedicated to sugar cane in future years as demand for ethanol increases worldwide.  The expansion of sugar cane plantations will place pressure on environmentally sensitive native ecosystems including rainforest in South America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6636467.stm ''BBC News''].&lt;/ref&gt;  In forest ecosystems, these effects themselves will undermine the climate benefits of alternative fuels, in addition to representing a major threat to global biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tni.org/detail_pub.phtml?know_id=188 Agrofuels — towards a reality check in nine key areas].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although biofuels are generally considered to improve net carbon output, biodiesel and other fuels do produce local air pollution, including [[nitrogen oxide]]s, the principal cause of [[smog]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

It is the structural form of α-Keggin anions, which have a general formula of [XM&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''n''−&lt;/sup&gt;, where X is the [[heteroatom]] (most commonly are P&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;, Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, or B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), M is the addenda atom (most common are [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]]), and O represents [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|pages= 660&amp;ndash;662}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure self-assembles in acidic aqueous solution and is the most stable structure of polyoxometalate [[catalyst]]s.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:crystalstructure.jpg|thumb|150px|Scanning electron micrograph of ammonium phosphomolybdate {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
The first α-Keggin anion, [[ammonium phosphomolybdate]] ((NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[PMo&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;]), was first reported by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]] in 1826. In 1892, Blomstrand proposed the structure of [[phosphomolybdic acid]] and other poly-acids as a chain or ring configuration. [[Alfred Werner]], using the [[coordination compound]]s ideas of Copaux, attempted to explain the structure of [[silicotungstic acid]]. He assumed a central group, [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; ion, enclosed by four [RW&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where R is a unipositive ion. The [RW&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are linked to the central group by primary [[valences]]. Two more R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; groups were linked to the central group by secondary valences. This proposal accounted for the characteristics of most poly-acids, but not all.

In 1928, [[Linus Pauling]] proposed a structure for α-Keggin anions consisting of a [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] central ion, [XO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''n''−8&lt;/sup&gt;, caged by twelve WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral. In this proposed structure, three of the oxygen on each of the [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] shared electrons with three neighboring octahedral. As a result, 18 oxygen atoms were used as bridging atoms between the metal atoms. The remaining oxygen atoms bonded to a [[proton]]. This structure explained many characteristics that were observed such as basicities of [[alkali metal]] salts and the hydrated of some of the salts. However the structure could not explain the structure of [[dehydrated]] acids.

James Fargher Keggin with the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] experimentally determined the structure of α-Keggin anions in 1934. The Keggin structure accounts for both the hydrated and dehydrated α-Keggin anions without a need for significant structural change. The Keggin structure is the widely accepted structure for the α-Keggin anions.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Bailar, Jr. ''The Chemistry of the Coordination Compounds,'' Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1956, pp 472-482&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KegginCAGE.jpg|200px|Cage of the Keggin structure]] +
[[Image:Heteroatom.jpg|100px|Central tetrahedron]]


The structure is composed of one [[heteroatom]] surrounded by four oxygen atoms to form a [[tetrahedron]]. The heteroatom is located centrally and caged by 12 [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] MO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-units linked to one another by the neighboring oxygen atoms. There are a total of 24 bridging oxygen atoms that link the 12 addenda atoms. The metal centres in the 12 octahedra are arranged on a sphere almost [[equidistant]] from each other, in four M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; units, giving the complete structure an overall tetrahedral symmetry. The [[bond length]] between atoms varies depending on the heteroatom (X) and the addenda atoms (M). For the 12–phosphotungstic acid, Keggin determined the bond length between the heteroatom and each the four central oxygen atoms to be 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Angstrom|Å]]. The bond length form the central oxygen to the addenda atoms is 2.43&amp;nbsp;Å. The bond length between the addenda atoms and each of the bridging oxygen is 1.9&amp;nbsp;Å. The remaining 12 oxygen atoms that are each double bonded to an addenda atom have a bond length of 1.70&amp;nbsp;Å. The octahedra are therefore distorted.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Keggin. ''Proc. Roy.

===Isomerism===
Including the original Keggin structure there are 5 [[isomer]]s, designated by the prefixes α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ε-. The original Keggin structure is designated α-. These isomers are sometimes termed Baker, Baker-Figgis or rotational isomers,&lt;ref&gt;''A New Fundamental Type of Inorganic Complex: Hybrid between Heteropoly and Conventional Coordination Complexes. Possibilities for Geometrical Isomerisms in 11-, 12-, 17-, and 18-Heteropoly Derivatives.'' LCW Baker, JS Figgis Journal of the American Chemical Society 92(12), 3794-3797 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; These involve different rotational orientations of the Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; units, which lowers the symmetry of the overall structure.

===Lacunary Keggin structures===
The term ''lacunary'' is applied to ions which have a fragment missing, sometimes called defect structures. Examples are the (XM&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''−&lt;/sup&gt; and (XM&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''−&lt;/sup&gt; formed by the removal from the Keggin structure of sufficient Mo and O atoms to eliminate 1 or 3 adjacent MO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra. The Dawson structure, X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;62&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''−&lt;/sup&gt;, is made up of two Keggin lacunary fragments with 3 missing octahedra.

===Group 13 cations with the Keggin structure===
The cluster cation (Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt; has the Keggin structure with a tetrahedral Al atom in the centre of the cluster coordinated to 4 oxygen atoms. The formula can be expressed as (AlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ion is generally called the Al13 ion. A Ga13 analogue is known&lt;ref&gt;''Detection of a new polymeric species formed through the hydrolysis of gallium(III) salt solutions'' S. M. Bradley, R. A. Kydd and R. Yamdagni J. Chem.

===The iron Keggin ion===
Due to the similar aqueous chemistries of aluminum and iron, it has been long thought that an analogous iron polycation should be isolatable from water. Moreover, in 2007, the structure of ferrihydrite was determined and shown to be built of iron Keggin ions.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Michel, L. Ehm, S. M. Antao, et al. ''Science'', 316, 1726-1729 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This further captured scientists’ imagination and drive to isolate the iron Keggin ion. In 2015, the iron Keggin ion was isolated from water, but as a polyanion with a −17 charge; and protecting chemistry was required.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sadeghi, L. N. Zakharov and M. Nyman, ''Aqueous formation and manipulation of the iron-oxo Keggin ion'' Science; 2015; 347 (6228) pp 1359 - 1362; {{doi|10.1126/science.aaa4620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron-bound water is very acidic; so it is difficult to capture the intermediate Keggin ion form without bulky and nonprotic ligands instead of the water that is found in the aluminum Keggin ion. However, more important in this synthesis was the bismuth (Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) counterions that provided high positive charge to stabilize the high negative charge of the heptadecavalent polyanion.

== Chemical properties ==
The stability of the Keggin structure allows the metals in the anion to be readily [[redox|reduced]]. Depending on the [[solvent]], [[acidity]] of the solution and the charge on the α-Keggin anion, it can be reversibly reduced in one- or multiple-electron steps.&lt;ref&gt;T. Okuhara; N. Mizuno; M. Misono. ''Advances in Cayalysis, Vol 41: Catalytic Chemistry of Heteropoly Compounds.'' Academic Press Inc., 1996, pp 191-193&lt;/ref&gt; For example, silicotungstate anion can be reduced to 20th state.&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Pope. ''Inorganic Chemistry Concepts 8: Heteropoly and Isopoly oxometalates.'' Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 1983, pp 101-107&lt;/ref&gt; Some anions such as silicotungstic acid are strong enough as an acid as [[sulfuric acid]] and can be used in its place as an acid catalyst.

== Preparation ==
In general α-Keggin anions are synthesized in acidic solutions. For example, 12-[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is formed by condensing phosphate ion with tungstate ions. The heteropolyacid that is formed has the Keggin structure.&lt;ref name = izumi /&gt;

== Uses ==
α-Keggin anions have been used as catalyst in the following reactions: [[hydration reaction|hydration]], [[polymerization]] and [[oxidation]] reaction as catalysts.&lt;ref name = izumi /&gt; Japanese chemical companies have commercialized the use of the compounds in hydration of [[propene]], oxidation of [[methacrolein]], hydration [[isobutene]], hydration of [[1-Butene|''n''-butene]], and [[polymerization]] of [[THF]].&lt;ref&gt;M.T.

[[Image:KFm3 Illustration.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aircraft wing showing the KFm3 Step]]
The '''Kline–Fogleman airfoil''' or '''KF airfoil''' is a simple airfoil design with single or multiple steps along the length of the wing. It was originally devised around 50 years ago for paper airplanes.

In the 21st century the KF [[airfoil]] has found renewed interest among hobbyist builders of [[radio-controlled aircraft]], due to its simplicity of construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1051573 Example of discussion at RC Groups forum]&lt;/ref&gt; But it has not been adopted for full-size aircraft capable of carrying a pilot, passengers, or other substantial payloads.

== History ==
The KF airfoil was designed by Richard Kline and Floyd Fogleman.
[[Image:KFm4 Illustration.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aircraft wing showing the KFm4 Step]]

In the early 1960s, Richard Kline wanted to make a paper airplane that could handle strong winds, climb high, level off by itself and then enter a long downwards glide. After many experiments he was able to achieve this goal.  He presented the paper airplane to Floyd Fogleman who saw it fly and resist stalling. The two men then filed for a patent on the stepped airfoil.

Further development resulted in two patents and a family of airfoils known as the KF airfoil and KFm airfoils (for Kline–Fogleman modified). The two patents, US Patent # 3,706,430 and US Patent # 4,046,338, refer to the introduction of a step either on the bottom (KFm1) or on the top of an [[airfoil]] (KFm2), or both on top and bottom (KFm4). It can also be used with two steps on the top (KFm3), or two steps on the top and one on the bottom (KFm7).

The purpose of the step, it is claimed, is to allow some of the displaced air to fall into a pocket behind the step and become part of the airfoil shape as a trapped [[vortex]] or vortex attachment. This purportedly prevents separation and maintains airflow over the surface of the airfoil.

==Reception==

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] published an April 2, 1973 article,''The Paper-Plane Caper''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monday, Apr. 02, 1973 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907054,00.html |title=Science: The Paper-Plane Caper |publisher=TIME |date=1973-04-02 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the paper airplane and its Kline–Fogleman airfoil.

Also in 1973, [[CBS]] [[60 Minutes]] did a 15-minute segment on the KF airfoil. It repeated the show again in 1976.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1985, Kline wrote a book entitled "The Ultimate Paper Airplane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Kline|title=The Ultimate Paper Airplane: With Step-by Step Instructions for Seven Different Models|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djrpAQAACAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-55551-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To publicize the book, he went down to [[Kill Devil Hills, NC]] in 1985, to the site where the Wright Brothers first flew where their first manned powered flight went 122 feet. A crew from Good Morning America came along to film the event. The longest flight by Kline with his paper airplane traveled 401 feet, four inches.

==Independent scientific testing==
[[Image:KFm2-airfoil-laminar-flow.jpg|right|thumb|250px|KFm2 airfoil showing purported laminar flow vortex]]
In 1974, a NASA-funded study prompted by Kline and Fogelman's claims and the resulting national coverage found the airfoil to have worse [[lift-to-drag ratio]] than a flat plate airfoil in wind tunnel tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750006642.pdf|title=Investigation of the Kline-Fogleman Airfoil Section for Rotor Blade Applications|last=Lumsdaine|first=Edward|date=1974-12-15|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, with 20 years of technical progress opening up new possibilities and with the original [[Term of patent in the United States|patents expired]], researchers returned to the topic of stepped wings. A 1998 study by Fathi Finaish and Stephen Witherspoon at the University of Missouri tested numerous step configurations in a wind tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/26834873/Journal-of-Aerospace-Engineering Aerodynamic Performance Of An Airfoil With Step-Induced Vortex For Lift Augmentation, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, January 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;  While many made wing performance worse, they got promising results with backward-facing steps on the lower surface of the wing – in some cases giving considerable enhancement in lift without much of a drag penalty. However, they concluded that a single configuration could not be best solution at every [[angle of attack]] and flight speed. Indeed, "vastly different configurations may be needed during a single maneuver."  The idea works, Finaish and Witherspoon concluded, but only with active automated re-configuration of the shape of the step(s) during flight. Further testing has shown that this airfoil is effective in low Reynolds number flow.

A 2008 study by Fabrizio De Gregorio and Giuseppe Fraioli at CIRA and the University of Rome in Italy tried this out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/lxlaser/lxlaser2008/papers/11.3_4.pdf |title=Flow Control On A High Thickness Airfoil By A Trapped Vortex Cavity, 14th Int Symp on Applications of Laser Techniques to Fluid Mechanics, Lisbon July 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320192645/http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/lxlaser/lxlaser2008/papers/11.3_4.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model aerofoils used in their wind tunnel tests were equipped with numerous small holes through which air could be blown or sucked in an active way.

They concluded that the trapped vortex formed by a cavity or step could not be held in place without such active control. Just relying passively on wing shape wasn't enough – the vortex would detach possibly giving you worse characteristics than the original unstepped airfoil. But when active controls were used to keep the vortex stably in place they found the results "really encouraging".

Such scientific experimental work seems to have put paid to the idea that the original KF airfoil will find a simple practical application in the world of full-size aircraft. But the basic idea of the stepped wing has mutated, and is now bound up with a new body of research into actively controlling the airflow over a wing's surface with new mechanisms unthinkable 50 years ago.

Research led by Ranganadhan Voona in 2012 at Missouri University of Science and Technology was to investigate the lift and drag characteristics of a stepped airfoil with backward facing steps; apply active flow control technique to enhance the aerodynamic performance of stepped airfoils and examine the possibility of using such airfoils on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s).&lt;ref name = vf2012 /&gt;  A step was introduced at mid-chord, with a depth of 50% of the airfoil thickness at mid-chord position extending till the trailing edge of a [[NACA]] 4415 airfoil.

Computational studies were conducted with the use of passive flow control constituting the activation of step and active flow control with the use of air injecting jets placed in the step cavity of the NACA 4415 airfoil with a goal of enhancing the aerodynamic performance. The jet angle and jet momentum coefficient were varied independently to identify the best setting for optimizing the aerodynamic performance of the stepped airfoil. Studies of a scaled wing model with the same airfoil were conducted within a wind tunnel for a range of Reynolds numbers to validate some of the numerical results that were obtained or the cases of base and stepped airfoils. The results that were produced showed that as much as 37% increase in Cl and as much as 12% increase in L/D ratios over conventional airfoil values could be obtained by using stepped airfoils.&lt;ref name = vf2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranganadhan |first=Voona |title=Voona, Ranganadhan.

The case study conducted as a part of this research focuses on the [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] RQ-2 Pioneer employed in a stepped airfoil configuration by comparing its aerodynamic characteristics with the conventional NACA 4415 airfoil originally used on this aircraft. The main objective of the case study was to identify and outline a step schedule for the flight envelope of the UAV Pioneer using a stepped airfoil configuration at the same time applying active flow control to obtain enhanced aerodynamic performance over conventional [[NACA airfoil|NACA 4415 airfoil]] originally used and hence improve the flight performance characteristics like Range and Endurance of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voona|first=Ranganadhan|title=Enhancing the aerodynamic performance of stepped airfoils Numerical and Experimental Study|date=2012|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing|location=Saarbrücken|isbn=978-3-659-26600-3|pages=45–54|url=https://www.lap-publishing.com/catalog/details/store/cn/book/978-3-659-26600-3/enhancing-the-aerodynamic-performance-of-stepped-airfoils?search=stepped|edition=1.

==Applications of the KF airfoil today==

[[File:KFm Family of Airfoils Ver 3.png|thumb|Shows the known variations of the KFm family of airfoils.{{citation-attribution|Dick Kline}}]]

Poor lift-to-drag ratio performance in wind tunnel testing has meant that to date the KF airfoil has not been used on any full size aircraft. But the KF airfoil and derivative 'stepped' airfoils have in recent years gained a following in the world of foam constructed radio controlled model aircraft. The low Reynolds numbers allow for the stepped airfoils to produce a significant amount of lift for the drag inured, making them increasingly popular among RC hobbyist.

The simple KF airfoil shape lends itself well to construction in sheets of various plastic foams, typically expanded [[polystyrene]] (EPS) or expanded [[polypropylene]] (EPP). The resulting stepped wing can have improved performance and flying characteristics compared to the even simpler 'flat plate' wing used in some radio-controlled models. The Airfoils illustrated in this article are examples of those used in radio control foam models.

The first man carrying KF airfoil based aircraft was successfully flown in 1986 by Richard Wood in Canada. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}Top speed was higher and stall was slower{{clarify|date=December 2017}}. The airfoil was tested on a Vector 600 ultralight.

The KF airfoil has been applied to the [[Darrieus wind turbine]] using a trapped vortex. Experiments have found the KF rotor demonstrates a higher static and dynamic torque with low [[Reynolds number|Reynolds]] applications and better performance for wind conditions lower than 0.8&amp;nbsp;m/s{{clarify|date=December 2017}}. It is seen a potential solution for self-starting in the Darrieus wind turbine.&lt;ref&gt;https://zapdf.com/queue/experimental-investigation-of-the-performance-of-darrieus-wi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liquid breathing''' is a form of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in which a normally air-breathing organism breathes an [[oxygen]]-rich [[liquid]] (such as a [[perfluorocarbon]]), rather than breathing [[air]].

This requires certain physical properties such as respiratory gas solubility, density, viscosity, vapor pressure, and lipid solubility which some, but not all, perfluorochemicals ([[perfluorocarbon]]) have.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is critical to choose the appropriate PFC for a specific biomedical application, such as liquid ventilation, drug delivery or blood substitutes. The physical properties of PFC liquids vary substantially; however, the one common property is their high solubility for respiratory gases. In fact, these liquids carry more [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] than blood.&lt;ref name="Gabrielet"&gt;{{Cite journal

In theory, liquid breathing could assist in the treatment of patients with severe [[human lung|pulmonary]] or [[human heart|cardiac]] trauma, especially in pediatric cases. Liquid breathing has also been proposed for use in deep [[Underwater diving|diving]]&lt;ref name=kylstra&gt;{{cite book |title=The Feasibility of Liquid Breathing in Man. |author=Kylstra JA |year=1977 |volume=Report to the US Office of Naval Research |publisher=Duke University |location=Durham, NC |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4257 |accessdate=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidszondy.com/future/underwater/menfish.htm |title=menfish |accessdate=2008-05-17 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516182627/http://www.davidszondy.com/future/underwater/menfish.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Featured on the ABC television program That's Incredible, including a demonstration of a mouse surviving a prolonged dunking in perflourocarbon.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human spaceflight|space travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Liquid_breathing_-_Medical_uses/id/1580110 |title=Liquid Breathing - Medical uses |accessdate=2008-05-17 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415002959/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Liquid_breathing_-_Medical_uses/id/1580110 |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Featured on the ABC television program That's Incredible.

Because liquid breathing is still a highly experimental technique, there are several proposed approaches.

===Total liquid ventilation===

Although total liquid ventilation (TLV) with completely liquid-filled lungs can be beneficial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Multicenter comparative study of conventional mechanical gas ventilation to tidal liquid ventilation in oleic acid injured sheep | url = | journal = | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 236–269 |last1= Wolfson  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the complex liquid-filled tube system required is a disadvantage compared to gas ventilation—the system must incorporate a [[membrane oxygenator]], heater, and pumps to deliver to, and remove from the lungs [[tidal volume]] [[wikt:aliquot|aliquots]] of conditioned [[perfluorocarbon]] (PFC). One research group led by Thomas H. Shaffer has maintained that with the use of [[microprocessor]]s and new technology, it is possible to maintain better control of respiratory variables such as liquid [[functional residual capacity]] and tidal volume during TLV than with gas ventilation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cox CA, Stavis RL.

Many prototypes are used for [[animal experimentation]], but experts recommend continued development of a [[liquid ventilator]] toward clinical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=  ML |last1= Costantino |first2= P |last2= Micheau |first3= TH |last3= Shaffer |first4= S |last4= Tredici |first5= MR |last5= Wolfson |displayauthors= 4

Specific preclinical liquid ventilator (Inolivent) is currently under joint development in [[Canada]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inolivent.ca/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The main application of this liquid ventilator is the ultra-fast induction of [[therapeutic hypothermia]] after [[cardiac arrest]]. This has been demonstrated to be more protective than slower cooling method after experimental cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kohlhauer M, Lidouren F, Remy-Jouet I, Mongardon N, Adam C, Bruneval P, Hocini H, Levy Y, Blengio F, Carli P, Vivien B, Ricard JD, Micheau P, Walti H, Nadeau M, Robert R, Richard V, Mulder P, Maresca D, Demené C, Pernot M, Tanter M, Ghaleh B, Berdeaux A, Tissier R | year = 2015 | title = Hypothermic Total Liquid Ventilation Is Highly Protective Through Cerebral Hemodynamic Preservation and Sepsis-Like Mitigation After Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest | url = https://zenodo.org/record/895839/files/article.pdf| journal = Crit.

===Partial liquid ventilation===

In contrast, partial liquid ventilation (PLV) is a technique in which a PFC is instilled into the lung to a volume approximating [[functional residual capacity]] (approximately 40% of [[Lung volumes|total lung capacity]]). [[mechanical ventilation|Conventional mechanical ventilation]] delivers [[tidal volume]] breaths on top of it. This mode of liquid ventilation currently seems technologically more feasible than total liquid ventilation, because PLV could utilise technology currently in place in many [[neonatal intensive-care unit]]s (NICU) worldwide.

The influence of PLV on oxygenation, carbon dioxide removal and lung mechanics has been investigated in several [[animal studies]] using different models of lung injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical applications of PLV have been reported in patients with [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), [[meconium aspiration syndrome]], [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]] and [[infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] (RDS) of [[neonate]]s.  In order to correctly and effectively conduct PLV, it is essential to
# properly dose a patient to a specific lung volume (10–15 ml/kg) to recruit alveolar volume 
# redose the lung with PFC liquid (1–2 ml/kg/h) to oppose PFC [[evaporation]] from the lung.
If PFC liquid is not maintained in the lung, PLV can not effectively protect the lung from biophysical forces associated with the gas ventilator.

New application modes for PFC have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote= A significant positive step was the use of PFC-associated gas exchange, now termed partial liquid ventilation (PLV). |last1= Hlastala |first1= MP |first2= JE |title=Perfluorocarbon Enhanced Gas Exchange: The easy way|last2= Souders| journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=  July 1, 2001 |volume= 164|pages=1–2|url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/164/1/1/|pmid= 11435228|issue= 1|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.164.1.2104021a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) involves filling the lungs with a fluid. This fluid is perfluorocarbon, also called Liquivent or Perflubron.  The liquid has some unique properties.  It has a very low surface tension, similar to surfactant, a substance that is produced in the lungs to prevent the alveoli from collapsing and sticking together during exhalation.  It also has a high density, oxygen readily diffuses through it, and it may have some anti-inflammatory properties.  In PLV, the lungs are filled with the liquid, the patient is then ventilated with a conventional ventilator using a protective lung ventilation strategy. This is called partial liquid ventilation. The hope is that the liquid will help the transport of oxygen to parts of the lung that are flooded and filled with debris, help remove this debris and open up more alveoli improving lung function.  The study of PLV involves comparison to protocolized ventilator strategy designed to minimize lung damage.&lt;ref name="Hirschl et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hirschl |first1=RB |last2=Pranikoff |first2=T |last3=Wise |first3=C |last4=Overbeck |first4=MC |last5=Gauger |first5=P |last6=Schreiner |first6=RJ |last7=Dechert |first7=R |last8=Bartlett |first8=RH |displayauthors= 4 |year=1996 |title= Initial experience with partial liquid ventilation in adult patients With the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=275 |issue=5 |pages=383–389 |doi=10.1001/jama.1996.03530290053037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verbrugge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbrugge |first1=SJC |last2=Lachmann |first2=B |date=September 1, 1997 |title=Partial liquid ventilation |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=1937–9 |doi=10.1183/09031936.97.10091937 |pmid=9311481 |url=http://www.ersj.org.uk/content/10/9/1937.full.pdf }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (editorial)&lt;/ref&gt;

===PFC vapor===

[[Vaporization]] of [[perfluorohexane]] with two [[anesthetic vaporizer]]s calibrated for perfluorohexane has been shown to improve [[gas exchange]] in [[oleic acid]]-induced lung injury in sheep.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Vaporization is a new application technique for perfluorocarbon that significantly improved oxygenation and pulmonary function in oleic acid-induced lung injury.&lt;/cite&gt;"

Predominantly PFCs with high [[vapor pressure]] are suitable for vaporization.

===Aerosol-PFC===

With [[aerosolized]] [[perfluorooctane]], significant improvement of oxygenation and pulmonary
mechanics was shown in adult sheep with [[oleic acid]]-induced lung injury.

In [[surfactant]]-[[wikt:depleted|depleted]] [[Domestic pig|piglet]]s, persistent improvement of gas exchange and lung mechanics was demonstrated with Aerosol-PFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The aerosol device is of decisive importance for the efficacy of PFC aerosolization, as aerosolization of [[PF5080]] (a less purified [[FC77]]) has been shown to be ineffective using a different aerosol device in surfactant-depleted rabbits. Partial liquid ventilation and Aerosol-PFC reduced pulmonary [[inflammatory response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Proposed uses==

===Diving===

Gas pressure increases with depth, rising 1 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] ({{convert|14.5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}) every 10 meters to over 1,000 bar at the bottom of the [[Mariana Trench]]. Diving becomes more dangerous as depth increases, and deep diving presents [[Diving hazards and precautions|many hazards]]. All surface-breathing animals are subject to [[decompression sickness]], including [[aquatic mammal]]s&lt;ref name="Lippsett"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[free-diving]] humans (see ''[[taravana]]''). Breathing at depth can cause [[nitrogen narcosis]] and [[oxygen toxicity]]. Holding the breath while ascending after breathing at depth can cause [[air embolism]]s, [[Pulmonary barotrauma|burst lung]], and [[Pneumothorax|collapsed lung]].

Special [[Breathing gas|breathing gas mixes]] such as [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] or [[heliox]] ameliorate the risk of [[decompression illness]] but do not eliminate it. Heliox further eliminates the risk of nitrogen narcosis but introduces the risk of [[High pressure nervous syndrome|helium tremors]] below about {{convert|500|ft|m}}. [[Atmospheric diving suit]]s maintain body and breathing pressure at 1 bar, eliminating most of the hazards of descending, ascending, and breathing at depth. However, the rigid suits are bulky, clumsy, and very expensive.

Liquid breathing offers a third option,&lt;ref name=kylstra/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kylstra JA |title=Liquid breathing |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=259–69 |date=September 1974 |pmid=4619862 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2665 |accessdate=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; promising the mobility available with flexible dive suits and the reduced risks of rigid suits. With liquid in the lungs, the pressure within the diver's lungs could accommodate changes in the pressure of the surrounding water without the huge gas partial pressure exposures required when the lungs are filled with gas. Liquid breathing would not result in the saturation of body tissues with high pressure nitrogen or helium that occurs with the use of non-liquids, thus would reduce or remove the need for slow [[decompression (diving)|decompression]].

A significant problem, however, arises from the high [[viscosity]] of the liquid and the corresponding reduction in its ability to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=kylstra/&gt;&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matthews WH, Kylstra JA |title=A fluorocarbon emulsion with a high solubility for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=113–20 |date=June 1976 |pmid=951821 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2764 |accessdate=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All uses of liquid breathing for diving must involve total liquid ventilation (see above). Total liquid ventilation, however, has difficulty moving enough liquid to carry away CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, because no matter how great the total pressure is, the amount of partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas pressure available to dissolve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the breathing liquid can never be much more than the pressure at which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exists in the blood (about 40&amp;nbsp;mm of mercury ([[Torr]])).&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt;

In order to explore drug delivery techniques that would be useful for both partial and total liquid ventilation, more recent studies have focused on PFC drug delivery using a nanocrystal suspension. The first image is a computer model of a PFC liquid (perflubron) combined with gentamicin molecules.

The second image shows experimental results comparing both plasma and tissue levels of gentamicin after an intratracheal (IT) and intravenous (IV) dose of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in a newborn lamb during gas ventilation. Note that the plasma levels of the IV dose greatly exceed the levels of the IT dose over the 4 hour study period; whereas, the lung tissue levels of gentamicin when delivered by an [[Intratracheal instillation|intratracheal]] (IT) suspension, uniformly exceed the intravenous (IV) delivery approach after 4 hours. Thus, the IT approach allows more effective delivery of the drug to the target organ while maintaining a safer level systemically. Both images represent the in-vivo time course over 4 hours. Numerous studies have now demonstrated the effectiveness of PFC liquids as a delivery vehicle to the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson MR, Greenspan JS, Shaffer TH.

Clinical trials with premature infants, children and adults were conducted. Since the safety of the procedure and the effectiveness were apparent from an early stage, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) gave the product "fast track" status (meaning an accelerated review of the product, designed to get it to the public as quickly as is safely possible) due to its life-saving potential. Clinical trials showed that using perflubron with ordinary [[medical ventilator|ventilators]] improved outcomes as much as using [[High Frequency Ventilation|high frequency oscillating ventilation]] (HFOV).  But because perflubron was not better than HFOV, the FDA did not approve perflubron, and Alliance is no longer pursuing the partial liquid ventilation application.  Whether perflubron would improve outcomes when used with HFOV or has fewer long-term consequences than HFOV remains an open question.

In 1996 [[Mike Darwin]] and Steven B. Harris proposed using cold liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbon to quickly lower the body temperature of victims of [[cardiac arrest]] and other brain trauma to allow the brain to better recover.&lt;ref&gt;

Most recently, hypothermic brain protection has been associated with rapid brain cooling. In this regard, a new therapeutic approach is the use of intranasal perfluorochemical spray for preferential brain cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wolfson| year = 2008 | title = Intranasal perfluorochemical spray for preferential brain cooling in sheep | url = | journal = Neurocrit Care. | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 437–47 | doi=10.1007/s12028-008-9064-0| pmid = 18266110 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nasopharyngeal (NP) approach is unique for brain cooling due to anatomic proximity to the cerebral circulation and arteries. Based on preclinical studies in adult sheep, it was shown that independent of region, brain cooling was faster during NP-perfluorochemical versus conventional whole body cooling with cooling blankets. To date, there have been four human studies including a completed randomized intra-arrest study (200 patients).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Castrén M, Nordberg P, Svensson L, etal |date=Aug 2010 | title = Intra-arrest transnasal evaporative cooling: a randomized, prehospital, multicenter study (PRINCE: Pre-ROSC IntraNasal Cooling Effectiveness) | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = 7| pages = 729–36 | doi=10.1161/circulationaha.109.931691 | pmid=20679548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Busch HJ, Eichwede F, Födisch M, etal |date=Aug 2010 | title = Safety and feasibility of nasopharyngeal evaporative cooling in the emergency department setting in survivors of cardiac arrest | url = | journal = Resuscitation | volume = 81 | issue = 8| pages = 943–9 | doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.04.027 | pmid=20627524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results clearly demonstrated that prehospital intra-arrest transnasal cooling is safe, feasible and is associated with an improvement in cooling time.

===Space travel===

Liquid immersion provides a way to reduce the physical stress of [[G force]]s. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures. Because liquids cannot be practically compressed, they do not change density under high acceleration such as performed in aerial maneuvers or space travel. A person immersed in liquid of the same density as [[Biological tissue|tissue]] has acceleration forces distributed around the body, rather than applied at a single point such as a seat or harness straps. This principle is used in a new type of [[G-suit]] called the Libelle G-suit, which allows aircraft pilots to remain conscious and functioning at more than 10 G acceleration by surrounding them with water in a rigid suit.

Acceleration protection by liquid immersion is limited by the differential density of body tissues and immersion fluid, limiting the utility of this method to about 15 to 20 G.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Extending acceleration protection beyond 20 G requires filling the lungs with fluid of density similar to water. An astronaut totally immersed in liquid, with liquid inside all body cavities, will feel little effect from extreme G forces because the forces on a liquid are distributed equally, and in all directions simultaneously. However effects will be felt because of density differences between different body tissues, so an upper acceleration limit still exists.

Liquid breathing for acceleration protection may never be practical because of the difficulty of finding a suitable breathing medium of similar density to water that is compatible with lung tissue. [[Perfluorocarbon]] fluids are twice as dense as water, hence unsuitable for this application.&lt;ref name="Gabrielet" /&gt;

* In the 1995 [[anime]] ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', the cockpits of the [[Evangelion (mecha)|titular]] [[mecha]] are filled with a fictional oxygenated liquid called LCL which is required for the pilot to mentally sync with an Evangelion, as well as providing direct oxygenation of their blood, and dampening the impacts from battle. Once the cockpit is flooded the LCL is ionized, bringing its density, opacity, and viscosity close to that of air.
* In the movies [[Event Horizon (film)|''Event Horizon'']] (1997) and ''[[Mission to Mars]]'' (2000), a character is depicted as being immersed in apparent breathable fluid before a high-acceleration launch.
* In season 1, episode 13 of ''[[Seven Days (TV series)|Seven Days]]'' (1998-2001) chrononaut Frank Parker is seen breathing a hyper-oxygenated [[perfluorocarbon]] liquid that is pumped through a sealed full body suit that he is wearing. This suit and liquid combination allow him to board a Russian submarine through open ocean at a depth of almost 1000 feet. Upon boarding the submarine he removes his helmet, expels the liquid from his lungs and is able to breathe air again.
* In an episode of the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon series ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' (2006-2013), the other members of the band submerge guitarist Toki in a "liquid oxygen isolation chamber" while recording an album in the [[Mariana Trench]].
* In an episode of the [[Syfy]] Channel show ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'' (2006-2012), Sheriff Jack Carter is submerged in a tank of "oxygen rich [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]" to be cured of the effects of a scientific accident.
* In the anime series ''[[Aldnoah.Zero]]'' (2014-2015), episode 5 shows that Slaine Troyard was in a liquid-filled capsule when he crashed. Princess Asseylum witnessed the crash, helped him to get out of the capsule, then used CPR on him to draw out the liquid from his lungs.

=== Video games ===
* In the classic 1995 PC [[turn-based strategy]] game ''[[X-COM: Terror from the Deep]]'', "Aquanauts" fighting in deep ocean conditions breathe a dense oxygen-carrying fluid.
* In the ''[[EVE Online]]'' Universe (2003), pilots in capsules ([[escape pods]] that function as the control center for the spacecraft) breathe an oxygen rich, [[Nanorobotics|nano-saturated]], breathable glucose-based suspension solution.&lt;ref&gt;https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=3479925#post3479925&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5404">'''Marine Diesel Oil''' ('''MDO''') is a type of [[fuel oil]] and is a blend of [[gasoil]] and [[heavy fuel oil]], with less gasoil than intermediate fuel oil used in the [[Shipping|maritime]] field. Marine Diesel Oil is also called "Distillate Marine Diesel".&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Diesel Fuel Oil|url=http://www.etc-cte.ec.gc.ca/databases/Oilproperties/pdf/WEB_Marine_Diesel_Fuel_Oil.pdf|website=Environment Canada Oil Properties Database|publisher=Environment Canada, Emergencies Science and Technology Division|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDO is widely used by medium speed and medium/high speed marine diesel engines. It is also used in the larger slow speed and medium speed propulsion engine which normally burn [[residual fuel]].&lt;ref name=EC /&gt; Those fuels resulting from a catalytic [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]]/[[visbreaking]] refinery.&lt;ref name=EC /&gt; Marine diesel oil has been condemned for its nimiety of sulfur, so many countries and organizations established regulations and laws on MDO use. Due to its lower price compared to more refined fuel, MDO is favored particularly by [[Freight transport|shipping industry]]. &lt;ref name=DTecReview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chevron|title=Diesel Fuels Technical Review|url=http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/DieselFuelTechReview.pdf|website=Chevron Global Marketing|publisher=Chevron|accessdate=4 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411064644/http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/DieselFuelTechReview.pdf|archivedate=11 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Specification==
ISO 8217 of the [[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) is the primary standard of MDO. &lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt;

Marine fuels range in [[viscosity]] from less than one centistoke (see [[viscosity]]) (cSt) to about 700 cSt at 50°C (122°F).&lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; (1 cSt = 1 mm2/s.) And higher viscosity grades are preheated during use to bring their viscosity into the range suitable for [[fuel injection]] (8 to 27 cSt). &lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; But MDO does not need to be preheated before using. According to Chevron, MDO has a sulfur limit varies from 1 to 4.5 percent by mass for different grades and Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). &lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt;

==Manufacturing procedure==
MDO is made from a catalytic [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]]/[[visbreaking]] refinery.&lt;ref name=Everything&gt;{{cite web|title=Everything You Need to Know About Marine Fuels|url=http://www.chevronmarineproducts.com/docs/everythingaboutfuels_v0108_lo.pdf|website=Chevron Global Marine Products|publisher=Chevron|accessdate=4 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330002324/http://www.chevronmarineproducts.com/docs/everythingaboutfuels_v0108_lo.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalytic cracking operation breaks large molecules into small molecules. It happens in high temperature and with appropriate [[catalysts|catalyst]].&lt;ref name=Everything /&gt; 
[[Visbreaking]] is a process that turn the bottom product of the vacuum unit, which has extremely high [[viscosity]], into lower [[viscosity]], marketable product.&lt;ref name=Everything /&gt; In visbreaking, a relatively mild thermal cracking operation is performed.&lt;ref name=Everything /&gt; And the amount of cracking is limited by the overruling requirement to safeguard the heavy fuel stability.&lt;ref name=Everything /&gt;

The market of MDO is much smaller than on-highway diesel. According to the a 2004 U.S. Diesel Fuel Sales statistics from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Marine shipping only takes 3.7% of total diesel market.&lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; On the other hand, On-highway diesel takes up 59.5% of diesel fuel sales.&lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; This small sales share of MDO is due to the high proportion of petroleum resid that made it can be used on large marine engines.&lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; According to Chevron, petroleum resid, or inorganic salts, in the fuel result in injector tip deposits that prevent the injector from creating the desired fuel spray pattern.&lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; But those low-speed, large marine diesel engines are appropriate for using fuel containing large amounts of petroleum resid.&lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt;

==Regulations and restrictions==
The [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) develops regulations for marine shipping. Among those regulations, [[MARPOL]] (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) is the most widely adopted one. &lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt;  MARPOL is the main international convention covering the prevention of operational or accidental pollution of the marine environment by ships. &lt;ref name=DTecReview /&gt; Inside [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], there is a committee called [[International Maritime Organization|MEPC]](Marine Environment Protection Committee). MEPC has meetings periodically and discuss resolutions to current [[marine pollution]] by adding amendments to its official documents.&lt;ref name=MEPC&gt;{{cite web|title= MEPC Official Documents|url=http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/Marine-Environment-Protection-Committee-(MEPC)/Pages/default.aspx|website=Marine Environment Protection Committee|publisher=IMO|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5180">The '''mĕnē''' (also '''mina''', [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) ({{Lang-he-n|מנה}})&lt;ref&gt;In the Hebrew tradition, a ''meh-ney'' had always the weight of 100 silver [[denarii]].&lt;/ref&gt; is an ancient [[Mesopotamian]] unit of weight for gold or silver and one of the earliest written words for money. The mĕnē, like the shekel, was also a unit of [[currency]]. In ancient Greece, it originally equalled 70 [[drachmae]] and later was increased to 100 drachmae.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Athenian Constitution, 10.2&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''mna'' was borrowed from Semitic; compare Hebrew ''māneh'', Aramaic ''mĕnē'', Syriac ''manyā'', Ugaritic ''mn'', and Akkadian ''manū''.
However, before it was used as currency, a mene was a unit of measurement, equal to 567 grams. One mĕnē of gold would be worth $23,000 USD and one mĕnē of silver would be worth $300 USD at today's metal prices.

In folk language used by sailors, the word ''mina'' or ''mines'' came to mean "mines", indicating mineral resources extracted from the ground.

From earliest [[History of Sumer|Sumerian]] times, a mĕnē was a unit of weight. At first, talents and shekels had not yet been introduced. By the time of [[Ur-Nammu]], the mĕnē had a value of 1/60 [[Talent (weight)|talents]] as well as 60 [[shekel]]s. The value of the mĕnē is calculated at 1.25 pounds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Church/Research%20History%20and%20Great%20Links/Biblical%20Weights%20Measure%20and%20Monetary%20System.htm] Calculation of weight by number of shekels.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=726&amp;letter=M#2473] Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; or 0.571 kilograms per mĕnē (18.358 troy ounces).

Evidence from [[Ugarit]] indicates that a mĕnē was equivalent to fifty shekels.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merril ed., ''The Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', vol. 5, "Weights and Measures," Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet [[Ezekiel]] refers to a mĕnē ('maneh' in the King James Version) as sixty shekels, in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 45:12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesus of Nazareth]] tells the "parable of the mĕnē" in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 19:11-27.

From the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian period, 2 mĕnē was equal to 1 ''sila'' of water (cf. [[water clock|clepsydra]], water clock).


==Menē Jewelry==
In early 2016, noted gold investor [[Roy Sebag]] began to study and write about the global jewelry market which contributes the majority of the world's annual gold demand (2,000 tonnes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = WGC Report: Gold Demand Trends |url = http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/gold-demand-trends =World Gold Council |accessdate = 24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; far exceeding demand for gold investment coins. Following extensive travels to India, Asia, and Southeast Asia, Sebag recognized an opportunity in bringing the ancient tradition for jewelry being a store of enduring value and accessible savings to the West.

In October 2016, Sebag founded Mene Inc. a luxury online jewelry venture along with [[Diana Widmaier Picasso]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Fickenscher, Lisa |title = Here’s your chance to finally own a Picasso|url = https://nypost.com/2017/06/15/heres-your-chance-to-finally-own-a-picasso/|publisher = New York Post|accessdate = 23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the granddaughter of [[Pablo Picasso]]. Menē (meh-nay) derives its name from the ancient Mesopotamian unit of measurement, the Mene (unit) reflected 567 grams of pure gold and was one of the earliest written words for money. Menē designs, manufactures, and markets timeless 24 karat gold jewelry under the brand name Menē. The company retails its jewelry direct-to-consumer through a transparent and empowering online shopping experience. Through Mene.com, customers can buy, sell, and exchange their jewelry by weight at the prevailing daily price for gold as quoted on the international bullion markets. Menē is currently in closed private beta and will launch to the greater public in the fall of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Menē Website  |url = http://www.mene.com =Mene.com |accessdate = 24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the first century AD [in Greece?], it amounted to about a fourth of the wages earned annually by an agricultural worker. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Code of Hammurabi ==
* In the [[Code of Hammurabi]] which is arguably the first example of written law, mene is one of the most used terms denoting the weight of gold to be paid for crimes or to resolve civil conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/ham/ham07.htm] Sacred Texts&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] of international scientific bodies [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]].

It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest [[pnictogen]], although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of the pnictogen bismuth. Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]], and to be a [[post-transition metal]], although it should also show several major differences from them. In particular, moscovium should also have significant similarities to [[thallium]], as both have one rather loosely bound electron outside a quasi-closed [[electron shell|shell]]. About 100 atoms of moscovium have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.

==History==
{{see also|Discoveries of the chemical elements}}
[[File:RedSquare (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|A view of the famous [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]]. The region around the city was honored by the discoverers as "the ancient Russian land that is the home of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research" and became the namesake of moscovium.]]

===Discovery===
The first successful [[discovery of the chemical elements|synthesis]] of moscovium was by a joint team of Russian and American scientists in August 2003 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist [[Yuri Oganessian]], the team included American scientists of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. The researchers on February 2, 2004, stated in ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review C]]'' that they bombarded [[americium]]-243 with calcium-48 ions to produce four atoms of moscovium. These atoms decayed by emission of alpha-particles to [[nihonium]] in about 100&amp;nbsp;milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu. Ts.|last2=Utyonkoy|first2=V.

The Dubna–Livermore collaboration strengthened their claim to the discoveries of moscovium and nihonium by conducting chemical experiments on the final [[decay product]] &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Db. None of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known, so existing experimental data was not available to support their claim. In June 2004 and December 2005, the presence of a [[dubnium]] isotope was confirmed by extracting the final decay products, measuring [[spontaneous fission]] (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a [[group 5 element]] (as dubnium is known to be in group 5 of the periodic table).&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name=e115/&gt; Both the half-life and the decay mode were confirmed for the proposed &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Db, lending support to the assignment of the parent nucleus to moscovium.&lt;ref name=e115&gt;[http://www.jinr.ru/publish/Preprints/2004/157(e12-2004-157).pdf "Results of the experiment on chemical identification of Db as a decay product of element 115"], Oganessian et al., JINR preprints, 2004.

Two heavier isotopes of moscovium, &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc and &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, were discovered in 2009–2010 as daughters of the [[tennessine]] isotopes &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts and &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Ts; the isotope &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc was later also synthesized directly and confirmed to have the same properties as found in the tennessine experiments.&lt;ref name="117s"/&gt; The JINR also had plans to study lighter isotopes of moscovium in 2017 by replacing the americium-243 target with the lighter isotope [[americium-241]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study of heavy and superheavy nuclei (see project 1.5)|url=http://flerovlab.jinr.ru/flnr/education_list.html|work=Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flerovlab.jinr.ru/flnr/programme_synth_2017.html |title=FLNR Scientific Programme: Year 2017 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=flerovlab.jinr.ru |publisher=JINR |access-date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca+&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am reaction producing moscovium is planned to be the first experiment done at the new SHE Factory in 2018 at Dubna to test the systems in preparation for attempts at synthesising [[ununennium|elements 119]] and [[unbinilium|120]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/esf/Nupecc-LRP2017.pdf |title=NuPECC Long Range Plan 2017 Perspectives in Nuclear Physics |author=Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee |date=2017 |website=www.esf.org |publisher=European Science Foundation |access-date=9 January 2018 |quote=The new building is ready for installation of the DC-280 cyclotron, the commissioning and testing of the accelerator are ongoing, and the first experiments should begin in 2018. ...

In 2011, the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] of international scientific bodies [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) evaluated the 2004 and 2007 Dubna experiments, and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery. Another evaluation of more recent experiments took place within the next few years, and a claim to the discovery of moscovium was again put forward by Dubna.&lt;ref name=JWP/&gt; In August 2013, a team of researchers at [[Lund University]] and at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]  announced they had repeated the 2004 experiment, confirming Dubna's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/existence-of-new-element-confirmed |agency=Lund University |title=Existence of new element confirmed |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=10 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://prl.aps.org/accepted/2207dY2bS631e84382e425232df55fb5da302c431|title=Spectroscopy of element 115 decay chains (Accepted for publication on Physical Review Letters on 9 August 2013)|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the 2004 experiment had been repeated at Dubna, now additionally also creating the isotope &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc that could serve as a cross-bombardment for confirming the discovery of the [[tennessine]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts in 2010.&lt;ref name=Karol/&gt; Further confirmation was published by the team at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.92.021301|title=Decay spectroscopy of element 115 daughters: &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Rg→&lt;sup&gt;276&lt;/sup&gt;Mt and &lt;sup&gt;276&lt;/sup&gt;Mt→Bh|journal=Physical Review C|volume=92|issue=2|bibcode=2015PhRvC..92b1301G|year=2015|last1=Gates|first1=J.

In December 2015, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized the element's discovery and assigned the priority to the Dubna-Livermore collaboration of 2009–2010, giving them the right to suggest a permanent name for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118.html Discovery and Assignment of Elements with Atomic Numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118].

A 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI nevertheless cast some doubt on the syntheses of moscovium and tennessine after the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized these elements as having been discovered in 2009–2010. It found that the decay chains assigned to the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Mc and &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc were probably internally consistent, with the uncertainty due to the probable insensitivity of the measurements to very short and very long nuclide lifetimes, incorrect assignments of other decay chains from the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction to different moscovium isotopes, or uncertainty in the identification of some of the daughters of these moscovium isotopes. On the other hand, the decay chains assigned to &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, the isotope instrumental in the official confirmation of the synthesis of moscovium and tennessine, were found not to be internally consistent. Some subsets of these chains were found to be consistent, suggesting however that their true assignment was to &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, and that their shortness indicated instead new [[spontaneous fission]] branches in its daughters &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Rg – or, more likely, undetected [[electron capture]] branches in these daughters leading to the even–even nuclides &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Cn and &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, which have a very low barrier to spontaneous fission. While the &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Ts decay chains were found to be congruent, the &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts decay chains approved by the JWP were found to probably not be so and require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different tennessine isotopes. It was also found that the set of chains from &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc were not congruent. The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticised the IUPAC/IUPAP JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine was an almost certainly non-existent link was "problematic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forsberg |first=U. |last2=Rudolph |first2=D. |first3=C. |last3=Fahlander |first4=P. |last4=Golubev |first5=L.

On 8 June 2017, two members of the Dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms, analysing their data on the nuclides &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc with widely accepted statistical methods, noted that the 2016 studies indicating non-congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay: they excluded from the 90% confidence interval both average and extreme decay times, and the decay chains that would be excluded from the 90% confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included. The 2017 reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain, although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zlokazov |first1=V.

===Naming===
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], moscovium is sometimes known as ''eka-[[bismuth]]''. In 1979 IUPAC recommended that the [[placeholder name|placeholder]] [[systematic element name]] ''ununpentium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uup'')&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure Appl.

Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it "element 115", with the symbol of ''E115'', ''(115)'' or even simply ''115''.&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt;

On 30 December 2015, discovery of the element was recognized by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118.html|title=IUPAC - International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry: Discovery and Assignment of Elements with Atomic Numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverer(s) of a new element has the right to suggest a name.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Island of Stability derived from Zagrebaev.png|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The expected location of the island of stability. The dotted line is the line of [[beta decay|beta]] stability.]]
Moscovium is expected to be in the middle of an [[island of stability]] centered on [[copernicium]] (element 112) and [[flerovium]] (element 114): the reasons for the presence of this island, however, are still not well understood.&lt;ref name="Zagrebaev"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Zagrebaev |first1=Valeriy |last2=Karpov |first2=Alexander |last3=Greiner |first3=Walter |date=2013 |title=Future of superheavy element research: Which nuclei could be synthesized within the next few years? |publisher=IOP Science |booktitle=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=420 |pages=1–15 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/420/1/012001/pdf/1742-6596_420_1_012001.pdf |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Nostrand's scientific encyclopedia|first1=Glenn D. |last1= Considine |first2=Peter H. |last2= Kulik|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|date=2002|edition=9th|isbn=978-0-471-33230-5|oclc=223349096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the expected high fission barriers, any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and [[beta decay]].&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Although the known isotopes of moscovium do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability, they can be seen to approach the island as in general, the heavier isotopes are the longer-lived ones.&lt;ref name=117s/&gt;&lt;ref name=e115/&gt;

The hypothetical isotope &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Mc is an especially interesting case as it has only one neutron more than the heaviest known moscovium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;Mc. It could plausibly be synthesized as the daughter of &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Ts, which in turn could be made from the reaction {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,2n)&lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Ts}}.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev/&gt; Calculations show that it may have a significant [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]] decay mode in addition to alpha decaying and also have a relatively long half-life of several seconds. This would produce &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;[[flerovium|Fl]], &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, and finally &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;[[copernicium|Cn]] which is expected to be in the middle of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200&amp;nbsp;years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. Possible drawbacks are that the cross section of the production reaction of &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Ts is expected to be low and the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev/&gt;

Other possibilities to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus.&lt;ref name=ZG/&gt; Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly [[Magic number (physics)|magic]] or nearly doubly magic fragments such as [[calcium-40]], [[tin-132]], [[lead-208]], or [[bismuth-209]].&lt;ref name=jinr20006&gt;{{cite web|title=JINR Annual Reports 2000–2006|url=http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html|publisher=[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]|accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently it has been shown that the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as [[uranium]] and [[curium]]) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the [[island of stability]],&lt;ref name=ZG&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zagrebaev |first1=V.|last2=Greiner |first2=W.|date=2008|title=Synthesis of superheavy nuclei: A search for new production reactions|journal=[[Physical Review C]]|volume=78 |issue=3 |page=034610|arxiv=0807.2537|bibcode=2008PhRvC..78c4610Z|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.78.034610}}&lt;/ref&gt; although formation of the lighter elements [[nobelium]] or [[seaborgium]] is more favored.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev/&gt; One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled [[nuclear explosion]]s to create a [[neutron flux]] high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at &lt;sup&gt;258–260&lt;/sup&gt;[[fermium|Fm]] and at [[mass number]] 275 (atomic numbers [[rutherfordium|104]] to [[hassium|108]]), mimicking the [[r-process]] in which the [[actinide]]s were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around [[radon]] bypassed.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev/&gt; Some such isotopes (especially &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Cn and &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; the abundance of [[lead]]) to be detectable as [[primordial nuclide]]s today outside [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev/&gt;

===Physical and atomic===
In the [[periodic table]], moscovium is a member of group 15, the pnictogens, below [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and bismuth. Every previous pnictogen has five electrons in its valence shell, forming a [[valence electron]] configuration of ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;np&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In moscovium's case, the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt; therefore, moscovium will behave similarly to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in many respects. However, notable differences are likely to arise; a largely contributing effect is the [[spin–orbit interaction|spin–orbit (SO) interaction]]—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and [[spin (physics)|spin]]. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name=Thayer/&gt; In relation to moscovium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels&lt;!--|level is an important word.

For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.&lt;ref name=Thayer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thayer |first1=John S. |title=Relativistic Methods for Chemists |date=2010 |pages=63–67, 83 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9975-5_2|chapter=Relativistic Effects and the Chemistry of the Heavier Main Group Elements |isbn=978-1-4020-9974-8|publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
Moscovium is predicted to be the third member of the 7p series of [[chemical element]]s and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below [[bismuth]]. Unlike the two previous 7p elements, moscovium is expected to be a good homologue of its lighter congener, in this case bismuth.&lt;ref name=Zaitsevskii&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tan11.jinr.ru/pdf/07_Sep/S_3/04_Titov.pdf |title=Relativistic DFT and ab initio calculations on the seventh-row superheavy elements: E113 - E114 |last1=Zaitsevskii |first1=A. |first2=C. |last2=van Wüllen |first3=A. |last3=Rusakov |first4=A. |last4=Titov |date=September 2007 |website=jinr.ru |access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like [[dinitrogen pentoxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]: it is very difficult to have five [[covalent bond]]s to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five [[ligand]]s. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]]. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the [[inert pair effect]], so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons, as the [[binding energy]] of the lone 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=O. L., Jr.|author2=C. W.

The chemistry of moscovium in [[aqueous solution]] should essentially be that of the Mc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The former should be easily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and not be easily [[coordination complex|complexed]] with [[halide]]s, [[cyanide]], and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Moscovium(I) [[hydroxide]] (McOH), [[carbonate]] (Mc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxalate]] (Mc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[fluoride]] (McF) should be soluble in water; the [[sulfide]] (Mc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) should be insoluble; and the [[chloride]] (McCl), [[bromide]] (McBr), [[iodide]] (McI), and [[thiocyanate]] (McSCN) should be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess [[hydrochloric acid]] would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Mc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; should be about as stable as Tl&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and hence should also be an important part of moscovium chemistry, although its closest [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]] among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[thiozonide]] (McS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), bromide (McBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and iodide (McI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form [[oxyhalide]]s such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; Both moscovium(I) and moscovium(III) should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

Like its lighter homologues [[ammonia]], [[phosphine]], [[arsine]], [[stibine]], and [[bismuthine]], moscovine (McH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is expected to have a [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]], with an Mc–H bond length of 195.4&amp;nbsp;pm and a H–Mc–H bond angle of 91.8° (bismuthine has bond length 181.7&amp;nbsp;pm and bond angle 91.9°; stibine has bond length 172.3&amp;nbsp;pm and bond angle 92.0°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Santiago |first1=Régis T. |last2=Haiduke |first2=Roberto L.

'''Neon Museum''', also the '''Museum of Neon''' ({{lang-pl|Muzeum Neonów}}) is a museum located in [[Warsaw|Warsaw's]] [[Praga-Południe]]. The institution documents and protects Polish light advertisements created after World War II. It is the first in [[Poland]] and one of the few museums of [[Neon sign|neon signs]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/22/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-warsaw-poland.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=36 Hours in Warsaw, Poland|last=Wilder|first=Charly|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is located at ul. Mińska 25, on the premises of Soho Factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/warsaw-best-restaurants-bars-things-to-do-hotels-city-break-guide-poland-a8430631.html|title=How to spend a weekend in Warsaw|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2012.

== History ==
The history of the museum began in 2005 when Ilona Karwińska saved the ''Berlin'' neon sign from [[Marszałkowska Street, Warsaw|Marszałkowska]] Street in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,34861,9344335,Pierwsze_w_Polsce_Muzeum_Neonow_dziala_juz_w_Warszawie.html|title=Wyborcza.pl|website=Warszawa.wyborcza.pl|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of the museum features about 100 neon lights from all over Poland

Zobaczcie warszawskie neony|website=Cojestgrane24.wyborcza.pl|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the neons come from the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1167356/poland-celebrates-history-fluorescent-ads-neon-museum|title=Poland Celebrates History of Fluorescent Ads in Neon Museum|last=Al-awsat|first=Asharq|website=Aawsat.com|language=UK|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine largest neon signs including ''GŁÓWNA KSIĘGARNIA TECHNICZNA (MAIN TECHNICAL BOOKSTORE)'', ''Jubiler'', ''dworzec kolejowy CHODZIEŻ ([[Chodzież|CHODZIEŻ]] railway station)'', ''KINO PRAHA (PRAHA cinema)'' i ''[[Warszawa Wschodnia railway station|WARSZAWA WSCHODNIA]]'' are located on different Soho Factory buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/warsaw/attractions/neon-museum/a/poi-sig/1517814/360342|title=Neon Museum|website=Lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also looks after some neon signs in Warsaw, including [[Coat of arms of Warsaw|Mermaid]] on Grójecka Street. 

In 2013, the museum together with RWE organized ''Neon for Warsaw'' competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.um.warszawa.pl/aktualnosci/mi-o-ci-widzie-zab-y-nie-nowy-symbol-stolicy ''Happy to see you''] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nines''' are an informal, yet common method of grading the purity of materials.

==Precious metals==
very fine precious metals such as [[platinum]], [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Based on the system of [[millesimal fineness]], a metal is said to be ''one nine'' or ''one nine fine'' if it is 900 fine, or 90% pure. A metal that is 990 fine is then described as ''two nines fine'' and one that is 999 fine is described as ''three nines fine''. Thus, [[List of unusual units of measurement#Nines|nines]] are a [[logarithmic scale]] of purity for very fine precious metals. Similarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then "five", so 999.5 fine (99.95% pure) is "three nines five", abbreviated 3N5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGachie |first1=Richard O. |last2=Bradley |first2=Anne Grace |title=Precious metals |journal=Precious metals |volume=4 |year=1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22four+nines+five%22 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing |year=1998 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}&lt;!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as "four-nines-five" while it is actually *five* nines five. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gases==
The nines scale is also sometimes used in describing the [[Purity (gas)|purity of bottled gases]]. The purity of gas is an indication of the amount of other gases it contains. A high purity refers to a low amount of other gases. Gases of higher purity are considered to be of better quality and are usually more expensive.

The purity of a gas is generally expressed as a grade prefixed with the letter N giving the  "number of nines" in the [[percentage]] or [[decimal fraction]].  For gasses, the number of nines is usually written after the letter N, rather than before it. An N2.0 gas is 99% pure, and 1% (by volume) impurities.  An N6.0 gas is 99.9999% (six nines) pure, with 1 [[part per million]] (1 ppm) impurities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Purity, Grades, and Concentration |url=http://www.boconline.co.uk/en/contact-and-support/technical-advice/speciality-products-advice/purity-grades-concentration/purity-grades.html |website=BOCOnline.co.uk |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermediate values are formed using the [[common logarithm]].  For example, a gas which is 99.97% pure would be described as N3.5, since log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(0.03%) = &amp;minus;3.523.

Nines are used in a similar manner to describe [[High availability#Percentage_calculation|computer system availability]].

'''Parallel generation''' refers to the generation of [[electric power]] directly by consumers instead of purchasing it from an integrated [[electric utility]] company. Generally, it seems that parallel generation of electric power is taken on by institutions, such as hospitals, manufacturers or other large organizations. It may be understood that individuals typically do not have an economic incentive to invest in and organize such specialized services as [[electric power generation]].

A '''photoflash capacitor''' is an [[electrolytic capacitor]] used in [[flash (photography)|flash]] [[camera]]s, professional flashes, and also in solid-state [[laser]] power supplies. Their usual purpose is to briefly power a high-voltage [[flash tube]], used to illuminate a photographic subject or optically pump a laser rod. As flash tubes require very high current for a very short time to operate, photoflash capacitors are designed to supply high discharge current pulses without excessive internal heating.  

The principal properties of a capacitor are capacitance, working voltage, [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR), [[equivalent series inductance]] (ESL), and working temperature

Compared with electrolytic capacitors usually used for power supply filtering at [[utility frequency|power frequency]], a photoflash capacitor is designed to have lower ESR, ESL, and capacitance [[manufacturing tolerance]], but does not need as high a working temperature.

The light energy emitted by a flash is supplied by the capacitor, and is proportional to the product of the capacitance and the voltage squared; photoflash capacitors have capacitance in the range 80-160 [[microfarad]]s (µF) and voltages from 180–330 volts for flash units built into small disposable and compact cameras, increasing for units delivering higher light energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forrest Mims|Forrest M. Mims, III]], ''Forrest Mims' Circuit Scrapbook II'', Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Indianapolis IN, {{ISBN|0-672-22552-2}}, page 149. Mims gives the rating of the [[Disc film|Kodak Disc]] camera flash as 160 µF and 180 volts.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical manufacturer's range includes capacitors operating at 330–380V, with capacitance from 80 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;µF&lt;ref name=hitachi&gt;[http://www.hitachiaic.com/products/photo_flash_capacitors Hitachi Photo Flash Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt; While normal electrolytic capacitors are often operated at not more than half their nominal voltage due to their high derating, photoflash capacitors are typically operated at their nominal working voltage (labelled as "WV" or "W.V." rather than just "V"). Photoflash capacitors are not subject to the high temperatures of cased electronic equipment in continuous operation, with nearby components and sometimes the capacitors themselves dissipating heat; they are often rated at a maximum [[operating temperature]] rate of typically 55 °C, compared to 85 °C–105 °C or more for capacitors for continuous use in electronic equipment. In most electronic applications an electrolytic capacitor can have a capacitance much larger than its nominal value without detracting from circuit performance; general-purpose electrolytics are often specified to have capacitance between 20% below and 80% above rated value, although tighter tolerances are available. The light energy of a flash is proportional to the capacitance and large variations are not acceptable, typical tolerance is -10+20%.&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;

Photoflash capacitors are designed to deliver a brief pulse of very high current, and are consequently sometimes used in [[railgun]] and [[coilgun]] designs.

'''Pseudocapacitors''' store electrical energy [[Faradaic current|faradaically]] by electron charge transfer between [[electrode]] and [[electrolyte]].

A pseudocapacitor is part of an [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[capacitor]], and forms together with an [[electric double-layer capacitor]] (EDLC) to create a [[supercapacitor]].

Pseudocapacitance and [[double-layer capacitance]] add up to a common inseparable capacitance value of a supercapacitor. However, they can be effective with very different parts of the total capacitance value depending on the design of the electrodes. A pseudocapacitance may be higher by a factor of 100 as a double-layer capacitance with the same electrode surface.

A pseudocapacitor has a chemical reaction at the electrode, unlike EDLCs where the electrical charge storage is stored electrostatically with no interaction between the electrode and the ions. Pseudocapacitance is accompanied by an [[electron]] [[Charge transfer complex|charge-transfer]] between [[electrolyte]] and electrode coming from a [[Solvation|de-solvated]] and [[Adsorbtion|adsorbed]] [[ion]]. One electron per charge unit is involved. The adsorbed ion has no [[chemical reaction]] with the [[atom]]s of the electrode (no [[chemical bond]]s arise&lt;ref name="Garthwaite"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Garthwaite |author-first=Josie |title=How ultracapacitors work (and why they fall short) |url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/how-ultracapacitors-work-and-why-they-fall-short/ |work=Earth2Tech |publisher=GigaOM Network |accessdate=2013-04-23 |date=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) since only a charge-transfer takes place. An example is a redox reaction where the ion is O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and during charging, one electrode hosts a reduction reaction and the other an oxidation reaction. Under discharge the reactions are reversed.

Unlike batteries, in faradaic electron charge-transfer ions simply cling to the atomic structure of an electrode. This faradaic energy storage with only fast redox reactions makes charging and discharging much faster than batteries.

Electrochemical pseudocapacitors use [[metal oxide]] or [[conductive polymer]] electrodes with a high amount of electrochemical pseudocapacitance. The amount of [[electric charge]] stored in a pseudocapacitance is linearly proportional to the applied [[voltage]]. The unit of pseudocapacitance is the [[farad]].

==Examples of Pseudocapacitors==
Brezesinki et al. showed that mesoporous films of ''α''-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have improved charge storage due to lithium ions inserting into the gaps of ''α''-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. They claim this intercalation pseudocapacitance takes place on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance and gives better charge-storage capacity without changing kinetics in mesoporous MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This approach is promising for batteries with rapid charging ability, comparable to that of lithium batteries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last1=Brezesinski |author-first1=Torsten |author-last2=Wang |author-first2=John |author-last3=Tolbert |author-first3=Sarah H. |author-last4=Dunn |author-first4=Bruce |date=2010-02-01 |title=Ordered mesoporous α-MoO3 with iso-oriented nanocrystalline walls for thin-film pseudocapacitors |url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v9/n2/abs/nmat2612.html |journal=Nature Materials |language=en |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=146–151 |doi=10.1038/nmat2612 |issn=1476-1122 |pmid=20062048}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are promising for efficient energy materials.

Other groups have used vanadium oxide thin films on carbon nanotubes for pseudocapacitors. Kim et al. electrochemically deposited amorphous V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;·{{mvar|x}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O onto a carbon nanotube film. The three-dimensional structure of the carbon nanotubes substrate facilitates high specific lithium-ion capacitance and shows three times higher capacitance than vanadium oxide deposited on a typical Pt substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last1=Kim |author-first1=Il-Hwan |author-last2=Kim |author-first2=Jae-Hong |author-last3=Cho |author-first3=Byung-Won |author-last4=Lee |author-first4=Young-Ho |author-last5=Kim |author-first5=Kwang-Bum |date=2006-06-01 |title=Synthesis and Electrochemical Characterization of Vanadium Oxide on Carbon Nanotube Film Substrate for Pseudocapacitor Applications |url=http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/153/6/A989 |journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society |language=en |volume=153 |issue=6 |pages=A989–A996 |doi=10.1149/1.2188307 |issn=0013-4651}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies demonstrate the capability of deposited oxides to effectively store charge in pseudocapacitors.

Conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), have tunable electronic conductivity and can achieve high doping levels with the proper counterion. A high-performing conducting polymer pseudocapacitor has high cycling stability after undergoing charge/discharge cycles. Successful approaches include embedding the redox polymer in a host phase (e.g. titanium carbide) for stability and depositing a carbonaceous shell onto the conducting polymer electrode. These techniques improve cyclability and stability of the pseudocapacitor device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last1=Bryan |author-first1=Aimee M. |author-last2=Santino |author-first2=Luciano M. |author-last3=Lu |author-first3=Yang |author-last4=Acharya |author-first4=Shinjita |author-last5=D’Arcy |author-first5=Julio M. |date=2016-09-13 |title=Conducting Polymers for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage |journal=Chemistry of Materials |volume=28 |issue=17 |pages=5989–5998 |doi=10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b01762 |issn=0897-4756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rice bran wax''' is the vegetable [[wax]] extracted from the [[rice bran oil|bran oil]] of rice (''[[Oryza sativa]]'').

==Chemical Composition==
The main components of rice bran wax are [[aliphatic]] acids (wax acids) and [[fatty alcohol|higher alcohol]] [[esters]]. The aliphatic acids consist of [[palmitic acid]] (C16), [[behenic acid]] (C22), [[lignoceric acid]] (C24), other higher [[wax acid]]s. The higher alcohol esters consist mainly of [[ceryl alcohol]] (C26) and [[melissyl alcohol]] (C30). Rice bran wax also contains constituents such as free [[fatty acid]]s ([[palmitic acid]]), [[squalene]] and [[phospholipid]]s.

==Uses==
Rice bran wax is [[Eating|edible]] and can serve as a substitute for [[carnauba wax]] in most applications due to its relatively high melting point. It is used in [[paper]] coatings, [[textile]]s, [[explosive]]s, fruit &amp; vegetable coatings, [[confectionery]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[candle]]s, [[molding (process)|moulded]] [[novelties]], [[Electrical insulation|electric insulation]], [[textile]] and [[leather]] [[sizing]], [[waterproofing]], [[carbon paper]], [[typewriter ribbon]]s, [[printing]] [[ink]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[chewing gum]] and [[cosmetics]].&lt;ref name="baileys"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bailey's Industrial Oil and Fat Products |last=Orthoefer |first=F.

In cosmetics, rice bran wax is used as an [[emollient]], and is the basis material for some [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]] particles.  It has been observed that rice bran wax at concentrations as low as 1 wt% in triglycerides can crystallize to form stable gels.&lt;ref name=Dassanayake&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dassanayake|first=Lakmali|author2=Kodali, Dharma R. |author3=Ueno, S. |author4= K., Sato |title=Physical Properties of Rice Bran Wax in Bulk and Organogel|journal=Journal of the America Oil Chemist's Society|date=December 2009|volume= 86|issue= 12|doi=10.1007/s11746-009-1464-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selenium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Se''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;34. It is a [[nonmetal]] (more rarely considered a [[metalloid]]) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the [[periodic table]], [[sulfur]] and [[tellurium]], and also has similarities to [[arsenic]]. It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust. Selenium (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|el |σελήνη}} (selḗnē) "Moon") was discovered in 1817 by [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]], who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered [[tellurium]] (named for the Earth).

Selenium is found in [[:Category:Sulfide minerals|metal sulfide ores]], where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are [[glassmaking]] and [[pigment]]s. Selenium is a [[semiconductor]] and is used in [[photocell]]s. Applications in [[electronics]], once important, have been mostly replaced with [[silicon]] semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power [[surge protector]]s and one type of [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[quantum dot]].

Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, including [[infant formula]].  It is a component of the antioxidant enzymes [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[thioredoxin reductase]] (which indirectly reduce certain [[Redox|oxidized]] molecules in animals and some plants). It is also found in three [[deiodinase]] enzymes, which convert one [[thyroid hormone]] to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently requiring none.&lt;ref name="Ruyle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cals.arizona.edu/arec/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |format= PDF |title= Poisonous Plants on Arizona Rangelands |first= George |last= Ruyle |accessdate= 2009-01-05 |publisher= The University of Arizona |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040715194026/http://cals.arizona.edu/AREC/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |archivedate= 2004-07-15 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[File:Selenium trigonal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Structure of hexagonal (gray) selenium]]
Selenium forms several [[allotrope]]s that interconvert with temperature changes, depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads.&lt;ref name="house2008"&gt;{{cite book|title= Inorganic chemistry| first= James E.|last= House| publisher= Academic Press| date= 2008| isbn= 978-0-12-356786-4| page= 524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in [[carbon disulfide|CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Upon heating, it softens at 50&amp;nbsp;°C and converts to gray selenium at 180&amp;nbsp;°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and [[amine]]s.&lt;ref name=ge&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|pages=751–752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red α, β, and γ forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation rate of the solvent (usually CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). They all have relatively low, [[monoclinic]] crystal symmetries and contain nearly identical puckered Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; rings with different arrangements, as in [[sulfur]]. The packing is most dense in the α form. In the Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; rings, the Se-Se distance is 233.5 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 105.7°. Other selenium allotropes may contain Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or Se&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; rings.&lt;ref name=ge/&gt;

The most stable and dense form of selenium is gray and has a hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3&amp;nbsp;pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6&amp;nbsp;pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable [[photoconductivity]]. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=ge/&gt; It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing [[acids]]. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.&lt;ref name="house2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|nDEfR2Nw50s|Video of selenium heating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical properties ===
Owing to its use as a photoconductor in flat-panel x-ray detectors (see [[#Photoconductors|below]]), the optical properties of amorphous selenium (α-Se) thin films have been the subject of intense research.&lt;ref name=Jafar2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafar|first=Mousa M.

=== Isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of selenium}}

Selenium has seven natural [[isotope]]s, including [[Selenium-79|&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Se]], which occurs in minute quantities in [[uranium]] ores, as well as 23 other synthetic isotopes.

==Chemical compounds==
{{see also|Category:Selenium compounds|organoselenium chemistry}}
Selenium compounds commonly exist in the [[oxidation state]]s −2, +2, +4, and +6.

===Chalcogen compounds===
Selenium forms two [[oxide]]s: [[selenium dioxide]] (SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[selenium trioxide]] (SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Selenium dioxide is formed by the reaction of elemental selenium with oxygen:&lt;ref name="house2008"/&gt;
:Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[File:Selenium-dioxide-chain-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|Structure of the polymer SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: The (pyramidal) Se atoms are yellow.]]
It is a [[polymer]]ic solid that forms monomeric SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in the gas phase. It dissolves in water to form [[selenous acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Selenous acid can also be made directly by oxidizing elemental selenium with [[nitric acid]]:&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"&gt;{{cite book|title= Inorganic chemistry|last1= Wiberg |first1=Egon|last2= Wiberg |first2=Nils|last3= Holleman |first3=Arnold Frederick|publisher= Academic Press|date= 2001|location= San Diego|isbn= 978-0-12-352651-9|page= 583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 Se + 4 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NO
Unlike sulfur, which forms a stable [[sulfur trioxide|trioxide]], selenium trioxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to the dioxide above 185&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref name="house2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;

:2 SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔH = −54&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol)
Selenium trioxide is produced in the laboratory by the reaction of [[anhydrous]] [[potassium selenate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and sulfur trioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt (chemistry)|Salts]] of selenous acid are called selenites. These include [[silver selenite]] (Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium selenite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[Hydrogen sulfide]] reacts with aqueous selenous acid to produce [[selenium disulfide]]:
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → SeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Selenium disulfide consists of 8-membered rings. It has an approximate composition of SeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with individual rings varying in composition, such as Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Selenium disulfide has been used in shampoo as an anti[[dandruff]] agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in [[fireworks]].&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;

Selenium trioxide may be synthesized by dehydrating [[selenic acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is itself produced by the oxidation of selenium dioxide with [[hydrogen peroxide]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi = 10.1002/9780470132517.ch9|last1= Seppelt |first1=K.|last2= Desmarteau |first2=Darryl D.|title= Selenoyl difluoride|date= 1980|volume= 20|pages= 36–38|isbn= 978-0-471-07715-2|series= Inorganic Syntheses}} The report describes the synthesis of selenic acid.&lt;/ref&gt;
:SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Hot, concentrated selenic acid can react with gold to form gold(III) selenate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = V.| title = Action of selenic acid on gold| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 24| issue = 4| pages = 354–355| date=April 1902 | last1 = Lenher| doi = 10.1021/ja02018a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halogen compounds===
[[Iodide]]s of selenium are not well known. The only stable [[chloride]] is [[selenium monochloride]] (Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which might be better known as selenium(I) chloride; the corresponding [[bromide]] is also known. These species are structurally analogous to the corresponding [[disulfur dichloride]]. Selenium dichloride is an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds (e.g. the preparation of Se&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). It is prepared by treating selenium with [[sulfuryl chloride]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 24 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 SeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

In comparison with its sulfur counterpart ([[sulfur hexafluoride]]), [[selenium hexafluoride]] (SeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is more reactive and is a toxic [[pulmonary]] irritant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Proctor and Hughes' chemical hazards of the workplace| first1 = Nick H.|last1= Proctor

Some of the selenium oxyhalides, such as [[selenium oxyfluoride]] (SeOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[selenium oxychloride]] (SeOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) have been used as specialty solvents.&lt;ref name="house2008"/&gt;

===Selenides===
Analogous to the behavior of other chalcogens, selenium forms [[hydrogen selenide]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se. It is a strongly [[wikt:odiferous|odiferous]], toxic, and colorless gas. It is more acidic than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. In solution it ionizes to HSe&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The selenide dianion Se&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include [[mercury selenide]] (HgSe), [[lead selenide]] (PbSe), [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe), and [[copper indium gallium diselenide]] (Cu(Ga,In)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). These materials are [[semiconductor]]s. With highly electropositive metals, such as [[aluminium]], these selenides are prone to hydrolysis:&lt;ref name="house2008"/&gt;
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se
Alkali metal selenides react with selenium to form polyselenides, {{chem|Se|n|2-}}, which exist as chains.

===Other compounds===
Tetraselenium tetranitride, Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is an explosive orange compound analogous to [[tetrasulfur tetranitride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="house2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Woollins|first1= Derek |title= The Reactivity of Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in Liquid Ammonia|journal= [[Polyhedron (journal)|Polyhedron]]|date= 1993|volume= 12|pages= 1129–1133|doi= 10.1016/S0277-5387(00)88201-7|issue= 10 |last2= Kelly |first2= Paul F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kelly| first1=P.

:8 KCN + Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 KSeCN

===Organoselenium compounds===
{{main|Organoselenium chemistry}}
Selenium, especially in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to [[carbon]], which are structurally analogous to the corresponding [[organosulfur compounds]]. Especially common are selenides (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, analogues of [[thioether]]s), diselenides (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, analogues of [[disulfide]]s), and [[selenol]]s (RSeH, analogues of [[thiol]]s). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively [[selenomethionine]], [[diphenyldiselenide]], and [[benzeneselenol]]. The [[sulfoxide]] in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, as illustrated by the [[selenoxide elimination]] reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the [[double bond rule]], selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Erker | first1 = G.| last2 = Hock| last3 = Krüger| last4 = Werner| last5 = Klärner| last6 = Artschwager-Perl| title = Synthesis and Cycloadditions of Monomeric Selenobenzophenone| journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English| volume = 29| issue = 9| pages = 1067–1068| year = 1990 | doi = 10.1002/anie.199010671 | first2 = R. | first3 = C. | first4 = S. | first5 = F.

==History==
Selenium ([[Greek language|Greek]] σελήνη ''[[selene]]'' meaning "Moon") was discovered in 1817 by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] and [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berzelius|first1=J.J.|title=Lettre de M. Berzelius à M. Berthollet sur deux métaux nouveaux|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1818|volume=7|pages=199–206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBIAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA199|series=2nd series|trans-title=Letter from Mr. Berzelius to Mr. Berthollet on two new metals|language=French}}  From p. 203:  ''"Cependant, pour rappeler les rapports de cette dernière avec le tellure, je l'ai nommée sélénium."'' (However, in order to recall the relationships of this latter [substance (viz, selenium)] to tellurium, I have named it "selenium".)&lt;/ref&gt; Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near [[Gripsholm]], Sweden, producing [[sulfuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]]. The pyrite from the [[Great Copper Mountain|Falun mine]] created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like [[horseradish]] when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from [[tellurium]] compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to [[Alexander Marcet]] stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the [[Great Copper Mountain|Falun mine]] minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to [[sulfur]] and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1021/ed009p474|title= The discovery of the elements.

In 1873, [[Willoughby Smith]] found that the electrical resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The first commercial products using selenium were developed by [[Werner Siemens]] in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell was used in the [[photophone]] developed by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of [[light meter]]s and similar devices.

Selenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to [[human being]]s working in industries. Selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin, which is seen in animals that have eaten high-selenium plants. In 1954, the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in [[microorganism]]s by biochemist, [[Jane Gibson|Jane Pinsent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc =1269698|title =The need for selenite and molybdate in the formation of formic dehydrogenase by members of the Coli-aerogenes group of bacteria|volume =57|issue =1|journal=Biochem.

==Occurrence==
[[File:Selenium in sandstone Westwater Canyon Section 23 Mine Grants, New Mexico.jpg|thumb|Native selenium in sandstone, from a uranium mine near [[Grants, New Mexico]]]]
{{Category see also|Selenide minerals}}
Native (i.e., elemental) selenium is a rare mineral, which does not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= Webminerals|url= http://www.galleries.com/minerals/elements/selenium/selenium.htm |title= Native Selenium |accessdate= 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements.

Selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms, including [[selenide]], [[selenate]], and [[Selenite (ion)|selenite]], but these minerals are rare. The common mineral [[selenite (mineral)|selenite]] is not a selenium mineral, and contains no [[Selenite (ion)|selenite ion]], but is rather a type of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.&lt;ref name="geosel1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 9726787|date= 1998|last1= Kabata-Pendias|first1= A.|title= Geochemistry of selenium|volume= 17|issue= 3–4|pages= 173–177|journal= Journal of Environmental Pathology, Toxicology and Oncology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geosel2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[94:SGAH]2.0.CO;2|volume= 36|pages= 94–97|title= Selenium Geochemistry and Health|last1= Fordyce|first1= Fiona|journal= AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In living systems, selenium is found in the amino acids [[selenomethionine]], [[selenocysteine]], and [[methylselenocysteine]]. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring [[organoselenium compound]] is dimethyl selenide.&lt;ref name="biol1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1515/BC.2007.138|title = Selenium in chemistry and biochemistry in comparison to sulfur|date = 2007|last1 = Wessjohann|first1 = Ludger A.|last2 = Schneider|first2 = Alex|last3 = Abbas|first3 = Muhammad|last4 = Brandt|first4 = Wolfgang|journal = Biological Chemistry|volume = 388|issue = 10|pages = 997–1006|pmid = 17937613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biol1a"&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1039/B205802M|title =Trends in selenium biochemistry|date =2002|last1 =Birringer|first1 =Marc|last2 =Pilawa|first2 =Sandra|last3 =Flohé|first3 =Leopold|journal =Natural Product Reports|volume =19|issue =6|pages =693–718|pmid =12521265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain solids are selenium-rich, and selenium can be [[bioaccumulation|bioconcentrated]] by some plants. In soils, selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff.&lt;ref name="geosel1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geosel2"/&gt; Ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00370-3|title= Role of oceans as biogenic sources of selenium|date= 2001|last1= Amouroux|first1= David|last2= Liss|first2=Peter S.|last3= Tessier|first3= Emmanuel|last4= Hamren-Larsson|first4= Marie|last5= Donard|first5= Olivier F.X|journal= Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume= 189|issue= 3–4|pages= 277–283|bibcode= 2001E&amp;PSL.189..277A |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1080/08910600701698986|title =How to use the world's scarce selenium resources efficiently to increase the selenium concentration in food|date =2007|last1 =Haug|first1 =Anna|last2 =Graham|first2 =Robin D.|last3 =Christophersen|first3 =Olav A.|last4 =Lyons|first4 =Graham H.|journal =Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease|volume =19|issue =4|pages =209–228|pmid =18833333|pmc =2556185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning, and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c1.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title= Public Health Statement: Selenium |accessdate= 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Selenium is most commonly produced from [[selenide]] in many [[sulfide]] [[ore]]s, such as those of [[copper]], [[nickel]], or [[lead]]. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the [[anode]] mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the [[Lead chamber process|lead chambers]] of [[sulfuric acid]] plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of [[Refining (metallurgy)|refining]] copper or producing [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c5.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title= Public Health Statement: Selenium – Production, Import/Export, Use, and Disposal |accessdate= 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Se/key.html |title= Chemistry: Periodic Table: selenium: key information |accessdate= 2009-01-06 |publisher= webelements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its invention, [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/S0301-4207(03)00025-4|title= SX-EW copper and the technology cycle|date= 2002|last1= Bartos|first1=P. J.|journal= Resources Policy|volume= 28|issue= 3–4|pages= 85–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.&lt;ref name="Naumov"/&gt;

Industrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of [[selenium dioxide]] from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with [[sodium carbonate]] to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed with water and [[acid]]ified to form [[selenous acid]] ([[oxidation]] step). Selenous acid is bubbled with [[sulfur dioxide]] ([[Redox|reduction]] step) to give elemental selenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/BF03220269|title= Recovering selenium and tellurium from copper refinery slimes|date= 1989|last1= Hoffmann|first1= James E.|journal= JOM|volume= 41|issue= 7|pages= 33–38|bibcode= 1989JOM....41g..33H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/BF03220271|title= Recovering selenium from copper refinery slimes|date= 1989|last1= Hyvärinen|first1= Olli|last2= Lindroos|first2= Leo|last3= Yllö|first3= Erkki|journal= JOM|volume= 41|issue= 7|pages= 42–43|bibcode = 1989JOM....41g..42H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://eprints.nmlindia.org/2071/--&gt;

About 2,000 tonnes of selenium were produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in Germany (650 t), Japan (630 t), Belgium (200 t), and Russia (140 t), and the total reserves were estimated at 93,000 tonnes. These data exclude two major producers, the United States and China.  A previous sharp increase was observed in 2004 from 4–5 to $27/lb. The price was relatively stable during 2004–2010 at about US$30 per pound (in 100-pound lots) but increased to $65 /lb in 2011. The consumption in 2010 was divided as follows: metallurgy – 30%, glass manufacturing – 30%, agriculture – 10%, chemicals and pigments – 10%, and electronics – 10%. China is the dominant consumer of selenium at 1,500–2,000 tonnes/year.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

==Applications==

===Manganese electrolysis===
During the [[electro winning]] of manganese, the addition of selenium dioxide decreases the power necessary to operate the [[Electrolytic cell|electrolysis cells]]. China is the largest consumer of selenium dioxide for this purpose. For every tonne of manganese, an average 2&amp;nbsp;kg selenium oxide is used.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{cite web|title= Selenium and Tellurium: Statistics and Information|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/selenium/|publisher= United States Geological Survey |accessdate= 2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.111|title= Studies of the reduction mechanism of selenium dioxide and its impact on the microstructure of manganese electrodeposit|date= 2011|last1= Sun|first1= Yan|last2= Tian|first2= Xike|last3= He|first3= Binbin|last4= Yang|first4= Chao|last5= Pi|first5= Zhenbang|last6= Wang|first6= Yanxin|last7= Zhang|first7= Suxin|journal= Electrochimica Acta|volume= 56|issue= 24|pages= 8305–8310 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--http://www.asianmetal.com/report/en/2008mn_en.pdf--&gt;

===Glass production===
The largest commercial use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, is for the production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Bernd E. Langner "Selenium and Selenium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alloys===
Selenium is used with [[bismuth]] in [[brass]]es to replace more toxic [[lead]]. The regulation of lead in drinking water applications with the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sxkPJzmkhnUC&amp;pg=PA91|page= 91|title= Copper and Copper Alloys|isbn= 978-0-87170-726-0|last1= Davis|first1=Joseph R.|date= 2001 |publisher= ASM Int. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=SZ1RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA378--&gt; Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QahG1Ou1cyEC&amp;pg=PA67|page= 67|title= Cutting Data for Turning of Steel|isbn= 978-0-8311-3314-6|last1= Isakov|first1= Edmund|date= 2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/BF00708374|title= Effect of selenium on the structure and properties of structural steel|date= 1979|last1= Gol'Dshtein|first1=Ya.

===Lithium–selenium batteries===
Lithium–selenium (Li–Se) battery is one of the most promising system for energy storage in the family of lithium batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1039/C6SE00094K|title= The rise of lithium–selenium batteries|date= 2017|last1= Eftekhari|first1=Ali|journal= Sustainable Energy &amp; Fuels|volume= 1|pages= 14–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li–Se battery is an alternative to [[Lithium–sulfur battery]] with an advantage of high electrical conductivity.

=== Rectifiers ===
Beginning from 1933 until the 1990s, Selenium was used for rectifiers, the such called [[selenium rectifier]]s.

===Other uses===

Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although it was still a large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, [[selenium rectifier]]s have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC [[surge protection]], where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than [[metal oxide varistor]]s.

[[Zinc selenide]] was the first material for blue [[LED]]s, but gallium nitride dominates that market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D2zyNlMu7kkC&amp;pg=PA57|page= 57|chapter= The birth of the Blues|first= Dennis|last= Normile|title= Popular Science|date =2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadmium selenide]] was an important component in [[quantum dot]]s.

Selenium is a catalyst in some chemical reactions, but it is not widely used because of issues with toxicity. In [[X-ray crystallography]], incorporation of one or more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and [[single wavelength anomalous dispersion]] phasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1098/rspa.1993.0087|title= New Techniques of Applying Multi-Wavelength Anomalous Scattering Data|date= 1993|last1= Hai-Fu|first1= F.|last2= Woolfson|first2=M.

Although it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral{{clarify|date=August 2018}}, sometimes in toxic proportions in [[forage]] (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as [[locoweed]], require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil).&lt;ref name="Ruyle" /&gt; See more on plant nutrition below.{{ clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = plant nutrition below where?}}

Selenium is a component of the unusual [[amino acid]]s [[selenocysteine]] and [[selenomethionine]]. In humans, selenium is a [[dietary mineral|trace element]] nutrient that functions as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for [[redox|reduction]] of [[antioxidant]] enzymes, such as [[glutathione peroxidase]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University] lpi.oregonstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt; and certain forms of [[thioredoxin reductase]] found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).

The [[glutathione peroxidase]] family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze certain reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] and organic [[hydroperoxide]]s:

:2 GSH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;----GSH-Px → GSSG + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The thyroid gland and every cell that uses thyroid hormone use selenium, which is a cofactor for the three of the four known types of [[thyroid hormone]] [[deiodinase]]s, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites; the [[iodothyronine deiodinase]]s are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine. (Only the deiodinase, [[iodotyrosine deiodinase]], which works on the last breakdown products of thyroid hormone, does not use selenium.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ |publisher= Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University |title= Selenium |accessdate= 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution in biology===
{{Main|Evolution of dietary antioxidants}}

From about three billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein families drive the evolution of selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,&lt;ref name="glady"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals |journal=Journal of Biomedical Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |date=1999 |pmid=10343164 |doi=10.1007/BF02255899 |last1=Gladyshev |first1=Vadim N. |last2=Hatfield |first2=Dolph L.|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biochemgladyshev/77 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules [[glutathione]] and [[thioredoxin]]. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the [[glutathione peroxidase]]s) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals ([[thioredoxin reductase]]) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stadtman |first=T. C. |title=Selenocysteine |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=65 |pages=83–100 |date=1996 |pmid=8811175 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.000503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]], may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas.&lt;ref name="glady" /&gt; Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their selenoproteomes, whereas the selenoproteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that, with the exception of [[vertebrate]]s, aquatic life supports selenium use, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life |journal=Genome Biology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=R198 |date=2007 |pmid=17880704 |pmc=2375036 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r198 |last1=Lobanov |first1=Alexey V. |last2=Fomenko |first2=Dmitri E. |last3=Zhang |first3=Yan |last4=Sengupta |first4=Aniruddha |last5=Hatfield |first5=Dolph L. |last6=Gladyshev |first6=Vadim N. |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 million years ago, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of "new" endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C), [[polyphenol]]s (including flavonoids), [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The deiodinase [[Isozyme|isoenzymes]] constitute another family of eukaryotic selenoproteins with identified enzyme function. Deiodinases are able to extract electrons from iodides, and iodides from iodothyronines. They are, thus, involved in thyroid-hormone regulation, participating in the protection of [[Thyroid epithelial cell|thyrocytes]] from damage by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced for thyroid-hormone biosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Venturi |first= Sebastiano |last2= Venturi |first2= Mattia |title= Evolution of Dietary Antioxidant Defences |newspaper= European EpiMarker |volume= 11 |issue= 3|date= 2007 |pages= 1–11 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastiano_Venturi2/publication/234162439_epimarker_3_07_Antioxidants/links/02bfe50fa320b02e18000000.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 million years ago, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reconsidering the evolution of eukaryotic selenoproteins: a novel nonmammalian family with scattered phylogenetic distribution |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–7 |date=2004 |pmid=14710190 |pmc=1298953 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400036 |last1=Castellano |first1=Sergi |last2=Novoselov |first2=Sergey V. |last3=Kryukov |first3=Gregory V. |last4=Lescure |first4=Alain |last5=Blanco |first5=Enrique |last6=Krol |first6=Alain |last7=Gladyshev |first7=Vadim N. |last8=Guigó |first8=Roderic |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The prokaryotic selenoproteome |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=538–43 |date=2004 |pmid=15105824 |pmc=1299047 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400126 |last1=Kryukov |first1=Gregory V. |last2=Gladyshev |first2=Vadim N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Selenoprotein synthesis in archaea: identification of an mRNA element of Methanococcus jannaschii probably directing selenocysteine insertion |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=266 |issue=4 |pages=637–41 |date=1997 |pmid=9102456 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0812 |last1=Wilting |first1=R. |last2=Schorling |first2=S. |last3=Persson |first3=B.

===Nutritional sources of selenium===
Dietary selenium comes from nuts, cereals and mushrooms. [[Brazil nut]]s are the richest dietary source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Barclay |first= Margaret N. I. |date= 1995 |title=Selenium content of a range of UK food |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 307–318 |doi= 10.1006/jfca.1995.1025 |last2= MacPherson |first2= Allan |last3= Dixon |first3= James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of selenium-rich foods can be found on [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h2 The Office of Dietary Supplements Selenium Fact Sheet].&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (RDA) for teenagers and adults is 55&amp;nbsp;µg/day.
Selenium as a dietary supplement is available in many forms, including multi-vitamins/mineral supplements, which typically contain 55 or 70&amp;nbsp;µg/serving.  Selenium-specific supplements typically contain either 100 or 200&amp;nbsp;µg/serving.

In June 2015 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published its final rule establishing the requirement of minimum and maximum levels of selenium in [[infant formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FDA Issues Final Rule to Add Selenium to List of Required Nutrients for Infant Formula|url = http://www.fda.gov/Food/NewsEvents/ConstituentUpdates/ucm451982.htm|website = www.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-10|archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20171114120142/https://www.fda.gov/Food/NewsEvents/ConstituentUpdates/ucm451982.htm|archive-date = November 14, 2017|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selenium content in the human body is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.&lt;ref&gt;A common reference for this is {{cite journal|pmid =4926392|date =1970|last1 =Schroeder|first1 = H.

===Indicator plant species===
Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil because they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are ''[[Astragalus]]'' species (including some [[locoweed]]s), prince's plume (''[[Stanleya (plant)|Stanleya]]'' sp.), woody asters (''[[Xylorhiza]]'' sp.), and false goldenweed (''[[Oonopsis]]'' sp.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/54282000/PPClassPPSlides/3-27-08DavisSelenium.pdf |title= Selenium in Plants |accessdate= 2008-12-05 |last= Zane Davis |first=T. |date= 2008-03-27 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection in biological fluids===
Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= R.|last= Baselt|title= Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition= 8th|publisher= Biomedical Publications|place= Foster City, CA|date= 2008|pages= 1416–1420|isbn= 978-0-9626523-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicity===
Although selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|trace element]], it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 |title= Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium |publisher= National Institutes of Health; Office of Dietary Supplements |accessdate= 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 400&amp;nbsp;[[Microgram|µg]] Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids |publisher= Institute of Medicine |date= August 15, 2000 |pages= 314–315 |url= http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&amp;page=315 |isbn= 978-0-309-06949-6 |author= Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, Subcommittees on Upper Reference Levels of Nutrients and Interpretation and Uses of DRIs, Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yang |first1=G.|last2= Zhou |first2=R.|date= 1994 |title= Further Observations on the Human Maximum Safe Dietary Selenium Intake in a Seleniferous Area of China |journal= Journal of Trace Elements and Electrolytes in Health and Disease |volume= 8 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 159–165 |pmid=7599506
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous [[shale]]) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yang |first1=Guang-Qi|last2= Xia |first2=Yi-Ming|date= 1995 |title= Studies on Human Dietary Requirements and Safe Range of Dietary Intakes of Selenium in China and Their Application in the Prevention of Related Endemic Diseases |journal= Biomedical and Environmental Sciences |volume= 8 |issue= 3|pages= 187–201 |pmid= 8561918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs and symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, [[sloughing]] of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pulmonary edema]], or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c3.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title= Public Health Statement: Health Effects |accessdate= 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elemental selenium and most metallic [[selenide]]s have relatively low toxicities because of low [[bioavailability]]. By contrast, [[selenate]]s and [[Selenite (ion)|selenites]] have an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide and are very toxic.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, [[selenomethionine]], [[selenocysteine]] and [[methylselenocysteine]], all of which have high [[bioavailability]] and are toxic in large doses.

On 19 April 2009, 21 [[polo]] ponies died shortly before a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a pharmacy released a statement explaining that the horses had received an incorrect dose of one of the ingredients used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly prepared by a [[compounding pharmacy]]. Analysis of blood levels of [[inorganic compound]]s in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were ten to fifteen times higher than normal in the [[blood sample]]s, and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in the liver samples. Selenium was later confirmed to be the toxic factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-05-06| url= http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/news/2009/05/033.shtml| title= Polo pony selenium levels up to 20 times higher than normal| accessdate= 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selenium Pollution|Selenium poisoning]] of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates. Selenium pollution of waterways also occurs when selenium is leached from coal flue ash, mining and metal smelting, crude oil processing, and landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemly|first=D.|title=Aquatic selenium pollution is a global environmental safety issue|journal=Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety|date=2004|volume=59|issue=1|pages=44–56|doi=10.1016/S0147-6513(03)00095-2|pmid=15261722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant high selenium levels in waterways were found to cause congenital disorders in oviparous species, including wetland birds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qN0I3husm50C&amp;pg=PA477 |title= Ecotoxicology of selenium |series= Handbook of ecotoxicology |first=H.

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) for selenium in the workplace at 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[Recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, selenium is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Selenium|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0550.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deficiency===
{{main|Selenium deficiency}}
Selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised [[intestine|intestinal]] function, those undergoing [[total parenteral nutrition]], and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/2/590 |title= Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged ≥90 y |volume= 71 |issue= 2 |pages= 590–598 |journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |pmid= 10648276 |date=2000 |last1= Ravaglia |first1=G.|last2= Forti |first2=P. |last3= Maioli |first3=F. |last4= Bastagli |first4=L. |last5= Facchini |first5=A. |last6= Mariani |first6=E. |last7= Savarino |first7=L. |last8= Sassi |first8=S. |last9= Cucinotta |first9=D. |last10=Lenaz |first10=G. |display-authors=3|doi= 10.1093/ajcn/71.2.590 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although [[New Zealand]] soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/Sel.htm |website= Prescriber Update Articles |title= Selenium |accessdate= 2009-07-13 |publisher= New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |author= MedSafe Editorial Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium deficiency, defined by low (&lt;60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues, occurs only when a low selenium level is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralston |first1=N. V. C.|last2=Raymond |first2=L. J.|title=Dietary selenium's protective effects against methylmercury toxicity|journal=Toxicology|date=2010|volume=278|pages=112–123|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2010.06.004|pmid=20561558|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or increased oxidant stress from vitamin E deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Essentials of Human Nutrition |edition= 2nd |publisher= Oxford University Press |date= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-19-262756-8 |first1= Jim |last1= Mann |first2= A. Stewart |last2= Truswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium interacts with other nutrients, such as [[iodine]] and [[vitamin E]]. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to [[Kashin-Beck disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/137?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=selenium&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |title= Selenium and iodine supplementation of rural Tibetan children affected by Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy |first1=R. |last1= Moreno-Reyes |first2=F. |last2= Mathieu |first3=M. |last3= Boelaert |first4=F. |last4= Begaux |first5=C. |last5= Suetens |first6=M.

High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio and lead to Zn reduction; in such treatment cases, Zn levels should be monitored. Further studies are needed to confirm these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092144881200380X |title= The effect of dietary organic and inorganic selenium supplementation on serum Se, Cu, Fe and Zn status during the late pregnancy in Merghoz goats and their kids|first1=R.|last1 =Kachuee |first2=M. |last2= Moeini |first3=M. |last3= Suori |volume= 110 |issue= 1 |pages= 20–27 |journal= Small Ruminant Research |date=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the regions (e.g. various regions within North America) where low selenium soil levels lead to low concentrations in the plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, Subcommittee on Sheep Nutrition (1985). ''Nutrient requirements of sheep''. 6th ed., National Academy Press, Washington, {{ISBN|0309035961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruminant]]s are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain.&lt;ref name=NRCsr2007&gt;National Research Council, Committee on Nutrient Requirements of Small Ruminants (2007). ''Nutrient requirements of small ruminants''. National Academies Press, Washington, {{ISBN|0-309-10213-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some [[white clover]] varieties containing [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s, may have higher selenium requirements,&lt;ref name=NRCsr2007/&gt; presumably because cyanide is released from the [[aglycone]] by [[glucosidase]] activity in the rumen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coop |first1=I.

===Controversial health effects===
{{main|Selenium in biology}}
A number of correlative epidemiological studies have implicated selenium deficiency (measured by blood levels) in a number of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer,&lt;ref name="jn.nutrition"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://jn.nutrition.org/content/128/11/1845.full.pdf|pmid= 9808633|date= 1998|last1= Ip|first1=C.|title= Lessons from basic research in selenium and cancer prevention|volume= 128|issue= 11|pages= 1845–54|journal= The Journal of Nutrition|doi= 10.1093/jn/128.11.1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amaral|first1=A.

In addition, selenium supplementation has been found to be a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents.

'''Shilendra Kumar Singh''' or '''S.K. Singh''' (24 January 1932 – 1 December 2009) was an Indian diplomat. He was [[Governor of Arunachal Pradesh]] from December 2004 to September 2007 and [[Governor of Rajasthan]] from September 2007 until he died in office in December 2009.

Singh was [[Indian Foreign Secretary]] from 1989 to 1990. Prior to becoming Governor of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], he was secretary-general of a [[think tank]] in Delhi, the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India. He was appointed as Governor of [[Rajasthan]] on 19 August 2007,&lt;ref name=Tiwari&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-08-20/india/27976001_1_nagaland-governor-b-l-joshi-t-n-chaturvedi "Tiwari appointed new Andhra governor"], IST, TNN (''The Times of India''), 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; left his position as Governor of Arunachal Pradesh on 4 September 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200709041866.htm "Sankaranarayan takes additional charge as Arunachal Governor"], PTI (''The Hindu''), 4 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn in as Governor of Rajasthan on 6 September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/004200709061551.htm "S.K. Singh takes oath as Governor of Rajasthan"], PTI (''The Hindu''), 6 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was the son of a nationalist zamindar of the erstwhile United Provinces, and a former Dewan of [[Alwar]]. A topper throughout school and college, he was an alumnus of [[St Johns College, Agra]] which is affiliated to [[Agra University]] where he received a bachelor's degree in History, Sanskrit and Hindi. He attended the [[Agra University]] and received a master's degree in History and an LLB Degree. Thereafter he read Persian and International Law at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].{{cn|date=December 2014}}

He was married to Manju Singh.  His younger son [[Kanishka Singh]] is a political aide to [[Rahul Gandhi]] and his elder son, Shashank Singh, has an MBA from Harvard University, and currently works as an investment banker in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/20/stories/2009022057410500.htm |title=Archive News |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Gubernatorial tenure===
While in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], Singh was an extremely vocal advocate articulating that Arunachal Pradesh is a non-negotiable part of sovereign India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/14/asia/AS_GEN_India_China_Disputed_Territory.php "India rejects China's claim to its northeastern region ahead of Chinese president's visit"], AP (''The International Herald Tribune''), 14 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He also crusaded for the [[Inner Line Permit]] and restricted area permit required for travel to Arunachal Pradesh to be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050222/asp/northeast/story_4408096.asp "Governor fuels debate on ILP"], (''The Telegraph''), 22 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he worked hard for ensuring connectivity of Arunachal Pradesh with the rest of India by building an airport in the state, constructing a railway line and improving the road network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20060725/16079.htm "No cars please, we only know helicopters!"], (''India e News''), 25 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career as a diplomat===
In February 1989, Singh was appointed Foreign Secretary of India.  He held the personal rank of Grade-I Ambassador, the highest in the [[Indian Foreign Service]].  Prior to becoming Foreign Secretary, he was India's longest serving Ambassador to [[Pakistan]] from 1985 until 1989.  He also served as Ambassador to [[Austria]] from 1982–1985, Additional Foreign Secretary from 1979–1982, Ambassador to [[Afghanistan]] from 1977–1979 and Ambassador concurrently to [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Cyprus]] from 1974–1977.  He was the longest-serving Official Spokesman of the Government of India from 1969–74.  In 1968–69 he served in the Ministry of Commerce as Director Foreign Trade.

Singh began his career in the Indian Foreign Service in 1954. From 1956 to 1959, he was Third Secretary in [[Iran]] and concurrently attended the Tehran University to study the Persian language. From 1959–62 he was assigned to various desks in the Foreign Office in Delhi. From 1962–68 he was a member of the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations in New York.

Singh was President of the [[Group of 77]] and also served as India's Governor on the Board of Governors of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] in Vienna.  Singh has been a member of 19 Indian delegations to the [[UN General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].  Singh has monitored for the [[Commonwealth]] and the United Nations, general elections in South Africa, [[Kenya]], [[Algeria]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]] and [[Sierra Leone]] 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecommonwealth.org/press/31555/34582/140745/commonwealth_to_observe_presidential_and_parliamen.htm "Commonwealth to Observe Presidential and Parliamentary Elections in Sierra Leone"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605025848/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/press/31555/34582/140745/commonwealth_to_observe_presidential_and_parliamen.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}, Commonwealth Secretariat, 16 February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and the presidential election in [[Sri Lanka]]. Singh is rated among the most distinguished in his generation of Indian diplomats.

{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2012}}

[[Image:Diving.jpg|thumb|right|Diving from a springboard]]
A '''springboard''' or '''diving board''' is used for [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and is a board that is itself a [[Spring (device)|spring]], i.e. a linear flex-spring, of the [[cantilever]] type.

Springboards are commonly fixed by a [[hinge]] at one end (so they can be flipped up when not in use), and the other end usually hangs over a [[swimming pool]], with a point midway between the hinge and the end resting on an adjustable [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]].

==Springboard materials==
Modern springboards are made out of a single-piece extrusion of aircraft-grade aluminum. The Maxiflex Model B, the board used in all major competitive diving events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diving.about.com/od/facilities/a/cheeseboard.htm|title=Why a Diving Board Has Holes|first=Woody|last=Franklin|publisher=About.com|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made out of such aluminum, and is heat treated for a yield strength of {{Convert |340000 |kPa| abbr=on |sp=us}}. The slip-resistant surface of the board is created using an epoxy resin, finished with a laminate of flint silica and alumina in between the top coats of resin. This thermal-cured resin is aqua-colored to match the water of a clean pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duraflexinternational.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_22&amp;products_id=31 duraflexinternational.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727214818/http://www.duraflexinternational.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_22&amp;products_id=31 |date=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjustment of the spring constant==
[[Image:AdjFulcrum.jpg|thumb|right|Adjusting fulcrum with foot prior to a dive]]

The [[spring constant]] of a springboard is usually adjusted by way of a fulcrum that is located approximately mid way along the springboard. Springboards are usually operated in a linear regime where they approximately obey [[Hooke's law]]. When loaded with a diver, the combination of the diver's approximately constant [[mass]], and the constant [[stiffness]] of the spring(board) result in a [[resonance|resonance frequency]] that is adjustable by way of the spring constant (set by the fulcrum position). Since the resulting system is in an approximately linear regime, it may be modeled fairly accurately by a second order [[differential equation]]. Typically the resonance frequency can be adjusted over a range of a 2:1 or 3:1 [[ratio]].&lt;ref name="UNC CH"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030525160250/http://www.unc.edu/~lahol/ The Physics of Springboard and Platform Diving]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjusting the fulcrum==
The fulcrum of competitive diving boards travels over a range of {{convert|0.61|m|in|abbr=off}},&lt;ref&gt;http://diving.about.com/od/facilities/tp/anatBoard.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and is set by way of a foot wheel that is approximately {{convert|0.35|m|in|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]].&lt;ref name="UNC CH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DuraFlex"&gt;[http://diving.about.com/od/divingglossary/g/fulcrumDef.htm Diving Fulcrum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anatomy"&gt;[http://diving.about.com/od/facilities/tp/anatBoard.htm Duraflex International/Coach woody Franklyn: diving board construction].&lt;/ref&gt; To stiffen the spring (as if tightening it), the foot wheel is usually turned counter clockwise. Some may find this counter intuitive, since usually things are tightened by turning clockwise. However, with a little experience, people realize the fulcrum moves in the direction the bottom of the foot faces when placed on the foot wheel.

:Note – Standing behind or in front of the knob, rather than directly above it, will provide better [[lever]]age to move the fulcrum. This is accomplished by holding on to the hand rails and leaning the body a few degrees, then placing the foot as low as possible on the knob. In this way, it is possible to move even the most difficult fulcrum.&lt;ref name="DuraFlex"/&gt;

==Heights of springboards==
[[Image:ThreeMeter.jpg|thumb|right|Three and one metre springboards]]
Springboards are usually located either {{convert|1.0|or|3.0|m|ftin}} above the water surface. It is very seldom that one is mounted at a height other than these two standard heights.

===Historical heights of springboards===
Before around 1960, springboards, usually made of wood, were located at heights of either {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1|disp=x| (approximately |)}}, or {{convert|6|m|ft|sigfig=1|disp=x| (approximately |)}} above the water. American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting titled ''Boy on High Dive'' (1947) shows a typical wooden springboard of the early 20th century era at the 7 m height.

==Home springboards==
After an incident in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential [[swimming pool]] with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a "suicide dive" (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and was seriously injured and became a [[tetraplegia|tetraplegic]]. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute (NSPI) over the inappropriate depth of the pool.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news |first=AmyJo|last=Brown|title=No Diving?|url=http://www.poolspanews.com/2004/012/012diving.html|publisher=Pool &amp; Spa News| date=January 30, 2004|accessdate=2007-04-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304034008/http://www.poolspanews.com/2004/012/012diving.html|archivedate=March 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Deep Impact: Back Yard Danger | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/06/02/60II/main6583.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|work=[[60 Minutes II]]|date=June 2, 1999|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NSPI had specified a minimum depth of {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards. The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner. But the courts held that the pool "was close enough" to the standards to hold NSPI liable. The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6&amp;nbsp;million ($8&amp;nbsp;million after interest was added) in favor of the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court State of WA, Docket Number:18036-1-III
Title: Shawn Meneely, et al. v. S. R. Smith, Inc., et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

'''''Sweet Crude''''' is a documentary film about [[Nigeria]]'s oil-rich [[Niger Delta]] directed by [[Sandy Cioffi]]. The film premiered in April 2009 at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival and has since screened at 30 film festivals around the world and has won numerous awards.

On April 12, 2008, members of the ''Sweet Crude'' filmmaking crew were detained by the Nigerian military Joint Task Force while traveling by boat in the Niger Delta. The crew was taken into custody and subsequently handed over to the Nigerian State Security Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Rolph |title=Seattle film crew arrested in Nigeria |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/358989_film15.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were held for seven days without being charged and without access to legal counsel. They were released Friday, April 18.

From the ''Sweet Crude'' website:
{{cquote|The region is seething and the global stakes are high. But in this moment, there’s an opportunity to find solutions. What if the world paid attention before it was too late?}}

==Awards==

'''''Sweet Crude''''' has been nominated at [[Oaxaca Film Fest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4781">The '''transition zone''' is part of the Earth’s [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], and is located between the lower mantle and the upper mantle, between a depth of 410 and 660&amp;nbsp;km (250 to 400 mi).  The Earth’s mantle, including the transition zone, consists primarily of [[peridotite]], an [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] [[igneous rock]].

The mantle was divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle as a result of sudden [[seismic]]-velocity discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660&amp;nbsp;km (250 to 400 mi).  This is thought to occur as a result of rearrangement of grains in [[olivine]] (which constitutes a large portion of peridotite) at a depth of 410&amp;nbsp;km, to form a denser crystal structure as a result of the increase in pressure with increasing depth.  Below a depth of 660&amp;nbsp;km, evidence suggests due to pressure changes ringwoodite minerals change into two new denser phases, bridgmanite and periclase. This can be seen using [[Body wave (seismology)|body wave]]s from [[earthquake]]s, which are converted, reflected or refracted at the boundary, and predicted from [[mineral physics]], as the phase changes are temperature and density-dependent and hence depth dependent.

==410 km discontinuity - phase transition==
A single peak is seen in all seismological data at 410 km which is predicted by the single transition from α- to β- Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[olivine]] to [[wadsleyite]]). From the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation|Clapeyron slope]] the Moho discontinuity is expected to be shallower in cold regions, such as [[Subduction zone|subducting]] slabs, and deeper in warmer regions, such as [[mantle plume]]s.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;C.M.R. Fowler, The Solid Earth (2nd Edition), Cambridge University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==660 km discontinuity - phase transition==
This is the most complex discontinuity seen. It appears in PP precursors (a wave which reflects off the discontinuity once) only in certain regions but is always apparent in SS precursors. It is seen as single and double reflections in receiver functions for P to S conversions over a broad range of depths (640–720&amp;nbsp;km, or 397–447 mi). The Clapeyron slope predicts a deeper discontinuity in cold regions and a shallower discontinuity in hot regions.&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; This discontinuity is generally linked to the transition from [[ringwoodite]] to [[bridgmanite]] and [[periclase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ito|first1=E|last2=Takahashi|first2=E|title=Postspinel transformations in the system Mg2SiO4-Fe2SiO4 and some geophysical implications|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|date=1989|volume=94|issue=B8|pages=10637–10646|doi=10.1029/jb094ib08p10637|bibcode=1989JGR....9410637I}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is thermodynamically an endothermic reaction and creates a viscosity jump. Both characteristics cause this phase transition to play an important role in geodynamical models. Cold downwelling material might pond on this transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fukao|first1=Y.|last2=Obayashi|first2=M.|title=Subducted slabs stagnant above, penetrating through, and trapped below the 660 km discontinuity|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|date=2013|volume=118|issue=11|pages=5920–5938|doi=10.1002/2013jb010466|bibcode=2013JGRB..118.5920F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other discontinuities==
There is another major phase transition predicted at 520&amp;nbsp;km for the transition of olivine (β to γ) and [[garnet]] in the [[pyrolite]] mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deuss|first=Arwen|last2=Woodhouse|first2=John|date=2001-10-12|title=Seismic Observations of Splitting of the Mid-Transition Zone Discontinuity in Earth's Mantle|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/354|journal=Science|language=en|volume=294|issue=5541|pages=354–357|doi=10.1126/science.1063524|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11598296|bibcode=2001Sci...294..354D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This one is only sporadically been observed in seismological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Egorkin|first=A.

===Graphene===
Graphene's two surfaces are single sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. Having two surfaces and lacking bulk makes it the thinnest possible material but also 5 times stronger than steel due to [[pi bond|pi]] and [[sigma bond|sigma]] orbital bonds. Graphene has high [[electron mobility]] and high [[thermal conductivity]]. Although graphene can be used in different applications, one issue regarding graphene is its lack of a [[band gap]], which poses a problem in particular with digital electronics because it is unable to switch off [[field-effect transistor]]s (FETs).&lt;ref name="Radisavljevic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radisavljevic|first1=B.|last2=Radenovic|first2=A.|last3=Brivio|first3=J.|last4=Giacometti|first4=V.|last5=Kis|first5=A.|year=2011| title=Single-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors| journal=Nature Nanotechnology| volume=6| issue=3| pages=147–150|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.279| pmid=21278752|bibcode=2011NatNa...6..147R|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/164049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hexagonal boron nitride===
Monolayer hexagonal [[boron nitride]] (h-BN), also known as ‘white graphene’, is structurally similar to graphite and features a honeycomb arrangement with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms in place of carbon. h-BN has a higher energy gap (5.97 eV) than graphene, thus functions as an insulator instead of a semimetal.&lt;ref name="DeanYoung2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=C.

Furthermore, h-BN also has a large thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. Thus, it can be employed as a support for metal catalyst due to its chemical, thermal, acid-base stability and high thermal conductance.

===Transition metal dichalcogenides===
[[Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers|Transition metal dichalcogenides]] (TMDCs) are a class of two-dimensional materials, which have the chemical formula MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where M represents [[transition metals]] from group VI, V and VI, and X represents a [[chalcogen]] such as [[sulfur]], [[selenium]] or [[tellurium]].&lt;ref name="WangKalantar-Zadeh2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Qing Hua|last2=Kalantar-Zadeh|first2=Kourosh|last3=Kis|first3=Andras|last4=Coleman|first4=Jonathan N.|last5=Strano|first5=Michael S.|title=Electronics and optoelectronics of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=7|issue=11|year=2012|pages=699–712|issn=1748-3387|doi=10.1038/nnano.2012.193|bibcode = 2012NatNa...7..699W|pmid=23132225|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/182177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molybdenum disulfide|MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Molybdenum diselenide|MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Molybdenum ditelluride|MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tungsten(IV) sulfide|WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Tungsten(IV) selenide|WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] are TMDCs. TMDCs have layered structure with a plane of metal atoms in between two planes of chalcogen atoms as shown in Figure 1. Each layer is bonded strongly in plane, but weakly in interlayers. Therefore, TMDCs can be easily exfoliated into atomically thin layers through various methods. TMDCs show layer-dependent optical and electrical properties. When exfoliated into monolayers, the band gaps of several TMDCs change from indirect to direct,&lt;ref name="KucZibouche2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuc|first1=A.|last2=Zibouche|first2=N.|last3=Heine|first3=T.|title=Influence of quantum confinement on the electronic structure of the transition metal sulfideTS2|journal=Physical Review B|volume=83|issue=24|pages=245213|year=2452|issn=1098-0121|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.83.245213|arxiv = 1104.3670 |bibcode = 2011PhRvB..83x5213K }}&lt;/ref&gt; which lead to broad applications in nanoelectronics&lt;ref name="Radisavljevic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radisavljevic|first1=B.|last2=Radenovic|first2=A.|last3=Brivio|first3=J.|last4=Giacometti|first4=V.|last5=Kis|first5=A.|year=2011| title=Single-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors| journal=Nature Nanotechnology| volume=6| issue=3| pages=147–150|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.279| pmid=21278752|bibcode=2011NatNa...6..147R|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/164049}}&lt;/ref&gt; and optoelectronics.&lt;ref name="WilsonYoffe1969"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.A.|last2=Yoffe|first2=A.D.|title=The transition metal dichalcogenides discussion and interpretation of the observed optical, electrical and structural properties|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=18|issue=73|year=1969|pages=193–335|issn=0001-8732|doi=10.1080/00018736900101307|bibcode = 1969AdPhy..18..193W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoffe1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoffe|first1=A D|title=Layer Compounds|journal=Annual Review of Materials Science|volume=3|issue=1|year=1973|pages=147–170|issn=0084-6600|doi=10.1146/annurev.ms.03.080173.001051|bibcode = 1973AnRMS...3..147Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
[[File:CVD setup.PNG|thumb|420px|CVD setup for MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis]]
2D semiconductor materials are often synthesized using a [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) method. Because CVD can provide large-area, high-quality, and well-controlled layered growth of 2D semiconductor materials, it also allows synthesis of two-dimensional [[heterojunction]]s.&lt;ref name="DuanWang2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Xidong|last2=Wang|first2=Chen|last3=Shaw|first3=Jonathan C.|last4=Cheng|first4=Rui|last5=Chen|first5=Yu|last6=Li|first6=Honglai|last7=Wu|first7=Xueping|last8=Tang|first8=Ying|last9=Zhang|first9=Qinling|last10=Pan|first10=Anlian|last11=Jiang|first11=Jianhui|last12=Yu|first12=Ruqing|last13=Huang|first13=Yu|last14=Duan|first14=Xiangfeng|title=Lateral epitaxial growth of two-dimensional layered semiconductor heterojunctions|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=9|issue=12|year=2014|pages=1024–1030|issn=1748-3387|doi=10.1038/nnano.2014.222|pmid=25262331|bibcode = 2014NatNa...9.1024D }}&lt;/ref&gt; When building devices by stacking different 2D materials, [[Graphene#Exfoliation|mechanical exfoliation]] followed by transferring is often used.&lt;ref name="GeimGrigorieva2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WangKalantar-Zadeh2012"/&gt; Other possible synthesis methods include  chemical exfoliation, hydrothermal synthesis, and thermal decomposition.

==Device Applications==
Some devices applications include electronic devices, photonic and energy harvesting devices, and flexible and transparent substrates.

===Electronic Devices===
2D Semiconductors can be used as transistors for digital electronics.&lt;ref name="Radisavljevic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radisavljevic|first1=B.|last2=Radenovic|first2=A.|last3=Brivio|first3=J.|last4=Giacometti|first4=V.|last5=Kis|first5=A.|year=2011| title=Single-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors| journal=Nature Nanotechnology| volume=6| issue=3| pages=147–150|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.279| pmid=21278752|bibcode=2011NatNa...6..147R|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/164049}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impure charges at the interfaces that are free of dangling bonds, allow for 2D semiconductors to run low-power devices. The 2D semiconductor interface has future potential in nano circuits due to its ability to optimize and regulate thermal transfer.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Energy and Harvesting Devices===
2D semiconductors have potential for application in the harvesting of [[solar energy]]. The atomically thin structure allows for lower surface recombination velocity, which leads to better photocurrent conduction. An improvement on solar cell performance has been shown, while stacking 2D semiconductors with multilayers of graphene.&lt;ref name="ShanmugamJacobs-Gedrim2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shanmugam|first1=Mariyappan|last2=Jacobs-Gedrim|first2=Robin|last3=Song|first3=Eui Sang|last4=Yu|first4=Bin|title=Two-dimensional layered semiconductor/graphene heterostructures for solar photovoltaic applications|journal=Nanoscale|volume=6|issue=21|year=2014|pages=12682–12689|issn=2040-3364|doi=10.1039/C4NR03334E|pmid=25210837|bibcode = 2014Nanos...612682S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexible and Transparent Substrates===
The thin layer of 2D materials can be used for flexible electronics. In particular, 2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to create thin displays and wearable electronics due to its out of plane flexibility, strong covalent bonds, and diverse electronic properties.&lt;ref name="WangKalantar-Zadeh2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Qing Hua|last2=Kalantar-Zadeh|first2=Kourosh|last3=Kis|first3=Andras|last4=Coleman|first4=Jonathan N.|last5=Strano|first5=Michael S.|title=Electronics and optoelectronics of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=7|issue=11|year=2012|pages=699–712|issn=1748-3387|doi=10.1038/nnano.2012.193|bibcode = 2012NatNa...7..699W|pmid=23132225|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/182177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Weather Information Exchange Model''' (WXXM) is a platform that was originally designed by [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]] for the exchange of [[weather]] related information between users.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurocontrol.int/aim/public/standard_page/met_wie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now a proposed standard of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)]] and is used by both Eurocontrol and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/domain/aviation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aixm.aero/public/standard_page/2010_05_aixm_met.html&lt;/ref&gt;
