'''Alternative cancer treatments''' are [[Alternative medicine|alternative or complementary treatments]] for [[cancer]] that have not been approved by the government agencies responsible for the [[regulation of therapeutic goods]].  They include diet and exercise, chemicals, herbs, devices, and manual procedures. The treatments are not supported by [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]], either because no proper testing has been conducted, or because testing did not demonstrate [[statistically significant]] efficacy.  Concerns have been raised about the safety of some of them. Some treatments that have been proposed in the past have been found in clinical trials to be useless or unsafe.  Some of these obsolete or disproven treatments continue to be promoted, sold, and used. Promoting or marketing such treatments is illegal in most of the developed world including the United States and European Union.

A distinction is typically made between complementary treatments which do not disrupt conventional medical treatment, and alternative treatments which may replace conventional treatment. 
Alternative cancer treatments are typically contrasted with [[experimental cancer treatment]]s&amp;nbsp;– which are treatments for which experimental testing is underway&amp;nbsp;– and with complementary treatments, which are non-invasive practices used alongside other treatment. All approved [[chemotherapeutic]] cancer treatments were considered experimental cancer treatments before their safety and efficacy testing was completed.

Since the 1940s, medical science has [[history of cancer chemotherapy|developed chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[adjuvant therapy]] and the newer [[targeted therapies]], as well as refined [[oncosurgery|surgical techniques]] for removing cancer.  Before the development of these modern, evidence-based treatments, 90% of cancer patients died within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2268104/ |title=Who's a Survivor? |author = Schattner,  Elaine |journal=Slate Magazine |date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With modern mainstream treatments, only 34% of cancer patients die within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html#survival |title=Cancer of All Sites – SEER Stat Fact Sheets |accessdate=6 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926191037/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html| archivedate= 26 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while mainstream forms of cancer treatment generally prolong life or permanently cure cancer, most treatments also have side effects ranging from unpleasant to fatal, such as pain, blood clots, fatigue, and infection.&lt;ref name=Complications&gt;{{cite web|last=McMillen|first=Matt|title=8 Common Surgery Complications|url=http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/common-surgery-complications|work=WebMD Feature|publisher=|accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These side effects and the lack of a guarantee that treatment will be successful create appeal for alternative treatments for cancer, which purport to cause fewer side effects or to increase survival rates despite evidence to suggest a 2–5 fold increase in death with alternative medicines.&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djx145/4064136/Use-of-Alternative-Medicine-for-Cancer-and-Its&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative cancer treatments have typically not undergone properly conducted, well-designed clinical trials, or the results have not been published due to [[publication bias]] (a refusal to publish results of a treatment outside that journal's focus area, guidelines or approach).  Among those that have been published, the methodology is often poor.  A 2006 systematic review of 214 articles covering 198 clinical trials of alternative cancer treatments concluded that almost none conducted [[dose-ranging]] studies, which are necessary to ensure that the patients are being given a useful amount of the treatment.&lt;ref name=Vickers2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vickers AJ, Kuo J, Cassileth BR |title=Unconventional anticancer agents: a systematic review of clinical trials |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=136–40 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16382123 |pmc=1472241 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.03.8406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These kinds of treatments appear and vanish frequently, and have throughout history.&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996/&gt;

==Terminology==
Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are often grouped together, in part because of the adoption of the phrase "complementary and alternative medicine" by the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="whccamp.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite book|title=White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy |url=http://whccamp.hhs.gov/fr2.html |chapter=Overview of CAM in the United States: Recent History, Current Status, And Prospects for the Future |date=March 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902075517/http://whccamp.hhs.gov/fr2.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Barrie R. Cassileth]], in cancer treatment the distinction between complementary and alternative therapies is "crucial".&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996/&gt;

Complementary treatments are used in conjunction with proven mainstream treatments. They tend to be pleasant for the patient, not involve substances with any pharmacological effects, inexpensive, and intended to treat side effects rather than to kill cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wesa KM, Cassileth BR |title=Is there a role for complementary therapy in the management of leukemia? |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=1241–9 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19761428 |pmc=2792198 |doi=10.1586/era.09.100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Medical massage]] and [[self-hypnosis]] to treat pain are examples of complementary treatments.

About half the practitioners who dispense complementary treatments are physicians, although they tend to be generalists rather than [[oncologist]]s. As many as 60% of American physicians have referred their patients to a complementary practitioner for some purpose.&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996&gt;{{cite journal |author =Cassileth BR |title=Alternative and Complementary Cancer Treatments |journal=The Oncologist |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=173–179 |year=1996 |pmid=10387984 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10387984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative treatments, by contrast, are used in place of mainstream treatments. The most popular alternative cancer therapies include restrictive [[diets]], [[mind-body intervention]]s, [[bioelectromagnetic]]s, [[nutritional supplement]]s, and [[herbology|herbs]].&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996/&gt; The popularity and prevalence of different treatments varies widely by region.&lt;ref name=Cassileth2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassileth BR, Schraub S, Robinson E, Vickers A |title=Alternative medicine use worldwide: the International Union Against Cancer survey |journal=Cancer |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=1390–3 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11283941 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(20010401)91:7&lt;1390::AID-CNCR1143&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While conventional physicians should always be kept aware of any complementary treatments used by a patient, many physicians in the United Kingdom are at least tolerant of their use, and some might recommend them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/about/the-difference-between-complementary-and-alternative-therapies "The difference between complementary and alternative therapies"], [[Cancer Research UK]], accessed 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of their use==
Survey data about how many cancer patients use alternative or complementary therapies vary from nation to nation as well as from region to region. A 2000 study published by the ''[[European Journal of Cancer]]'' evaluated a sample of 1023 women from a British cancer registry suffering from [[breast cancer]] and found that 22.4% had consulted with a practitioner of complementary therapies in the previous twelve months. The study concluded that the patients had spent many thousands of pounds on such measures and that use "of practitioners of complementary therapies following diagnosis is a significant and possibly growing phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(00)00099-X/abstract?cc=y?cc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], one study reported that 46% of children suffering from cancer have been treated with at least one non-traditional therapy. Further 40% of those of any age receiving [[palliative care]] had tried at least one such therapy. Some of the most popular alternative cancer treatments were found to be dietary therapies, antioxidants, high dose vitamins, and herbal therapies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2000/172/3/australian-oncologists-self-reported-knowledge-and-attitudes-about-non&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of unconventional cancer treatments in the United States has been influenced by the U.S. federal government's [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM), initially known as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), which was established in 1992 as a [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) adjunct by the [[U.S. Congress]]. Over thirty American [[medical schools]] have offered general courses in alternative medicine, including the [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] university systems, among others.&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996/&gt;

==People who choose alternative treatments==
People who choose alternative treatments tend to believe that evidence-based medicine is extremely invasive or ineffective, while still believing that their own health could be improved.&lt;ref name="pmid8071452"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furnham A, Forey J |title=The attitudes, behaviors and beliefs of patients of conventional vs. complementary (alternative) medicine |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=458–69 |date=May 1994 |pmid=8071452 |doi=10.1002/1097-4679(199405)50:3&lt;458::AID-JCLP2270500318&gt;3.0.CO;2-V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[loyalty|loyal]] to their alternative healthcare providers and believe that "treatment should concentrate on the whole person".&lt;ref name="pmid8071452"/&gt;

Cancer patients who choose alternative treatments instead of conventional treatments believe themselves less likely to die than patients who choose only conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="pmid16504038"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Helyer LK, Chin S, Chui BK |title=The use of complementary and alternative medicines among patients with locally advanced breast cancer – a descriptive study |journal=BMC Cancer |volume=6|pages=39 |year=2006 |pmid=16504038 |pmc=1475605 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-6-39 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They feel a greater sense of control over their destinies, and report less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="pmid16504038"/&gt;  They are more likely to engage in [[benefit finding]], which is the psychological process of adapting to a traumatic situation and deciding that the trauma was valuable, usually because of perceived personal and spiritual growth during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garland SN, Valentine D, Desai K |title=Complementary and alternative medicine use and benefit finding among cancer patients |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=876–81 |date=November 2013  |pmid=23777242 |doi=10.1089/acm.2012.0964|display-authors=etal|pmc=3842868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, patients who use alternative treatments have a poorer survival time, even after controlling for type and stage of disease.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt; In 2017, researchers at [[Yale School of Medicine]] published a paper which suggested that people who choose alternative medicine over conventional cancer treatments were more than twice as likely to die within five years of diagnosis. And specifically, in those with breast cancer, people choosing alternative medicine were 5.68 times more likely to die within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hamzelou |first1=Jessica |title=Choosing alternative cancer treatment doubles your risk of death |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2143825-choosing-alternative-cancer-treatment-doubles-your-risk-of-death/ |website=newscientist.com |publisher=New Scientist Ltd. |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reason that patients using alternative treatments die sooner may be because patients who accurately perceive that they are likely to survive do not attempt unproven remedies, and patients who accurately perceive that they are unlikely to survive are attracted to unproven remedies.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;  Among patients who believe their condition to be untreatable by evidence-based medicine, "desperation drives them into the hands of anyone with a promise and a smile."&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite book |author =Olson, James Stuart |title=Bathsheba's breast: women, cancer &amp; history |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |pages=146 |isbn=0-8018-6936-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Con artist]]s have long exploited patients' perceived lack of options to extract payments for ineffectual and even harmful treatments.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;

In a survey of American cancer patients, [[Baby boomers|Baby Boomers]] were more likely to support complementary and alternative treatments than people from an older generation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do attitudes and beliefs regarding complementary and alternative medicine impact its use among patients with cancer? A cross-sectional survey|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cncr.29173|journal = Cancer|author = Bauml, J. M.|author2 = Chokshi, S.|author3 = Schapira, M. M.|author4 = Im, E.-O.|author5 = Li, S.

:{{main article|List of unproven and disproven cancer treatments}}
Many [[therapy|therapies]] have been (and continue to be) promoted to treat or prevent cancer in humans but lack good scientific and medical evidence of effectiveness.  In many cases, there is good scientific evidence that the alleged treatments do not work. Unlike [[management of cancer|accepted cancer treatments]], unproven and disproven treatments are generally ignored or avoided by the [[medicine|medical community]], and are often [[pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name=pseudoscientific&gt;{{cite journal |author =Green S |title=Pseudoscience in Alternative Medicine: Chelation Therapy, Antineoplastons, The Gerson Diet and Coffee Enemas |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=21 |issue=5 |year=1997 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, many of these therapies have continued to be promoted as effective, particularly by promoters of [[alternative medicine]]. Scientists consider this practice [[quackery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassileth BR, Yarett IR |title=Cancer quackery: the persistent popularity of useless, irrational 'alternative' treatments |journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.) |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=754–58 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22957409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Lerner IJ |title=The whys of cancer quackery |journal=Cancer |volume=53 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=815–19 |date=February 1984  |pmid=6362828 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19840201)53:3+&lt;815::aid-cncr2820531334&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of those engaged in it have been investigated and prosecuted by [[public health]] [[regulatory agency|regulators]] such as the US [[Federal Trade Commission]],&lt;ref name=nw&gt;{{cite journal

===Pain relief===
Most studies of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of [[cancer pain]] are of low quality in terms of scientific evidence. Studies of [[massage therapy]] have produced mixed results, but overall show some temporary benefit for reducing pain, anxiety, and depression and a very low risk of harm, unless the patient is at risk for bleeding disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The use of massage therapy for reducing pain, anxiety, and depression in oncological palliative care patients: a narrative review of the literature|journal = ISRN nursing|date = 2011|issn = 2090-5491|pmc = 3168862|pmid = 22007330|pages = 929868|volume = 2011|doi = 10.5402/2011/929868|first = Maria|last = Falkensteiner|first2 = Franco|last2 = Mantovan|first3 = Irene|last3 = Müller|first4 = Christa|last4 = Them}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cam-cancer.org/CAM-Summaries/Manipulative-body-based/Massage-Classical-Swedish|title = Massage (Classical/Swedish)|date = 17 December 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = CAM-Cancer Consortium|last = Cooke|first = Helen|last2 = Seers|first2 = Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis, [[supportive psychotherapy]] and [[cognitive therapy]].  Results about Reiki and touch therapy were inconclusive.  The most studied such treatment, acupuncture, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain. The evidence for [[music therapy]] is equivocal, and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some cancer patients. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for [[mind–body interventions]] such as [[biofeedback]] and [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] techniques.&lt;ref name = Induru&gt;{{vcite journal |author =Induru RR, Lagman RL |title=Managing cancer pain: frequently asked questions |journal=Cleve Clin J Med |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=449–64 |year=2011 |month=July |pmid=21724928 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.78a.10054 |url=http://www.ccjm.org/content/78/7/449.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of complementary therapy==
As stated in the scientific literature, the measures listed below are defined as 'complementary' because they are applied in conjunction with mainstream anti-cancer measures such as chemotherapy, in contrast to the ineffective therapies viewed as 'alternative' since they are offered as substitutes for mainstream measures.&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996/&gt;

* [[Psychotherapy]] may reduce [[anxiety]] and improve [[quality of life]] as well as allow for improving patient moods.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;

* [[Music therapy]] eases cancer-related symptoms by helping with mood disturbances.&lt;ref name=Vickers /&gt;

==Alternative theories of cancer==
Some alternative cancer treatments are based on unproven or disproven theories of how cancer begins or is sustained in the body.  Some common concepts are:
* Mind-body connection:  This idea says that cancer forms because of, or can be controlled through, the person's mental and emotional state.  Treatments based on this idea are [[mind–body intervention]]s.  Proponents say that cancer forms because the person is unhappy or stressed, or that a positive attitude can cure cancer after it has formed.  A typical claim is that stress, anger, fear, or sadness depresses the immune system, whereas that love, forgiveness, confidence, and happiness cause the immune system to improve, and that this improved immune system will destroy the cancer.  This belief that generally boosting the immune system's activity will kill the cancer cells is not supported by any scientific research.&lt;ref name=Thyphronitis&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, many cancers require the support of an active immune system (especially through inflammation) to establish the [[tumor microenvironment]] necessary for a tumor to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Toxin theory of cancer:  In this idea, the body's metabolic processes are overwhelmed by normal, everyday byproducts.  These byproducts, called "toxins", are said to build up in the cells and cause cancer and other diseases through a process sometimes called ''[[wikt:autointoxication|autointoxication]]'' or ''autotoxemia''.  Treatments following this approach are usually aimed at detoxification or [[body cleansing]], such as enemas.
* Low activity by the immune system:  This claim asserts that if only the body's [[immune system]] were strong enough, it would kill the "invading" or "foreign" cancer.  Unfortunately, most cancer cells retain normal cell characteristics, making them appear to the immune system to be a normal part of the body.  Cancerous tumors also actively induce [[immune tolerance]], which prevents the immune system from attacking them.&lt;ref name=Thyphronitis /&gt;
* Epigenetic disregulation.  This claim uses research into the mechanism of [[epigenetics]] to understand how mutations in the epigenetic machinery of cells will altered histone acetylation patterns to create  [[cancers|cancer epigenetics]].  DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid18403632"&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Kastan MB |title=DNA damage responses: mechanisms and roles in human disease: 2007 G.H.A.

==Regulatory action==
Government agencies around the world routinely investigate purported alternative cancer treatments in an effort to protect their citizens from fraud and abuse.

In 2008, the [[United States Federal Trade Commission]] acted against companies that made unsupported claims that their products, some of which included highly toxic chemicals, could cure cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''''Atelosteogenesis type I''''' is a rare autosomal dominant condition.&lt;ref name=Sillence1997&gt;Sillence D, Worthington S, Dixon J, Osborn R, Kozlowski K (1997) Atelosteogenesis syndromes: a review, with comments on their pathogenesis. Pediatr Radiol 27(5):388-396&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is evident at birth and is associated with a very poor prognosis for the baby. It may be diagnosed antenatally.

==Genetics==

This condition is caused by mutations in the  filamin B ([[FLNB]]) gene.&lt;ref name=Farrington-Rock2006&gt;Farrington-Rock C, Firestein MH, Bicknell LS, Superti-Furga A, Bacino CA, Cormier-Daire V, Le Merrer M, Baumann C, Roume J, Rump P, Verheij JB, Sweeney E, Rimoin DL, Lachman RS, Robertson SP, Cohn DH, Krakow D (2006) Mutations in two regions of FLNB result in atelosteogenesis I and III. Hum Mutat 27(7):705-710&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Li2013&gt;Li BC, Hogue J, Eilers M, Mehrotra P, Hyland J, Holm T, Prosen T, Slavotinek AM (2013) Clinical report: Two patients with atelosteogenesis type I caused by missense mutations affecting the same FLNB residue. Am J Med Genet A 161A(3):619-625. doi: 10.1002/ajmg.a.35792&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeon2014&gt;Jeon GW, Lee MN, Jung JM, Hong SY, Kim YN, Sin JB, Ki CS (2014) Identification of a de novo heterozygous missense FLNB mutation in lethal atelosteogenesis type I by exome sequencing. Ann Lab Med 34(2):134-138. doi: 10.3343/alm.2014.34.2.134&lt;/ref&gt; This gene is located on the short arm of [[chromosome 3]] (3p14).

==Pathogensis==

Filamin B forms part of the [[actin]] [[cytoskeleton]]. How these mutations produce the clinical picture is not yet clear.

==Clinical features==

This is a rare condition with a prevalence of &lt; 1/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. The total number of cases reported to date is &lt;20.

Clinical features include&lt;ref name=Temple1990&gt;Temple K, Hall C A, Chitty L, Baraitser M (1990) A case of atelosteogenesis. J Med Genet 27: 194-197&lt;/ref&gt;

* Abnormal facies
**Prominent forehead
**[[Hypertelorism]]
**Depressed nasal bridge with a grooved tip
**[[Micrognathia]]
**[[Cleft palate]]
* Severe short limbed dwarfism
* Joint dislocations ([[hip]], [[knee]] and [[elbow]] joints)
* [[Club feet]]
* Cardiorespiratory failure

Cardiorespiratory failure is due to [[pulmonary hypoplasia]] or [[tracheobronchial hypoplasia]].&lt;ref name=Wessels2011&gt;Wessels A, Wainwright HC, Beighton P (2011) Atelosteogenesis type I: autopsy findings. Pediatr Dev Pathol 14(6):496-500&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

This condition is evident at birth and may be diagnosed antenatally with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. The infants may be still born. Those that are live born do not survive long.&lt;ref name=Stevenson1983&gt;Stevenson RE, Wilkes G (1983) Atelosteogenesis with survival beyond the neonatal period. Proc. Greenwood Genet Center 2: 32-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiological findings include&lt;ref name=Ueno2002&gt;Ueno K, Tanaka M, Miyakoshi K, Zhao C, Shinmoto H, Nishimura G, Yoshimura Y (2002) Prenatal diagnosis of atelosteogenesis type I at 21 weeks' gestation. Prenat Diagn 22(12):1071-1075&lt;/ref&gt;

* Severe [[platyspondyly]]
* Distally tapered, shortened, incomplete or absent [[humerus|humeri]] and [[femur]]s
* Shortened or bowed radii, [[ulna]]s and [[tibia]]s
* Hypoplastic [[pelvis]] and [[fibula]]s
* Deficient ossification of the [[metacarpal]]s, middle and proximal [[phalange]]s

===Differential diagnosis===

This includes&lt;ref name=Nishimura1997&gt;Nishimura G, Horiuchi T, Kim OH, Sasamoto Y (1997) Atypical skeletal changes in otopalatodigital syndrome type II: phenotypic overlap among otopalatodigital syndrome type II, boomerang dysplasia, atelosteogenesis type I and type III, and lethal male phenotype of Melnick-Needles syndrome. Am J Med Genet 73(2):132-138&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Achondroplasia]]
* [[Achondrogenesis]]
* [[Atelosteogenesis III]] 
* [[Boomerang dysplasia]] 
* [[Campomelic dysplasia]]
* [[Ellis-van Creveld syndrome]]
* [[Hypophosphatasia]] 
* [[Melnick Needles syndrome]]
* [[Metatropic dysplasia]]
* [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]
* [[Roberts syndrome]] 
* [[Short rib polydactyly syndrome]]
* [[Thanatophoric dysplasia]]

==Treatment==

There is currently no curative treatment for this condition.

Supportive management is all that is currently available.

==History==

This condition was first described by Maroteaux et al. in 1982.&lt;ref name=Maroteaux1082&gt;Maroteaux P, Spranger J, Stanescu V, Le Marec B, Pfeiffer RA, Beighton P, Mattei JF (1982) Atelosteogenesis. Am J Med Genet 13: 15-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Presbyterian Mission''' was founded by the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] to reach those "beyond the farthest fence" with God's Word. It is better known as the '''Australian Inland Mission''' (AIM). [[John Flynn (minister)|Rev. John Flynn]] was the first superintendent possessing a vision and dedication to see that "hospital and nursing facilities are provided within a hundred miles of every spot in Australia where women and children reside".

From 1912 the Australian Inland Mission established 15 nursing homes/bush hospitals in remote Australian locations.

Following the establishment of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] in 1977, the work of the AIM continued in the Presbyterian Church as the [[Presbyterian Inland Mission]] and in the Uniting Church as [[Frontier Services]].

A '''boil-water advisory''' or '''boil-water order''' is a [[public health]] advisory or directive given by government or health authorities to consumers when a community's [[drinking water]] is, or could be, contaminated by [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Research Council (U.S.). Committee to Review the New York City Watershed Management Strategy|title=Watershed management for potable water supply: assessing the New York City strategy|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sqf1kmdKHYC&amp;dq|accessdate=2011-04-11|isbn=978-0-309-06777-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a boil-water advisory (BWA), the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends that water be brought to a rolling [[boiling|boil]] for one minute before it is consumed in order to kill protozoa, bacteria and viruses. At altitudes above {{convert|2000|m}}, boiling should be extended to 3 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html A Guide to Drinking Water Treatment and Sanitation for Backcountry &amp; Travel Use.] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Accessed 2012-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; as the lower [[boiling point]] at high altitudes requires more time to kill such organisms.

BWAs are typically issued when monitoring of water being served to consumers detects ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or other microbiological indicators of sewage contamination. Another reason for a BWA is a failure of distribution system integrity evidenced by a loss of system pressure. While loss of pressure does not necessarily mean the water has been contaminated, it does mean that pathogens may be able to enter the piped-water system and thus be carried to consumers. In the United States, this has been defined as a drop below {{convert|20|psi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/region8-waterops/emergencies-and-security-loss-pressure|title=News|accessdate=September 28, 2016|date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:First Boil Water Notice 1866.jpg|thumb|First Known Boil Water Advisory]]
[[John Snow|John Snow's]] 1849 recommendation that water be "filtered and boiled before it is used" is one of the first practical applications of the [[germ theory of disease]] in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern boil water advisory. Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings. He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines. Snow later went so far as to accurately propose in his 1855 edition of the work that the structure of cholera was that of a cell. Snow's ideas were not fully accepted until years after his death. He died in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Steven|title=The Ghost Map|publisher=[[Riverhead Books]]|year=2006|isbn=1-59448-925-4|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known modern Boil Water Advisory notice based solely on germ theory and unfettered by extraneous and irrelevant advice was distributed in 1866 during [[1863–75 cholera pandemic|the last of three major cholera outbreaks]] that ravaged London in the 19th century.

APOGEE-Net/'''CanGèneTest''' is an international Network of Investigators and Decision Makers, funded by the [[Canadian Institutes for Health Research]] (CIHR) as an Emerging Team in Health Services Research. Its objective is to streamline the [[Verification and validation|validation]] and evidence-based translation of genetic and genomic innovations and discoveries of proven [[Clinical utility of diagnostic tests|clinical utility]] and [[cost-effectiveness]] from the discovery towards [[health care system]]s and improvement of population's health outcomes.

This project was initiated in 2003 with the [[funding]] of the APOGEE-Net Knowledge Network on Health Services and Policy Research in Genetics, followed by the funding of the CanGèneTest Research Network on Health Care and Policy in Genetic Laboratory Services. These two Networks merged in 2009 to be funded again by CIHR for five more years (2009 to 2014) and become the APOGEE-Net/CanGèneTest Research and Knowledge Network on Genetic Health Services and Policy. The Network has published several [[peer-reviewed]] manuscripts providing data or evidence along the [[Research]] continuum between discovery and health care.
This Network involves 28 Investigators and collaborators from [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] and is led by Prof François Rousseau as its designated Principal Investigator. The Network has many partner organization including [[Eurogentest]], PHGEN, SPIDIA and [[International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine|IFCC]]. The Network published every two weeks a horizon-scanning e-newsletter on [[genetic testing]], destined to all types of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in the field. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

'''[[Cannabis]] in [[Chad]]''' is illegal.

==Cultivation==
Per a 1999 report, the islands of [[Lake Chad]] contain a number of hectares of cannabis but local police have not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tchad et culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XAwAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|page=6|quote=Selon des sources policières de Bol, les îles du Lac contiennent plusieurs hectares de cannabis mais la police n'a pas de moyens pour aller les détruire. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cantalloc Aqueducts''' are a series of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] located 4 km north of the city of [[Nazca]], [[Peru]], built by the [[Nazca culture]]. More than 40 aqueducts were built, which were used all year round. There are other aqueducts in different parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mincetur.gob.pe/TURISMO/OTROS/inventario%20turistico/Ficha.asp?cod_Ficha=250|title=ACUEDUCTO DE CANTALLOC|publisher=Mincetur|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are part of a system of aqueducts of the same type called [[puquios]] that were built by the pre-Inca civilization of Nazca about 1,500 years ago.

The aqueducts ensured the supply of water to the city of Nazca and the surrounding fields, allowing the cultivation of [[cotton]], [[bean]]s, [[potato]]es, and other crops in an arid region.

A '''ceremonial pipe''' is a particular type of [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]], used by a number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures in their sacred ceremonies. Traditionally they are used to offer prayers in a religious ceremony, to make a ceremonial commitment, or to seal a [[Covenant (historical)|covenant]] or [[treaty]]. The pipe ceremony may be a component of a larger ceremony, or held as a sacred ceremony in and of itself. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] who use ceremonial pipes have names for them in each culture's [[indigenous language]]. Not all cultures have pipe traditions, and there is no single word for all ceremonial pipes across the hundreds of diverse Native American languages.

==Use in ceremonies==
Native American ceremonial pipes are usually used in prayer ceremonies. Sometimes they have been called "peace pipes" by Europeans, or others whose cultures do not include these ceremonial objects. However, the smoking of a ceremonial pipe to seal a peace treaty is only one use of a ceremonial smoking pipe, by only some of the nations that utilize them. Various types of ceremonial pipes have been used by different [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] cultures. The style of pipe, materials smoked, and ceremonies are unique to the specific and distinct religions of those nations. Similarly, the pipes are called by names in that culture's own Indigenous language. The specific type of pipes smoked in Catholic conversion rituals first in [[Illinois]] and then in [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] territory were known as Calumets.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;Leavelle, Tracy Neal (2012) ''[https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780812207040 The Catholic Calumet: Colonial Conversions in French and Indian North America]''. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, ceremonial pipes have been used to mark war and peace, as well as commerce and trade, and social and political decision-making.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; 

During his travels down the [[Mississippi River]] in 1673, Father [[Jacques Marquette]] documented the universal respect that the ceremonial pipe was shown among all Native peoples he encountered, even those at war with each other. He claimed that presenting the pipe during battle would halt the fighting. The [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] people gave Marquette such a pipe as a gift to ensure his safe travel through the interior of the land.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt;

In ceremonial usage, the smoke is generally &lt;!--but not necessarily exclusively--&gt;believed to carry prayers to the attention of the [[Creator deity|Creator]] or other powerful spirits. [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tradition tells that [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]] brought the ''[[Chanunpa|čhaŋnúŋpa]]''&lt;ref name="Ullrich"&gt;Ullrich, Jan. (2008). ''New Lakota Dictionary''. Lakota Language Consortium. {{ISBN|0-9761082-9-1}}."&lt;/ref&gt; (Lakota sacred pipe) to the people, and instructed them in its symbolism and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=LookingHorse1&gt;Looking Horse, Chief Arvol (March 13, 2003) "[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2003/04/25/looking-horse-proclamation-protection-ceremonies-88707 Looking Horse Proclamation on the Protection of Ceremonies]" at ''[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native American cultures still practice these ceremonies.

According to oral traditions, and as demonstrated by pre-contact pipes held in museums and tribal and private holdings, some ceremonial pipes are adorned with feathers, fur, animal or human hair, beadwork, quills, carvings or other items having significance for the owner. Other pipes are very simple. Many are not kept by an individual, but are instead held collectively by a medicine society or similar indigenous ceremonial organization.

==Varieties and terminology==
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] who use ceremonial pipes have names for them in each culture's indigenous language. There is no single word for all ceremonial pipes across the hundreds of diverse Native cultures.

The [[Lakota people|Lakota]] sacred pipe is called a ''[[Chanunpa|chanupa]]'', also spelled ''chanunpa'' or ''c'anupa'' (in [[Lakota language|Lakota]]: ''čhaŋnúŋpa'').&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LookingHorse1/&gt;

In some historical sources written by colonists, a ceremonial pipe is referred to as a ''calumet'' (kal-yə-ˌmet, -mət). ''Calumet'' is a [[Norman language|Norman]] word ({{IPA-fr|kalyme|pron}}), first recorded in David Ferrand's ''La Muse normande'' around 1625–1655,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/calumet CNRTL site etymology of calumet]&lt;/ref&gt; and used by Norman-French settlers to describe the ceremonial pipes they saw used among the native peoples of the region.&lt;ref name=Rowland&gt;Rowland, Dunbar (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers initially used the word to refer to the hollow decorated pipe shaft alone while the pipe bowl was a separate ritual object,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/calumetpipe.htm Calumet or "Peace-pipe" of the Indians], ''Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico'', Bureau of American Ethnology, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; a "sort of reeds used to make pipes", with a suffix substitution for ''calumel''.&lt;ref&gt;The word comes from Late Latin ''calamellus''. The Northern Norman dialect retains the group /ca/, when it turns into /ʃa/ (''cha-'') in Common French and it retains the suffix ''-el'', when it has turned into ''-eau'' in Common French.

Cutler. ''Tracks that speak: the legacy of Native American words in North American culture''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (Boston : 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

One material used for ceremonial pipe bowls in the [[Upper Midwest]] is red pipestone or [[catlinite]],&lt;ref name = Ioway&gt;{{Cite web | title = Catlinite, Calumet Pipes and Pipestone National Monument  | work = Maps, Material, Culture, and Memory: On the Trail of the Ioway | publisher = [[University of Iowa]]  | url = http://archaeology.uiowa.edu/catlinite-calumet-pipes-and-pipestone-national-monument-0 | accessdate = 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fine-grained easily worked stone of a rich red color of the [[Coteau des Prairies]], west of the [[Big Stone Lake]] in [[South Dakota]]. The [[Pipestone National Monument|pipestone quarries]] of what today is Minnesota, were neutral ground as people from multiple nations journeyed to the quarry to obtain the sacred pipestone.&lt;ref name = pipestibe&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pipestone National Monument  | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | url = http://www.nps.gov/pipe/index.htm | accessdate = 19 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sioux people]] use long-stemmed pipes in some of their ceremonies. Other peoples, such as the [[Catawba people|Catawba]] in the American Southeast, use ceremonial pipes formed as round, footed bowls. A tubular smoke tip projects from each of the four cardinal directions on the bowl.

[[File:UtePipe3.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Uncompahgre Ute]] Salmon alabaster ceremonial pipe. Ute pipe styles are similar to those of the [[Plains Indians]], with notable differences. Ute pipes are thicker and use shorter pipestems than the plains style and more closely resemble the pipe styles of their Northern neighbors, the [[Shoshone]].]]

A number of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous North American]] cultures make and use ceremonial pipes. However, there are also [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures that do not have a ceremonial smoking tradition, but make pipes for social smoking only. The types of materials used vary by community and locality. Some of the known types of pipe stone and pipe materials are:

'''Clay'''&amp;nbsp;– The [[Cherokee]] and [[Chickasaw]] both fashion pipes made from fired [[clay]], however these are only used for social smoking. They use small [[Phragmites|reed]] cane pipestems made from river cane. These pipes are made from aged river clay hardened in a hot fire.

'''Red pipestone'''&amp;nbsp;– [[Catlinite]] is an iron-rich, reddish, soft [[argillite]] or [[claystone]] typically excavated from beds occurring between hard [[Sioux Quartzite]] layers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/pipe/learn/nature/geologicformations.htm Geologic Formations, Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; below groundwater level, as the stone erodes rapidly when exposed to the weather and outside air. Red pipestone is used primarily by the [[Plains Indians|Plains Tribes]], and the Western and [[Great Basin Tribes]]. The stone can be found in Minnesota (Pipestone), and [[Utah]] (Delta, Uinta). Sacred pipestone comes from [[Pipestone, Minnesota]]. The quarry is located just north of the town at the [[Pipestone National Monument]]. Today only Native Americans are allowed to quarry the pipestone from this quarry. The pipestone from this quarry is considered the softest stone available.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[File:MissPipe1.jpg|left|thumb|Mississippian and Eastern Woodlands style "acorn" pipe. These pipes have been found in [[Mississippian culture]] earthwork mounds in the Eastern United States. This acorn pipe is made from South Dakota red pipestone.]]
'''Blue pipestone'''&amp;nbsp;– is used predominantly by the Plains Tribes for certain types of ceremonial pipes. Deposits of the stone are found in South Dakota.

'''Bluestone'''&amp;nbsp;– a hard, greenish-blue quartzite stone from the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After being worked, it takes on a decidedly greenish cast. This stone has been used by several Eastern Woodlands tribes for pipemaking. Several ancient Mississippian culture bluestone pipes have been excavated.

[[File:UtePipe1.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Uncompahgre Ute Salmon alabaster ceremonial pipe with pipestem.]]
'''Salmon alabaster'''&amp;nbsp;– the [[Ute people|Uncompahgre Ute People]] make ceremonial pipes from salmon [[alabaster]] mined in central [[Colorado]].

'''Green pipestone'''&amp;nbsp;– A white on green marbled [[cupric]] pipestone found in [[Wyoming]] and South Dakota is used by the [[Shoshone]], Ute, and Plains Tribes for personal and ceremonial pipes. This stone is also used to carve sacred effigies and religious items.

'''Black pipestone (South Dakota)'''&amp;nbsp;– a soft, brittle, white on black marbled pipestone found in South Dakota and used by some of the Plains Tribes for certain types of ceremonial pipes.

'''Black pipestone (Uinta)'''&amp;nbsp;– an extremely hard black quartzite slate which has undergone [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] compression and is found in the southeastern drainage of the [[Uinta Mountains]] in Utah and Colorado. This stone has been used by the Great Basin Tribes for war [[club (weapon)|club]]s and pipes that are jet black with a high gloss when polished. Stones which have tumbled down creeks and drainages are always selected, since these stones typically contained no cracks or defects.

==Traditional pipemaking tools==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Pipestone1.jpg|right|thumb|180px|High-grade red pipestone from [[Delta, Utah]], in both raw and cut-and-slabbed forms]]

One traditional method of manufacture is the use of [[bow drill]]s made with hard white [[quartz]] points for drilling sacred objects from stone.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} One technique uses moistened [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] strips rolled in crushed white quartz and stretched with a bow handle to shape and rough the pipes. Pipe bowls may also be shaped with hard [[sandstone]]s, then polished with water and sanded with progressively finer and finer [[abrasive]] grit and animal hide, finally being rubbed with [[fat]] or other oils to complete polishing.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The '''China Food and Drug Administration''' ('''CFDA''')&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.sfda.gov.cn/WS03/CL0755/&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh |s = 国家食品药品监督管理总局}}) was founded on the basis of the former State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). In March 2013, the regulatory body was rebranded and restructured as the China Food and Drug Administration, elevating it to a ministerial-level agency.&lt;ref&gt;"China gets stronger food, drug regulator." China Daily, Xinhua. 22 March 2013. http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2013-03/22/content_16336113.htm

Xinhua. http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-03/10/c_132221729.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The China Food and Drug Administration is directly under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]], which is in charge of comprehensive supervision on the safety management of food, health food and cosmetics and is the competent authority of drug regulation in [[mainland China]].&lt;ref&gt;"Consolidation of the China Food and Drug Administration," by Nick Beckett and David Pountney.

On July 10, 2007, [[Zheng Xiaoyu]], the former head of China's State Food And Drug Administration, was executed for taking bribes from various firms in exchange for state licenses related to product safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6286698.stm China food safety head executed]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main responsibilities ==
{{Cleanup|reason=This list needs to be consolidated and its original source cited.|talksection=Responsibilities|date=March 2016}}

The State Food and Drug Administration is not responsible for regulating pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured and exported by chemical companies. This regulatory hole, which has resulted in considerable international news coverage unfavorable to China, has been known for a decade, but failure of Chinese regulatory agencies to cooperate has prevented effective regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/world/asia/31chemical.html "Chinese Chemicals Flow Unchecked to World Drug Market"] article reported by Walt Bogdanich, Jake Hooker and Andrew W. Lehren and written by Mr. Bogdanich in ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registration for medical devices ===
The CFDA is responsible for registration of medical devices for the Chinese market. All medical devices have to be classified by the CFDA according to its risk in 3 classes. Depending on the risk classification, different aspects are required: 
* For medical devices of class I: product tests are sometimes required
* For medical devices of class II: product tests are always required and clinical trials are sometimes required
* For medical devices of class III: product tests are always required

{{Pizza}}
'''Chocolate pizza''' is a type of [[pizza]] prepared using [[chocolate]] as a primary ingredient.&lt;ref name="LOCALSYR 2015"/&gt; Various styles and preparation techniques exist. Chocolate pizza may be prepared as a dessert dish, as a savory dish, and as chocolate molded in the form of a pizza. Some companies specialize in chocolate pizzas.

==Preparation==
Some chocolate pizzas incorporate chocolate into the pizza dough.&lt;ref name="Lebovitz 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hulin 2007"/&gt; Chocolate pizza may be served as a sweet, dessert-style dish,&lt;ref name="The Cut 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford Mail"/&gt; or as a [[Savoury_(dish)|savory dish]] that includes chocolate. Chocolate pizza may be prepared using cooking chocolate as a spread before baking in the oven. Another variety is the use of a hazelnut spread after the pizza is baked.&lt;ref name="Oxford Mail"/&gt; In recent years, chocolate pizza preparations have included icing sugar, banana, strawberries,&lt;ref name="Oxford Mail"/&gt; marshmallows,&lt;ref name="Oxford Mail"/&gt; [[sprinkles]],&lt;ref name="Oxford Mail"/&gt; smarties, and white chocolate chips.

==History==
Chocolate pizza combines chocolate and pizza, two popular ingredients among school-aged children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2007.00773.x/abstract;jsessionid=2533CD4F6A527FC670D2C224F2C389F6.f04t01|title=Three consecutive (1993, 1995, 1997) surveys of food intake, nutritional attitudes and knowledge, and lifestyle in 1000 French children, aged 9-11 years|accessdate=28 December 2015 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-277X.2007.00773.x|volume=20|journal=Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics|pages=241–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confluence of [[pizza]] and [[chocolate]] developed in parallel in several Western countries and has become a dessert purveyed in franchise and chain restaurants.

When continuous white noise (with a frequency content below about 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz) is presented by headphones to the left and right ear of a listener, and given a particular interaural phase relationship between the left and right ear signals, a sensation of [[pitch (psychophysics)]] may be observed. Thus, stimulation of either ear alone gives rise to the sensation of white noise only, but stimulation of both ears together produces pitch. Therefore, as a special case of [[dichotic listening]], such a pitch is called dichotic pitch or binaural pitch. Generally, a dichotic pitch is perceived somewhere in the head amidst the noisy sound filling the binaural space. To be more specific, the dichotic pitch is characterized by three perceptual properties: pitch value, timbre, and in-head position (lateralization). Experiments on dichotic pitch were motivated in the context of the study of pitch in general, and of the binaural system in particular, relevant for [[sound localization]] and separation of competing sound sources (see [[cocktail party effect]]). In the past, various configurations of dichotic pitch were studied and several auditory models were developed. The great challenge for psychophysical and physiological acoustics is to predict both the pitch value and pitch-image position in one model. For more information, references, audio demos etc. see [http://www.xs4all.nl/~fabilsen/#Dichotic_pitch more].

== Studies ==
There have been many findings on the subject of dichotic pitch, showing that different disorders experience it in multiple different ways. Individuals who suffer from [[dyslexia]] seem to experience dichotic pitch in a similar way, too if they were trying to distinguish words and letters. Robert F. Dougherty and team, ran an experiment using both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children. The participants were given a melody to listen to and different tones were then played within the melody. The dyslexic children were able to decipher the higher pitched tones but were unable to distinguish the lower notes from the background melody. It became apart that the lower caused some sort of auditory and sensory problem for the dyslexic children that made it harder for their brain to sort out the information being sent to it.

A study done by Bianca Pinheiro Lanzetta-Valdo and team looked at children with the diagnosis of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD) and dichotic pitch. At the beginning of the experiment, all of the children were at a base level of the medication methylphenidate, a stimulant that is used to try and calm individuals with ADHD. Over a 6-month period, the children were given auditory stimulation that consisted of white noise, and during this stimulation, they would be given physical, neurological, visual and auditory examination, as well as biochemical tests to see if any improvement was made. Lanzetta-Valdo and collaborators did find improvement in these participants over the 6 months in their different evaluations, but there are controversy results on this topic.

The '''Dutch Society for Sexual Reform''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] organization known by the acronym '''NVSH''' (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Seksuele Hervorming). The NVSH was founded in 1946, as the successor of the Dutch Neo-[[Malthusian]] League, a [[birth control]] organisation which opened the first birth control clinic in the world in 1881, in [[Amsterdam]]. The NVSH was once the only source of [[condom]]s in the Netherlands.

Up to the 1960s, a great deal of energy went into building up the organisation, which in its heyday ran over 60 birth control clinics in The Netherlands. Much work in those early years was put into improving the quality and availability of [[contraceptives]] (condom, [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and spermicidal jelly). In 1966 the society  reached a membership of 220,000. Contraceptives were officially legalized in 1970, after which membership began to fall. In 2002, the number was about 1500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.nvsh.nl/sekstant/ |title=NVSH website - history of the organization - translated by Google |publisher=Translate.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and late 2008 about 700.&lt;ref&gt;NVSH Newsletter, November 200'''9''' (Dutch): ''"Het aantal leden van de vereniging blijft dalen. Eind november [200'''8'''] werd aan 705 leden een acceptgiro verzonden."''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, the NVSH aims at what it calls the sexual emancipation of individuals and the improvement of sexual conditions in society, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvsh.nl/us/want.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221181512/http://www.nvsh.nl/us/want.htm |date=December 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernando José de La Vieter Ribeiro Nobre''' (born 16 December 1951) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Physician|doctor]] who is the founder and president of the Portuguese [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] AMI (Global Humanitarian Action). In 2007 he was voted as the 25th greatest Portuguese ever in the contest [[Os Grandes Portugueses]], being the 5th most voted among Portuguese living people at that date. He was a candidate to the [[Portuguese presidential election, 2011]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Luanda]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] (it was then a Portuguese territory), in 1951. He moved to the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)]] by the age of 12. He spent 16 years in Africa. He studied medicine in [[Belgium]], where he worked and lived for around 20 years.

He is married to Maria Luísa Ferreira da Silva Nemésio (born [[Coimbra]], Santa Cruz, 21 February 1959), paternal granddaughter of [[Vitorino Nemésio]], and has one son: Alexandre Focquet de La Vieter Nobre (born 2 June 1980) and three daughters: Isabel Focquet de La Vieter Nobre (born 11 May 1982), Leonor Nemésio de La Vieter Nobre (born 9 January 1993) and Gabriela Nemésio de La Vieter Nobre (born 7 November 1996).

==AMI==
He was part of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] from 1977 to 1983. In December 1984 he founded in Portugal the NGO AMI&amp;nbsp;— Assistência Médica Internacional. He has participated in humanitarian missions in over 180 countries.

==Political career==
===Candidacy for President of the Republic===
On February 19, 2010 he announced that he would be an independent (supported by no parties) presidential candidate to the [[Portuguese presidential election, 2011]]. Without any party support, he had a result of 14% of the votes, achieving 3rd place.

===Candidacy for President of the Assembly of the Republic===
After the election he declared that he was uninterested in partisan politics and refused the idea of turning his supporting movement into a party. He was deserted by some of his previous supporters after accepting an invite by the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic]] leader [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] to be the head of the Social Democratic lists and to run for MP for Lisbon for the [[Portuguese legislative election, 2011|elections which would happen in June 2011]] after the fall of the [[José Sócrates|Sócrates]] government. The fact that Nobre, considered a leftist and a [[Mário Soares|Soarist]] [[socialist]] and who had supported the [[Left Bloc]] in 2009 (saying he "shared the values of the party"), was heading the electoral lists of a rightwing party. Other supporters were disappointed by the fact that he was involved in a party at all after what he had said about not involving in party politics. Nobre defended himself that he trusted Passos Coelho personally (stating he was an honest man) and that (quoting [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]) only who doesn't look for the truth never changes his mind. He also stated that he believed [[Left-right politics|the left-right division]] was worn out, and remembered that he had supported other rightists like [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]] in 2003 and [[António Capucho]] for the City Hall of [[Cascais]].

Nobre was elected, despite much discussion over his acceptance of the offer (including his statement that he was running just to be [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Speaker of the Portuguese Parliament]] and not an MP) with a quite positive result over [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] competitor [[Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues]].  Despite the apparent support of the Social Democratic seats in the Parliament, on 20 June 2011, in the first meeting of the Parliament elected by the [[Portuguese legislative election, 2011|5 June election]], Nobre failed to be elected Speaker even after two round of voting (gaining even fewer votes the second time around). It is argued that his defeat was not only due to opposition in the Social Democrats to having an independent as the highest standing among them in Parliament, to opposition of all parties to a non-partisan in Parliament. After failing to become Speaker of the Assembly, Nobre renounced his seat. He still attended to the parliamentary meeting of 21 June and had two justified absences (due to illness) on the meetings of 30 June and 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.pt/DeputadoGP/Paginas/PresencasReunioesPlenarias.aspx?BID=4433 Assembleia da República&amp;nbsp;– Presenças a Reuniões Plenárias] Retrieved 24 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, he has not had involvement in politics except for some political commentaries in television.

{{About|GnRH as a hormone|its use as a medication|Gonadorelin}}
{{Infobox gene}}

'''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone''' ('''GnRH'''), also known by [[#Names|various other names]] in its [[endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] form (and as '''[[gonadorelin]]''' ({{abbrlink|INN|International Nonproprietary Name|INN}}) in its [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] form), is a [[releasing and inhibiting hormones|releasing hormone]] responsible for the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[anterior pituitary]]. GnRH is a [[tropic hormone|tropic]] [[peptide hormone]] synthesized and released from [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]] within the [[hypothalamus]]. The peptide belongs to [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone family]]. It constitutes the initial step in the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]].

==Structure==
The identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochman|first1=K. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evolution of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) structure and its receptor | journal = Journal of Animal and Feed Sciences | date = 2012 | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | page = 6 | url = http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20123164798.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; of GnRH was clarified by the 1977 [[Nobel Laureate]]s [[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Andrew V. Schally]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1977|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1977/|website=www.nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;[[pyroglutamic acid|pyroGlu]]-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As is standard for [[peptide]] representation, the sequence is given from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus; also standard is omission of the designation of chirality, with assumption that all amino acids are in their L- form. The abbreviations appearing are to standard [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s, except for ''pyroGlu'', which refers to [[pyroglutamic acid]], a derivative of glutamic acid. The ''NH2'' at the carboxyl terminus indicates that rather than terminating as a free carboxylate, it terminates as a [[carboxamide]].

==Synthesis==
The [[gene]], ''GNRH1'', for the GnRH precursor is located on [[chromosome 8]]. In mammals, the linear decapeptide end-product is synthesized from a 89-[[amino acid]] [[preprohormone]] in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus. It is the target of various [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis#regulation|regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]], such as being inhibited by increased [[estrogen]] levels in the body.

==Function==
GnRH is secreted in the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypophysial]] portal bloodstream at the [[median eminence]].&lt;ref name=pmid19541658 /&gt; The portal blood carries the GnRH to the [[pituitary gland]], which contains the [[gonadotrope]] cells, where GnRH activates its own [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor]] (GnRHR), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor that stimulates the beta isoform of [[Phosphoinositide phospholipase C]], which goes on to mobilize [[calcium]] and [[protein kinase C]]. This results in the activation of proteins involved in the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH. GnRH is degraded by [[proteolysis]] within a few minutes.

GnRH activity is very low during [[childhood]], and is activated at [[puberty]] or [[adolescence]]. During the reproductive years, pulse activity is critical for successful reproductive function as controlled by feedback loops. However, once a pregnancy is established, GnRH activity is not required. Pulsatile activity can be disrupted by hypothalamic-pituitary disease, either dysfunction (i.e., [[hypothalamic suppression]]) or organic lesions (trauma, tumor). Elevated [[prolactin]] levels decrease GnRH activity. In contrast, [[hyperinsulinemia]] increases pulse activity leading to disorderly LH and FSH activity, as seen in [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS). GnRH formation is congenitally absent in [[Kallmann syndrome]].

===Control of FSH and LH===
At the pituitary, GnRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of the [[gonadotropins]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH).&lt;ref name=isbn0-521-42665-0 /&gt; These processes are controlled by the size and frequency of GnRH pulses, as well as by feedback from [[androgens]] and [[estrogens]]. Low-frequency GnRH pulses are required for FSH release, whereas high-frequency GnRH pulses stimulate LH pulses in a one-to-one manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jayes FC, Britt JH, Esbenshade KL | title = Role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse frequency in differential regulation of gonadotropins in the gilt | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 1012–9 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9096885 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod56.4.1012 | url = http://www.biolreprod.org/content/56/4/1012.full.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923190449/http://www.biolreprod.org/content/56/4/1012.full.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences in GnRH secretion between females and males. In males, GnRH is secreted in pulses at a constant frequency; however, in females, the frequency of the pulses varies during the menstrual cycle, and there is a large surge of GnRH just before ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Ehlers K, Halvorson L | title = Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) and the GnRH Receptor (GnRHR) | url = http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/284/recordset/18975/value/284 | website = The Global Library of Women's Medicine | access-date = 5 November 2014 | doi = 10.3843/GLOWM.10285 | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GnRH secretion is [[Pulsatile secretion|pulsatile]] in all vertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsutsumi R, Webster NJ | title = GnRH pulsatility, the pituitary response and reproductive dysfunction | journal = Endocrine Journal | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 729–37 | date = 17 July 2009 | pmid = 19609045 | pmc = 4307809 | doi = 10.1507/endocrj.K09E-185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is necessary for correct reproductive function. Thus, a single hormone, GnRH1, controls a complex process of [[Ovarian follicle|follicular]] growth, [[ovulation]], and [[corpus luteum]] maintenance in the female, and [[spermatogenesis]] in the male.

===Neurohormone===
GnRH is considered a [[neurohormone]], a [[hormone]] produced in a specific [[Neuron|neural cell]] and released at its [[Neuron#Anatomy and histology|neural terminal]]. A key area for production of GnRH is the [[preoptic area]] of the hypothalamus, which contains most of the GnRH-secreting neurons. [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]] originate in the nose and migrate into the brain, where they are scattered throughout the medial septum and hypothalamus and connected by very long &gt;1-millimeter-long [[dendrite]]s. These bundle together so they receive shared [[Synapse|synaptic]] input, a process that allows them to synchronize their GnRH release.&lt;ref name="pmid19541658"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell RE, Gaidamaka G, Han SK, Herbison AE | title = Dendro-dendritic bundling and shared synapses between gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 26 | pages = 10835–40 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19541658 | pmc = 2705602 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0903463106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]] are regulated by many different afferent neurons, using several different transmitters (including [[norepinephrine]], [[GABA]], [[glutamate]]). For instance, [[dopamine]] appears to stimulate LH release (through GnRH) in estrogen-progesterone-primed females; dopamine may inhibit LH release in ovariectomized females.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-42665-0"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown RM | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = An introduction to Neuroendocrinology | edition = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1994 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-521-42665-0 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kisspeptin]] appears to be an important regulator of GnRH release.&lt;ref name="pmid16373418"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dungan HM, Clifton DK, Steiner RA | title = Minireview: kisspeptin neurons as central processors in the regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 147 | issue = 3 | pages = 1154–8 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16373418 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-1282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GnRH release can also be regulated by [[estrogen]]. It has been reported that there are [[KNDy neuron|kisspeptin-producing neurons]] that also express [[estrogen receptor|estrogen receptor alpha]].&lt;ref name="pmid16621281"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franceschini I, Lomet D, Cateau M, Delsol G, Tillet Y, Caraty A | title = Kisspeptin immunoreactive cells of the ovine preoptic area and arcuate nucleus co-express estrogen receptor alpha | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 401 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–30 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16621281 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2006.03.039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organs===
GnRH is found in organs outside of the hypothalamus and pituitary, and its role in other life processes is poorly understood. For instance, there is likely to be a role for GnRH1 in the [[placenta]] and in the [[gonads]]. GnRH and GnRH receptors are also found in cancers of the breast, ovary, prostate, and endometrium.&lt;ref name="pmid10573298"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schally AV | title = Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs: their impact on the control of tumorigenesis | journal = Peptides | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 1247–62 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10573298 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-9781(99)00130-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of behavior==
GnRH production/release is one of the few confirmed examples of behavior influencing hormones, rather than the other way around.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Cichlid]] fish that become socially dominant in turn experience an upregulation of GnRH secretion whereas cichlid fish that are socially subordinate have a down regulation of GnRH secretion.&lt;ref name="pmid23000535"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chee SS, Espinoza WA, Iwaniuk AN, Pakan JM, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez C, Wylie DR, Hurd PL | title = Social status, breeding state, and GnRH soma size in convict cichlids (Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus) | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 237 | issue = | pages = 318–24 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23000535 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides secretion, the social environment as well as their behavior affects the size of [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]]. Specifically, males that are more territorial have larger [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]] than males that are less territorial. Differences are also seen in females, with brooding females having smaller [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]] than either spawning or control females.&lt;ref name="pmid12151363"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SA, Nguyen T, Fernald RD | title = Social regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 205 | issue = Pt 17 | pages = 2567–81 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12151363 | doi = | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/17/2567.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; These examples suggest that GnRH is a socially regulated hormone.

==Medical uses==
{{Main article|Gonadorelin|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist}}

Natural GnRH was previously prescribed as [[gonadorelin]] hydrochloride (Factrel)&lt;ref&gt;[[Drugs.com]] Factrel: {{Drugs.com|CDI|Factrel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate (Cystorelin)&lt;ref&gt;[[Drugs.com]] Cystorelin: {{Drugs.com|pro|Cystorelin}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in treating human diseases. Modifications of the [[decapeptide]] structure of GnRH to increase half life have led to [[GnRH analog|GnRH1 analog]] medications that either stimulate ([[GnRH agonist|GnRH1 agonist]]s) or suppress ([[GnRH antagonist]]s) the gonadotropins. These synthetic analogs have replaced the natural hormone in clinical use.

Its analogue [[leuprorelin]] is used for continuous infusion, to treat [[breast cancer]], [[endometriosis]], [[prostate cancer]], and following research in the 1980s by researchers, including Dr. [[Florence Comite]] of Yale University, it was used to treat [[precocious puberty]].&lt;ref name=nejm_PP&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Comite F, Cutler GB, Rivier J, Vale WW, Loriaux DL, Crowley WF | title = Short-term treatment of idiopathic precocious puberty with a long-acting analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. A preliminary report | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 305 | issue = 26 | pages = 1546–50 | date = December 1981 | pmid = 6458765 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198112243052602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AACS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonis WA, Comite F, Pescovitz OH, Hench K, Rahn CW, Cutler GB, Loriaux DL, Klein RP | title = Biobehavioral aspects of precocious puberty | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 674–9 | date = September 1986 | pmid = 3760417 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-7138(09)60293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal sexual behavior==
GnRH activity influences a variety of sexual behaviors. Increased levels of GnRH facilitate sexual displays and behavior in females. GnRH injections enhance copulation solicitation (a type of courtship display) in [[white-crowned sparrow]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid9344687"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maney DL, Richardson RD, Wingfield JC | title = Central administration of chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone-II enhances courtship behavior in a female sparrow | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–8 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9344687 | doi = 10.1006/hbeh.1997.1399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mammals]], GnRH injections facilitate sexual behavior of female display behaviors as shown with the [[musk shrew]]’s (Suncus murinus) reduced latency in displaying rump presents and tail wagging towards males.&lt;ref name="pmid10868484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiml PA, Rissman EF | title = Effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormones, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and vasopressin on female sexual behavior | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–20 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10868484 | doi = 10.1006/hbeh.2000.1575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An elevation of GnRH raises males’ [[testosterone]] capacity beyond a male’s natural testosterone level. Injections of GnRH in male birds immediately after an aggressive territorial encounter results in higher testosterone levels than what is observed naturally during an aggressive territorial encounter.&lt;ref name="pmid22613708"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DeVries MS, Winters CP, Jawor JM | title = Testosterone elevation and response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone challenge by male northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) following aggressive behavior | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–105 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22613708 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compromised GnRH system has aversive effects on [[reproductive physiology]] and [[maternal]] behavior. In comparison to female mice with a normal GnRH system, female mice with a 30% decrease in [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH neurons]] are poor caregivers to their offspring. These mice are more likely to leave their pups scattered rather than grouped together, and will take significantly longer to retrieve their pups.&lt;ref name="pmid22950531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brooks LR, Le CD, Chung WC, Tsai PS | title = Maternal behavior in transgenic mice with reduced fibroblast growth factor receptor function in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Behavioral and Brain Functions | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 47 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22950531 | pmc = 3503805 | doi = 10.1186/1744-9081-8-47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veterinary use==
{{Main|Gonadorelin}}

The natural hormone is also used in veterinary medicine as a treatment for cattle with cystic [[ovarian disease]]. The synthetic analogue [[deslorelin]] is used in veterinary reproductive control through a sustained-release implant.

[[Hadrosaurid]]s, also commonly referred to as duck-billed [[dinosaur]]s or hadrosaurs, were large terrestrial [[herbivory|herbivore]]s. The '''diet of hadrosaurid dinosaurs''' remains a subject of debate among paleontologists, especially regarding whether hadrosaurids were [[grazing|grazers]] who fed on vegetation close to the ground, or [[browsing (predation)|browsers]] who ate higher-growing leaves and twigs. Preserved stomach content findings have indicated they may have been browsers, whereas other studies into jaw movements indicate they may have been grazers.

The mouth of a hadrosaur had hundreds of tiny teeth packed into dental batteries. These teeth were continually replaced with new teeth.&lt;ref name="HornerWeishampel2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horner |first=John R. |authorlink=Jack Horner (paleontologist) |author2=Weishampel, David B. |author3= Forster, Catherine A.  |editor=Weishampel, David B. |editor2= Dodson, Peter |editor3=Osmólska Halszka (eds.)|title=The Dinosauria |edition=2nd |year= 2004|publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-24209-2 |pages=438–463 |chapter=Hadrosauridae }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008–2009 study by [[University of Leicester]] researchers analyzed hundreds of microscopic scratches on the teeth of a fossilized ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' jaw and determined hadrosaurs had a unique way of eating unlike any creature living today. In contrast to a flexible lower jaw joint prevalent in today's mammals, a hadrosaur had a unique hinge between the upper jaws and the rest of its skull. The team found the dinosaur's upper jaws pushed outwards and sideways while chewing, as the lower jaw slid against the upper teeth.

[[Coprolite]]s (fossilized droppings) of some Late [[Cretaceous]] hadrosaurs show that the animals sometimes deliberately ate rotting wood. Wood itself is not nutritious, but decomposing wood would have contained fungi, decomposed wood material and [[detritus]]-eating [[invertebrate]]s, all of which would have been nutritious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chin, K. | title=The Paleobiological Implications of Herbivorous Dinosaur Coprolites from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana: Why Eat Wood?| journal=PALAIOS | volume=22 | issue=5 |date=September 2007 | doi=10.2110/palo.2006.p06-087r | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.2110%2Fpalo.2006.p06-087r | accessdate=2008-09-10 | pages=554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular importance was the unequal lengths of the forelimbs and hindlimbs. He interpreted his new animal as a [[kangaroo]]-like animal that browsed along rivers, using its forelimbs to manipulate branches.&lt;ref name=JL58/&gt;&lt;ref name=BSC07/&gt; His vague inference of amphibious habits would later be expanded upon by [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who contributed the mistaken conclusion that hadrosaur teeth and jaws were weak and suitable only for eating soft water plants.&lt;ref name=JHO64/&gt;

Significantly, Cope regarded his ''Diclonius'' as an amphibious animal consuming soft water vegetation.

===Lull and Wright (1942)===

The early study of hadrosaurid dietary adaptations and feeding behavior was summarized in a 1942 [[monograph]] by [[Richard Swann Lull]] and [[Nelda Wright]]. Unlike previous authors, they moved away from soft water plants as the major part of the diet, but retained the interpretation of an amphibious lifestyle.  They drew attention to the extensive development of the hadrosaurid dental batteries, and compared their dental equipment to that of horses, noting the advantage the dinosaurs had in continual replacement of teeth. However, they found the purpose of the dental batteries uncertain: hadrosaur jaws were unlike those of any modern reptiles, and there did not appear to be an evolutionary pressure on hadrosaurids like [[evolution of the horse|grasses were for horses]].  Lull and Wright eliminated the soft plants as the primary choice of diet, and eliminated grasses on the grounds that the beak was unlike that of grazing birds like geese, and that the quantity of available grasses appeared insufficient to feed hadrosaurids.  Instead, they proposed [[equisetales|equisetaleans]] (horsetails) as the major food source, as these plants existed in the same times and places as hadrosaurids, are known to be rich in [[starch]], and contain abrasive [[silicon dioxide|silica]] which would necessitate teeth that could be replaced.  Softer land and water plants were proposed as secondary foods.  Lull and Wright found that their proposed feeding ecology was comparable to that of a modern [[moose]], which browses on trees and feeds on water plants in wetlands.  They further interpreted the complex anatomy of hadrosaurid snouts and nasal passages as adaptations to feeding underwater, like moose.&lt;ref name=LW42b&gt;Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). ''Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America''. p. 30–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lull and Wright added a new element to hadrosaurid feeding by proposing the presence of muscles analogous to mammalian [[buccinator muscle|cheek muscles]], which would hold in food chopped by the teeth. These muscles would be attached on bony ridges present on the upper and lower jaws.  The authors interpreted the action of the jaws as limited to simple up–and–down motions, finding forward–backward motion unlikely based on skull articulation. The vertical motion would cut food into short lengths, and the pieces would be retained by the cheeks.  To manipulated the food in the cheeks, the authors inferred the presence of a well-developed tongue.&lt;ref name=LW42c&gt;Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). ''Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America''. p. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ostrom (1964) and reception===
The general preexisting consensus on hadrosaurid paleobiology was challenged in 1964 by [[John Ostrom]], who found little evidence to support either a diet of aquatic plants or an amphibious lifestyle.  Unlike previous depictions, he interpreted hadrosaurids as terrestrial foragers that browsed on land plants, not aquatic plants. Like Lull and Wright, he drew attention to the robust dental batteries, and found that hard, resistant foods were the most likely diet (such as woody, silica–rich, or fibrous materials).  Unlike Lull and Wright, he interpreted hadrosaur jaws as using a complex rodent–like forward–backward grinding motion, and did not comment on the possibility of cheeks.  Drawing  on an older proposal made during study of a hadrosaur specimen with a preserved beak, he noted the possibility that the animals stripped leaves and shoots from branches by closing the beak over branches and pulling back.  A terrestrial diet was also supported by the 1922 gut content study, which found conifer needles and twigs, seeds, and fruits inside the specimen.  There was also more circumstantial evidence for terrestrial feeding. Ostrom found that hadrosaurid skeletal anatomy indicated that the animals were well–adapted to move on land, and were well–supported by [[ossification|ossified]] [[tendon]]s along the [[spinous process|vertebral spines]], which would have hindered swimming.  He also reported that aquatic plant pollen was rare in the rock units hadrosaurids are known from, which indicates that aquatic plants were uncommon.&lt;ref name=JHO64/&gt;

==1984 hadrosaurid chewing hypothesis==
In 1984, David B. Weishampel proposed a new hypothesis on how hadrosaurids fed. His study of the sutures between bones in fossil skulls concluded that [[ornithopod]]s, a group of [[Ornithischia|bird-hipped]] dinosaurs that includes hadrosaurids, had flexible upper jaws and that when the lower jaw clamped shut, pressure would spread outward from both sides of the upper jaw.  The upper teeth would grind against the lower teeth like rasps, trapping the plants and grinding them up.&lt;ref name=DBW84&gt;{{cite book |last=Weishampel |first=David B. |authorlink=David B.

A study into exactly how a hadrosaur broke down and ate its food was conducted by Vince Williams, a graduate student at the University of Leicester; Paul Barrett, a [[paleontology|paleontologist]] with [[London]]'s [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]; and [[Mark Purnell]], a British paleontologist  from the geology department of the [[University of Leicester]].&lt;ref name=VSWetal09&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Vincent S. |author2=Barrett, Paul M. |author3= Purnell, Mark A.  |year=2009 |title=Quantitative analysis of dental microwear in hadrosaurid dinosaurs, and the implications for hypotheses of jaw mechanics and feeding |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=27 |pages=11194–11199|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812631106 |pmid=19564603 |pmc=2708679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Teeth scratches reveal dinosaur menu |work=[[Natural Environment Research Council|PlanetEarth Online (Natural Environment Research Council)]] |date=2009-06-30 |url=http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=467 |accessdate=2009-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719233932/http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=467 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three men employed a new approach to analyze the feeding mechanisms of dinosaurs, and thus help understand their place in the prehistoric ecosystems.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; Chewing on solid food always leaves tiny scratches on the teeth's surfaces.

Wiliams, Barrett, and Purnell conducted their study using the jaws of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid that lived between 68 and 66 million years ago in what is now the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The specific ''Edmontosaurus'' jaw used in this study was collected from Late Cretaceous rocks found in the United States.&lt;ref name=VSWetal09/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt; The individual teeth on the jaw contained multiple hundreds of microscopic scratches, which had been preserved intact during [[fossil]]ization. The researchers carefully cleaned the jaws, molded them and coated them with gold to make a detailed replica of the tooth surface. Then they used a [[scanning electron microscope]] to give high-power magnification of the scratches for study, and conducted a three-dimensional statistical analysis of the direction of the scratches.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VSWetal09/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt;

The study found that the hadrosaur chewed using a method completely different from any creature living today,&lt;ref name="AP0629"/&gt; and utilized a type of jaw that is now extinct.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; The study found the ''Edmontosaurus'' jaw had four different sets of parallel scratches running in different directions. Purnell concluded each set of scratches related to a specific jaw movement. This revealed the movement of hadrosaurs was complex and employed movement in several different directions, including up-and-down, front-to-back and sideways movements. The trio concluded that in contrast to the flexible lower jaw joint prevalent in modern mammals, the hadrosaur had a hinge between its upper jaws and the rest of its skull.&lt;ref name="AP0629"/&gt; According to the study, the hadrosaur would push its upper jaws outwards and sideways, while the lower teeth slid against the upper teeth.&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt; As the tooth surfaces slid sideways across each other, the food would be ground and shredded before consumption.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; Purnell said the style of eating, "was not a scissor-like movement; it seems that these dinosaurs invented their own way of chewing."&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt; Although the upper-jaw teeth hinged outward when the hadrosaur ate, Purnell said it was likely the dinosaur could still chew with its mouth closed. While the outward flexure of the upper jaws might have been visible, Purnell said the chewing was likely concealed by the hadrosaur's cheeks and probably looked "quite subtle".&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bryner |first=Jeanna |title=Study hints at what and how dinosaurs ate |work=[[LiveScience]] |date=2009-06-29 |url=http://www.livescience.com/animals/090629-dino-teeth.html |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Equisetopsida.jpg|thumb|150px|right|An extant [[horsetail]], ''[[Equisetum telmateia]]'']]The study also made conclusions about what hadrosaurids ate, although Purnell cautioned the conclusions about the hadrosaur's diet were "a little less secure than the very good evidence we have for the motions of the teeth relative to each other."&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; The scratches found on each individual tooth were so equal that measuring an area of just one square millimeter was enough to sample the whole jaw. The team concluded the evenness of the scratches suggested the hadrosaur used the same series of jaw motions over and over again. As a result, the study determined that the hadrosaur diet was probably made of leaves and lacked the bulkier items such as twigs or stems, which might have required a different chewing method and created different wear patterns.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; The lack of pit marks on the teeth also upheld these conclusions, and suggested the hadrosaurs likely grazed on low-lying vegetation that lacked pits, rather than browsing on higher-growing vegetation with twigs.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; The scratches also indicated the hadrosaur's food contained either small particles of [[gritstone|grit]], which was normal for vegetation cropped close to the ground, or that it contained microscopic granules of [[silicon dioxide|silica]], which is common in [[grass]].&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous period, but were not particularly common, so the study concluded it probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet. Instead, they believed [[equisetum|horsetails]], a common plant at the time containing the above characteristics, was probably an important food for the dinosaur.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt; The results of the study were published online on June 30, 2009, in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', the official journal of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. The study was published under the title, "Quantitative analysis of dental microwear in hadrosaurid dinosaurs, and the implications for hypotheses of jaw mechanics and feeding".&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt;

It was the first quantitative analysis of tooth microwear in dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Vince|last=Williams|author2=Purnell, Mark|journal=[http://www.le.ac.uk/litandphil/transactions.html Transactions of the Leicester Literary &amp; Philosophical Society] |volume=102 |year=2008 |pages=58–59 |title=Duck-billed dentistry: evidence for hadrosaur diet from tooth microwear (Abstract)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purnell said the technique employed in the study was equally important as the findings themselves, and that the study proved analyzing microscopic scratch marks on teeth can provide reliable information about an animal's diet and chewing mechanism.&lt;ref name="PlanetEarth"/&gt; Purnell said this method could be used to study other areas of scientific research, including the dietary habits of other long-vanished species including dinosaurs, extinct groups of fish or very early mammals.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; Purnell said the findings were further significant not only for the basic understanding of how hadrosaurids ate, but also because a lack of such understanding from those dinosaurs represented a "big gap in our knowledge" of the ecosystem of the late Cretaceous. Because hadrosaurs were the dominant terrestrial herbivores of that time, they played a major role in structure the ecosystem of the Late Cretaceous period. Purnell said, "The more we understand the ecosystems of the past, and how they were affected by global events like climate change, the better we can understand how changes now are going to pan out in the future."&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt; Lawrence Witmer, a paleontologist with [[Ohio University]] [[Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine|College of Osteopathic Medicine]] in [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], called the study, "One of the best microwear papers I've seen", although he said he was not yet convinced the hadrosaurid upper jaw could flex.&lt;ref name="ScienceMag"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Into the Mouth of the Hadrosaur |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2009-07-10 |volume=325|issue=5937|doi=10.1126/science.325_129d|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that hadrosaurs were likely grazers rather than browsers appears to contradict previous findings from preserved stomach contents found in the fossilized guts in previous hadrosaurs studies.&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt;  In response to such findings, Purnell said preserved stomach contents are questionable because they do not necessarily represent the usual diet of the animal.&lt;ref name="BoyleOnGrazing"&gt;This information comes from the aforementioned Alan Boyle source from June 29, 2009.

Since the comments were written by Boyle himself, and since they cite information he received specifically from Purnell, they are as legitimate a source of information as the article itself.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Boyle]], a journalist and [[MSNBC]] science editor who reported on the team's findings, said of the apparent contradictions between Williams ''et al.''.'s study and previous stomach content findings are subject to debate, but do not necessarily render Williams ''et al.''.'s study irrelevant or incorrect. Specifically, Boyle said, "the claims about grazing vs. browsing are certainly not conclusive (but) the researcher's surmise is that they were more likely to graze".&lt;ref name="BoyleOnGrazing"/&gt; Williams ''et al.''.'s hypothesis of hadrosaurids as grazers who ate vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs, would also contradict the portrayal of hadrosaurs in ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', the 1990 science fiction novel by [[Michael Crichton]].&lt;ref name="AlanBoyle"/&gt;

'''Healing environment''', for [[healthcare]] buildings describes a physical setting and [[organizational culture]] that supports [[patient]]s and families through the [[stress (medicine)|stresses]] imposed by illness, hospitalization, medical visits, the process of healing, and sometimes, bereavement. The concept implies that the physical healthcare environment can make a difference in how quickly the patient recovers from or adapts to specific acute and chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stichler | first1 = J.F. | year = 2001 | title = Creating healing environments in critical care units | url = | journal = Critical Care Nursing Quarterly | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1097/00002727-200111000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The original concept of the healing environment was developed by [[Florence Nightingale]] whose theory of nursing called for nurses to manipulate the environment to be therapeutic (Nightingale, F. 1859).&lt;ref name="notes on nursing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on Nursing|year=1859|publisher=public domain|location=Gutenberg Project|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nightingale outlined in detail the requirements of the "sick room" to minimize suffering and optimize the capacity of a patient to recover, including quiet, warmth, clean air, light, and good diet. Early healthcare design followed her theories outlined in her treatise, "Notes on Hospitals.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on Hospitals|year=1860|publisher=Public Domain|location=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Notes_on_hospitals.html?id=k_w5uPm0D-cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the discoveries by Louis Pasteur and others which lead to the Germ Theory, plus other technologies, the role of the environment was dominated by infection control and technological advances.

Starting in the 1960s, healing environments have been linked with [[Evidence-based design]] (EBD), giving the concept a strong scientific base. While in some respects it can be said that the concept of healing environments has evolved into EBD, it’s mainly in the area of reduction of stress that this overlap occurs; as EBD goes beyond the healing environments dimension to consider the effect of the built environment on patient clinical outcomes in the areas of staff stress and fatigue, patient stress, and facility operational efficiency and productivity to improve quality and
patient safety. A 1984 study by Roger Ulrich found that surgical patients with a view of nature suffered fewer complications, used less pain medication and were discharged sooner than those who looked out on a brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R.S.|title=View through a window may influence recovery from surgery|year=1984|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roger_Ulrich4/publication/17043718_View_through_a_window_may_influence_recovery_from_surgery/links/00b4953a3febc6e176000000.pdf|journal=Science|volume=224|pages=420–421|doi=10.1126/science.6143402|pmid=6143402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many studies have followed, showing impact of several environmental factors on several health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Dijkstra|first=K.|title=Understanding healing environments: Effects of physical environmental stimuli on patients' health and well-being|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/60753/1/thesis_K_Dijkstra.pdf|author= |date= |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the philosophy that guides the concept of the healing environment is rooted in research in the [[neuroscience]]s, [[environmental psychology]], [[psychoneuroimmunology]], and [[evolutionary biology]]. The common thread linking these bodies of research is the physiological effects of stress on the individual and the ability to heal. Psychologically supportive environments enable patients and families to cope with and transcend illness.

== Goal ==

The goal of creating a healing environment is to reduce stress, and thereby reduce associated problems such as medical error, inability to concentrate, and physical symptoms of stress that can affect logical thought process. While use of EBD techniques would not necessarily make an environment a healing one, through EBD we can define environmental factors that can help to ease stress and thereby result in a healing environment. Malkin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Malkin J|date=2008|title=A visual reference for evidence-based design.|url=|journal=Center for Health Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the contribution of research to concepts that can create a healing environment, but just the inclusion do not make setting a 'healing environment'. The design team needs to translate the [[Evidence-based design|EBD]] into design solutions unique to the individual hospital. 

According to "The Business Case for Creating a Healing Environment" written by Jain Malkin, the physical setting has the potential to be therapeutic if it achieves the following:
* eliminates environmental stressors such as noise, glare, lack of privacy and poor air quality;
* connects patients to nature with views to the outdoors, interior gardens, aquariums, water elements, etc.;
* offers options and choices to enhance feelings of being in control - these may include privacy versus socialization, lighting levels, type of music, seating options, quiet versus 'active' waiting areas;
* provides opportunities for social support - seating arrangements that provide privacy for family groupings, accommodation for family members or friends in treatment setting; sleep-over accommodation in patient rooms;
* provides positive distractions such as interactive art, fireplaces, aquariums, Internet connection, music, access to special video programmes with soothing images of nature accompanied by music developed specifically for the healthcare setting; and
* engenders feelings of peace, hope, reflection and spiritual connection and provides opportunities for relaxation, education, humour and whimsy.

== Bringing Home to the Hospital ==

The most important thing for inpatients at hospitals is the comfort and normalcy of having family members and friends that visit and spend time with them.  With advances in healthcare most patients are treated in an outpatient setting, where they come in have a procedure or test run and then go back to their homes.  Today’s inpatients are more likely to have a serious condition and be there for a period of at least several days and sometimes even months.  This explains the growing trend of creating healthcare environments that make not only the patient, but also their loved ones feel like they can relax and maybe even forget that they’re at the hospital.  It is proven that if someone feels comfortable and relaxed, they can rest easier and heal faster{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

== Importance of Lighting and Sound ==

'''Lighting''' Eighty percent of what we interpret of our surroundings comes to us from what we see of our environment and that is greatly affected by the light available in that environment.  Lighting design in healthcare environments is a major factor in creating healing situations.  Since the design of healthcare environments is said to influence patient’s outcomes, yet high costs prevent most hospitals from renovating or rebuilding, changes in lighting becomes a cost-effective way to improve existing environments.  It is proven that people who are surrounded by natural light are more productive and live healthier lives.  When patients are sick, and surrounded by medical equipment and white walls, the last thing they need is a dark, stuffy room.  This is why it is important for every room to have a window for natural light to come into and help create a healing environment for the patient.

'''The Auditory Environment'''   While so much of the patient's experience is based on visual cues, the majority of meaning of their experience is auditory.  The many sounds of a hospital are foreign to their experience and their line of sight is limited.  Nightingale claimed that sounds that create "anticipation, expectation, waiting, and fear of surprise ...damage the patient."(&lt;ref name="notes on nursing" /&gt;).  Add to the perception and meaning attribute to any sound the factors of age-related hearing impairment common to older patients, heavy medication, pain, and other conditions, cognition is impacted as is the ability to understand language.  Hospital noise, at any volume level, is credited with being the primary cause of sleep deprivation, a contributing factor in delirium, and a risk factor for errors.&lt;ref&gt;BI&amp;T (Mazer, SE, Increase Patient Safety by Creating a Quieter Hospital Environment Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology Journal, September/October 2010 - See more at: http://www.healinghealth.com/resources/increase-patient-safety/#sthash.VwFmiKBu.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;  The current pressure to reduce noise at night has been mistakenly understood to mean undue quiet at night when patients most need cues that people are around them and available if they need help.  Just s lighting must be designed to serve both day and night, so much the auditory environment be designed to support activity,cognition, rest, and sleep.

Adding to the above, patients need positive visual and auditory stimulation.  Nightingale called for variety, color, and form as a means of arousing creativity and health in patients.  Currently, using appropriate art, nature imagery and music are found to improve the experience of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mazer, Susan E [1]; Music and Nature at the Bedside, Part I, published by Research Design Connections, 2009
Mazer, Susan E [2]; Music and Nature at the Bedside, Part II, published by Research Design Connections, 2010 /&lt;/ref&gt;  Technologies have afforded patients infinite options to use media as the choose.  The addition of beauty must also be accompanied by an attention to orderliness:  removal of clutter, trash, and other distractions.

The '''Philippine Council for Health Research and Development''' ('''PCHRD''') enhanced its system of collecting entries to its databases, popularly known as HERDIN or Health Research and Development Information Network to ease access to health research information. The new distributed system called HERDIN Network of Networks (NeON) is being deployed to research institutions nationwide.

[http://www.herdin.ph/ HERDIN] is a specialized network of documentation and information centers engaged in health research and development activities. HERDIN hosts electronic collection or database of bibliographic entries of published and unpublished health researches in the Philippines in cooperation with other member-institutions.

==Vision==
Quality health information, on time and online, for better health, better quality of life.

==Mission==
To build the capacities of health research institutions to participate in building and in sharing information resources as part of managing knowledge for better health.

==History==
It started during the 1980s as a project of the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development ([[PCHRD]]) supported by the International Development Research Centre ([[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]]) of Canada, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), and the [[British Council]] with the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] and [[University of the Philippines Manila]] as major cooperators.

'''Public health in Niger''' suffers from a chronic lack of resources and a small number of health providers relative to population. Some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  

== Health infrastructure ==
There are government hospitals in [[Niamey]] (with three main hospitals in Niamey, including the ''[[National Hospital (Niamey)|National Hospital of Niamey]]'' and the ''[[Lamordé University Hospital|Hôpital National De Lamordé]]''), [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]], [[Tahoua]], [[Zinder]] and other large cities, with smaller medical clinics in most towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stone-env.com/docs/atlases/NigerPrelimPov/Map8.pdf REPUBLIC OF NIGER PRELIMINARY ATLAS OF POVERTY/VULNERABILITY.

Prepared for The World Bank Technical Department, Africa Region. 6 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medical facilities are limited in both supplies and staff, with a small government healthcare system supplemented by private, charitable, religious, and Non-government organisation operated clinics and public health programs (such as [[Galmi Hospital]] near [[Birnin Konni]] and Maradi).&lt;ref name=who2006/&gt;

Government hospitals, as well as [[public health]] programmes, fall under the control of the [[Nigerian Ministry of Health]]. A number of private for profit clinics ("''Cabinets Médical Privé''") operate in Niamey and other cities. The total expenditure on health per capita in 2005 was Intl $25.  There were 377 [[physicians]] in [[Niger]] in 2004, a ratio of 0.03 per 10,000 population.  In 2003, 89.2 percent of individual expenditures on healthcare were "out-of-pocket" (paid by the patient).&lt;ref name=who2006&gt;[http://www.afro.who.int/home/countries/fact_sheets/niger.pdf Niger.

==Health status==
[[Malaria]] exists across the populated arc of southern Niger.  [[Polio]], as recently as 2000 considered endemic in places, exists as a small number of cases annually, mostly imported from northern [[Nigeria]] which in 2005 was the home of around 40 percent of the world's confirmed cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/mch/ch/techareas/polio.html Polio Eradication Initiative: Program Overview].

===Meningitis===
{{Further|African meningitis belt}}

Niger is within a belt of sub-Saharan Africa susceptible to seasonal outbreaks of [[Neisseria meningitidis]]: a meningococcal bacterial [[meningitis]].  These outbreaks tend to occur around the end of the "cold" season (temperatures dropping down to 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) at night in some areas) in February to the beginning of the rainy season in May.  The [[2009 West African meningitis outbreak]] resulted in several thousand infections and more than one hundred deaths.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200903120120.html|title=Nigeria: Battling the Lassa, CSM Outbreaks|date=2009-03-11|publisher=All Africa|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83384|title=In Brief: Meningitis infections climb in Niger |date=2009-03-09|publisher=IRIN News|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200903050913.html|title=West Africa: Meningitis Emergency Vaccine Stock Tapped Early|date=2009-03-05|publisher=All Africa|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nigerdiaspora.info/index.php/sant%C3%A9/sant%C3%A9/agadez-:-des-migrants-vecteurs-de-la-m%C3%A9ningite/ Agadez : des migrants vecteurs de la méningite].

===Measles===
[[Measles]] outbreaks still occur in Niger, in part due to the low vaccination rate and in part due to [[Seasonal migration in Niger|seasonal migration]] of rural populations. Sporadic outbreaks in Nigerien communities were found to have occurred beginning at the end of the rainy season, when many rural populations begin seasonal migration pattern, with traveling children often missing their vital second immunization booster against the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-02/2008-02-06-voa76.cfm Researchers Blame Seasonal Migration for Measles in Niger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916082342/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-02/2008-02-06-voa76.cfm |date=2008-09-16 }}.

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Niger}}

2008 estimates ranged from 44,000 to 85,000 people living with HIV in a nation of around 14 million, with an adult (aged 15 to 49) prevalence rate of between 0.6% and 1.1%.  Adults aged 15 and up living with HIV were estimated to range from 42,000 to 81,000, with women of this age range making up about a third (12,000 to 26,000). Estimates of children (under 14) living with HIV were between 2,500 and 4,200. Total deaths were estimated to be between 3,000 to 5,600 per year. [[Aids orphan]]s (under 17) were estimated at between 18,000 and 39,000.&lt;ref name=UNoverview&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/niger.asp UNAIDS country overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325170242/http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/niger.asp |date=2009-03-25 }}. Accessed 2009-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Maternal and child healthcare ===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Niger is 820.  This is compared with 600.7 in 2008 and 890.1 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 167 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 22. In Niger the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 1 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 16.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20499">{{short description| Procedure to integrate safety practices into a particular task }}
{{more footnotes|date=February 2010}}

A '''job safety analysis''' (JSA) is a procedure which helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a particular task or job operation. In a JSA, each basic step of the job is to identify potential hazards and to recommend the safest way to do the job. Other terms used to describe this procedure are job hazard analysis (JHA) and job hazard breakdown.

The terms "job" and "task" are commonly used interchangeably to mean a specific work assignment, such as "operating a grinder," "using a pressurized water extinguisher" or "changing a flat tire." JSAs are not suitable for jobs defined too broadly, for example, "overhauling an engine"; or too narrowly, for example, "positioning car jack."

==Terminology and definitions==

;Workplace hazard categories:
:Workplace hazards can be allocated to three categories:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: [[#Workplace Hazard Types|Types]],
:: [[#Workplace Hazard Groups|Groups]], and
:: [[#Hazard Families|Families.]]

;Workplace hazard types:
:There are two hazard types. They are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: Hazards to safety - anything assessed as "possible", or more likely, to cause an immediate injury
:: Hazards to health - anything assessed as "possible", or more likely, to cause harm by repeated exposure over time.

;Workplace hazard groups:
:There are three hazard groups. They are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: Physical object hazard – touch or inhale it.
:: Hazardous work type – requires a permit, qualification etc.
:: Duty of care breaches - Legislative and/or company contraventions.

;Hazard families:
:There are many hazard families. The following list is not exhaustive. Many hazards will fit into more than one family.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:Physical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, biological, magnetic, thermal, gravitational, environmental, ergonomic, psychological, invisible, visible, and developing.{{clarify|reason=what is meant by developing|date=June 2017}}

;Workplace hazard criteria:
: These criteria are a set of tests to help identify genuine workplace hazards related to a task.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: '''"Clearly identifiable"''' means that the hazard type, group and family are clearly linked to a hazard.
:: '''"A scenario is not required for its articulation"''' - It can be clearly described in few (generally five, or less, words). If this is not possible, it is probably not a hazard.
:: It has an inherent likelihood of '''"possible"''' or greater - If the hazard under consideration is not inherently at least "possible", then it does not present a risk.
:: The description is '''without "judgmental adjectives"''' - Judgmental adjectives are negative and sometimes overlap with "descriptions of absence". Adjectives such as poor, deficient, defective, scant, weak, unsound, or faulty, are not used in the hazard column.
:: The description '''contains no "descriptions of absence"''' - Descriptions of absence are usually negative and sometimes overlap with judgmental adjectives. They include: Without, lack of, minimal, unsuitable, unavailable, inadequate, missing, non-existent.

;Mechanism of Injury (MoI):
:Mechanism of injury (MoI) is how an injury occurs. It is important because in the absence of an MoI there is no hazard.
:Common MoIs are "slips, trips and falls", for example:
:: Hazard = Tool bag (in walkway)
:: MoI =  Trip (over tool bag)
:: Injury =  Bone fracture 
: Other common mechanisms of injury include:
:* Struck against or by
:* Contact with or by
:* Caught in, on, by or between
:* Exposure to
:* Fall to same or lower level

;Likelihood:
:Likelihood is how often an event is reasonably and realistically expected to occur in a given time, and may be expressed as a [[probability]], [[frequency]] or percentage.

;Consequence:
:Consequence is the outcome of an event expressed qualitatively or quantitatively, being a loss, injury, disadvantage or gain. There may be a range of possible outcomes associated with an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=AS/NZS4360:2009 Risk Management/year=2009|publisher=Australian Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Consequence is the severity of the injury or harm that can be reasonably and realistically expected from exposure to the mechanism of injury of the hazard being rated.
:An implemented control may affect the severity of the injury, but it has no effect on the way the injury occurred. Therefore, when rating risk, the consequence remains the same for both the initial rating and the residual rating.
:People inherently tend to overestimate severity of consequence when rating risk,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} but the rating should be both reasonable and realistic.

;Risk:
: [[Risk]] is the combination of likelihood and consequence.

;Risk Authority:
:The organisational level of the person authorised to accept a specified level of risk, for example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Risk Level !! Risk Authority
|-
| Low risk || Supervisor
|-
| Moderate risk || Superintendent
|-
| Significant risk || Manager
|-
| High risk || Unacceptable without mitigation
|}
 
;ALARP:
:[[ALARP]] is an acronym for "As Low As Reasonably Practicable".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Risk Management - Risk assessment techniques - International Standard IEC/ISO 31010|year=2011|publisher=ISO| pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:When applied to JSA, this means that it is not necessary to reduce risk beyond the point where the cost of further control becomes disproportionate to any achievable safety benefit.
:The acronym "ALARA",  which stands for "As Low As Reasonably Achievable", is also in common usage.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

;Reasonably Practicable:
: Reasonably practicable, in relation to a duty to ensure health and safety, means that which is, or was at a particular time, reasonably able to be done to ensure health and safety, taking into account and weighing up all relevant matters including:&lt;ref&gt;How to determine what is reasonably practicable to meet a health and safety duty - Guidance note - Safe Work Australia - May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the likelihood of the hazard or the risk concerned occurring; 
:* the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or the risk; 
:* what the person concerned knows, or ought reasonably to know, about the hazard or risk, and about the ways of eliminating or minimising the risk; 
:* the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk; and
:* after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, including whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to the expected reduction of risk.

;Work Process:
:The way in which work is performed is called the "Work Process".

;PEPE:
:Acronym for the four elements that are present in every task of the work process:
:* '''P'''rocess,
:* '''E'''nvironment,
:* '''P'''eople,
:* '''E'''MT, which is itself an acronym for 'equipment, materials and tools'.
:'''PEPE''' is used to assist in identifying hazards.

;Process
:In this context, process is about procedures, standards, legislation, safe work instructions, permits and permit systems, risk assessments and policies.
:Key factors for effective process are that the relevant components are in place, easy to follow and regularly reviewed and updated.

;Environment:
: People may be exposed to issues related to:
* Access &amp; Egress.
* Obstructions.
* Weather.
* Dust, heat, cold, noise.
* Darkness.
* Contaminants.
* Isolated workers.
* Other Workers.

;People:
:To assist people to be safe in their workplace they need to be provided with sufficient information, training, instructions and supervision.
:People may be:
:* Untrained.
:* Not yet competent.
:* Uncertified.
:* Inexperienced.
:* Unsupervised.
:* Affected by alcohol or other drugs.
:* Fatigued.
:* Inadequately instructed.
:* Suffering from stress from home life or [[workplace bullying]].
:* Have a poor attitude to, or refuse to follow procedures.

;Equipment, Material and Tools  (EMT):
:The right EMT must be selected for the task. Incorrect EMT selections may be hazardous in themselves.
:* The EMT may be hazardous, e.g.: sharp, hot, vibrating, heavy, fragile, contain pinch points, a hazardous substance containing hydrocarbons, acids, alkalis, glues, solvents, asbestos etc.
:* There may be a need for isolating personnel from energy sources such as electricity, hydraulic, pneumatic, radiation and gravitational sources.
:* Is the EMT in date? Does it require certification and/or calibration, tested and tagged?
:* Obstructions should be kept out of walkways and leads and hoses suspended?

==Hazard controls==

Controls are the barriers between people and/or assets and the hazards.

A hard control provides a physical barrier between the person and the hazard. Hard controls include machine guards, restraint equipment, fencing/barricading.

A soft control does not provide a physical barrier between the person and the hazard. Soft controls include signage, procedures, permits, verbal instructions etc.

===Control effectiveness criteria===

The effectiveness of a control is measured by its ability to reduce the likelihood of a hazard causing injury or damage. A control is either effective or not.

To gauge this effectiveness several control criteria are used, which:
*Address the relevant aspects of PEPE,
*Reduce likelihood to ALARP,
*Selected hard controls in preference to soft controls, and
*Contain a ‘doing word’.

There is no commonly used mathematical way in which multiple controls for a single hazard can be combined to give a score that meets an organisations acceptable risk level.  In instances where the residual risk is greater than the organisations acceptable risk level, consultation with the organisations relevant risk authority should occur.

===Hierarchy of control===

[[Hierarchy of hazard control|Hierarchy of control]] is a system used in industry to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

It is a widely accepted system promoted by numerous safety organizations. This concept is taught to managers in industry, to be promoted as 
a standard practice in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Various illustrations are used to depict this system, most commonly a triangle.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The hierarchy of hazard controls are, in descending order of effectiveness:  Elimination,  Substitution,  Engineering,  Administration and Personal Protective Equipment. In some systems, Isolation is included in the list of controls. The list then is Elimination,  Substitution,  Isolation, Engineering,  Administration and Personal Protective Equipment.

== Scope of application ==
A JSA is a documented risk assessment developed when company policy directs employees to do so. Workplace hazard identification and an assessment of those hazards may be required before every job.

JSAs are usually developed when directed to do so by a supervisor, when indicated by the use of a first tier risk assessment and when a hazard associated with a task has a likelihood rating of 'possible' or greater.

Generally, high consequence, high likelihood task hazards are addressed by way of a JSA.

These may include, but are not limited to, those with:

A history of, or potential for, injury, harm or damage such as those involving:

# Fire, chemicals or a toxic or oxygen deficient atmosphere.
# Tasks carried out in new environments.
# Rarely performed tasks.
# Tasks that may impact on the integrity or output of a processing system.
It is important that employees understand that it is not the JSA form that will keep them safe on the job, but rather the process it represents. It is of little value to identify hazards and devise controls if the controls are not put in place. Workers should never be tempted to "sign on" the bottom of a JSA without first reading and understanding it.

JSAs are quasi-[[legal document]]s, and are often used in [[incident investigation]]s, [[contractual dispute]]s, and court cases.

== Structure of a JSA ==
The JSA or JHA is usually created by the [[work group]] who will perform the task. The more minds and experience applied to analysing the hazards in a job, the more successful the work group is likely to be in controlling them. Sometimes it is expedient to review a JSA that was prepared when the same task was performed on a previous occasion, but care should be taken to ensure that all of the hazards for the job are controlled for the new occasion. The JSA is usually recorded in a standardised tabular format with three to as many as five or six columns.{{clarify|reason=what are the other columns for?|date=June 2017}} The headings of the three basic columns are: Job step, Hazard and Controls. A Hazard is any factor that can cause damage to [[personnel]], [[property]] or the [[Natural environment|environment]] (some companies include loss of production or [[downtime]] in the definition as well). A Control is any process for controlling a hazard. The job is broken down into its component steps. Then, for each step, hazards are identified. Finally, for each hazard identified, controls are listed. In the example below, the hazards are analyzed for the task of erecting scaffolding and welding lifting lugs:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Job step
! Hazard
! Control
|-
| rowspan="2" | Erect scaffolding
| Falling scaffolding components
| '''Barricade''' work area while erecting and dismantling scaffolding  
|-
| Working at height
| '''Verify''' scaffolder competence&lt;br/&gt; '''Inspect''' scaffold components and structure&lt;br/&gt; '''Tag''' scaffolding after approval &lt;br/&gt; '''Wear''' appropriate PPE (harness, hard hats, safety footwaer etc.) &lt;br/&gt; '''Tether''' tools
|-
| rowspan="4" | Weld lugs
| Electrical current
| '''Wear''' insulated gloves&lt;br/&gt; '''Inspect''' cables, connections and tools before use
|-
| Welding fumes
| '''Ventilate''' using intrinsically safe fume extraction fans &lt;br/&gt; '''Wear''' respiratory protection when appropriate
|-
| Welding arc
| '''Wear''' welding helmet with eye protection, fire resistant overalls, welding gloves and apron&lt;br/&gt;'''Erect''' welding screens if appropriate
|-
| Hot weld metal, sparks and slag
| '''Remove''' all combustibles from work area&lt;br/&gt; '''Lay out''' fireproof drop cloths.&lt;br/&gt; '''Set up''' appropriate fire fighting equipment in work area &lt;br/&gt;'''Maintain''' a fire watch during task plus 30 minutes.
|-
| Housekeeping
| Obstacles in work area
| '''Maintain''' a clear path work area&lt;br/&gt; '''Remove''' unnecessary and vulnerable equipment &lt;br/&gt; '''Display''' warning signage &lt;br/&gt;'''Barricade''' danger areas
|}

=== Assessing risk levels ===

Some organisations add columns for risk levels. The risk rating of the hazard prior to applying the control is known as the 'inherent risk rating'. The risk rating of the hazard with the control in place is known as the 'residual' risk rating.

Risk, within the occupational health and safety sphere, is defined as the 'effect of uncertainties on objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management - Principles and guidelines|publisher=Standards Australia|isbn=0 7337 9289 8|pages=Preface (a)}}&lt;/ref&gt;'. In the context of rating a risk, it is the correlation of 'likelihood' and 'consequence', where likelihood is a quantitative evaluation of frequency of occurrences over time, and consequence is a qualitative evaluation of both the "Mechanism of Injury" and the reasonable and realistic  estimate of "Severity of Injury".

Example:

:There is historical precedent to reasonably and realistically evaluate that the likelihood of an adverse event occurring while operating a hot particle producing tool, ([[grinding machine|grinder]]), is "possible", therefore the activity of grinding meets the workplace hazard criteria.

:It would also be reasonable and realistic to assume that the mechanism of injury of an eye being struck at high speed with hot metal particles may result in a permanent disability, whether it be the eye of the grinder operator, a crew member or any person passing or working adjacent to, above or below the grinding operation.

:The severity of reasonably and realistically expected injury may be [[blindness]]. Therefore, grinding warrants a high severity rating.

:Wearing eye protection while in the vicinity of grinding operations reduces the likelihood of this adverse event occurring.

:If the eye protection was momentarily not used, not fitted correctly or failed and hot high speed particles struck an eye, the expected mechanism of injury (adverse event) has still occurred, hence the consequence rating remains the same for both the inherent and residual consequence rating.

:It is accepted that the control may affect the severity of injury, however, the rated consequence remains the same as the effect is not predictable.

One of the known risk rating anomalies is that likelihood and the severity of injury can be scaled, but mechanism of injury cannot be scaled. This is the reason why the mechanism of injury is bundled with severity, to allow a rating to be given.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The MoI is an important factor as it suggests the obvious controls.

=== Identifying responsibilities ===
Another column that is often added to a JSA form or [[worksheet]] is the ''Responsible'' column. The Responsible column is for the name of the individual who will put the particular control in place. Defining who is responsible for actually putting the controls in place that have been identified on the JSA worksheet ensures that an individual is accountable for doing so.

=== Application of the JSA ===
After the JSA worksheet is completed, the work group that is about to perform the task would have a [[toolbox talk]], to discuss the hazards and controls, delegate responsibilities, ensure that all equipment and personal protective equipment described in the JSA are available, that contingencies such as [[fire fighting]] are understood, communication channels and hand signals are agreed etc. Then, if everybody in the work group agrees that it is safe to proceed with the task, work can commence.

If at any time during the task circumstances change, then work should be stopped (sometimes called a "time-out for safety"), and the hazards and controls described in the JSA should be reassessed and additional controls used or alternative methods devised. Again, work should only continue when every member of the work group agrees it is safe to do so.

When the task is complete it is often of benefit to have a close-out or "tailgate" meeting, to discuss any lessons learned so that they may be incorporated into the JSA the next time the task is undertaken.

'''Sir John Bruce''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|FRCSEd]] (6 March 1905 – 30 December 1975) was a Scottish surgeon who was Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery in the University of Edinburgh and President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

==Early life==
John Bruce was born in [[Dalkeith]], Midlothian on 6 March 1905.&lt;ref name = "BMJ"&gt;Obituary. Sir John Bruce  ''British Medical Journal''  1976;1:159&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated MB ChB with honours from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in 1928. After resident appointments at the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] and the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Royal Hospital for Sick Children]] in Edinburgh, he worked in general practice in Grimsby while studying for the Fellowship of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (FRCSEd), which he obtained in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=List of fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: from the year 1581 to 31st December 1873 | url=https://archive.org/details/b21465812 | year=1874 | publisher=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh | accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E005676b.htm|title=Bruce, Sir John – Biographical entry – Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online|last=England|first=Royal College of Surgeons of|website=livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was then appointed clinical tutor to Professor [[John Fraser (surgeon)|Sir John Fraser]], Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery and in 1935 was appointed assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary with charge of the surgical outpatient department. During this time he ran, in partnership with his surgical colleague [[Ian Aird]], a highly acclaimed lecture and tutorial course to prepare candidates for the Fellowship examination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His MD thesis on congenital dislocation of the hip was awarded the Syme medal.&lt;ref name = "Ross"&gt;Ross JA. Sir John Bruce 1905–1975. ''Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh''.1976; 21(3):190-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service in Second World War==
Bruce had joined the Territorial Army as an officer in 11th(2nd Scottish) General Hospital(TA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/52_Division__1930_38_.pdf|title=British military history|year=1938|access-date=1 February 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the outbreak of war this was mobilised as 23 (Scottish) General Hospital (RAMC) with Bruce serving as a surgical specialist in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC). The hospital unit joined the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian Expeditionary Force]] in 1940. For his actions in the evacuation of the field hospital during the Allied retreat he was mentioned in despatches. After promotion he was posted as Surgeon to the 14th Army in South East Asia with the rank of Brigadier, serving first in South East Asia Command, and subsequently in Burma. During this campaign he was befriended by [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Field Marshall Sir William Slim]], a friendship which they continued after the war. On demobilisationon in 1945 he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (Mil) and received the [[Territorial Decoration]] (TD).

==Surgical career==
On return to Edinburgh he was appointed Surgeon to the [[Western General Hospital]] and in 1946 he was instrumental in founding the combined medical and surgical Gastrointestinal Unit in partnership with Dr Wilfred Card.&lt;ref name = Ross /&gt; The concept of combined patient care by physicians and surgeons was an innovative one at that time.  Combined care was particularly applicable to two common gastrointestinal problems of the day, peptic ulcer and inflammatory bowel disease. His research interests also encompassed breast disease.&lt;ref name = "BMJ"/&gt;

In 1955 he was the driving force behind the founding of the ''Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh'' a publication which he continued to edit until his death.&lt;ref name = Ross /&gt;

He was appointed to the [[Regius Chair of Clinical Surgery]] at the University of Edinburgh in 1956, in succession to [[James Learmonth|Sir James Learmonth]].&lt;ref name = "BMJ"/&gt;

His original papers covered many aspects of surgical research and he co-authored ''A Manual of Surgical Anatomy''&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, John, Robert Walmsley, and James A. Ross. Manual of Surgical Anatomy. Edinburgh: Livingstone, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
John Bruce  was knighted in 1963 and in that year was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). He was Surgeon to Queen in Scotland from 1966 to 1975. He was [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] from 1957 to 1962 and was President of the [[Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland]], President of the British Cancer Council and President of the International Federation of Surgical Colleges and Associations. With Ian Aird and [[William Hinton (physician)|Dr William Hinton]] of New York he jointly founded The James IV Association of Surgeons and served as its President.&lt;ref name = "BMJ"/&gt;

John Bruce married Mary Whyte Craig in 1935. They had no children. He died in Edinburgh on 30 December 1975.&lt;ref name = "BMJ"/&gt;

[[File:Ah Pah Dam project, Klamath river, 1951.svg|thumb|right|The planned reservoir lake on the Klamath river]]
The '''Klamath Diversion''' was a federal water project proposed by the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] in the 1950s. It would have diverted the [[Klamath River]] in Northern [[California]] to the more arid central and southern parts of that state. It would relieve irrigation water demand and [[groundwater]] overdraft in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] and boost the water supply for [[Southern California]]. Through the latter it would allow for other Southwestern states—[[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]]—as well as [[Mexico]] to receive an increased share of the waters of the [[Colorado River]]. 

Although many different versions of the plan were put forth, all would have involved damming the Klamath River, as well as the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] and several other tributaries. A tunnel would have carried much of the Klamath's water to the [[Sacramento River]], whose flow would be routed around the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]] and travel under the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] to the [[Los Angeles Basin]]. However, the Klamath River has one of the western continental United States' most significant [[salmon run]]s, and building the diversion would have all but destroyed this productive fishery. Both commercial fishermen and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]—namely the [[Yurok people|Yurok]]—opposed the plan, as did the city of [[Los Angeles]]. The city saw the Klamath Diversion as a "ploy to encourage it to relinquish its claim on the share of the river [the Colorado] it considered its own".&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The rapid development of the American Southwest in the late 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with a wet period that swelled the flow of rivers, allowing for much more water consumption than was sustainable under normal, long-term conditions. The Colorado River, the main water supply of the Desert Southwest, averaged {{convert|17|e6acre.ft|km3}} of annual runoff from pre-1920s gaged records. At that time, there was ample amount for all the Southwest states and Mexico. When the region spun out of its wet spell, the Colorado was found to have a maximum sustainable runoff of perhaps {{convert|14.5|to|16|e6acre.ft|km3}} per year. This great reduction in water supply spurred Southern California to look north to the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]]–[[San Joaquin River|San Joaquin]] river system for water. However, most of the water in these rivers was already appropriated for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815164-5,00.html
|title=Science: Endless Frontier

|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only remaining large, undammed river systems in California were those in the wild North Coast region, which drain to the Pacific Ocean nearly unused by agriculture or cities. The Klamath is the largest of these rivers, discharging more than {{convert|12|e6acre.ft|km3}} annually. Not counting smaller rivers in [[Oregon]] such as the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue]] and [[Umpqua River|Umpqua]], the closest rivers that provide a similar or greater flow are the [[Columbia River]] in the north and its tributary the [[Snake River|Snake]]. The Klamath River was not only closer, but has over twice the flow of either the Rogue or Umpqua, and over one-third of the discharge of the Snake. At the time, diverting the Klamath into the Sacramento River system, in turn augmenting its flow for use in Central and Southern California, was an attractive idea. The first plans to divert the Klamath appeared in a 1951 Bureau of Reclamation report called the United Western Investigation: Interim Report on Reconnaissance.

The major physical barrier towards development of the Klamath River is the climate of its watershed. The Klamath River begins in the high desert of southern Oregon, and the average annual flow at [[Keno, Oregon|Keno]] (about 20 miles below [[Upper Klamath Lake]]) is just over {{convert|1.1|e6acre.ft|km3}}. A Klamath Diversion at this point would be simple–an aqueduct running south to [[Shasta Lake]] on the Sacramento River—but the flow here is not enough to warrant such an effort. The river gains most of its volume in high rainfall regions as it approaches the coast, but here it is walled off from the Sacramento River system by the [[Klamath Mountains]]. Any diversion from the lower Klamath would require one of the most massive engineering projects ever undertaken.

==Proposals and controversy==
Due to the heavy controversy, the initial Bureau of Reclamation proposal for the project was defeated, but the project continued to resurface throughout the 1960s and 1970s in several different forms. In 1965 Congress passed a bill requiring the Bureau of Reclamation to seek congressional approval before conducting feasibility studies for water projects. This placed such a handicap on the development of new projects that it may have been responsible for killing the Klamath Diversion in its entirety.

The original plan consisted of one large reservoir on the main Klamath, located about {{convert|12|mi|km}} above the mouth of the Klamath at the Pacific Ocean. The Ah Pah Reservoir would be formed by the {{convert|813|ft|m|adj=on}}-high&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Blue Creek – Ah Pah
|publisher=Blue Creek – Ah Pah Traditional Yurok Village Website
|date=
|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ah Pah Dam]]. This {{convert|15|e6acre.ft|km3|sing=on}} reservoir would extend {{convert|70|mi|km}} up the Klamath River, with a {{convert|40|mi|km|sing=on}}-long Trinity River arm that would also flood part of its [[South Fork Trinity River|South Fork]]. The lower half of the [[Salmon River (California)|Salmon River]] and a number of smaller tributaries would also be flooded under the reservoir. 

From the Trinity arm, a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} tunnel would be drilled under the Klamath Mountains to the [[Sacramento Valley]], through which water would flow by gravity into the Sacramento River. From there it would travel to the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and Southern California through the proposed [[Peripheral Canal]] (which would bypass the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]]) and the [[California Aqueduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Klamath Diversion was also considered as part of the California Water Plan, a statewide effort in the early 1960s to provide more water for the [[California State Water Project|State Water Project]], for irrigation in the Central Valley and urban uses in Central and Southern California. The California Water Plan was virtually identical to the Bureau of Reclamation proposal, except on a matter of scale. No fewer than sixteen new dams were proposed, including four on the Klamath River, five on the Trinity River, and others on the [[Smith River (California)|Smith]], [[Mad River (California)|Mad]], and [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] systems. Like the Bureau of Reclamation proposal, this iteration died a victim of its own colossal size.

Ironically, the City of Los Angeles and other entities within Southern California – who would be among the principal beneficiaries – heavily opposed the plan. The prevailing local belief was that the Klamath Diversion was a plot by politicians in the other Colorado River basin states (especially Arizona) to get Southern California to let go of the water it was taking from the Colorado. Combined with concerted opposition from Northern California voters, who saw it as just another water grab by the thirsty south that would damage the ecology, fisheries and natural beauty of the North Coast, the project never left the drawing boards.

==Legacy==
The scaled-down California Water Plan would become the [[California State Water Project]], drawing its main water supply from the [[Feather River]], a tributary of the Sacramento River.

A diversion from the Klamath basin to the Sacramento was eventually undertaken on a far smaller scale, through the construction of the Trinity River Division of the [[Central Valley Project]], which appropriates about {{convert|1.2|e6acre.ft|km3}} per year from the Trinity River, a major Klamath River tributary.

Most of the North Coast rivers originally slated for damming have since been granted [[National Wild and Scenic River]] status, effectively eliminating the possibility for such a project.

The '''La Mesa Dam and Reservoir'''  is an [[earth dam]] whose [[reservoir]] can hold up to 50.5 million cubic meters and occupying an area of 27 square kilometers in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. It was built in 1929 under the supervision of the construction firm Pedro Siochi and Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamesawatershed.com/background.php |title=ABS - CBN Foundation &amp;#124; Bantay Kalikasan &amp;#124; Save La Mesa Watershed |publisher=Lamesawatershed.com |date=1999-06-21 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Angat Dam|Angat]]-[[Ipo Dam|Ipo]]-La Mesa water system, which supplies most of the water supply of [[Metro Manila]].

==Water treatment==
[[File:Metro Manila water zones.PNG|left|thumb|Metro Manila and its surrounding areas are divided into two water concessionaires: Maynilad Water (red) and Manila Water (blue).]]
The water collected in the reservoir is treated at the [[Balara Treatment Plant]] by the [[Manila Water]], the private [[concessionaire]] of the [[Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]], the government agency in charge of water supply, in [[Metro Manila's East Zone]]. 1.5 million liters of water pass through this reservoir every day. It is located in the [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation]], the last forest of its size in the metropolis.

'''Licensed professional counselor''' ('''LPC''') is a [[licensure]] for [[mental health professional]]s in some countries.

In the US, licensed professional counselors (or in some states, "licensed clinical professional counselors" or "licensed mental health counselors") provide mental health and substance abuse care to millions of Americans.
Licensed professional counselors (LPCs) are doctoral and master's-level mental health service providers, trained to work with individuals, families, and groups in treating mental, behavioral, and emotional problems and disorders. LPCs make up a large percentage of the workforce employed in community mental health centers, agencies, and organizations, and are employed within and covered by managed care organizations and health plans. LPCs also work with active duty military personnel and their families, as well as veterans.

Licenses are awarded for professional counselors ('''LPC''') and professional counselor supervisors ('''LPC-S'''); Interns are identified with the corresponding suffix "I" ('''LPC-I'''), and [[Licensed Professional Counselor Associate]]s, with the suffix "-A"; this also applies to licensed therapists, as in the case of Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists ('''LMFT''') who are designated as: '''LMFTA'''.

In U.S., the exact title varies by state, but the other most frequently used title is ''licensed mental health counselor'' (LMHC).  Several U.S. states, including [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], and [[Tennessee]], have implemented a two-tier system whereby both the LPC and LCPC (or equivalent) are used. In those states higher tier professionals are granted the privilege to practice independently. However, in most states LPC's or LMHC's may practice independently. Licensed Professional Counselors are one of the six types of licensed mental health professionals who provide psychotherapy in the United States.

In addition to their education, LPCs must obtain supervised clinical experience and must pass a state licensing exam. Different states require one of several different licensing examinations. Examples are the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE) as well as the National Certified Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE). LPCs are regulated by federal and state laws, which either protect the title of LPC or LMHC or actually define the scope of practice of a professional counselor and stipulate certain client protections. If an LPC is also a member of a professional association or has received additional certifications, they must adhere to the codes of ethics of the professional association or certification body with which they have aligned.

==Requirements for professional counselors==
===United States===
LPC (or variation, e.g. LCPC, LMHC, etc.) licensure is recognized in 50 states in the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.org/publicpolicy/whoarelpcs.pdf|title=WHO ARE LICENSED PROFESSIONAL COUNSELORS?|website=Counseling.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements vary from one jurisdiction to the next.  Most states require some combination of a master's degree, counseling experience and supervision, as well as passing a national examination, such as the National Counselor Examination (NCE) and/or the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Examination (NCMHCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcc.org/Certification-Licensure |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209070211/http://nbcc.org/Certification-Licensure |archivedate=February 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of requirements from the state of [[Texas]] LPC board serves as an example;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/counselor/lpc_apply.shtm|title=Texas Department of State Health Services, Texas State Board of Examiners of Professional Counselors  - Apply for a New License - Requirements|first=Texas Department of State Health|last=Services|website=Dshs.state.tx.us|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; requirements vary from state to state.  For example, practicum/internship requirements (during the master's degree) vary significantly between states (i.e.: 300 in Texas and 1000 in Vermont). Course requirements and credit amount also vary, making reciprocity between states difficult for many licensed counselors.

#A master's degree or doctoral degree in counseling or a related field.
#Academic course work in each of the following areas: normal human growth and development; abnormal human behavior; appraisal or assessment techniques; counseling theories; counseling methods or techniques (individual and group); research; lifestyle and career development; social, cultural and family issues; and professional orientation.
#As part of the graduate program, a supervised practicum experience that is primarily counseling in nature. The practicum should be at least 300 clock-hours with at least 100 clock-hours of direct client contact. Academic credit for the practicum must appear on the applicant's transcript.
#After completion of the graduate degree and before application, an applicant must take and pass the National Counselor Exam and the Texas Jurisprudence Exam. After receiving a temporary LPC license from the board, the applicant may begin the supervised post-graduate counseling experience (internship). 3000 clock-hours with at least 1,500 being direct client contact of internship under the supervision of a board-approved supervisor is required. The 3000 clock-hours may not be completed in a time period of less than 18 months."

====Exemptions====
Some states, such as [[Oregon]], have broad exemptions that allow the practice of professional counseling without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unlicensed-practitioner.com/69/|title=Practicing Your Profession In Oregon Without a License, Legally and Ethically - Alternative &amp; Unlicensed Practitioners|date=6 December 2014|website=Unlicensed-practitioner.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, nothing in the chapter regulating professional counseling applies to the activities, services, titles, and descriptions of persons employed, as professionals or as volunteers, in the practice of counseling for IRS recognized 501(c)(3)  public and private nonprofit organizations or charities. [Alabama Code 34-8A-3-a-6]

===Canada===
In the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], the Ordre des conseillers et conseilleres d'orientation et psychoeducateurs et psychoeducatrices du Quebec (OCCOPPQ) grants counselor licensure. The Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association, CCPA offers a distinct certification, Canadian Certified Counsellor (CCC), separate from the regular professional membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/en/memberbenefits/certification/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605064802/http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/en/memberbenefits/certification/ |archivedate=June 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Professional Counsellors Association (CPCA) is a national competency-based association that provides the designation of Registered Professional Counsellor (RPC) to its members. Unlike degree-based associations, a specific degree level does not automatically qualify applicants for membership.  Instead, the CPCA requires core competencies in education and experience prior to taking a qualifying exam and undergoing psychological testing  as part of the membership application process.  Counsellors must then embark on a two-year candidacy under the supervision of an approved Clinical Supervisor prior to becoming a full member.  The CPCA membership roles are a mixture of Diploma, Bachelor, Master, and PhD level degree holders, and its primary purpose is the protection of the public and the promotion of competency in the mental health profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpca-rpc.ca|title=Home: Canadian Professional Counsellors Association - Canada BC|first=David|last=Teal|website=Cpca-rpc.ca|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well; the Canadian Addiction Counsellors Certification Federation (CACCF) promotes, certifies and monitors the competency of addiction specific counsellors in Canada using current and effective practices, which are internationally recognized. The certifications CACCF issues and its professional conduct review process provide public protection for counsellors, employers, regulatory agencies, clients and their families. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caccf.ca/pdf/Membership%20Handbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The Ministry of Labor and Human Resources grants counselor licensure.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, Lembaga Kaunselor Malaysia grants counselor licensure.

'''Local [[gigantism]]''' or '''localised gigantism''' is a condition in which a certain part of the body acquires larger than normal size due to excessive growth of the anatomical structures or abnormal accumulation of substances. It is more common in [[finger]]s and [[toe]]s, where it is termed '''macrodactyly'''. However, sometimes an entire limb may be enlarged.

==Causes==
Local gigantism may be caused by a heterogeneous group of both [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired conditions.

===Congenital===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Elephantman1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|An extreme example of local gigantism in [[Joseph Merrick]], the Elephant Man, who may have had [[Proteus syndrome]]]] --&gt;
Congenital causes include:
*[[Klippel Trenaunay Weber syndrome]]
*[[Maffucci syndrome]]
*[[macrodystrophia lipomatosa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijri.org/articles/archives/20001002/letter3.htm Letter to the Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907143525/http://www.ijri.org/articles/archives/20001002/letter3.htm |date=September 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[neurofibromatosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lassmann H, Gebhart W, Mamoli B, Niebauer G |title=Nervous lesions in a case of local gigantism |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=109–15 |year=1977 |pmid=878849 |doi=10.1007/BF00688556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chung IH, Kim NH, Choi IY |title=Macrodactylism associated with neurofibroma of the median nerve.

*[[Proteus syndrome]], which by one theory accounts for the deformities of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]]

===Acquired===
There are a number of acquired causes of local gigantism. A body part can attain bigger size from causes as common as the following:
*[[inflammation]], due to trauma or infection
*[[tumor]]s like [[Osteoma|osteoid osteoma]], [[melorheostosis]], and [[lipofibromatous hamartoma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Razzaghi A, Anastakis DJ |title=Lipofibromatous hamartoma: review of early diagnosis and treatment |journal=Canadian Journal of Surgery |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=394–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16248139 |doi= |pmc=3211895}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arteriovenous malformation]]s occurring on a limb, before the closure of [[epiphyses]] in [[long bone]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianheartjournal.com/SeptOctober2001/abstact/659-662/265_focal_gigantism.htm Case report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514125923/http://indianheartjournal.com/SeptOctober2001/abstact/659-662/265_focal_gigantism.htm |date=May 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Elephantiasis tropica|Elephantiasis]], which is quite common in [[south-east asia]] due to prevalence of [[filariasis]].
*[[Adult-onset Still's disease|Still's disease]]
*[[amyloidosis]]
*[[acromegaly]]

===Treatment===
As the causes of local gigantism are varied, treatment depends on the particular condition.  Treatment may range from [[antibiotics]] and other medical therapy, to [[surgery]] in order to correct the anatomical anomaly.

{{nihongo|'''Naomi Uemura'''|植村 直己|Uemura Naomi|February 12, 1941 – c. February 13, 1984}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[adventurer]]. He was particularly well known for doing alone what had previously been achieved only with large teams. For example, he was the first man ever to reach the [[North Pole]] solo, the first man ever to raft the [[Amazon river|Amazon]] solo, and the first man ever to climb [[Denali]] solo. He disappeared while attempting to climb Denali in the winter.

==Early adventures==
Uemura was born in [[Hidaka, Hyōgo|Hidaka]], now part of [[Toyooka, Hyōgo]], Japan. Shy by nature, he began climbing in college in the hope that [[mountaineering]] would increase his self-confidence.

Naomi Uemura was a licensed radio amateur operator, signed as JG1QFW. He used amateur radio communication during his expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;QST Magazine, Sep., 1978, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;QST Magazine, May, 1984, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

While still in his 20s, Uemura had climbed solo [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], [[Aconcagua]], [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]], had walked the length of [[Japan]] and summited during the first (1970) Japanese expedition to climb [[Mount Everest]] and subsequent disastrous 1971 International Everest Expedition.

== North Pole ==
Uemura wrote that he almost gave up twice during his 1978 North Pole trip. On the fourth day of his trek, a [[polar bear]] invaded his camp, ate his supplies, and poked his nose against the sleeping bag where Uemura lay tense and motionless. When the bear returned the next day, Uemura was ready and shot him dead. On the 35th day of the trip, Uemura had hunkered down on an ice floe with his [[Alaskan Malamute|malamutes]], when there was the roar of breaking ice and the floe cracked into pieces. He and his dogs were stranded on a tossing island of ice. After a night of terror, Uemura found a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} ice bridge and raced to safety.

He persevered, and became the first ever to reach the Pole solo. Describing his 57-day push, he wrote, "What drove me to continue then was the thought of countless people who had helped and supported me, and the knowledge that I could never face them if I gave up." In this trip he cooperated with the [[Canadian Air Force]] and received his supplies from its [[helicopter]]s. After the trip he questioned such extensive support and decided to carry supplies on his own back.

==First Denali ascent ==
In August 1970, Uemura climbed Denali (then known as Mt McKinley) solo, becoming the first person ever to reach the top alone. He did this quickly and with a light pack (8 days up, versus an average of 14 days or so; {{convert|55|lb|adj=on}} pack, versus an average probably twice that). August is after the end of the normal climbing season. While the weather he faced was not terrible, the mountain was almost empty with only four other people on it. Though many people have climbed Denali alone since Uemura, most do it in the middle of the climbing season.

Uemura dreamed of soloing across [[Antarctica]] and climbing that continent's highest peak, [[Vinson Massif]]. In preparation, in 1976 he did a solo sled-dog run from [[Greenland]] to [[Alaska]], in two stages and 363 days.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20070742,00.html Naomi Uemura Almost Always Walks Alone—this Time Across the Arctic to the North Pole May 1, 1978] ''[[People (magazine)]]'' Retrieved September 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He set a record for the long-distance record for a dog-sled journey at 12,000 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/09/12/national/epic-journey-across-ice-set-to-break-world-record/ Epic journey across ice set to break world record September 12, 2001] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved September 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denali winter ascent==
Uemura then prepared to climb Denali again solo in winter; however, for people unfamiliar with Alaskan climbing, the difficulty of a winter ascent can often be misjudged. Historically, nobody had successfully climbed any large Alaskan peak in winter until 1967, when Gregg Blomberg organized an expedition that got to the top of Denali (Blomberg himself did not summit). This team lost one member and nearly lost the remaining members in a storm on the way down. Team member Art Davidson's book, ''Minus 148,'' recounts the events of the climb and was named after the storm that jeopardized the team.  

There is a high degree of danger with [[glacier]] travel, and even short treks across the ice are considered hazardous. For example, glaciers are often broken with cracks, called [[crevasse]]s, that are often covered with snow and not visible. Due to these occurrences as well as other underlying factors, an ascent is both very difficult and very dangerous to attempt without a team.
 
Uemura had developed a "self-rescue" device which consisted of [[bamboo]] poles tied over his shoulders. The poles would span any crevasse into which he fell and allow him to pull himself out. He planned a very light run, with only a {{convert|40|lb|adj=on}} pack plus sled. He kept his gear light by planning to sleep in snow caves and therefore freeing himself from needing to carry a tent. He also skimped on fuel and planned to eat cold food.

He began his climb in early February 1984, and reached the summit on February 12. Some time later, climbers would find the Japanese flag that he left at the summit.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1997/02/10/national/exhibit-celebrates-late-alpine-adventurer/ February 10, 1997] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved September 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
On February 13, 1984, one day after his 43rd birthday, Uemura spoke by radio with Japanese photographers who were flying over Denali, saying that he had made the top and descended back to {{convert|18000|ft|m}}. He planned to reach base camp in another two days, but never made it.

There appeared to be high winds near the top, and the temperature was around {{convert|-50|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Planes flew over the mountain but did not see him that day. He was spotted around {{convert|16600|ft|m}} the next day (presumably on the ridge just above the headwall). However, complications with weather made further searching difficult.
 
It was likely that Uemura was running out of fuel at this point but because of his reputation, nobody wanted to send a rescue party for fear it would offend him. Doug Geeting, one of the bush pilots who had been "Uemura spotting" over the previous week, said "If it were anybody else, we'd have somebody [a rescuer] on the mountain already". On February 20, the weather had cleared and Uemura was nowhere to be found. There was no sign of his earlier camp at {{convert|16600|ft|m}}, and no evidence that caches left by other climbers nearby had been disturbed.

Two experienced climbers were dropped at {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to begin a search. Though another storm came in, they stayed on the mountain until February 26, finding a cave in which Uemura had stayed at {{convert|14000|ft|m}} on the way up, but no sign of the climber himself. A diary found in the cave revealed that Uemura had left gear there in order to lighten his load on the summit push. He had also left his self-rescue poles back at {{convert|9500|ft|m}}, knowing he was past the worst crevasse fields. Most people figured he had fallen on his descent of the headwall and been hurt, died, and was buried by snow. Another theory is that he could have made it to {{convert|14200|ft|m}} (which is the base of the headwall) and then fallen into one of the many crevasses there and perished.

A group of Japanese climbers arrived to look for the body. They failed, though they did locate much of his gear at {{convert|17200|ft|m}}.

The diary found in the {{convert|14000|ft|m}} cave has been published in Japanese and English. It describes the conditions that Uemura suffered – the crevasse falls, -40° weather, frozen meat, and inadequate shelter. The diary entries showed him to be in good spirits, and documented the songs he sang to stay focused on his task.

The last entry read,
: "I wish I could sleep in a warm sleeping bag. No matter what happens I am going to climb McKinley."

==Legacy ==
Uemura gave frequent public lectures and wrote about his travels. His adventure books for children were popular in Japan. There is a museum dedicated to him in Tokyo,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.uemura-museum-tokyo.jp/ 植村冒険館] Retrieved September 7, 2015 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in [[Toyooka, Hyōgo]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www3.city.toyooka.lg.jp/boukenkan/index.html 植村直己冒険館] Retrieved September 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

An award named for him was created in Japan after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2004/07/06/national/doctor-plans-global-trek-to-explore-how-japanese-got-here/ Doctor plans global trek to explore how Japanese got here July 6, 2004] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved September 7, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/01/15/national/huge-hot-air-balloon-debuts-for-pacific-try/ Huge hot-air balloon debuts for Pacific try January 15, 2003] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved September 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the best-known compositions of experimental guitarist [[Michael Hedges]], "Because it's There", was a tribute to Uemura written for a film about the explorer's life.

He is remembered not only as a gifted climber and a driven adventurer, but also as a gentle, self-effacing man who cared about others. In the words of Jonathan Waterman,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Just as remarkable] as his solo achievements was his sincere modesty and unassuming nature. Another part of his greatness lay in his deep interest in everyone he met.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a commentary on research published by ''[[The Lancet]]'', Sleepio was described as “a proven intervention for sleep disorders using the internet”.&lt;ref name=TheLancet&gt;Mike Moore, [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61220-3/ “Looking for a good night’s sleep”], ''The Lancet'', July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' described Sleepio as “about as effective as CBT delivered in person”.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, J. M., [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7450_supp/full/497S16a.html “Insomnia: Chasing the dream”], ''Nature'', May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In March 2013 Sleepio was one of the launch apps in the NHS-approved Healthy Apps Library.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Hodgson, [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324266904578460913262105152 “U.K. Health Service Takes Closer Look at Apps’ Potential”], ''The Wall Street Journal'', May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleepio was one of ten partners worldwide to launch on [[Jawbone (company)|Jawbone]]’s UP self-tracking platform in April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Dante D’Orazio, [https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4283626/jawbone-bodymedia-acquisition-up-platform-api-fitness-data-share “Jawbone launches an ecosystem for Up, lets other apps tap into your fitness data”], ''The Verge'', April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing import of sleep data collected by the UP activity tracker into Sleepio. Integrated support is also available to users of the [[BodyMedia]] FIT band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=BodyMedia Teams with Sleepio &amp; A.R.O. to Support Sleep &amp; Life Improvements |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bodymedia-teams-with-sleepio--aro-to-support-sleep--life-improvements-209168021.html |date=2013-05-28 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
The Sleepio program is delivered via the web and via Apple devices.&lt;ref&gt;Espie, C. A., Hames P., McKinstry, B., [https://archive.is/20140523084703/http://www.sleep.theclinics.com/article/S1556-407X(13)00057-X “Use of digital (internet and mobile) media delivery of cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy], “Sleep Medicine Clinics”, September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual sleep expert, The Prof, guides the user through six interactive weekly sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Lamberg, [http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=1310504 “The Virtual Doctor Will See you Now”], ''Psychiatric News'', August 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The results of the CBT group show that Sleepio is comparable in effectiveness to face-to-face delivered cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name=TheLancet/&gt;

== Awards ==
In November 2013, Sleepio was the winning "Healthcare IT Product Innovation" as selected by a UK healthcare industry website, E-Health Insider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/mobile/8954/mersey-burns-app-wins-ehi-awards-2013 “Mersey Burns App wins EHI Awards 2013”], ''EHI Mobile'', October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The start-up was also a semi-finalist in the BIG Awards organised by Cisco Systems, Inc. in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Baldwin, [http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240203636/Cisco-announces-BIG-Awards-startup-semi-finalists “Cisco announces BIG Awards startup semi-finalists”], ''Computer Weekly'', August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Sleepio won the Bupa Startup competition at [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Health.&lt;ref&gt;Liat Clark, [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-04/29/sleepio-wired-health "Insomnia app Sleepio wins startup competition at Wired Health"], ''Wired'', May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the company behind the Sleepio program, Big Health, was chosen as the Best Health Startup at The Europas Awards, the annual event honoring the best tech startups in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Europas Awards - The Winners |url=http://theeuropas.com/2014/06/10/the-europas-awards-the-winners/ |date=2014-06-10 |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408044317/http://theeuropas.com/2014/06/10/the-europas-awards-the-winners/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition states that type 22 tobacco is a type of fire-cured tobacco, known as Eastern District fire-cured, produced principally in a section east of the Tennessee River in southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee. Most type 22 tobacco in northern Tennessee is grown in Robertson and Montgomery County.

Type 22 is harvested, stripped and hung inside [[curing barn]]s and a fire is set to provide optimum conditions for curing the product for sale. Incidentally, several barns are lost to fire each year, usually representing a substantial loss for the grower.

'''Water supply and sanitation in Greece''' is characterised by diversity. While [[Athens]] receives its water from a series of [[reservoir]]s, some of which are located 200&amp;nbsp;km away, some small islands are supplied with water from [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]]. Greeks have suffered from repeated [[drought]]s, the most recent one occurring in 2007. The [[EU]] supported the construction of numerous [[wastewater treatment plant]]s since the 1990s in order to achieve EU environmental standards. While the wastewater discharge of the biggest cities is now in compliance with these standards, some smaller towns still lag behind.

In Athens and [[Thessaloniki]], two state utilities – EYDAP and EYATH – are in charge of water supply and sanitation. The companies, which are listed on the Athens stock exchange, post profits despite low tariffs, partly due to investment subsidies from the state. Outside the two largest cities, 230 different municipal utilities are in charge of water supply and sanitation. As part of the so-called [[Kallikratis plan]] for local government reform, smaller municipalities and municipal utilities are to be merged into larger units. The [[Greek financial crisis]] is making it difficult for Greek utilities to increase tariffs, to enforce payment of arrears and to service their debt.

==Water resources==

On average, Greece has quite abundant water resources of 58 billion cubic metres per year (1977–2001), of which the country uses only 12 percent. Of that, 87 percent is used by agriculture, 3 percent by industry and only 10% (or 1.2 percent of total water resources) for municipal water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Resources Institute]]: [http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/wat_cou_300.pdf Water Resources and Freshwater Ecosystems: Greece], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, the average masks substantial variations between years, seasons and regions. Water resources are especially scarce on the Greek islands, some of which are supplied by tanker ships or have turned to seawater desalination. Droughts are a recurrent phenomenon throughout Greece, including a drought in 1993 that was considered the worst in at least 50 years and another drought in 2007. 
[[Image:Lake Marathon Dam, Greece.jpg|left|thumb|Lake Marathon is one of the drinking water sources for Athens]]

===Water sources of Athens===
Because local water sources are insufficient and to hedge against the risk of drought, the metropolitan area of the capital Athens, where more than a third of the population of Greece lives, is supplied by five different water sources, the most distant one located almost 200&amp;nbsp;km away. The five sources are:
* [[Lake Marathon]] close to the city with an operational capacity of 34 million cubic meters and tapped since 1931 through the Boyati tunnel.
* Lake Yliki, 90&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the capital with an operational capacity of 590 million cubic metres and tapped since 1959.
[[Image:Mornos.jpg|right|thumb|Lake Mornos, created by a dam that was initially built for local water supply, is now partially diverted to supply Athens with drinking water]]
* The [[Mornos]] reservoir 192&amp;nbsp;km to the west of Athens with an operational capacity of 670 million cubic metres, tapped since 1980 through a system of tunnels and canals.
* the Evinos reservoir with an operational capacity of 113 million cubic metres, completed in 2001, and linked via a tunnel with the Mornos Reservoir.
* 105 boreholes in three wellfields that are used only in emergency situations.

Due to the need to pump large quantities of water over long distances and mountains, the water company of Athens is the second-largest electricity customer in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;EYDAP:[http://www.eydap.gr/index.asp?a_id=333 Water supply facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thessaloniki''' is partly supplied by the [[Aliakmon]] River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyath.gr/eng/1profil2.htm Thessaloniki Water Supply and Sewerage Co.: Historical Data]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Castelorizon.jpg|thumb|left|Kastelorizo, an island with 430 inhabitants off the Turkish coast, is supplied with drinking water from tanker boats]]
The '''Aegean islands''' are partly supplied by local groundwater sources. However, some smaller islands have insufficient water resources and have to be supplied via tanker ships at a high cost. For example, the islands [[Kimolos]], [[Irakleia, Cyclades|Irakleia]], [[Schoinoussa]], [[Symi]], [[Halki (Greece)|Halki]], [[Patmos]] and [[Kastelorizo]] (Megisti) were partly or entirely supplied via tankers as of 2008. Seawater desalination using renewable energy is an emerging option for these islands. A small wind-powered floating desalination plant has been built as a pilot in 2008 and has been anchored off the shore of Irakleia.&lt;ref&gt;Athens News Agency-Macedonian Press Agency:[http://www.ana.gr/anaweb/user/showplain?maindoc=4743491&amp;maindocimg=4742173&amp;service=102 Greece builds world's first autonomous, floating, ecological desalination platform], ca. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;12 degrees of freedom:[http://12degreesoffreedom.blogspot.com/2008/04/greek-desalination-plant-powered-by.html Greek desalination plant powered by floating wind turbine], 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the inhabitants of Greek islands have also [[rainwater harvesting|harvested winter rains]] from rooftops for use during the summer.

==Institutional responsibility==
'''Policy responsibility'''. Within the Greek government the Ministry of Environment is in charge of water resources management and the Ministry of Interior is in charge of supervising municipalities which are responsible for providing water and sanitation services. The Ministry of Finance plays an important role in providing subsidies for investment.

'''Responsibility for service provision'''. Water and sanitation services in Greece are provided by 230 utilities. The largest utility is the [[Athens]] Water and Sewerage Company (EYDAP SA) serving 4 million inhabitants, followed by the [[Thessaloniki]] Water and Sewerage Company (EYATH SA) serving about one million inhabitants. Both companies buy raw water from the Greek government that operates the dams and pipelines necessary to store and transfer the raw water. The majority of the shares of EYDAP and EYATH are owned by the government. Private companies and individuals own minorities of 39% in the case of EYDAP and 10% in the case of EYATH (including 5% held by the French company [[SUEZ]]). The shares of both companies are listed on the Athens stock exchange.&lt;ref name="WUMI"&gt;Water Utility Management International: [http://www.iwaponline.com/wumi/00502/5.2/default.htm  Greek budget crisis prompts latest water sector reforms], Volume 5 Issue 2, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The largest single shareholder of EYDAP currently is the hedge fund of [[Hank Paulson]] who bought 9.9% of the shares in May 2014 from [[Piraeus Bank]], which in turn had received the shares when it rescued the collapsed [[Agricultural Bank of Greece]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedge fund banks on profits from Athens water privatization|url=http://www.thepressproject.net/article/61231/Hedge-fund-banks-on-profits-from-Athens-water-privatization|publisher=The Press Project|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4 million Greeks are served by 230 municipality-owned companies called DEYA.  The Hellenic Union of Municipal Enterprises of Water Supply and Sewerage (EDEYA), founded in 1989, represents 155 DEYAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edeya.gr/index_en.htm Hellenic Union of Municipal Enterprises of Water Supply and Sewerage]&lt;/ref&gt; There are about a 1,000 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities in Greece]], some of them with fewer than 100 inhabitants.

'''Consolidation of municipal utilities'''. The so-called Kallikratis plan approved in May 2010 foresees the redrawing of the boundaries of Greek municipalities and giving them more resources and responsibilities. Under the plan, which is to become effective as early as January 2011, the number of DEYAs is expected to be reduced through mergers from 230 to 142. The number of DEYAs had been only 80 as recently as 1997 when the so-called Kapodistria law increased their number. Many of the municipal utilities created at that time were small and have faced financial difficulties due to low tariffs and excessive hiring{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. A Greek Ministry of Finance document of 2010 discusses the possibility of creating a holding company to be called Hellenic Waters S.A. for the entire country including EYATH, EYDAP and the DEYAs.&lt;ref name="WUMI"/&gt;

== Impact of the 2010 Greek financial crisis and planned privatisation==
As a result of the Greek financial crisis, the government wants to privatise [[EYDAP]] and EYATH. In June 2010 the Ministry of Finance announced it would reduce its share in the two companies to 51% as part of a broader Hellenic Privatisation Programme. In 2012 the Greek Parliament even voted that the companies should be sold completely. In May 2013 two consortia were prequalified to buy the utilities, one led by the private French water company [[Suez Environnement]] and the other by the public Israeli water company [[Mekorot]].&lt;ref name="Privatizing Water in Greece"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christos Avramidis and Antonis Galanopoulos|title=Privatizing Water in Greece|url=http://borderlinereports.net/2013/07/09/privatizing-water-in-greece/|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A citizens' initiative, called initiative 136, also wants to buy EYATH, but it was not prequalified. Its name derives from €136, which is the estimated value of EYATH's shares that were to be sold originally - 50 million Euro - divided by the number of its water customers.&lt;ref name=I136&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Initiative 136?|url=http://www.136.gr/article/what-initiative-136|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kostas Marioglou, a union leader and activist of initiative 136, insists that the initiative does not want to preserve the status quo of a "state company where the management is political appointments with no water service experience, running the company poorly before they move on to another party position."&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Daniel|title=Greeks Stand up to Protect Their Water from Privatization|url=http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/greeks-stand-up-to-protect-their-water-from-privatization|publisher=On the Commons Magazine|accessdate=12 May 2014|date=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it wants to create a transparent, democratic not-for-profit utility. A non-binding referendum on water privatisation

in Thessaloniki will be held  y  May9, 2014. Mayors have declared their opposition to privasization, and a local survey showed that 76% of respondents had an unfauvorable opinion of privasization.&lt;ref name="PETITJEAN" /&gt; Other coalitions, such as SOSte to nero (Save the water) and Save Greek Water, also oppose the privatisation. Diane D’Arras, Vice-President of Suez, promised annual investments of between 25 and 50 million Euro as well as the creation of 4,000 jobs through privatisation

. These promises were derided by critics as completely unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A public answer to Diane D’Arras|url=http://www.136.gr/article/public-answer-diane-d%E2%80%99arras|publisher=SAVEGREEKWATER, The Initiative for the non privatization on Greece, SOSTE TO NERO, EYATH Employees Union, Movement 136, Water Warriors|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the Greek [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] blocked the transfer of the government's stake to its privatisation fund, the [[Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Greek court blocks privatization of EYDAP water utility|publisher=[[Kathimerini]]|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_26/05/2014_540043|date=26 May 2014|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this decision, a merger of EYDAP with the [[EYATH|Thessaloniki Water Supply &amp; Sewage Co.]] (EYATH) was taken into consideration instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikoleta|last=Kalmouki|title=Possible Merger of Athens and Thessaloniki Water Utilities|publisher=[[Greek Reporter]]|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/12/possible-merger-of-athens-and-thessaloniki-water-utilities/|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government canceled the privation.67% of EYDAP and 74% of EYATH remains to state.

EYDAP and EYATH have posted profits since they were partly privatised in 2000. In 2009 EYDAP posted an after-tax profit of €6 million and EYATH, though much smaller, posted an after-tax profit of €14 million.&lt;ref name="WUMI" /&gt; In 2012, EYATH posted an after-tax profit of Euro 17.8 million while its income stood at €75 million.&lt;ref name="Privatizing Water in Greece" /&gt; The government provided significant investment subsidies. For example, the law that established EYDAP committed the state to subsidise 60% of its capital expenditure either through EU funds or Greek funds. However, subsidies for the DEYAs were reduced by 37% to €23 million in 2010. Many utilities are having difficulties paying back their loans, given the reduction of subsidies and political difficulties concerning tariff increases during an economic crisis. Also, cash revenues may decline due to difficulties in collecting bills from customers whose incomes have been reduced through public sector wage cuts.&lt;ref name="WUMI" /&gt;

Water and wastewater tariffs in Athens and Thessaloniki are increasing-block tariffs under which higher tariffs are charged for higher blocks of consumption. For a consumption of 20 cubic metres per month, the residential combined water and wastewater tariff was €1.20 per cubic metre in Athens and €1.59 per cubic metre in Thessaloniki in 2013. This compares to €1.24 in Rome, €1.57 in Lisbon, €1.62 in Madrid and €3.24 in Paris. Most water tariffs in smaller towns are lower than in Athens and Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence: Global Water Tariff Survey 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to unions, water tariffs in Thessaloniki have tripled between 2001 and 2014.&lt;ref name="PETITJEAN"&gt;{{cite web|last=PETITJEAN|first=OLIVIER|title=Forced Privatizations in Greece: Suez Eyes Taking Over the Water Services of Athens and Thessaloniki|url=http://multinationales.org/Forced-Privatizations-in-Greece|accessdate=12 May 2014|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, EYATH allegedly "supplies the cheapest water in Europe", while actually its tariffs are higher than e.g. in Rome and among the highest in Greece. The company’s profits are partly due to downsizing from 650 employees in 1998 to only 250 in 2013 due to a hiring freeze, with only 11 plumbers for the whole city. The decline occurred despite a growth in the service area.&lt;ref name="Privatizing Water in Greece" /&gt;

==Environmental aspects ==
Greece lags behind in the implementation of the European Union’s Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive of 1991, which required all municipal wastewaters to be treated by 2005. The biggest cities are in compliance with the directive. Athens and Thessaloniki, which discharge into sensitive areas, have wastewater treatment plants with nitrogen removal. The wastewater treatment plant of Athens, located on the island of [[Psyttaleia]], was put into service in 1994, followed by a sludge treatment plant that became operational in 2007. [[Iraklion]] on the island of Crete and [[Patras]] are situated in areas not declared sensitive and provide full secondary treatment followed by nitrogen removal. However, there are issues with insufficient wasteater treatment in some smaller towns.
[[Image:Brücke Arta.jpg|thumb|The town of Arta discharges its wastewater in an ecologically sensitive area in the lower reaches of the Arachtos river (shown here with the famous Arta bridge)]]

In 1999, Greece had identified under the mechanism provided by the Directive 34 lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal water bodies as sensitive areas due to eutrophication. These include some tributaries of the [[Aliakmonas]] river (Grevenitis), the [[Axios]] river and Vozvozis river. The European Commission said that 16 additional water bodies should have been identified as sensitive. Among those were the lower part of the [[Saronic Gulf]] and the Gulf of Thessaloniki. In 2002 the Greek authorities designated the Thessaloniki Gulf and the lower part of the Saronic Gulf as sensitive. The latter receives Athens' wastewater. According to the Greek authorities 17 agglomerations discharge into these sensitive areas. According to the European Commission, in 2002 (no more recent information from the EC is available) the towns of Elefsina [[Aspropyrgos]], [[Grevena]], [[Kilkis]] and Theva discharged their wastewater in sensitive areas without any treatment. Other towns such as [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Serres]] had wastewater treatment plants without phosphorus removal. The latter is required to prevent [[eutrophication]] of sensitive water bodies. Furthermore, some existing wastewater treatment plants do not function properly. In 2002 only 2 of the wastewater treatment plants discharging in sensitive areas achieved the treatment efficiency required by the EU Directive. Concerning cities discharging into areas that were not declared as sensitive, as of 2002, Greece achieved a low compliance rate: It provided secondary treatment for less than 50% of the concerned waste water load.&lt;ref&gt;COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES:REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2004/com2004_0248en01.pdf Implementation of Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment, as amended by Commission Directive 98/15/EC of 27 February 1998], Brussels, 23.4.2004, p. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
