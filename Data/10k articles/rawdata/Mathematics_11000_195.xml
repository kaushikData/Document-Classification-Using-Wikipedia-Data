'''4''' ('''four''') is a [[number]], [[numeral system|numeral]], and [[glyph]]. It is the [[natural number]] following [[3]] and preceding [[5]].

==In mathematics==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Four is the smallest [[composite number]], its proper [[divisor]]s being {{num|1}} and {{num|2}}.

4 is the smallest squared prime (''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the only even number in this form.  4 is also the only square one more than a prime number.

A number is a multiple of 4 if its last two digits are a multiple of 4. For example, 1092 is a multiple of 4 because {{nowrap|1=92 = 4 × 23}}.

In addition, 2 + 2 = 2 × 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4. Continuing the pattern in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]], {{nowrap|1=2 ↑↑ 2 = 2 ↑↑↑ 2 = 4}}, and so on, for any number of up arrows. (That is, {{nowrap|1=2 [''n''] 2 = 4}} for every positive integer ''n'', where {{nowrap|''a'' [''n''] ''b''}} is the [[hyperoperation]].)

A four-sided plane figure is a [[quadrilateral]] (quadrangle) which include kites, rhombi, rectangles and squares, sometimes also called a ''tetragon''. A [[circle]] divided by 4 makes [[right angle]]s and four quadrants. Because of it, four (4) is the base number of the [[plane (mathematics)]]. Four [[cardinal directions]], [[Season|four seasons]], the [[duodecimal]] system, and the [[vigesimal]] system are based on four.

A solid figure with four faces as well as four vertices is a [[tetrahedron]], and 4 is the smallest possible number of faces (as well as vertices) of a [[polyhedron]]. The regular tetrahedron is the simplest [[Platonic solid]]. A [[tetrahedron]], which can also be called a 3-[[simplex]], has four triangular faces and four vertices. It is the only self-dual [[regular polyhedron]].

[[Four-dimensional space|Four-dimensional]] space is the highest-dimensional space featuring more than three convex regular figures:
*Two-dimensional: infinitely many convex [[regular polygon]]s.
*Three-dimensional: five convex [[Regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] (the five [[Platonic solid]]s).
*Four-dimensional: six [[Convex regular 4-polytope|convex regular polychora]].
*Five-dimensional and every higher-dimensional: three regular convex [[polytope]]s ([[simplex|regular simplexes]], [[hypercube]]s, [[cross-polytope]]s).

Four-dimensional [[differential manifold]]s have some unique properties. There is only one [[differential structure]] on ℝ{{sup|''n''}} except when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, in which case there are uncountably many.

The smallest non-[[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[group (mathematics)|group]] has four elements; it is the [[Klein four-group]]. Four is also the order of the smallest non-trivial groups that are not [[simple group|simple]].

Four is the only integer ''n'' for which the (non trivial) [[alternating group]] ''A{{sub|n}}'' is not simple.

Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real [[associative algebra|associative]] [[division algebra]] (the [[quaternions]]), by a [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|theorem]] of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]].

The [[four-color theorem]] states that a [[planar graph]] (or, equivalently, a flat [[map]] of two-dimensional regions such as countries) can be colored using four colors, so that adjacent vertices (or regions) are always different colors.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Bunch, ''The Kingdom of Infinite Number''. New York: W. H. Freeman &amp; Company (2000): 48&lt;/ref&gt; Three colors are not, in general, sufficient to guarantee this. The largest planar [[complete graph]] has four vertices.

[[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four [[square number]]s. Three are not always sufficient; {{num|7}} for instance cannot be written as the sum of three squares.

Each natural number divisible by 4 is a difference of squares of two natural numbers, i.e. {{nowrap|1=4''x'' = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Four is the highest degree general [[polynomial equation]] for which there is a [[solution in radicals]].

The [[four fours]] game, there are known solutions for all integers from 0 to 880 (but not 881).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Evolution of the glyph==
[[File:Evolution4glyph.png|x50px|right]]
[[File:Vier.jpg|thumb|right|Two modern handwritten fours]]
Representing 1, 2 and 3 in as many lines as the number represented worked well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The [[Brahmin]] Indians simplified 4 by joining its four lines into a cross that looks like the modern plus sign. The [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] would add a horizontal line on top of the numeral, and the Kshatrapa and Pallava evolved the numeral to a point where the speed of writing was a secondary concern. The [[Arab]]s' 4 still had the early concept of the cross, but for the sake of efficiency, was made in one stroke by connecting the "western" end to the "northern" end; the "eastern" end was finished off with a curve. The Europeans dropped the finishing curve and gradually made the numeral less cursive, ending up with a glyph very close to the original Brahmin cross.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl. David Bellos et al. London: The Harvill Press (1998): 394, Fig. 24.64&lt;/ref&gt;

While the shape of the 4 character has an [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] in most modern [[typeface]]s, in typefaces with [[text figures]] the character usually has a [[descender]], as, for example, in [[File:TextFigs148.svg|40px]].

[[File:Seven-segment 4.svg|x50px|left]]
On the [[seven-segment display]]s of pocket calculators and digital watches, as well as certain [[optical character recognition]] fonts, 4 is seen with an open top.

[[Television station]]s that operate on [[channel 4 (disambiguation)|channel 4]] have occasionally made use of another variation of the "open 4", with the open portion being on the side, rather than the top. This version resembles the [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] letter ᔦ or the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic letter]] Ϥ. The [[magnetic ink character recognition]] "CMC-7" font also uses this variety of "4".

==In logic and philosophy==
*The symbolic meanings of the number four are linked to those of the cross and the square. "Almost from prehistoric times, the number four was employed to signify what was solid, what could be touched and felt. Its relationship to the cross (four points) made it an outstanding symbol of wholeness and universality, a symbol which drew all to itself". Where lines of latitude and longitude intersect, they divide the earth into four proportions. Throughout the world kings and chieftains have been called "lord of the four suns" or "lord of the four quarters of the earth",&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrant, Alain (1994), ''The Dictionary of Symbols''. The quote beginning "Almost from prehistoric times..." is on p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; which is understood to refer to the extent of their powers both territorially and in terms of total control of their subjects' doings.
*The [[Square of Opposition]], in both its Aristotelian version and its [[Square of Opposition#Modern squares of opposition|Boolean version]], consists of four forms: A ("All ''S'' is ''R''"), I ("Some ''S'' is ''R''"), E ("No ''S'' is ''R''"), and O ("Some ''S'' is not ''R''").
*In regard to whether two given propositions can have the same [[truth value]], there are four separate logical possibilities: the propositions are ''subalterns'' (possibly both are true, and possibly both are false); ''subcontraries'' (it is possible that both are true, but not that both are false); ''contraries'' (it is possible that both are false, but not that both are true); or ''contradictories'' (it is not possible that both are true, and it is not possible that both are false).
*[[Aristotle]] held that there are basically [[Aristotle#Causality, the four causes|four causes]] in nature: the [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]], the [[Four causes#Material cause|matter]], the [[Four causes#Final cause|end]], and the [[Four causes#Formal cause|form]].
*The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] held with four basic [[categories (Stoic)|categories]], all viewed as bodies (substantial and insubstantial): (1) ''substance'' in the sense of substrate, primary formless matter; (2) ''quality'', matter's organization to differentiate and individualize something, and coming down to a physical ingredient such as ''pneuma'', breath; (3) ''somehow holding'' (or ''disposed''), as in a posture, state, shape, size, action, and (4) ''somehow holding'' (or ''disposed'') ''toward something,'' as in relative location, familial relation, and so forth.

[[File:Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica, 1508 (1230x1615).png|right|thumb|250px|Calculating-Table by Gregor Reisch: Margarita Philosophica, 1508]]
'''Algorism''' is the technique of performing basic [[arithmetic]] by writing numbers in [[place value]] form and applying a set of memorized rules and [[mathematical table|facts]] to the digits. One who practices algorism is known as an '''algorist'''. This [[positional notation]] system largely superseded earlier calculation systems that used a different set of symbols for each numerical [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], such as [[Roman numerals]], and in some cases required a device such as an [[abacus]].

==Etymology==
The word ''algorism'' comes from the name [[Al-Khwārizmī]] (c. 780–850), a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[geographer]] and [[scholar]] in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means "the native of [[Khwarezm]]", a city that was part of the [[Greater Iran]] during his era and now is in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref name="toomer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogendijk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaks"/&gt; He wrote a treatise in Arabic language in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, which was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Sfrxde0CXIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor of Algebra], by Corona Brezina (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through his other book, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system" that is still the meaning of modern English algorism. During the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, the French form for the word –but not its meaning– was changed to ''[[algorithm]]'', following the model of the word ''[[logarithm]]'', this form alluding to the ancient Greek {{nowrap|''arithmos'' {{=}} number}}. English adopted the French very soon afterwards, but it wasn't until the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of algorithm at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/algorithm Dictionary.Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In English, it was first used about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (first quote ''c'' 1230 CE, Chaucer ''c'' 1391, and later quotes showing continuing usage since then)&lt;/ref&gt; Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:
{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|This present art, in which we use those twice five Indian figures, is called algorismus.}}

The word ''[[algorithm]]'' also derives from ''algorism'', a generalization of the meaning to any set of rules specifying a computational procedure. Occasionally ''algorism'' is also used in this generalized meaning, especially in older texts.

==History==
Starting with the integer arithmetic developed in India using [[base 10]] notation, [[Al-Khwārizmī]] along with other [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematicians in medieval Islam]], both [[Iran]]ian and [[Arabic]], documented new arithmetic methods and made many other contributions to decimal arithmetic (see the articles linked below). These included the concept of the decimal fractions as an extension of the notation, which in turn led to the notion of the [[decimal point]].  This system was popularized in Europe by Leonardo of Pisa, now known as [[Fibonacci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-Pisano|title=Leonardo Pisano {{!}} Italian mathematician|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cauchy's theorem''' is a theorem in the mathematics of [[group theory]], named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. It states that if ''G'' is a [[finite group]] and ''p'' is a [[prime number]] dividing the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' (the number of elements in ''G''), then ''G'' contains an element of order ''p''. That is, there is ''x'' in ''G'' so that ''p'' is the lowest non-zero number with ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', where ''e'' is the [[identity element]].

The theorem is related to [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], which states that the order of any [[subgroup]] of a finite group ''G'' divides the order of ''G''. Cauchy's theorem implies that for any prime divisor ''p'' of the order of ''G'', there is a subgroup of ''G'' whose order is ''p''—the [[cyclic group]] generated by the element in Cauchy's theorem.

Cauchy's theorem is generalised by [[Sylow theorems|Sylow's first theorem]], which implies that if ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the maximal power of ''p'' dividing the order of ''G'', then ''G'' has a subgroup of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (and using the fact that a ''p''-group is [[Solvable group|solvable]], one can show that ''G'' has subgroups of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; for any ''r'' less than or equal to ''n'').

==Statement and proof==
Many texts appear to prove the theorem with the use of [[strong induction]] and the [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy class equation|class equation]], though considerably less machinery is required to prove the theorem in the [[abelian group|abelian]] case. One can also invoke [[group action]]s for the proof.

'''Theorem:''' Let ''G'' be a [[finite group]] and ''p'' be a [[prime number|prime]]. If ''p'' divides the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'', then ''G'' has an element of order ''p''.

===Proof 1===

We first prove the special case that where ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]], and then the general case; both proofs are by induction on ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''G''|, and have as starting case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'' which is trivial because any non-identity element now has order ''p''. Suppose first that ''G'' is abelian. Take any non-identity element ''a'', and let ''H'' be the [[cyclic group]] it generates. If ''p'' divides |''H''|, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;|''H''|/''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is an element of order ''p''. If ''p'' does not divide |''H''|, then it divides the order [''G'':''H''] of the [[quotient group]] ''G''/''H'', which therefore contains an element of order ''p'' by the inductive hypothesis. That element is a class ''xH'' for some ''x'' in ''G'', and if ''m'' is the order of ''x'' in ''G'', then ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'' in ''G'' gives (''xH'')&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''eH'' in ''G''/''H'', so ''p'' divides ''m''; as before ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''/''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is now an element of order ''p'' in ''G'', completing the proof for the abelian case.

In the general case, let ''Z'' be the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G'', which is an abelian subgroup. If ''p'' divides |''Z''|, then ''Z'' contains an element of order ''p'' by the case of abelian groups, and this element works for ''G'' as well. So we may assume that ''p'' does not divide the order of ''Z''; since it does divide |''G''|, the [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy class equation|class equation]] shows that there is at least one conjugacy class of a non-central element ''a'' whose size is not divisible by ''p''. But that size is [''G'' : ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'')], so ''p'' divides the order of the [[centralizer]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') of ''a'' in ''G'', which is a proper subgroup because ''a'' is not central. This subgroup contains an element of order ''p'' by the inductive hypothesis, and we are done.

===Proof 2===

This proof uses the fact that for any [[group action|action]] of a (cyclic) group of prime order ''p'', the only possible orbit sizes are 1 and ''p'', which is immediate from the [[orbit stabilizer theorem]].

The set that our cyclic group shall act on is the set &lt;math&gt; X = \{\,(x_1,\ldots,x_p) \in G^p : x_1x_2\cdots x_p = e\, \} &lt;/math&gt; of ''p''-tuples of elements of ''G'' whose product (in order) gives the identity. Such a ''p''-tuple is uniquely determined by all its components except the last one, as the last element must be the inverse of the product of those preceding elements. One also sees that those {{nobreak|''p'' − 1}} elements can be chosen freely, so ''X'' has |''G''|&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt; elements, which is divisible by ''p''.

Now from the fact that in a group if ''ab'' = ''e'' then also ''ba'' = ''e'', it follows that any cyclic permutation of the components of an element of ''X'' again gives an element of ''X''. Therefore one can define an action of the cyclic group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' &lt;/sub&gt; of order ''p'' on ''X'' by cyclic permutations of components, in other words in which a chosen generator of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; sends &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p)\mapsto(x_2,\ldots,x_p,x_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

As remarked, orbits in ''X'' under this action either have size 1 or size ''p''. The former happens precisely for those tuples (''x'',''x'',...,''x'') for which ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''. Counting the elements of ''X'' by orbits, and reducing modulo ''p'', one sees that the number of elements satisfying ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'' is divisible by ''p''. But ''x'' = ''e'' is one such element, so there must be at least {{nobreak|''p'' − 1}} other solutions for ''x'', and these solutions are elements of order ''p''. This completes the proof.

==Uses==
A practically immediate consequence of Cauchy's Theorem is a useful characterization of finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]], where ''p'' is a prime. In particular, a finite group ''G'' is a ''p''-group (i.e. all of its elements have order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for some [[natural number]] ''k'') if and only if ''G'' has order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some natural number ''n''.  One may use the abelian case of Cauchy's Theorem in an inductive proof&lt;ref&gt;N. Jacobson, Basic Algebra I, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; of the first of Sylow's Theorems, similar to the first proof above, although there also exist proofs that avoid doing this special case separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6544">{{For|the result about curves |Clifford's theorem on special divisors}}
In mathematics, '''Clifford theory''', introduced by {{harvtxt|Alfred H. Clifford|1937}}, describes the relation between representations of a group and those of a normal subgroup.

==Alfred H. Clifford==

[[Alfred H. Clifford]] proved the following result on the restriction of finite-dimensional irreducible representations from a group ''G'' to a [[normal subgroup]] ''N'' of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]]:

===Clifford's theorem===

'''Theorem'''. Let π: ''G'' → GL(''n'',''K'') be an irreducible representation with ''K'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then the restriction of π to ''N'' breaks up into a direct sum of irreducible representations of ''N'' of equal dimensions. These irreducible representations of ''N'' lie in one orbit for the action of ''G'' by conjugation on the equivalence classes of irreducible representations of ''N''. In particular the number of pairwise nonisomorphic summands is no greater than the index of ''N'' in ''G''.

Clifford's theorem yields information about the restriction of a complex irreducible character of a finite group ''G'' to a normal subgroup ''N.'' If μ is a complex character of ''N'', then for a fixed element ''g'' of ''G'', another character, μ&lt;sup&gt;(g)&lt;/sup&gt;, of ''N'' may be constructed by setting

:&lt;math&gt;\mu^{(g)}(n) = \mu(gng^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''n'' in ''N''. The character μ&lt;sup&gt;(g)&lt;/sup&gt; is irreducible if and only if μ is. Clifford's theorem states that if χ is a complex irreducible character of ''G,'' and μ is an irreducible character of ''N'' with

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \chi_N,\mu \rangle \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_N = e\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t} \mu^{(g_i)}\right), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' and ''t'' are positive integers, and each ''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an element of ''G.'' The integers ''e'' and ''t'' both divide the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] [''G'':''N'']. The integer ''t'' is the index of a subgroup of ''G'', containing ''N'', known as the '''inertial subgroup''' of μ. This is

:&lt;math&gt; \{ g \in G: \mu^{(g)} = \mu \}&lt;/math&gt;

and is often denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;I_G(\mu).&lt;/math&gt;

The elements ''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be taken to be representatives of all the right cosets of the subgroup ''I&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(μ) in ''G''.

In fact, the integer ''e'' divides the index

:&lt;math&gt;[I_G(\mu):N],&lt;/math&gt;

though the proof of this fact requires some use of [[Issai Schur|Schur's]] theory of [[projective representation]]s.

==Proof of Clifford's theorem==

The proof of Clifford's theorem is best explained in terms of modules (and the module-theoretic version works for irreducible [[Modular representation theory|modular representations]]). Let ''F'' be a field, ''V'' be an irreducible ''F''[''G'']-module, ''V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' be its restriction to ''N'' and ''U'' be an irreducible ''F''[N]-submodule of ''V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''. For each ''g'' in ''G'', ''U''.''g'' is an irreducible ''F''[''N'']-submodule of ''V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'', and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{g \in G} U.g &lt;/math&gt;  is an ''F''[''G'']-submodule of ''V'', so must be all of ''V'' by irreducibility. Now ''V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' is expressed as a sum of irreducible submodules, and this expression may be refined to a direct sum. The proof of the character-theoretic statement of the theorem may now be completed in the case ''F'' = '''C'''. Let χ be the character of ''G''  afforded by ''V'' and μ be the character of ''N'' afforded by ''U''. For each ''g'' in ''G'', the '''C'''[''N'']-submodule ''U''.''g'' affords the character μ&lt;sup&gt;(g)&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle \chi_N,\mu^{(g)}\rangle = \langle \chi_N^{(g)},\mu^{(g)}\rangle  = \langle \chi_N,\mu \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The respective equalities follow because χ is a class-function of ''G'' and ''N''  is a normal subgroup. The integer ''e'' appearing in the statement of the theorem is this common multiplicity.

==Corollary of Clifford's theorem==

A corollary of Clifford's theorem, which is often exploited, is that the irreducible character χ appearing in the theorem is induced from an irreducible character of the inertial subgroup ''I&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(μ). If, for example, the irreducible character χ is '''primitive''' (that is, χ is not induced from any proper subgroup of ''G''), then ''G'' = ''I&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(μ) and χ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e''μ. A case where this property of primitive characters is used particularly frequently is when ''N'' is Abelian and χ is '''faithful''' (that is, its kernel contains just the identity element). In that case, μ is linear, ''N'' is represented by scalar matrices in any representation affording character χ and ''N'' is thus contained in the '''center''' of ''G'' (that is, the subgroup of ''G'' consisting of those elements which themselves commute with every element of ''G''). For example, if ''G'' is the symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''G'' has a faithful complex irreducible character χ of degree ''3.'' There is an Abelian normal subgroup ''N'' of order ''4'' (a Klein ''4''-subgroup) which is not contained  in the center of ''G''. Hence χ is induced from a character of a proper subgroup of ''G'' containing ''N.'' The only possibility is that χ is induced from a linear character of a Sylow ''2''-subgroup of ''G''.

==Further developments==
Clifford's theorem has led to a branch of representation theory in its own right, now known as '''Clifford theory'''. This is particularly relevant to the representation theory of finite solvable groups, where normal subgroups usually abound. For more general finite groups, Clifford theory often allows representation-theoretic questions to be reduced to questions about groups that are close (in a sense which can be made precise) to being simple.

{{harvtxt|George Mackey|1976}} found a more precise version of this result for the restriction of irreducible [[unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s to closed normal subgroups in what has become known as the "Mackey machine" or "Mackey normal subgroup analysis".

Ltd. | year=1936 | oclc=152432557}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arithmetick'' along with companion volume, ''[[Decimal Arithmetick]]'' published in 1684, were used to teach mathematics in schools in the United Kingdom for more than 150 years.

Some controversy exists over the authorship of the book.  [[Augustus De Morgan]] claimed the work was written by Hawkins, who merely used Cocker's name to lend the authority of his reputation to the book.&lt;ref name=yeldham/&gt;  Ruth Wallis, in 1997, wrote an article in ''[[Annals of Science]]'', claiming De Morgan's analysis was flawed and Cocker was the real author.&lt;ref&gt;R Wallis, Edward Cocker (1632?-1676) and his arithmetick: De Morgan demolished, Ann. of Sci. 54 (1997), 507-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of ''Arithmetick'' is unquestioned by its more than 130 editions, and that its place was woven in the fabric of the popular culture of the time is evidenced by its references in the phrase, "according to Cocker", meaning "absolutely correct" or "according to the rules".&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Cocker|title=Edward Cocker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such noted figures of history as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Simpson]] are documented as having used the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Franklin  | first=Benjamin  | chapter=Chapter One | title=The Private Life of the Late Benjamin Franklin, LL.D.

:''In the afternoon tea was made by a very decent girl in a printed linen ; she engaged me so much, that I made her a present of Cocker's Arithmetick.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=Samuel | coauthors= | title=Letters of Samuel Johnson | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1892 | oclc=61918137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though popular, like most texts of its time, ''Arithmetick'' style is formal, stiff and difficult to follow as illustrated in its explanation of the "[[Rule of three (mathematics)|rule of three]]".
{{quote|Again, observe, that of the three given numbers, those two that are of the same kind, one of them must be the first, and the other the third, and that which is of the same kind with the number sought, must be the second number in the rule of three; and that you may know which of the said numbers to make your first, and which your third, know this, that to one of those two numbers there is always affixed a demand, and that number upon which the demand lieth must always be reckoned the third number}}

As well as the rule of three, ''Arithmetick'' contains instructions on [[alligation]] and the [[rule of false position]]. Following the common practice of textbooks at the time, each rule is illustrated with numerous examples of commercial transactions involving the exchange of wheat, rye and other seeds; calculation of costs for the erection of houses and other structures; and the rotation of gears on a shaft.&lt;ref name=yeldham/&gt; The text contains the earliest known use of the term ''[[lowest terms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jeff Miller | title=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics: 'Lowest Terms' | url=http://members.aol.com/jeff570/l.htm | work=Jeff Miller's Mathword | date=28 April 2008 | accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

==''Decimal Arithmetick''==
''Decimal Arithmetick'' was published in 1685 as a companion to ''Arithmetick''. The concept of decimal fractions and the advantages of using them in calculations were well known, but a wide variety of different notations were in use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/jeff570/fractions.html ''Earliest Uses of Symbols for Fractions''] by Jeff Miller&lt;/ref&gt; After surveying various notations, ''Decimal Arithmetick'' recommends the [[decimal point]] notation introduced by [[John Napier]]:

:''A decimal fraction being written ... by having a point or prick prefixed before it ... being written according to the first direction, I conceive they may be most fit for calculation.''&lt;ref name=yeldham/&gt;

''Decimal Arithmetick'' gives instructions for calculations involving decimals, methods of extracting roots, and an overview of the concept of logarithms. There are many worked examples, some of which involve solid geometry or the calculation of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24508">In [[mathematics]], there are several ways of defining the [[real number]] system as an [[ordered field]]. The ''synthetic'' approach gives a list of [[axiom]]s for the real numbers as a ''complete ordered [[field (mathematics)|field]]''. Under the usual axioms of [[axiomatic set theory|set theory]], one can show that these axioms are categorical, in the sense that there is a [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]] for the axioms, and any two such models are [[isomorphic]]. Any one of these models must be explicitly constructed, and most of these models are built using the basic properties of the [[rational number]] system as an ordered field.

==Synthetic approach==
The synthetic approach axiomatically defines the real number system as a complete ordered field. Precisely, this means the following. A ''model for the real number system'' consists of a set '''R''', two distinct elements 0 and 1 of '''R''', two [[binary operation]]s + and × on '''R''' (called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'', respectively), and a [[binary relation]] ≤ on '''R''', satisfying the following properties.

# ('''R''', +, ×) forms a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In other words,
#* For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in '''R''', ''x'' + (''y'' + ''z'') = (''x'' + ''y'') + ''z'' and ''x'' × (''y'' × ''z'') = (''x'' × ''y'') × ''z''. ([[associativity]] of addition and multiplication)
#* For all ''x'' and ''y'' in '''R''', ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x'' and ''x'' × ''y'' = ''y'' × ''x''. ([[commutative operation|commutativity]] of addition and multiplication)
#* For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in '''R''', ''x'' × (''y'' + ''z'') = (''x'' × ''y'') + (''x'' × ''z''). ([[distributivity]] of multiplication over addition)
#* For all ''x'' in '''R''', ''x'' + 0 = ''x''. (existence of additive [[identity element|identity]])
#* 0 is not equal to 1, and for all ''x'' in '''R''', ''x'' × 1 = ''x''. (existence of multiplicative identity)
#* For every ''x'' in '''R''', there exists an element &amp;minus;''x'' in '''R''', such that ''x'' + (&amp;minus;''x'') = 0. (existence of additive [[inverse element|inverses]])
#* For every ''x'' ≠ 0 in '''R''', there exists an element ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in '''R''', such that ''x'' × ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. (existence of multiplicative inverses)
# ('''R''', ≤) forms a [[totally ordered set]]. In other words,
#* For all ''x'' in '''R''', ''x'' ≤ ''x''. ([[reflexive relation|reflexivity]])
#* For all ''x'' and ''y'' in '''R''', if ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x'', then ''x'' = ''y''. ([[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]])
#* For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in '''R''', if ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''z'', then ''x'' ≤ ''z''. ([[transitive relation|transitivity]])
#* For all ''x'' and ''y'' in '''R''', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' or ''y'' ≤ ''x''. ([[total order|totality]])
# The field operations + and × on '''R''' are compatible with the order ≤. In other words,
#* For all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in '''R''', if ''x'' ≤ ''y'', then ''x'' + ''z'' ≤ ''y'' + ''z''. (preservation of order under addition)
#* For all ''x'' and ''y'' in '''R''', if 0 ≤ ''x'' and 0 ≤ ''y'', then 0 ≤ ''x'' × ''y'' (preservation of order under multiplication)
# The order ≤ is ''complete'' in the following sense: every non-empty subset of '''R''' [[upper bound|bounded above]] has a [[least upper bound]]. In other words,
#* If ''A'' is a non-empty subset of '''R''', and if ''A'' has an [[upper bound]], then ''A'' has a least upper bound ''u'', such that for every upper bound ''v'' of ''A'', ''u'' ≤ ''v''.

The rational numbers '''Q''' satisfy the first three axioms (i.e. '''Q''' is totally [[ordered field]]) but '''Q''' does not satisfy axiom 4. So axiom 4, which requires the order to be [[Dedekind-complete]], is crucial. Axiom 4 implies the [[Archimedean property]]. Several models for axioms 1-4 are given [[#Explicit constructions of models|below]]. Any two models for axioms 1-4 are isomorphic, and so up to isomorphism, there is only one complete ordered Archimedean field.

When we say that any two models of the above axioms are isomorphic, we mean that for any two models (''R'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, ×&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, ≤&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''S'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, +&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ×&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ≤&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;), there is a [[bijection]] ''f'' : ''R'' → ''S'' preserving both the field operations and the order. Explicitly,
*''f'' is both [[injective]] and [[surjective]].
*''f''(0&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*For all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'', ''f''(''x'' +&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') +&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''y'') and ''f''(''x'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') ×&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''y'').
*For all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'', ''x'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x'') ≤&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''y'').

===Tarski's axiomatization of the reals===
{{Main|Tarski's axiomatization of the reals}}
An alternative synthetic [[axiomatization]] of the real numbers and their arithmetic was given by [[Alfred Tarski]], consisting of only the 8 [[axiom]]s shown below and a mere four [[primitive notion]]s: a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] called ''the real numbers'', denoted '''R''', a [[binary relation]] over '''R''' called ''order'', denoted by [[infix]] &lt;, a [[binary operation]] over '''R''' called ''addition'', denoted by infix +, and the constant 1.

''Axioms of order'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;):

'''Axiom 1'''. If ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then not ''y'' &lt; ''x''. That is, "&lt;" is an [[asymmetric relation]].

'''Axiom 2'''. If ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''. In other words, "&lt;" is [[dense order|dense]] in '''R'''.

'''Axiom 3'''. "&lt;" is [[Dedekind-complete]]. More formally, for all ''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''', if for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'', then there exists a ''z'' such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', if ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''y'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

To clarify the above statement somewhat, let ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose:

:''X precedes Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

:The real number ''z separates'' ''X'' and ''Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' with ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' with ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

Axiom 3 can then be stated as:

:"If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets."

''Axioms of addition'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +):

'''Axiom 4'''. ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''.

'''Axiom 5'''. For all ''x'', ''y'', there exists a ''z'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''.

'''Axiom 6'''. If ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' or ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''.

''Axioms for one'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +, 1):

'''Axiom 7'''. 1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

'''Axiom 8'''. 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

These axioms imply that '''R''' is a [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered]] [[abelian group]] under addition with distinguished element 1. '''R''' is also [[Dedekind-complete]] and [[divisible group|divisible]].

==Explicit constructions of models==
We shall not prove that any models of the axioms are isomorphic. Such a proof can be found in any number of modern analysis or set theory textbooks. We will sketch the basic definitions and properties of a number of constructions, however, because each of these is important for both mathematical and historical reasons. The first three, due to [[Georg Cantor]]/[[Charles Méray]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]]/[[Otto Stolz]] all occurred within a few years of each other. Each has advantages and disadvantages. A major motivation in all three cases was the instruction of mathematics students.

===Construction from Cauchy sequences===
A standard procedure to force all [[Cauchy sequence]]s in a [[metric space]] to converge is adding new points to the metric space in a process called [[completeness (topology)|completion]].

'''R''' is defined as the completion of '''Q''' with respect to the metric |''x''-''y''|, as will be detailed below (for completions of '''Q''' with respect to other metrics, see [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic numbers]].)

Let ''R'' be the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. That is, sequences
: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;,... 
of rational numbers such that for every rational {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, there exists an integer ''N'' such that for all natural numbers {{nowrap|''m'',''n'' &gt; ''N''}}, {{nowrap| {{!}}''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}} &lt; ''ε''}}. Here the vertical bars denote the absolute value.

Cauchy sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) can be added and multiplied as follows:
: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;times; (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

Two Cauchy sequences are called ''equivalent'' if and only if the difference between them tends to zero.
This defines an [[equivalence relation]] that is compatible with the operations defined above, and the set '''R''' of all [[equivalence class]]es can be shown to satisfy [[#Synthetic approach|all axioms of the real numbers]]. We can [[Embedding|embed]] '''Q''' into '''R''' by identifying the rational number ''r'' with the equivalence class of the sequence {{nowrap| (''r'',''r'',''r'', …)}}.

Comparison between real numbers is obtained by defining the following comparison between Cauchy sequences: {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥  (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} if and only if   
''x'' is equivalent to ''y'' or there exists an integer ''N'' such that {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥  ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all    
{{nowrap|''n'' &gt; ''N''}}.

By construction, every real number ''x'' is represented by a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. This representation is far from unique; every rational sequence that converges to ''x'' is a representation of ''x''. This reflects the observation that one can often use different sequences to approximate the same real number.

The only real number axiom that does not follow easily from the definitions is the completeness of ≤, i.e. the [[least upper bound property]]. It can be proved as follows: Let ''S'' be a non-empty subset of '''R''' and ''U'' be an upper bound for ''S''. Substituting a larger value if necessary, we may assume ''U'' is rational. Since ''S'' is non-empty, we can choose a rational number ''L'' such that {{nowrap|''L'' &lt; ''s''}} for some ''s'' in ''S''. Now define sequences of rationals (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) as follows:

:Set ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U'' and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''.

For each ''n'' consider the number:

:''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2

If ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an upper bound for ''S'' set:

: ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

Otherwise set:

: ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

This defines two Cauchy sequences of rationals, and so we have real numbers {{nowrap|1= ''l'' = (''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|1= ''u'' = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. It is easy to prove, by induction on ''n'' that:

: ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an upper bound for ''S'' for all ''n''

and:

: ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is never an upper bound for ''S'' for any ''n''

Thus ''u'' is an upper bound for ''S''. To see that it is a least upper bound, notice that the limit of (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is 0, and so ''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''. Now suppose {{nowrap|1= ''b'' &lt; ''u'' = ''l''}} is a smaller upper bound for ''S''. Since (''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is monotonic increasing it is easy to see that {{nowrap| ''b'' &lt; ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for some ''n''. But ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not an upper bound for S and so neither is ''b''. Hence ''u'' is a least upper bound for ''S'' and ≤ is complete.

The usual [[decimal notation]] can be translated to Cauchy sequences in a natural way. For example, the notation π = 3.1415... means that π is the equivalence class of the Cauchy sequence (3,  3.1,  3.14,  3.141,  3.1415, ...). The equation [[0.999...]] = 1 states that the sequences (0,  0.9,  0.99,  0.999,...) and (1, 1, 1, 1,...) are equivalent, i.e., their difference converges to 0.

An advantage of constructing '''R''' as the completion of '''Q''' is that this construction is not specific to one example; it is used for other metric spaces as well.

===Construction by Dedekind cuts===
[[File:Dedekind cut- square root of two.png| thumb| right| 350px| Dedekind used his cut to construct the [[irrational number|irrational]], [[real number]]s.]]

A [[Dedekind cut]] in an ordered field is a partition of it, (''A'', ''B''), such that ''A'' is nonempty and closed downwards, ''B'' is nonempty and closed upwards, and ''A'' contains no [[greatest element]]. Real numbers can be constructed as Dedekind cuts of rational numbers.

For convenience we may take the lower set &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; as the representative of any given Dedekind cut &lt;math&gt;(A, B)\,&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; completely determines &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  By doing this we may think intuitively of a real number as being represented by the set of all smaller rational numbers.  In more detail, a real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is any subset of the set &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of rational numbers that fulfills the following conditions:&lt;ref name="pugh"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is not empty
# &lt;math&gt;r \neq \textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is closed downwards.  In other words,  for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;y \in r&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in r&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; contains no greatest element.  In other words, there is no &lt;math&gt;x \in r&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;y \in r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y \leq x&lt;/math&gt;

* We form the set &lt;math&gt; \textbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; of real numbers as the set of all Dedekind cuts &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \textbf{Q} &lt;/math&gt;, and define a [[total ordering]] on the real numbers as follows: &lt;math&gt;x \leq y\Leftrightarrow x \subseteq y&lt;/math&gt;
* We [[embedding|embed]] the rational numbers into the reals by identifying the rational number &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; with the set of all smaller rational numbers &lt;math&gt; \{ x \in \textbf{Q} : x &lt; q \} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="pugh"/&gt;  Since the rational numbers are [[dense order|dense]], such a set can have no greatest element and thus fulfills the conditions for being a real number laid out above.
* [[Addition]]. &lt;math&gt;A + B := \{a + b: a \in A \land b \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="pugh"/&gt;
* [[Subtraction]]. &lt;math&gt;A - B := \{a - b: a \in A \land b \in ( \textbf{Q} \setminus B ) \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \textbf{Q} \setminus B &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \{ x : x \in \textbf{Q} \land x \notin B \} &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Negation of a number|Negation]] is a special case of subtraction: &lt;math&gt;-B := \{a - b: a &lt; 0 \land b \in ( \textbf{Q} \setminus B ) \}&lt;/math&gt;
* Defining [[multiplication]] is less straightforward.&lt;ref name="pugh"/&gt;
** if &lt;math&gt;A, B \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; A \times B := \{ a \times b : a \geq 0 \land a \in A \land b \geq 0 \land b \in B \} \cup \{ x \in \mathrm{Q} : x &lt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
** if either &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; is negative, we use the identities &lt;math&gt; A \times B = -(A \times -B) = -(-A \times B) = (-A \times -B) \,&lt;/math&gt; to convert &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; to positive numbers and then apply the definition above.
* We define [[division (mathematics)|division]] in a similar manner:
** if &lt;math&gt; A \geq 0 \mbox{ and } B &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; A / B := \{ a / b : a \in A \land b \in ( \textbf{Q} \setminus B ) \}&lt;/math&gt;
** if either &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; is negative, we use the identities &lt;math&gt; A / B = -(A / {-B}) = -(-A / B)= -A / {-B} \, &lt;/math&gt; to convert &lt;math&gt;A\, &lt;/math&gt; to a non-negative number  and/or &lt;math&gt;B\, &lt;/math&gt; to a positive number and then apply the definition above.
* [[Supremum]].  If a nonempty set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers has any upper bound in &lt;math&gt;\textbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then it has a least upper bound in &lt;math&gt;\textbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; that is equal to &lt;math&gt;\bigcup S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="pugh"/&gt;

As an example of a Dedekind cut representing an [[irrational number]], we may take the [[Square root of 2|positive square root of 2]].  This can be defined by the set &lt;math&gt;A = \{ x \in \textbf{Q} : x &lt; 0 \lor x \times x &lt; 2 \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be seen from the definitions above that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a real number, and that &lt;math&gt;A \times A = 2\,&lt;/math&gt;. However, neither claim is immediate. Showing that &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; is real requires showing that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has no greatest element, i.e. that for any positive rational &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \times x &lt; 2\,&lt;/math&gt;, there is a rational &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \times y &lt;2\,.&lt;/math&gt; The choice &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{2x+2}{x+2}\,&lt;/math&gt; works.  Then  &lt;math&gt;A \times A \le 2&lt;/math&gt; but to show equality requires showing that if &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is any rational number less than 2, then there is positive &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;x \times x\,&lt;/math&gt;.

An advantage of this construction is that each real number corresponds to a unique cut.

===Construction using hyperreal numbers===
As in the [[hyperreal number]]s, one constructs the hyperrationals &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''Q''' from the rational numbers by means of an [[ultrafilter]].  Here a hyperrational is by definition a ratio of two [[hyperinteger]]s.  Consider the [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''B'' of all limited (i.e. finite) elements in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''Q'''.  Then ''B'' has a unique [[maximal ideal]] ''I'', the [[infinitesimal]] numbers.  The quotient ring ''B/I'' gives the [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''R''' of real numbers {{Citation needed|reason=No explanation given as to how the irrational numbers arise.|date=June 2017}}.  Note that ''B'' is not an [[internal set]] in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''Q'''.
Note that this construction uses a non-principal ultrafilter over the set of natural numbers, the existence of which is guaranteed by the [[axiom of choice]].

It turns out that the maximal ideal respects the order on &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''Q'''.  Hence the resulting field is an ordered field.  Completeness can be proved in a similar way to the construction from the Cauchy sequences.

===Construction from surreal numbers===
Every ordered field can be embedded in the [[surreal number]]s. The real numbers form a maximal subfield that is [[Archimedean group|Archimedean]] (meaning that no real number is infinitely large).  This embedding is not unique, though it can be chosen in a canonical way.

=== Construction from Z (Eudoxus reals)===&lt;!--Linked from 'Eudoxus of Cnidus'--&gt;
A relatively less known construction allows to define real numbers using only the additive group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; with different versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=math/0405454|title=The Eudoxus Real Numbers|author=R.D. Arthan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=math/0301015|author=[[Norbert A'Campo]]|title=A natural construction for the real numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/reals.pdf|title=Update on the efficient reals|author=Ross Street|date=September 2003|accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction has been [[Automated theorem proving|formally verified]] by the IsarMathLib project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nongnu.org/isarmathlib/|title=IsarMathLib}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shenitzer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shenitzer | first1 = A | year = 1987 | title = A topics course in mathematics | url = | journal = The Mathematical Intelligencer | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 44–52 | doi=10.1007/bf03023955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arthan refer to this construction as the ''[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] reals''.

Let an '''almost homomorphism''' be a map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; such that the set &lt;math&gt;\{f(n+m)-f(m)-f(n): n,m\in\mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. (Note that &lt;math&gt;f(n) = \lfloor \alpha n\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is an almost homomorphism for every &lt;math&gt; \alpha \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;.) Almost homomorphisms form an abelian group under pointwise addition. We say that two almost homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f,g&lt;/math&gt; are '''almost equal''' if the set &lt;math&gt;\{f(n)-g(n): n\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. This defines an equivalence relation on the set of almost homomorphisms. Real numbers are defined as the equivalence classes of this relation. Alternatively, the almost homomorphisms taking only finitely many values form a subgroup, and the underlying additive group of the real number is the quotient group. To add real numbers defined this way we add the almost homomorphisms that represent them. Multiplication of real numbers corresponds to functional composition of almost homomorphisms. If &lt;math&gt;[f]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the real number represented by an almost homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; we say that &lt;math&gt;0\leq [f]&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded or &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; takes an infinite number of positive values on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^+&lt;/math&gt;. This defines the [[total order|linear order]] relation on the set of real numbers constructed this way.

A '''cyclic redundancy check''' ('''CRC''') is an [[Error detection and correction|error-detecting code]] commonly used in digital [[Telecommunications network|networks]] and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.  Blocks of data entering these systems get a short ''check value'' attached, based on the remainder of a [[Polynomial long division|polynomial division]] of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for [[Error correcting code|error correction]] (see [[Mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks#Bitfilters|bitfilters]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|title=An Algorithm for Error Correcting Cyclic Redundance Checks|author=|date=|website=drdobbs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRCs are so called because the ''check'' (data verification) value is a ''redundancy'' (it expands the message without adding [[Entropy (information theory)|information]]) and the [[algorithm]] is based on [[Cyclic code|''cyclic'' codes]]. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary [[Computer hardware|hardware]], easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] in transmission channels.  Because the check value has a fixed length, the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that generates it is occasionally used as a [[hash function]].

The CRC was invented by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961; the 32-bit CRC function, used in Ethernet and many other standards, is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975.

== Introduction ==
CRCs are based on the theory of [[cyclic code|cyclic]] [[error-correcting code]]s. The use of [[systematic code|systematic]] cyclic codes, which encode messages by adding a fixed-length check value, for the purpose of error detection in communication networks, was first proposed by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="PetersonBrown1961"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cyclic codes are not only simple to implement but have the benefit of being particularly well suited for the detection of [[burst error]]s: contiguous sequences of erroneous data symbols in messages. This is important because burst errors are common transmission errors in many [[communication channel]]s, including magnetic and optical storage devices. Typically an ''n''-bit CRC applied to a data block of arbitrary length will detect any single error burst not longer than ''n'' bits and the fraction of all longer error bursts that it will detect is {{nowrap|(1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

Specification of a CRC code requires definition of a so-called [[generator polynomial]]. This polynomial becomes the [[divisor]] in a [[polynomial long division]], which takes the message as the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]] and in which the [[quotient]] is discarded and the [[remainder]] becomes the result.  The important caveat is that the polynomial [[coefficient]]s are calculated according to the arithmetic of a [[finite field]], so the addition operation can always be performed bitwise-parallel (there is no carry between digits).

In practice, all commonly used CRCs employ the [[Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)]]. The two elements are usually called 0 and 1, comfortably matching computer architecture.

A CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n'' bits long. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', which means it has {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms. In other words, the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}; its encoding requires {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} bits. Note that most polynomial specifications either drop the [[Most significant bit|MSB]] or [[Least significant bit|LSB]], since they are always 1. The CRC and associated polynomial typically have a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX as in the [[#table|table]] below.

The simplest error-detection system, the [[parity bit]], is in fact a 1-bit CRC: it uses the generator polynomial&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''x'' + 1}} (two terms), and has the name CRC-1.

== Application ==
A CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the ''check value'' or ''CRC'', for each block of data to be sent or stored and appends it to the data, forming a ''codeword''.

When a codeword is received or read, the device either compares its check value with one freshly calculated from the data block, or equivalently, performs a CRC on the whole codeword and compares the resulting check value with an expected ''residue'' constant.

If the CRC values do not match, then the block contains a data error.

The device may take corrective action, such as rereading the block or requesting that it be sent again. Otherwise, the data is assumed to be error-free (though, with some small probability, it may contain undetected errors; this is inherent in the nature of error-checking).&lt;ref name="ritter-1986"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Terry|last=Ritter|title=The Great CRC Mystery|url=http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/ARTS/CRCMYST.HTM|accessdate=21 May 2009|work=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]|date=February 1986|volume=11|issue=2|pages=26–34, 76–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data integrity ==
CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the [[data integrity|integrity]] of messages delivered. However, they are not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data.

Firstly, as there is no authentication, an attacker can edit a message and recompute the CRC without the substitution being detected. When stored alongside the data, CRCs and cryptographic hash functions by themselves do not protect against ''intentional'' modification of data. Any application that requires protection against such attacks must use cryptographic authentication mechanisms, such as [[message authentication code]]s or [[digital signatures]] (which are commonly based on [[cryptographic hash]] functions).

Secondly, unlike cryptographic hash functions, CRC is an easily reversible function, which makes it unsuitable for use in digital signatures.&lt;ref name="stigge-reversecrc"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stigge|first=Martin|last2=Plötz|first2=Henryk|last3=Müller|first3=Wolf|last4=Redlich|first4=Jens-Peter|title=Reversing CRC – Theory and Practice|date=May 2006|page=17|location=Berlin|publisher=Humboldt University Berlin|url=http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2011|quote=The presented methods offer a very easy and efficient way to modify your data so that it will compute to a CRC you want or at least know in advance.|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042902/http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, CRC is a [[linear function]] with a property that

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{crc}(x \oplus y \oplus z) = \operatorname{crc}(x) \oplus \operatorname{crc}(y) \oplus \operatorname{crc}(z);&lt;/math&gt;

as a result, even if the CRC is encrypted with a [[stream cipher]] that uses [[Exclusive or|XOR]] as its combining operation (or [[Block cipher modes of operation|mode]] of [[block cipher]] which effectively turns it into a stream cipher, such as OFB or CFB), both the message and the associated CRC can be manipulated without knowledge of the encryption key; this was one of the well-known design flaws of the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) protocol.&lt;ref name="wep"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Cam-Winget | first1=Nancy | last2=Housley | first2=Russ | last3=Wagner | first3=David | last4=Walker | first4=Jesse | title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=35–39 |date = May 2003| doi=10.1145/769800.769823 | url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{Main|Computation of cyclic redundancy checks}}

To compute an ''n''-bit binary CRC, line the bits representing the input in a row, and position the ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit pattern representing the CRC's divisor (called a "[[polynomial]]") underneath the left-hand end of the row.

In this example, we shall encode 14 bits of message with a 3-bit CRC, with a polynomial {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}. The polynomial is written in binary as the coefficients; a 3rd-order polynomial has 4 coefficients ({{nowrap|1''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 0''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1''x'' + 1}}). In this case, the coefficients are 1, 0, 1 and 1.  The result of the calculation is 3 bits long.

Start with the message to be encoded:

&lt;pre&gt;
11010011101100
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is first padded with zeros corresponding to the bit length ''n'' of the CRC. Here is the first calculation for computing a 3-bit CRC:

&lt;pre&gt;
11010011101100 000 &lt;--- input right padded by 3 bits
1011               &lt;--- divisor (4 bits) = x³ + x + 1
------------------
01100011101100 000 &lt;--- result
&lt;/pre&gt;

The algorithm acts on the bits directly above the divisor in each step.  The result for that iteration is the bitwise XOR of the polynomial divisor with the bits above it.  The bits not above the divisor are simply copied directly below for that step.  The divisor is then shifted one bit to the right, and the process is repeated until the divisor reaches the right-hand end of the input row. Here is the entire calculation:

&lt;pre&gt;
11010011101100 000 &lt;--- input right padded by 3 bits
1011               &lt;--- divisor
01100011101100 000 &lt;--- result (note the first four bits are the XOR with the divisor beneath, the rest of the bits are unchanged)
 1011              &lt;--- divisor ...
00111011101100 000
  1011
00010111101100 000
   1011
00000001101100 000 &lt;--- note that the divisor moves over to align with the next 1 in the dividend (since quotient for that step was zero)
       1011             (in other words, it doesn't necessarily move one bit per iteration)
00000000110100 000
        1011
00000000011000 000
         1011
00000000001110 000
          1011
00000000000101 000
           101 1
-----------------
00000000000000 100 &lt;--- remainder (3 bits).  Division algorithm stops here as dividend is equal to zero.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since the leftmost divisor bit zeroed every input bit it touched, when this process ends the only bits in the input row that can be nonzero are the n bits at the right-hand end of the row. These ''n'' bits are the remainder of the division step, and will also be the value of the CRC function (unless the chosen CRC specification calls for some postprocessing).

The validity of a received message can easily be verified by performing the above calculation again, this time with the check value added instead of zeroes. The remainder should equal zero if there are no detectable errors.

&lt;pre&gt;
11010011101100 100 &lt;--- input with check value
1011               &lt;--- divisor
01100011101100 100 &lt;--- result
 1011              &lt;--- divisor ...
00111011101100 100

......

00000000001110 100
          1011
00000000000101 100
           101 1
------------------
00000000000000 000 &lt;--- remainder
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code outlines a function which will return the initial CRC remainder for a chosen input and polynomial, with either 1 or 0 as the initial padding. Note that this code works with string inputs rather than raw numbers:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def crc_remainder(input_bitstring, polynomial_bitstring, initial_filler):
    '''
    Calculates the CRC remainder of a string of bits using a chosen polynomial.
    initial_filler should be '1' or '0'.
    '''
    polynomial_bitstring = polynomial_bitstring.lstrip('0')
    len_input = len(input_bitstring)
    initial_padding = initial_filler * (len(polynomial_bitstring) - 1)
    input_padded_array = list(input_bitstring + initial_padding)
    while '1' in input_padded_array[:len_input]:
        cur_shift = input_padded_array.index('1')
        for i in range(len(polynomial_bitstring)):
            if polynomial_bitstring[i] == input_padded_array[cur_shift + i]:
                input_padded_array[cur_shift + i] = '0'
            else:
                input_padded_array[cur_shift + i] = '1'
    return ''.join(input_padded_array)[len_input:]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;

def crc_check(input_bitstring, polynomial_bitstring, check_value):
    '''
    Calculates the CRC check of a string of bits using a chosen polynomial.
    '''
    polynomial_bitstring = polynomial_bitstring.lstrip('0')
    len_input = len(input_bitstring)
    initial_padding = check_value
    input_padded_array = list(input_bitstring + initial_padding)
    while '1' in input_padded_array[:len_input]:
        cur_shift = input_padded_array.index('1')
        for i in range(len(polynomial_bitstring)):
            if polynomial_bitstring[i] == input_padded_array[cur_shift + i]:
                input_padded_array[cur_shift + i] = '0'
            else:
                input_padded_array[cur_shift + i] = '1'
    if '1' not in ''.join(input_padded_array)[len_input:]:
        return True
    else:
        return False 


&gt;&gt;&gt; crc_check('11010011101100','1011','100')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; crc_remainder('11010011101100','1011','0')
'100'

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Mathematics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{Main|Mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks}}
Mathematical analysis of this division-like process reveals how to select a divisor that guarantees good error-detection properties. In this analysis, the digits of the bit strings are taken as the coefficients of a polynomial in some variable ''x''—coefficients that are elements of the finite field [[GF(2)]], instead of more familiar numbers. The set of binary polynomials is a mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].

=== Designing polynomials ===
The selection of the generator polynomial is the most important part of implementing the CRC algorithm. The polynomial must be chosen to maximize the error-detecting capabilities while minimizing overall collision probabilities.

The most important attribute of the polynomial is its length (largest degree(exponent) +1 of any one term in the polynomial), because of its direct influence on the length of the computed check value.

The most commonly used polynomial lengths are:
*9 bits (CRC-8)
*17 bits (CRC-16)
*33 bits (CRC-32)
*65 bits (CRC-64)

A CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n''-bits. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', and hence {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms (the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}). The remainder has length ''n''. The CRC has a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX.

The design of the CRC polynomial depends on the maximum total length of the block to be protected (data + CRC bits), the desired error protection features, and the type of resources for implementing the CRC, as well as the desired performance. A common misconception is that the "best" CRC polynomials are derived from either [[irreducible polynomial]]s or irreducible polynomials times the factor&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|1 + ''x''}}, which adds to the code the ability to detect all errors affecting an odd number of bits.&lt;ref name="williams93" /&gt; In reality, all the factors described above should enter into the selection of the polynomial and may lead to a reducible polynomial. However, choosing a reducible polynomial will result in a certain proportion of missed errors, due to the quotient ring having [[zero divisor]]s.

The advantage of choosing a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] as the generator for a CRC code is that the resulting code has maximal total block length in the sense that all 1-bit errors within that block length have different remainders (also called [[Syndrome decoding|syndromes]]) and therefore, since the remainder is a linear function of the block, the code can detect all 2-bit errors within that block length. If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the primitive generator polynomial, then the maximal total block length is &lt;math&gt;2 ^ {r} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;, and the associated code is able to detect any single-bit or double-bit errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  publication-place=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 22.4 Cyclic Redundancy and Other Checksums | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=1168}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can improve this situation. If we use the generator polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x) = p(x)(1 + x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a primitive polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;r - 1&lt;/math&gt;, then the maximal total block length is &lt;math&gt;2^{r - 1} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, and the code is able to detect single, double, triple and any odd number of errors.

A polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; that admits other factorizations may be chosen then so as to balance the maximal total blocklength with a desired error detection power. The [[BCH code]]s are a powerful class of such polynomials. They subsume the two examples above. Regardless of the reducibility properties of a generator polynomial of degree&amp;nbsp;''r'', if it includes the "+1" term, the code will be able to detect error patterns that are confined to a window of ''r'' contiguous bits. These patterns are called "error bursts".

== Specification ==
The concept of the CRC as an error-detecting code gets complicated when an implementer or standards committee uses it to design a practical system. Here are some of the complications:
*Sometimes an implementation '''prefixes a fixed bit pattern''' to the bitstream to be checked. This is useful when clocking errors might insert 0-bits in front of a message, an alteration that would otherwise leave the check value unchanged.
*Usually, but not always, an implementation '''appends ''n'' 0-bits''' (''n'' being the size of the CRC) to the bitstream to be checked before the polynomial division occurs. Such appending is explicitly demonstrated in the [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|Computation of CRC]] article. This has the convenience that the remainder of the original bitstream with the check value appended is exactly zero, so the CRC can be checked simply by performing the polynomial division on the received bitstream and comparing the remainder with zero. Due to the associative and commutative properties of the exclusive-or operation, practical table driven implementations can obtain a result numerically equivalent to zero-appending without explicitly appending any zeroes, by using an equivalent,&lt;ref name="williams93" /&gt; faster algorithm that combines the message bitstream with the stream being shifted out of the CRC register.
*Sometimes an implementation '''exclusive-ORs a fixed bit pattern''' into the remainder of the polynomial division.
*'''Bit order:''' Some schemes view the low-order bit of each byte as "first", which then during polynomial division means "leftmost", which is contrary to our customary understanding of "low-order". This convention makes sense when [[serial port|serial-port]] transmissions are CRC-checked in hardware, because some widespread serial-port transmission conventions transmit bytes least-significant bit first.
*'''[[Byte order]]''': With multi-byte CRCs, there can be confusion over whether the byte transmitted first (or stored in the lowest-addressed byte of memory) is the least-significant byte (LSB) or the most-significant byte (MSB). For example, some 16-bit CRC schemes swap the bytes of the check value.
*'''Omission of the high-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the high-order bit is always 1, and since an ''n''-bit CRC must be defined by an ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit divisor which [[Arithmetic overflow|overflows]] an ''n''-bit [[processor register|register]], some writers assume that it is unnecessary to mention the divisor's high-order bit.
*'''Omission of the low-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the low-order bit is always 1, authors such as Philip Koopman represent polynomials with their high-order bit intact, but without the low-order bit (the &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; or 1 term).  This convention encodes the polynomial complete with its degree in one integer.

These complications mean that there are three common ways to express a polynomial as an integer: the first two, which are mirror images in binary, are the constants found in code; the third is the number found in Koopman's papers.  ''In each case, one term is omitted.'' So the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^4 + x + 1&lt;/math&gt; may be transcribed as:
*0x3 = 0b0011, representing &lt;math&gt;x^4 + (0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1 + 1x^0)&lt;/math&gt; (MSB-first code)
*0xC = 0b1100, representing &lt;math&gt;(1x^0 + 1x^1 + 0x^2 + 0x^3) + x^4&lt;/math&gt; (LSB-first code)
*0x9 = 0b1001, representing &lt;math&gt;(1x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1) + x^0&lt;/math&gt; (Koopman notation)

CRCs in proprietary protocols might be [[Obfuscation|obfuscated]] by using a non-trivial initial value and a final XOR, but these techniques do not add cryptographic strength to the algorithm and can be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] using straightforward methods.&lt;ref name="ewing-rev-eng"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ewing|first=Gregory C.|date=March 2010|title=Reverse-Engineering a CRC Algorithm|location=Christchurch|publisher=University of Canterbury|url=http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/essays/CRC-Reverse-Engineering.html|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards and common use ==
Numerous varieties of cyclic redundancy checks have been incorporated into [[technical standard]]s.  By no means does one algorithm, or one of each degree, suit every purpose; Koopman and Chakravarty recommend selecting a polynomial according to the application requirements and the expected distribution of message lengths.&lt;ref name=koop04 /&gt;  The number of distinct CRCs in use has confused developers, a situation which authors have sought to address.&lt;ref name="williams93"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.repairfaq.org/filipg/LINK/F_crc_v3.html | title= A Painless Guide to CRC Error Detection Algorithms V3.0 | accessdate= 5 June 2010 | last= Williams | first= Ross N. | date= 24 September 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three polynomials reported for CRC-12,&lt;ref name=koop04 /&gt; nineteen conflicting definitions of CRC-16, and seven of CRC-32.&lt;ref name="cook-catalogue"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Cook | first = Greg | url = http://reveng.sourceforge.net/crc-catalogue/all.htm | title = Catalogue of parametrised CRC algorithms | accessdate = 1 August 2016 | date = 27 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The polynomials commonly applied are not the most efficient ones possible.

The design of the 32-bit polynomial most commonly used by standards bodies, CRC-32-IEEE, was the result of a joint effort for the [[Rome Laboratory]] and the Air Force Electronic Systems Division by Joseph Hammond, James Brown and Shyan-Shiang Liu of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and Kenneth Brayer of the [[Mitre Corporation]]. The earliest known appearances of the 32-bit polynomial were in their 1975 publications: Technical Report 2956 by Brayer for Mitre, published in January and released for public dissemination through [[DTIC]] in August,&lt;ref name="Brayer1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brayer | first = Kenneth | publication-date = August 1975 | title = Evaluation of 32 Degree Polynomials in Error Detection on the SATIN IV Autovon Error Patterns | publisher = [[National Technical Information Service]] | page = 74 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/srch/doc?collection=t3&amp;id=ADA014825 &lt;!-- http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA014825 --&gt; | accessdate = 3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hammond, Brown and Liu's report for the Rome Laboratory, published in May.&lt;ref name="Hammond1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammond | first = Joseph L., Jr. | last2 = Brown | first2 = James E. | last3 = Liu | first3 = Shyan-Shiang | publication-date = May 1975 | title = Development of a Transmission Error Model and an Error Control Model | publisher = [[National Technical Information Service]] | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA013939&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | accessdate = 7 July 2012 | page = 74 | doi =  | bibcode = 1975STIN...7615344H | volume = 76 | year = 1975 | journal = Unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both reports contained contributions from the other team. During December 1975, Brayer and Hammond presented their work in a paper at the IEEE National Telecommunications Conference: the IEEE CRC-32 polynomial is the generating polynomial of a [[Hamming code]] and was selected for its error detection performance.&lt;ref name="BrayerHammond1975"&gt;{{cite conference | last = Brayer | first = Kenneth | last2 = Hammond | first2 = Joseph L., Jr. |date=December 1975 | title = Evaluation of error detection polynomial performance on the AUTOVON channel | conference = IEEE National Telecommunications Conference, New Orleans, La | booktitle = Conference Record | volume = 1 | publisher = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers | location = New York | pages = 8–21 to 8–25 | bibcode = 1975ntc.....1....8B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, the Castagnoli CRC-32C polynomial used in iSCSI or SCTP matches its performance on messages from 58 bits to 131 kbits, and outperforms it in several size ranges including the two most common sizes of Internet packet.&lt;ref name="koop02" /&gt; The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard also uses CRC-32C to detect errors in the payload (although it uses CRC-16-CCITT for [[Physical layer|PHY headers]]).

CRC32 computation is implemented in hardware as an operation of [[SSE4#SSE4.2|SSE4.2]] instruction set, first introduced in [[Intel]] processors' [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] microarchitecture.

== Polynomial representations of cyclic redundancy checks ==
The table below lists only the polynomials of the various algorithms in use. Variations of a particular protocol can impose pre-inversion, post-inversion and reversed bit ordering as described above. For example, the CRC32 used in Gzip and Bzip2 use the same polynomial, but Gzip employs reversed bit ordering, while Bzip2 does not.&lt;ref name="cook-catalogue" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5948">In [[mathematics]], a [[metric space]] {{Mvar|X}} with metric {{Mvar|d}} is said to be '''doubling''' if there is some doubling constant {{Math|''M'' &gt; 0}} such that for any {{Math|''x'' &amp;isin; ''X''}} and {{Math|''r'' &gt; 0}}, it is possible to cover the ball {{Math|1=''B''(''x'', ''r'') = {''y'' {{!}} ''d''(''x'', ''y'') &lt; ''r''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} with the union of at most {{Mvar|M}} balls of radius {{Math|{{sfrac|''r''|2}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Heinonen| first = Juha | title = Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces | series = Universitext | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 2001 | pages = x+140 | ISBN = 0-387-95104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base-2 logarithm of {{Mvar|M}} is often referred to as the '''doubling dimension''' of {{Mvar|X}}. [[Euclidean space]]s {{Math|&amp;#8477;{{sup|''d''}}}} equipped with the usual Euclidean metric are examples of doubling spaces where the doubling constant {{Mvar|M}} depends on the dimension&amp;nbsp;{{Mvar|d}}. For example, in one dimension, {{Math|1=''M'' = 2}}; and in two dimensions, {{Math|1=M = 7}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiskCoveringProblem.html|title=Disk Covering Problem|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assouad's embedding theorem==

An important question in metric space geometry is to characterize those metric spaces that can be embedded in some Euclidean space by a [[Lipschitz continuity|bi-Lipschitz]] function. This means that one can essentially think of the metric space as a subset of Euclidean space. Not all metric spaces may be embedded in Euclidean space. Doubling metric spaces, on the other hand, would seem like they have more of a chance, since the doubling condition says, in a way, that the metric space is not infinite dimensional. However, this is still not the case in general. The [[Heisenberg group]] with its [[Carnot metric]] is an example of a doubling metric space which cannot be embedded in any Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Pansu| first= Pierre | title = Métriques de Carnot-Carathéodory et quasiisométries des espaces symétriques de rang un| journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2| volume = 129 | year = 1989 | number = 1 | pages = 1–60 | doi=10.2307/1971484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assouad's Theorem''' states that, for a ''M''-doubling metric space ''X'', if we give it the metric ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''ε''&lt;/sup&gt; for some 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ε''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, then there is a ''L''-bi-Lipschitz map ''f'':''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''d'' and ''L'' depend on ''M'' and&amp;nbsp;''ε''.

==Doubling Measures==

===Definition===
A nontrivial [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] on a metric space ''X'' is said to be '''doubling''' if the measure of any ball is finite and approximately the measure of its double, or more precisely, if there is a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt; 0&lt;\mu(B(x,2r))\leq C\mu(B(x,r))&lt;\infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in ''X'' and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. In this case, we say ''μ'' is '''C-doubling'''.

A metric measure space that supports a doubling measure is necessarily a doubling metric space, where the doubling constant depends on the constant&amp;nbsp;''C''.  Conversely, any [[complete metric space|complete]] doubling metric space supports a doubling measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Luukainen | last2 = Saksman | first1 = Jouni | first2 = Eero | title = Every complete doubling metric space carries a doubling measure | journal = Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume = 126 | year = 1998 | number = 2 | pages = 531–534 | doi = 10.1090/s0002-9939-98-04201-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouni|first=Luukkainen,|date=1998|title=ASSOUAD DIMENSION: ANTIFRACTAL METRIZATION, POROUS SETS, AND HOMOGENEOUS MEASURES|url=http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=DBSHBB_1998_v35n1_23|journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|issn=0304-9914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

A simple example of a doubling measure is [[Lebesgue measure]] on a Euclidean space. One can, however, have doubling measures on Euclidean space that are  [[Singular measures|singular]] with respect to Lebesgue measure. One example on the real line is the [[weak limit]] of the following sequence of measures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Zygmund | first = A. | title= Trigonometric Series. Vol. I,II | series = Cambridge Mathematical Library | edition = Third | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | pages = xii; Vol. I: xiv+383 pp.; Vol. II: viii+364| ISBN = 0-521-89053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; d\mu_n = \prod_{i=1}^n (1+a\cos (3^i 2\pi x))\,dx,\;\;\; |a|&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

One can construct another singular doubling measure ''μ'' on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] as follows: for each ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, partition the unit interval [0,1] into 3&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; intervals of length 3&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Let Δ be the collection of all such intervals in [0,1] obtained for each ''k'' (these are the ''triadic intervals''), and for each such interval ''I'', let ''m''(''I'') denote its "middle third" interval. Fix 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and let ''μ'' be the measure such that ''μ''([0,&amp;nbsp;1])&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and for each triadic interval ''I'', ''μ''(''m''(''I''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''δμ''(''I''). Then this gives a doubling measure on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] singular to Lebesgue measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kahane | first = J.-P. | title = Trois notes sur les ensembles parfaits linéaires| journal = Enseignement Math. (2) | volume = 15 | year = 1969 | pages = 185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The definition of a doubling measure may seem arbitrary, or purely of geometric interest. However, many results from classical harmonic analysis and [[computational geometry]] extend to the setting of metric spaces with doubling measures.

==Education and personal life==
The second of two children of E. W. Cheney, Sr., and Carleton (Pratt) Cheney, Elliott Ward Cheney Jr., was born in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"&gt;[http://www.ma.utexas.edu/CNA/DMY/ewc-bio.pdf EWC Biographical Data]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Ward began clarinet studies at age ten and would play in chamber music groups throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ma.utexas.edu/CNA/DMY/ewc.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward Cheney was a 1947 graduate of Fountain Hill High School, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  In 1951, he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from [[Lehigh University]], where his father was a physics professor. During undergraduate summers, Ward worked for the [[United States Forest Service]], where he met Elizabeth Jean "Beth", whom he married in 1952. The young couple resided in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], while Ward studied and served as a mathematics instructor at [[The University of Kansas]], earning his [[Ph.D.]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="mathgenealogy"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=13161|name=Elliott Ward Cheney Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ward had three children with his first wife, Beth, all of whom earned doctorates: daughter Margaret is a professor of mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.colostate.edu/~cheney|title=Margaret Cheney|work=Department of Mathematics, College of Natural Sciences|publisher=[[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; son David is a manager of international research projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csted.sri.com/people/david-w-cheney |title=David W.

Their mother Beth remarried in 1975 and died in 1991. Ward and his  wife Victoria had been together since 1983.

==Professional background==
Following the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1957, the United States intensified its focus on their aerospace program.  Cheney became a research scientist at [[Convair]] Astronautics in [[San Diego, California]], where his mathematical team worked on calculations for the [[Atlas rocket]]—which would take [[John Glenn]] into space.

Cheney also worked for [[Space Technology]], near Los Angeles, and taught at [[UCLA]], with visiting positions at [[Michigan State University]] and [[Iowa State University]]. In addition, Ward was a consultant and/or a guest worker at [[Boeing]] Scientific Research Laboratories, [[The Aerospace Corporation]], and [[IBM Research]] Laboratory.  In the summers of 1961–63, he was director of the NSF Summer Institute in Numerical Analysis at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

In 1964, Ward joined the mathematics faculty of [[The University of Texas at Austin]], where he taught for the next 41 years, until his retirement at age 76.&lt;ref name="UTemeritus"/&gt;

==Career and travel==
Cheney served continuously on the editorial board of the [[Journal of Approximation Theory]] from its inception in 1968 until sometime after the start of 2015, and published 14 papers there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00219045]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-approximation-theory/editorial-board Journal of Approximation Theory Editorial Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Cheney supervised 17 PhD students,&lt;ref name="mathgenealogy"/&gt; 35 Masters students, and worked with three post-doctoral students.&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} He was Associate Editor for ten mathematical journals as well as referee and reviewer for many other journals.&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|11–12}} Cheney had over a 100 published papers and was the author of two dozen mathematical textbooks, with several having multiple editions.&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|2–6}} A reviewer wrote of his 1986 monograph: "Cheney's book scores highly on all ... points". Ward Cheney and Will Light wrote two graduate level books. Ward Cheney and David Kincaid co-authored two undergraduate textbooks, and a graduate textbook.

During his career, Ward frequently spent his summers and a sabbatical semester in England at [[Lancaster University]] and at [[Leicester University]].  Also, he held a visiting professorship at [[Lund University]], Sweden. Ward was a world-wide traveler and was frequently invited to give lecturers on approximation theory at universities wherever he went.&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|6–10}}

==Teaching and research==
Ward was an inspirational teacher and a superb lecturer who presented over 165 invited lectures and colloquium talks at universities and conferences around the world.&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|6–10}}  Special honors include an invited lectures at the ''1963 National Meeting of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)'', in [[Denver]], Colorado, and at the ''1974 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]'', in [[Vancouver]], Canada.  Moreover, Professor Cheney was the honoree at the ''1995 International Conference on Approximation Theory'', [[College Station, Texas]].&lt;ref name="ewc-bio"/&gt;{{rp|11}} For over 40 years, this has been the main general conference on approximation theory with presentations by international mathematician from academia, industry, and government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~at14 14th International Conference on Approximation Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''embedding''' (or '''imbedding'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=49}} suggests that "the English" (i.e. the British) use "embedding" instead of "imbedding".&lt;/ref&gt;) is one instance of some [[mathematical structure]] contained within another instance, such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is a [[subgroup]].

When some object ''X'' is said to be embedded in another object ''Y'', the embedding is given by some [[Injective function|injective]] and structure-preserving map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}. The precise meaning of "structure-preserving" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which ''X'' and ''Y'' are instances. In the terminology of [[category theory]], a structure-preserving map is called a [[morphism]].

The fact that a map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a "hooked arrow" ({{unichar|21AA|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK|ulink=Unicode}});&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus: &lt;math&gt; f : X \hookrightarrow Y.&lt;/math&gt; (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for [[inclusion map]]s.)

Given ''X'' and ''Y'', several different embeddings of ''X'' in ''Y'' may be possible. In many cases of interest there is a standard (or "canonical") embedding, like those of the [[natural number]]s in the [[integer]]s, the integers in the [[rational number]]s, the rational numbers in the [[real number]]s, and the real numbers in the [[complex number]]s. In such cases it is common to identify the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''X'' with its [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''X'') contained in ''Y'', so that {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ ''Y''}}.

==Topology and geometry==
===General topology===

In [[general topology]], an embedding is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hocking|Young|1988|page=73}}. {{harvnb|Sharpe|1997|page=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More explicitly, an injective [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] map &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; between [[topological space]]s &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a '''topological embedding''' if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; yields a homeomorphism between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; carries the [[subspace topology]] inherited from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). Intuitively then, the embedding &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; lets us treat &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Every embedding is injective and [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. Every map that is injective, continuous and either [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]] is an embedding; however there are also embeddings which are neither open nor closed. The latter happens if the image &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is neither an [[open set]] nor a [[closed set]] in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

For a given space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the existence of an embedding &lt;math&gt;X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological invariant]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This allows two spaces to be distinguished if one is able to be embedded in a space while the other is not.

===Differential topology===

In [[differential topology]]:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be smooth [[manifold]]s and &lt;math&gt;f:M\to N&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth map. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] if its [[pushforward (differential)|derivative]] is everywhere injective. An '''embedding''', or a '''smooth embedding''', is defined to be an injective immersion which is an embedding in the topological sense mentioned above (i.e. [[homeomorphism]] onto its image).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bishop|Crittenden|1964|page=21}}. {{harvnb|Bishop|Goldberg|1968|page=40}}. {{harvnb|Crampin|Pirani|1994|page=243}}. {{harvnb|do Carmo|1994|page=11}}. {{harvnb|Flanders|1989|page=53}}. {{harvnb|Gallot|Hulin|Lafontaine|2004|page=12}}. {{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1963|page=9}}. {{harvnb|Kosinski|2007|page=27}}. {{harvnb|Lang|1999|page=27}}. {{harvnb|Lee|1997|page=15}}. {{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=49}}. {{harvnb|Warner|1983|page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other words, an embedding is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to its image, and in particular the image of an embedding must be a [[submanifold]]. An immersion is a local embedding (i.e. for any point &lt;math&gt;x\in M&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;x\in U\subset M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f:U\to N&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding.)

When the domain manifold is compact, the notion of a smooth embedding is equivalent to that of an injective immersion.

An important case is &lt;math&gt;N = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The interest here is in how large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be for an embedding, in terms of the dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitney H., ''Differentiable manifolds,'' Ann. of Math. (2), '''37''' (1936), pp. 645–680&lt;/ref&gt; states that &lt;math&gt;n = 2m&lt;/math&gt; is enough, and is the best possible linear bound. For example the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a power of two, requires &lt;math&gt;n = 2m&lt;/math&gt; for an embedding. However, this does not apply to immersions; for instance, '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be immersed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; as is explicitly shown by [[Boy's surface]]&amp;mdash;which has self-intersections. The [[Roman surface]] fails to be an immersion as it contains [[cross-cap]]s.

An embedding is '''proper''' if it behaves well with respect to [[Topological_manifold#Manifolds_with_boundary|boundaries]]: one requires the map &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; to be such that

*&lt;math&gt;f(\partial X) = f(X) \cap \partial Y&lt;/math&gt;, and
*&lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] to &lt;math&gt;\partial Y&lt;/math&gt; in any point of &lt;math&gt;f(\partial X)&lt;/math&gt;.

The first condition is equivalent to having &lt;math&gt;f(\partial X) \subseteq \partial Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(X \setminus \partial X) \subseteq Y \setminus \partial Y&lt;/math&gt;. The second condition, roughly speaking, says that ''f''(''X'') is not tangent to the boundary of ''Y''.

===Riemannian geometry===

In [[Riemannian geometry]]:
Let (''M,g'') and (''N,h'') be [[Riemannian manifold]]s.
An '''isometric embedding''' is a smooth embedding ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' which preserves the  [[Riemannian metric|metric]] in the sense that ''g'' is equal to the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of ''h'' by ''f'', i.e. ''g'' = ''f''*''h''. Explicitly, for any two tangent vectors 

:&lt;math&gt;v,w\in T_x(M)&lt;/math&gt;

we have 

:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w)=h(df(v),df(w)).&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, '''isometric immersion''' is an immersion between Riemannian manifolds which preserves the Riemannian metrics.

Equivalently, an isometric embedding (immersion) is a smooth embedding (immersion) which preserves length of [[curve]]s (cf. [[Nash embedding theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nash J.,  ''The embedding problem for Riemannian manifolds,'' Ann. of Math. (2), '''63''' (1956), 20–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebra==
In general, for an algebraic category ''C'', an embedding between two ''C''-algebraic structures ''X'' and ''Y'' is a ''C''-morphism {{nowrap|''e'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} that is injective.

===Field theory===

In [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], an '''embedding''' of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''E'' in a field ''F'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''σ'' : ''E'' → ''F''}}.

The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''σ'' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''E'' which cannot be the whole field ''E'', because of the condition {{nowrap|1=''σ''(1) = 1}}. Furthermore, it is a well-known property of fields that their only ideals are the zero ideal and the whole field itself. Therefore, the kernel is 0, so any embedding of fields is a [[monomorphism]]. Hence, ''E'' is [[isomorphic]] to the subfield ''σ''(''E'') of ''F''. This justifies the name ''embedding'' for an arbitrary homomorphism of fields.

===Universal algebra and model theory===
{{further|Substructure (mathematics)|Elementary equivalence}}
If σ is a [[signature (logic)|signature]] and &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are σ-[[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] (also called σ-algebras in [[universal algebra]] or models in [[model theory]]), then a map &lt;math&gt;h:A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is a σ-embedding [[iff]] all of the following hold:
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is injective,
* for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f \in\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n \in A^n,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;h(f^A(a_1,\ldots,a_n))=f^B(h(a_1),\ldots,h(a_n))&lt;/math&gt;,
* for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;R \in\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n \in A^n,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A \models R(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;B \models R(h(a_1),\ldots,h(a_n)).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;A\models R (a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a model theoretical notation equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in R^A&lt;/math&gt;. In model theory there is also a stronger notion of [[elementary embedding]].

==Order theory and domain theory==
In [[order theory]], an embedding of [[partial order]]s is a function F from X to Y such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1,x_2\in X: x_1\leq x_2\Leftrightarrow F(x_1)\leq F(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[domain theory]], an additional requirement is: 

:&lt;math&gt; \forall y\in Y:\{x: F(x)\leq y\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Directed set|directed]].

==Metric spaces==

A mapping &lt;math&gt;\phi: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; of [[metric spaces]] is called an ''embedding''
(with [[stretch factor|distortion]] &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) if 
:&lt;math&gt; L d_X(x, y) \leq d_Y(\phi(x), \phi(y)) \leq CLd_X(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;
for some constant &lt;math&gt;L&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Normed spaces ===

An important special case is that of [[normed spaces]]; in this case it is natural to consider linear embeddings. 

One of the basic questions that can be asked about a finite-dimensional [[normed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot \|)&lt;/math&gt; is, ''what is the maximal dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;\ell_2^k&lt;/math&gt; can be linearly embedded into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with constant distortion?''

The answer is given by [[Dvoretzky's theorem]].

==Category theory==

In [[category theory]], there is no satisfactory and generally accepted definition of embeddings that is applicable in all categories. One would expect that all isomorphisms and all compositions of embeddings are embeddings, and that all embeddings are monomorphisms. Other typical requirements are: any [[monomorphism#Related concepts|extremal monomorphism]] is an embedding and embeddings are stable under [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]]s.

Ideally the class of all embedded [[subobject]]s of a given object, up to isomorphism, should also be [[small class|small]], and thus an [[ordered set]]. In this case, the category is said to be well powered with respect to the class of embeddings. This allows defining new local structures in the category (such as a [[closure operator]]). 

In a [[concrete category]], an '''embedding''' is a morphism ''ƒ'':&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' which is an injective function from the underlying set of ''A'' to the underlying set of ''B'' and is also an '''initial morphism''' in the following sense:
If ''g'' is a function from the underlying set of an object ''C'' to the underlying set of ''A'', and if its composition with ''ƒ'' is a morphism ''ƒg'':&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'', then ''g'' itself is a morphism.

A [[factorization system]] for a category also gives rise to a notion of embedding. If (''E'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') is a factorization system, then the morphisms in ''M'' may be regarded as the embeddings, especially when the category is well powered with respect to&amp;nbsp;''M''. Concrete theories often have a factorization system in which ''M'' consists of the embeddings in the previous sense. This is the case of the majority of the examples given in this article.

As usual in category theory, there is a [[dual (category theory)|dual]] concept, known as quotient. All the preceding properties can be dualized.

An embedding can also refer to an [[Subcategory#Embeddings|embedding functor]].

Floating-point error arises because real numbers cannot, in general, be accurately represented in a fixed space.  By definition, [[floating-point]] error cannot be eliminated, and, at best, can only be managed.

H. M. Sierra noted in his 1956 patent "Floating Decimal Point Arithmetic Control Means for Calculator":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Thus under some conditions, the major portion of the significant data digits may lie beyond the capacity of the registers. Therefore, the result obtained may have little meaning if not totally erroneous.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Z1 (computer)|first computer]] (relays) developed by [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse]] in 1936 with floating point arithmetic and was thus susceptible to floating point error. Early computers, however, with operation times measured in milliseconds, were incapable of solving large, complex problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wikieducator.org/History_of_Computer_Development_%26_Generation_of_Computer|title= History of Computer Development &amp; Generation of Computer|date= September 2014|website= WikiEducator|accessdate= 2018-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus were seldom plagued with floating point error. Today, however, with super computer system performance measured in petaflops, (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) floating-point operations per second, floating point error is a major concern for computational problem solvers. Further, there are two types of floating point error, cancellation and rounding. Cancellation occurs when subtracting two similar numbers and rounding occurs with significant bits cannot be saved and are rounded or truncated. Cancellation error is exponential relative to rounding error.

The following sections describe the strengths and weaknesses of various means of mitigating floating point error.

== Numerical error analysis ==
Though not the primary focus of [[numerical analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://webs.um.es/eliseo/um/uploads/Main/TrefethendefNA.pdf|title= The Definition of Numerical Analysis|last1= Trefethen|first1= Lloyd N. |date= 1992|publisher= SIAM|accessdate= 2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Higham1&gt;{{cite book|title=Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms |edition=2 |first=Nicholas John |author-link=Nicholas John Higham |last=Higham |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) |year=2002 |isbn=0-89871-521-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=epilvM5MMxwC&amp;dq=accuracy+and+stability+of+numerical+algorithms+higham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiktX7vqrZAhXkh1QKHYvhCncQ6AEIMzAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} [[Error analysis (mathematics)|numerical error analysis]] for the analysis and minimization of floating point rounding error. Numerical error analysis generally does not account for cancellation error.&lt;ref name=Higham1/&gt;{{rp|5}}

== Monte Carlo arithmetic ==
Error analysis by Monte Carlo arithmetic is accomplished by repeatedly injecting small errors into an algorithms data values and determining the relative effect on the results.

== Extension of precision == 
Extension of precision is the use of larger representations of real values. The ISO standard define precision as the number of digits available to represent real numbers, and typically including single precision (32-bits), double precision (64-bits), and quad precision (128-bits). While extension of precision makes the effects of error less likely or less important, the true accuracy of the results are still unknown.

== Variable length arithmetic ==
[[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|Variable length arithmetic]] represents numbers as a string of digits of variable length limited only by the memory available. Variable length arithmetic operations are considerably slower than fixed length format floating point instructions. When high performance is not a requirement, but high precision is, variable length arithmetic can prove useful, thought the actual accuracy of the result may not be known.

== Interval arithmetic ==
[[Interval arithmetic]] is an algorithm for bounding rounding and measurement errors. The algorithm results in two floating point numbers representing the minimum and maximum limits for the real value represented. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Instead of using a single floating-point number as approximation for the value of a real variable in the mathematical model under investigation, interval arithmetic acknowledges limited precision by associating with the variable
a set of reals as possible values. For ease of storage and computation, these sets are restricted to intervals."&lt;ref name=Hickey&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hickey |first1= T. |last2= Ju|first2= Q. |last3= van Emden|first3= M.H. |date= September 2001 |title= Interval Arithmetic: from Principles to Implementation|url= http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/S62.12/docs/Hickey_interval.pdf|journal= Journal of the ACM|volume= 48|issue= 5|pages= 1038–1068 |doi= 10.1145/502102.502106|access-date= 2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The evaluation of interval arithmetic expression may provide a large range of values,&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt; and may seriously overestimate the true error boundaries.&lt;ref name=Kahan1&gt;{{cite web|url= https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/UnumSORN.pdf|title= A Critique of  John L.

== Gustafson's unums ==
[[Unums]] ("Universal Numbers") are an extension of variable length arithmetic proposed by [[John L. Gustafson|John Gustafson]].&lt;ref name="Gustafson"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Gustafson |author-first=John Leroy |author-link=John Leroy Gustafson |title=The End of Error: Unum Computing |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |edition=2nd corrected printing, 1st |date=2016-02-04 |orig-year=2015-02-05 |isbn=978-1-4822-3986-7 |series=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]] / [[CRC Computational Science]] |volume=24 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/The-End-of-Error-Unum-Computing/Gustafson/p/book/9781482239867 |access-date=2016-05-30}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fZsXBgAAQBAJ] [http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781482239867]&lt;/ref&gt; Unums have variable length fields for the exponent and significand lengths and error information is carried in a single bit, the ubit, representing possible error in the least significant bit of the significand ([[Unit in the last place|ULP]]).&lt;ref name="Gustafson"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The efficacy of unums is questioned by [[William Kahan]].&lt;ref name="Kahan1"/&gt;

'''Sir George Biddell Airy''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB|PRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛər|i}}; 27 July 1801{{snd}}2 January 1892) was an English [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]], [[Astronomer Royal]] from 1835 to 1881. His many achievements include work on [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s, measuring the mean density of the Earth, a method of solution of two-dimensional problems in [[solid mechanics]] and, in his role as Astronomer Royal, establishing [[Greenwich]] as the location of the [[prime meridian]]. His reputation has been tarnished by allegations that, through his inaction, Britain lost the opportunity of priority in the discovery of [[Neptune]].

==Biography==
Airy was born at [[Alnwick]], one of a long line of Airys who traced their descent back to a family of the same name residing at [[Kentmere]], in [[Westmorland]], in the 14th century. The branch to which he belonged, having suffered in the [[English Civil War]], moved to [[Lincolnshire]] and became farmers. Airy was educated first at elementary schools in [[Hereford]], and afterwards at [[Colchester Royal Grammar School]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=445}} An introverted child, Airy gained popularity with his schoolmates through his great skill in the construction of peashooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Airy|title=George Biddell Airy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the age of 13, Airy stayed frequently with his uncle, Arthur Biddell at [[Playford, Suffolk]]. Biddell introduced Airy to his friend [[Thomas Clarkson]], the slave trade abolitionist who lived at Playford Hall.  Clarkson had an MA in mathematics from Cambridge, and examined Airy in classics and then subsequently arranged for him to be examined by a Fellow from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on his knowledge of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of Sir George Biddel Airy (see Google books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Biddell Airy KCB.  Leaflet available from Playford church&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he entered Trinity in 1819, as a [[sizar]], meaning that he paid a reduced fee but essentially worked as a servant to make good the fee reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ARY819GB|name=Airy, George Biddell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he had a brilliant career, and seems to have been almost immediately recognised as the leading man of his year. In 1822 he was elected scholar of Trinity, and in the following year he graduated as [[senior wrangler]] and obtained first [[Smith's Prize]]. On 1 October 1824 he was elected fellow of Trinity, and in December 1826 was appointed [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian professor]] of [[mathematics]] in succession to [[Thomas Turton]]. This chair he held for little more than a year, being elected in February 1828 [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy|Plumian professor]] of [[astronomy]] and director of the new [[Cambridge Observatory]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=445}} In 1836 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and in 1840, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1859 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002330 |title=Sir George Biddell Airy (1801–1892) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
[[File:George Biddell Airy2.jpg|thumb|left|George Biddell Airy]]
Some idea of his activity as a writer on mathematical and physical subjects during these early years may be gathered from the fact that previous to this appointment he had contributed no less than three important memoirs to the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society]], and eight to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]]. At the Cambridge Observatory Airy soon showed his power of organisation. The only [[telescope]] in the establishment when he took charge was the [[transit telescope|transit instrument]], and to this he vigorously devoted himself. By the adoption of a regular system of work, and a careful plan of reduction, he was able to keep his observations up to date, and published them annually with a punctuality which astonished his contemporaries. Before long a [[mural circle]] was installed, and regular observations were instituted with it in 1833. In the same year the [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] presented the Cambridge observatory with a fine object-glass of 12-inch aperture, which was mounted according to Airy's designs and under his superintendence, although construction was not completed until after he moved to [[Greenwich]] in 1835.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=445}}

Airy's writings during this time are divided between mathematical physics and astronomy. The former are for the most part concerned with questions relating to the theory of light arising out of his professorial lectures, among which may be specially mentioned his paper ''On the Diffraction of an Object-Glass with Circular Aperture,'' and his enunciation of the complete theory of the [[rainbow]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1831 the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society was awarded to him for these researches. Of his astronomical writings during this period the most important are his investigation of the mass of [[Jupiter]], his report to the [[British Association]] on the progress of astronomy during the 19th century, and his work ''On an Inequality of Long Period in the Motions of the [[Earth]] and [[Venus]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=445-446}}

One of the sections of his able and instructive report was devoted to "A Comparison of the Progress of Astronomy in England with that in other Countries," very much to the disadvantage of England. This reproach was subsequently to a great extent removed by his own labours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}

====Mean density of the Earth====
One of the most remarkable of Airy's researches was his determination of the [[mean density of the Earth]]. In 1826, the idea occurred to him of attacking this problem by means of [[pendulum]] experiments at the top and bottom of a deep [[mining|mine]]. His first attempt, made in the same year, at the [[Dolcoath mine]] in Cornwall, failed in consequence of an accident to one of the [[pendulum]]s. A second attempt in 1828 was defeated by a flooding of the mine, and many years elapsed before another opportunity presented itself. The experiments eventually took place at the Harton pit near [[South Shields]] in 1854. Their immediate result was to show that gravity at the bottom of the mine exceeded that at the top by 1/19286 of its amount, the depth being 383&amp;nbsp;m (1,256&amp;nbsp;ft) From this he was led to the final value of Earth's [[specific density]] of 6.566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Airy |first=G. B. |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k55951k/f359.table |date=1856 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=146 |pages=343–355 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1856.0015 |title=Account of Pendulum Experiments Undertaken in the Harton Colliery, for the Purpose of Determining the Mean Density of the Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This value, although considerably in excess of that previously found by different methods, was held by Airy, from the care and completeness with which the observations were carried out and discussed, to be "entitled to compete with the others on, at least, equal terms."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}} The currently accepted value for Earth's density is 5.5153 g/cm³.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Reference geoid====
In 1830, Airy calculated the lengths of the polar radius and equatorial radius of the earth using measurements taken in the UK.  Although his measurements were superseded by more accurate radius figures (such as those used for [[GRS 80]] and [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]) his ''Airy geoid'' (strictly a reference ellipsoid, OSGB36) is still used by Great Britain's [[Ordnance Survey]] for mapping of England, Scotland and Wales because it better fits the local sea level (about 80&amp;nbsp;cm below world average).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenwichmeridian.org/tgm/articles.php?article=7 |title=WGS84 and the Greenwich Meridian |publisher=Royal Observatory, Greenwich |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnhs.co.uk/focuson/grabagridref/html/OSGB.pdf  |title=A Guide to Coordinate Systems |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Planetary inequalities====
Airy's discovery of a new inequality in the motions of Venus and the Earth is in some respects his most remarkable achievement. In correcting the elements of [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]]'s solar tables he had been led to suspect an inequality overlooked by their constructor. The cause of this he did not long seek in vain; thirteen times the mean motion of Venus is so nearly equal to eight times that of Earth that the difference amounts to only a small fraction of Earth's mean motion, and from the fact that the term depending on this difference, although very small in itself, receives in the integration of the [[differential equation]]s a multiplier of about 2,200,000, Airy was led to infer the existence of a sensible inequality extending over 240 years (''Phil. Trans.'' cxxii. 67). The investigation was probably the most laborious that had been made up to Airy's time in [[planet]]ary theory, and represented the first specific improvement in the solar tables effected in England since the establishment of the theory of [[gravity]]. In recognition of this work the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] was awarded to him in 1833{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}} (he would win it again in 1846).

====Airy disk====

The [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of optical devices is limited by [[diffraction]].  So even the most perfect lens can't quite generate a point image at its [[Focus (optics)|focus]], but instead there is a bright central pattern now called the [[Airy disk]], surrounded by concentric rings comprising an Airy pattern. The size of the Airy disk depends on the light wavelength and the size of the aperture. [[John Herschel]] had previously described the phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;Herschel, J. F. W., "Light," in [https://archive.org/details/treatisesonphysi00hersrich ''Transactions Treatises on physical astronomy, light and sound contributed to the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana''], Richard Griffin &amp; Co., 1828, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; but Airy was the first to explain it theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;Airy, G. B., "On the Diffraction of an Object-glass with Circular Aperture," [https://archive.org/details/transactionsofca05camb ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', Vol. 5], 1835, p. 283-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a key argument in refuting one of the last remaining arguments for absolute [[geocentrism]]: the [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli#The Star Size Argument|giant star argument]]. [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] pointed out that the lack of [[stellar parallax]] detectable at the time entailed that stars were a huge distance away.  But the naked eye and the early telescopes with small apertures seemed to show that stars were disks of a certain size. This would imply that the stars were many times larger than our sun (they were not aware of [[supergiant star|supergiant ]] or [[hypergiant star]]s, but some were calculated to be even larger than the size of the whole universe estimated at the time).  However, the disk appearances of the stars were spurious: they were not actually seeing stellar images, but Airy disks. In reality, the actual images of almost all stars, even using the best telescopes with the largest apertures, look like mere points of light.

====Astronomer Royal====
[[File:Airys Transit Circle.jpg|thumb|Airy's Transit Circle in the Transit Circle Room, Greenwich]]
In June 1835 Airy was appointed [[Astronomer Royal]] in succession to [[John Pond]], and began his long career at the national observatory which constitutes his chief title to fame. The condition of the observatory at the time of his appointment was such that [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], the first [[Lord of the Admiralty]], considered that "it ought to be cleared out," while Airy admitted that "it was in a queer state." With his usual energy he set to work at once to reorganise the whole management. He remodelled the volumes of observations, put the library on a proper footing, mounted the new ([[Richard Sheepshanks|Sheepshanks]]) [[equatorial mount|equatorial]] and organised a new magnetic observatory. In 1847 an [[altazimuth mount|altazimuth]] was erected, designed by Airy to enable observations of the [[moon]] to be made not only on the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], but whenever it might be visible.&lt;ref name="satterthwaite2006"/&gt; In 1848 Airy invented the reflex zenith tube to replace the [[zenith sector]] previously employed. At the end of 1850 the great transit circle of 203&amp;nbsp;mm (8&amp;nbsp;inch) aperture and 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in) [[focal length]] was erected, and is still the principal instrument of its class at the observatory. The mounting in 1859 of an equatorial of 330&amp;nbsp;mm (13&amp;nbsp;inch) aperture evoked the comment in his journal for that year, "There is not now a single person employed or instrument used in the observatory which was there in Mr Pond's time"; and the transformation was completed by the inauguration of [[spectroscopic]] work in 1868 and of the photographic registration of [[sunspots]] in 1873.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}

[[File:Prime meridian.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Prime Meridian in Greenwich]]
The formidable undertaking of reducing the accumulated planetary observations made at Greenwich from 1750 to 1830 was already in progress under Airy's supervision when he became Astronomer Royal. Shortly afterwards he undertook the further laborious task of reducing the enormous mass of observations of the moon made at Greenwich during the same period under the direction, successively, of [[James Bradley]], [[Nathaniel Bliss]], [[Nevil Maskelyne]] and John Pond, to defray the expense of which a large sum of money was allotted by the Treasury. As a result, no fewer than 8,000 lunar observations were rescued from oblivion, and were, in 1846, placed at the disposal of astronomers in such a form that they could be used directly for comparison with the theory and for the improvement of the tables of the moon's motion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}

For this work Airy received in 1848 a testimonial from the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], and it at once led to the discovery by [[Peter Andreas Hansen]] of two new inequalities in the moon's motion. After completing these reductions, Airy made inquiries, before engaging in any theoretical investigation in connection with them, whether any other mathematician was pursuing the subject, and learning that Hansen had taken it in hand under the patronage of the [[king of Denmark]], but that, owing to the death of the king and the consequent lack of funds, there was danger of his being compelled to abandon it, he applied to the admiralty on Hansen's behalf for the necessary sum. His request was immediately granted, and thus it came about that Hansen's famous ''Tables de la Lune'' were dedicated to ''La Haute Amirauté de sa Majesté la Reine de la Grande Bretagne et d'Irlande''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}

In 1851 Airy established a new [[Prime Meridian]] at Greenwich. This line, the fourth "Greenwich Meridian," became the definitive internationally recognised line in 1884.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Search for Neptune====
[[File:George Biddell Airy by Ape.jpg|right|thumb|George Biddell Airy caricatured by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Ape]] in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' Nov 1875]]
{{main article|Discovery of Neptune}}
In June 1846, Airy started corresponding with French astronomer [[Urbain Le Verrier]] over the latter's prediction that irregularities in the motion of [[Uranus]] were due to a so-far unobserved body. Aware that Cambridge Astronomer [[John Couch Adams]] had suggested that he had made similar predictions, on 9 July Airy entreated [[James Challis]] to undertake a systematic search in the hope of securing the triumph of discovery for Britain. Ultimately, a rival search in Berlin by [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], instigated by Le Verrier, won the race for priority.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Though Airy was "abused most savagely both by English and French"&lt;ref name="airy"&gt;{{cite book |last2=Wilfrid |first2=Airy, |first=George Biddell |last=Airy |title=The Autobiography of Sir George Biddell Airy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1896 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-mUSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=edward+maunder+astronomer |oclc=13130558 |accessdate=24 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his failure to act on Adams's suggestions more promptly, there have also been claims that Adams's communications had been vague and dilatory&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and further that the search for a new planet was not the responsibility of the Astronomer Royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |last=Hutchins |first=R.  |date=2004 |title=Adams, John Couch (1819–1892) |id=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ether drag test====
{{Main article|Luminiferous aether}}
By means of a water-filled [[telescope]], Airy in 1871 looked for a change in [[stellar aberration]] through the [[refract]]ing water due to an [[aether drag hypothesis|ether drag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Airy |first=G. B. |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k56114d/f79.table |date=1871 |title=On the Supposed Alteration in the Amount of Astronomical Aberration of Light, Produced by the Passage of the Light through a Considerable Thickness of Refracting Medium |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=20 |pages=35–39 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1871.0011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like in all other aether drift experiments, he obtained a negative result.

====Lunar theory====
In 1872 Airy conceived the idea of treating the lunar theory in a new way, and at the age of seventy-one he embarked on the prodigious toil which this scheme entailed. A general description of his method will be found in the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', vol. xxxiv, No. 3. It consisted essentially in the adoption of [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay]]'s final numerical expressions for [[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[parallax]], with a symbolic term attached to each number, the value of which was to be determined by substitution in the equations of motion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}

In this mode of treating the question the order of the terms is numerical, and though the amount of labour is such as might well have deterred a younger man, yet the details were easy, and a great part of it might be entrusted to "a mere computer".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}{{efn|At the time that this was written, the term "computer" referred to a human being who performed calculating work, either manually or with mechanical aids.}}

The work was published in 1886, when its author was eighty-five years of age. For some little time previously he had been harassed by a suspicion that certain errors had crept into the computations, and accordingly he addressed himself to the task of revision. But his powers were no longer what they had been, and he was never able to examine sufficiently into the matter. In 1890 he tells us how a grievous error had been committed in one of the first steps, and pathetically adds, "My spirit in the work was broken, and I have never heartily proceeded with it since."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=446}}

====Engineering mechanics====

=====Stress function method=====
In 1862, Airy presented a new technique to determine the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] and [[Stress (physics)|stress]] field within a [[beam theory|beam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Airy |first=G. B. |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k559580/f66.table |date=1863 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=153 |pages=49–80 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1863.0004 |title=On the Strains in the Interior of Beams }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, sometimes called the [[Wikiversity:Airy stress function|Airy stress function method]], can be used to find solutions to many two-dimensional problems in [[solid mechanics]] (see [[Wikiversity: Introduction to Elasticity|Wikiversity]]). For example, it was used by H. M. Westergaard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westergaard |first1=H. M. |date=1939 |title=Bearing Pressures and Cracks |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216756690_Bearing_Pressures_and_Cracks |journal=Journal of Applied Mechanics |volume=6 |pages=49–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the stress and strain field around a crack tip and thereby this method contributed to the development of [[fracture mechanics]].

=====Tay Bridge disaster=====
[[File:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Original Tay Bridge from the north]]
[[File:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|Destruction of the Tay Bridge]]
Airy was consulted about wind speeds and pressures likely to be encountered on the proposed Forth suspension bridge being designed by [[Thomas Bouch]] for the [[North British Railway]] in the late 1870s. He thought that pressures no greater than about 10 pounds per square foot could be expected, a comment Bouch took to mean also applied to the first Tay railway bridge then being built. Much greater pressures, however, can be expected in severe storms. Airy was called to give evidence before the Official Inquiry into the [[Tay Bridge disaster]], and was criticised for his advice. However, little was known about the problems of wind resistance of large structures, and a Royal Commission on Wind Pressure was asked to conduct research into the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=P.R. |date=2004 |title=Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay: Reinvestigating the Tay Bridge Disaster of 1879 |publisher=NPI Media Group |location=London |isbn=0-7524-3160-9 |pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====

Airy was described in his obituary published by the [[Royal Society]] as being "a tough adversary" and stories of various disagreements and conflicts with other scientists survive.  [[Francis Ronalds]] discovered Airy to be his foe while he was inaugural Honorary Director of the [[Kew Observatory]], which Airy considered to be a competitor to Greenwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=June 2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Early Years of the Kew Observatory|url=|journal=Weather|doi=10.1002/wea.2739|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode = 2016Wthr...71..131R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other well documented conflicts were with [[Charles Babbage]] and Sir [[James South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ed-thelen.org/bab/Swade_PhD.pdf|title=Calculation and Tabulation in the Nineteenth Century: Airy versus Babbage|last=Swade|first=D.

===Private life===
[[File:George Biddell Airy (1801-1892), by John Collier.jpg|thumb|right|George Biddell Airy ([[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]], 1883)]]

In July 1824, Airy met Richarda Smith (1804–1875), "a great beauty", on a walking tour of [[Derbyshire]]. He later wrote, "Our eyes met ... and my fate was sealed ... I felt irresistibly that we must be united," and Airy proposed two days later. Richarda's father, the Revd Richard Smith, felt that Airy lacked the financial resources to marry his daughter. Only in 1830, with Airy established in his Cambridge position, was permission for the marriage granted.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman2003/&gt;

The Airys had nine children, the first three died young. 

Elizabeth Airy (born 1833) died of consumption ([[tuberculosis]]) in 1852. 

The eldest to survive to adulthood was Wilfrid (1836-1925), who designed and engineered [["Colonel" George Tomline]]'s [[Nacton#Orwell Park Observatory, Nacton|Orwell Park Observatory]].&lt;ref name="goward2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goward2006" /&gt; Wilfrid's daughter was the artist [[Anna Airy]].&lt;ref name="goward2006" /&gt; Anna’s mother died shortly after she was born and she was raised by her maiden aunts Christabel and Annot (see below).

Their son [[Hubert Airy]] (1838–1903) was a doctor, and a pioneer in the study of [[migraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20608346 | volume=39 | title=Hubert Airy, contemporary men of science and the migraine aura | year=2009 | journal=J R Coll Physicians Edinb | pages=263–7 | last1 = Eadie | first1 = MJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airy himself suffered from this condition.

Their eldest daughter, Hilda (1840–1916), married the mathematician [[Edward Routh]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |last=Fuller |first=A. T. |year=2004 |title=Routh, Edward John (1831–1907) |id=35850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of their next two daughters married, they were Christabel (1842-1917) and Annot (1843-1924).

The Airys youngest child was Osmund (1845-1929).

Airy was [[Order of the Bath|knighted]] on 17 June 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23868 |date=18 June 1872 |page=2801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airy retired in 1881, living with his two un-married daughters at Croom's Hill near Greenwich. In 1891, he suffered a fall and an internal injury. He survived the consequential surgery only a few days. His wealth at death was £27,713. Airy and his wife and three pre-deceased children are buried at St. Mary's Church in [[Playford, Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; A cottage owned by Airy still stands, adjacent to the church and now in private hands.&lt;ref&gt;A description and images of Airy's Suffolk cottage and church are found in Goward (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Moore]] the late and widely known astronomer and TV presenter asserts in his autobiography that the ghost of Airy has been seen haunting the Royal Greenwich Observatory after nightfall. (page 178)

'''Georges Julien Giraud'''&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1939}}|year 1939 list of corresponding members]] of the "Geometry" section of the French Academy, this was his full name: however, he simply sign himself as "Georges Giraud" in all his scientific works.&lt;/ref&gt; (22 July 1889&lt;ref name="Ber_p629" /&gt; – 16 March 1943) was a French mathematician, working in [[potential theory]], [[partial differential equation]]s, [[singular integral]]s and [[singular integral equation]]s:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Tricomi|1967|p=21}} and {{Harv|Tampieri|2014|loc=p. 89 and p. 90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he is mainly known for his solution of the [[Oblique derivative problem|regular oblique derivative problem]] and also for his extension to [[Dimension (mathematics)|{{math|''n''}}–dimensional]] ({{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2}}) singular integral equations of the concept of [[symbol of a singular integral]], previously introduced by [[Solomon Mikhlin]].&lt;ref&gt;He announced his results in the short communication {{Harv|Giraud|1936}}, without proof and acknowledging the previous work of [[Solomon Mikhlin|Mikhlin]]. As a matter of fact, it was Mikhlin who gave the first proofs of these formulas, completing his work on the [[Dimension (mathematics)|2-dimensional]] theory: see {{Harv|Mikhlin|1965|p=9}} or the entry "[[Singular integrals]]" for a comprehensive historical survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific work of Georges Giraud was widely acknowledged and earned him several prizes, mainly, but not exclusively, awarded him by the French Academy of Sciences: he was seven times recipient of academy prizes.

In 1919, he was awarded the "Prix Francœur" for his work on the theory of [[automorphic function]]s:&lt;ref name="Fran"&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1919}}|22 December 1919 relation on the Prix Francœur]] in the "Comptes rendus".&lt;/ref&gt; the members of the commission who examined his work and nominated him were [[Camille Jordan]], [[Paul Appell]], [[Marie Georges Humbert]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Édouard Goursat]], [[Joseph Boussinesq]], [[Léon Lecornu]] and [[Emile Picard]] (the relator).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ibid.]]'' ([[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1919}}|1919, p. 1202]]).&lt;/ref&gt; For the same motivation,&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1923}}|17 December 1923 relation on the Prix Gustave Roux]] in the "Comptes rendus", and reference {{harv|AMS|1924|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 1923 he was awarded the "Gustave Roux" prize.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1923}}|17 December 1923 relation on the Prix Gustave Roux]] in the "Comptes rendus", the members of the examining commission were [[Albin Haller]], [[Guillaume Bigourdan]], [[Antoine Lacroix]], [[Léon Guignard]], [[Paul Appell]], and [[Emile Picard]] again as the relator.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 he won the Hirn Foundation Prize, for his whole scientific work:&lt;ref&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1924}}|22 December 1924 relation on the Hirn Foundation prize]] in the "Comptes rendus", and reference {{harv|AMS|1925|p=282}}. According to the first reference, the amount of the prize was 2500 [[French franc]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; he won again the same prize in 1935,&lt;ref name="Hirn"&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1935}}|16 December 1935 relation on the Hirn Foundation prize]] in the "Comptes rendus", and reference {{harv|AMS|1936|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for his work on singularities of [[boundary value problem]]s in the theory of partial differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;"''..., pour sex travaux sul les singularités dans les problèmes aux limites de la théorie des équations aux dérivées partielles''", as it is precisely stated in the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1935}}|relation on the 1935 Hirn Foundation prize]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Giraud won the "Grand Prix des sciences Mathématiques" for his work in the theory of partial differential equations:&lt;ref&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1928}}|17 December 1928 relation on the Gran Prix des sciences mathématiques]] in the "Comptes rendus", and reference {{harv|AMS|1929|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for the same motivation, in 1930 he was also awarded the "Prix Houllevigue".&lt;ref&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1930}}|15 December 1930 relation on the Prix Houllevigue]] in the "Comptes rendus", and reference {{harv|AMS|1931|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he was also awarded the prize of the Lasserre foundation.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|AMS|1931|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he was recipient of the Prix Saintour, for his work on partial differential and [[integral equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1933}}|11 December 1933 relation on the Prix Saintour]] in the "Comptes rendus", and reference {{harv|AMS|1934|p=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1935, apart from winning the Hirn foundation prize for a second time,&lt;ref name="Hirn" /&gt; he was awarded the prize of the [[Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Annali della Reale Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], equally divided between him, [[Guido Ascoli]] and [[Pietro Buzano]]:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|AMS|1936|p=178}} and {{harv|Tonelli|1936|p=III}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the members of the jury who awarded ex-aequo the prize were [[Guido Fubini]], [[Mauro Picone]] and [[Giovanni Sansone]].&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harv|Tonelli|1936}}, who reports excerpts from the conclusive relation of the jury. {{harv|Tonelli|1936|p=IV}} states also that the amount of the prize awarded to each of the three winners was 2000 [[Italian Lira]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 1936, following up a proposal Jacques Hadamard made since 1931,&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Tampieri|2014|p=89}}. Precisely, Jacques Hadamard presented Giraud for the election as corresponding member of the French Academy for three times, the first two being on 12 and on 26 January 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; he was elected [[corresponding member]] of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;See the obituary notices by {{Harvtxt|Cartan|1943|p=518}}, {{harvtxt|Bertrand|1943b|p=629}} and {{Harvtxt|Tampieri|2014|p=89}}, and also the [[#{{harvid|Les Secrétaires Perpétuelles|1930}}|14 December 1936 announce of his election]] reporting the detailed election results.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a member of the [[Société Mathématique de France]] from 1913 to his death.&lt;ref&gt;See reference {{Harv|SMF|1946|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13375">A '''variational principle''' in physics is an alternative method for determining the state or dynamics of a physical system, by identifying it as an extremum (minimum, maximum or saddle point) of a function or functional.  This article describes the historical development of such principles.

==Variational principles before [[Modern history|modern times]]==

Variational principles are found among earlier ideas in [[surveying]] and [[optics]]. The [[rope stretchers]] of [[ancient Egypt]] stretched corded ropes between two points to measure the path which minimized the distance of separation, and [[Claudius Ptolemy]], in his [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]] (Bk 1, Ch 2), emphasized that one must correct for "deviations from a straight course"; in [[ancient Greece]] [[Euclid]] states in his ''Catoptrica'' that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]]; and [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|pages= 167–168|isbn=0-19-501496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was generalized to [[refraction]] by [[Pierre de Fermat]], who, in the 17th century, refined the principle to "light travels between two given points along the path of shortest ''time''"; now known as the '''[[principle of least time]]''' or '''[[Fermat's principle]]'''.

==Principle of extremal action==
Credit for the formulation of the '''principle of least action''' is commonly given to [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], who wrote about it in 1744{{ref|Mau44}} and 1746,{{ref|Mau46}} although the true priority is less clear, as discussed below.

Maupertuis felt that "Nature is thrifty in all its actions", and applied the principle broadly: "The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements." {{ref|Dav98}}

In application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the "[[vis viva]]", twice what we now call the kinetic energy of the system.

[[Leonhard Euler]] gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the ''Additamentum 2'' to his "Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes".{{ref|Eul44}} He begins the second paragraph:{{ref|Adit}}

:"Sit massa corporis projecti ==''M'', ejusque, dum spatiolum == ''ds'' emetitur, celeritas debita altitudini == ''v''; erit quantitas motus corporis in hoc loco == &lt;math&gt;M\sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt; ; quae per ipsum spatiolum ''ds'' multiplicata, dabit &lt;math&gt;M\,ds\sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt; motum corporis collectivum per spatiolum ''ds''. Iam dico lineam a corpore descriptam ita fore comparatam, ut, inter omnes alias lineas iisdem terminis contentas, sit &lt;math&gt;\int M ds \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt;, seu, ob M constans, &lt;math&gt;\int ds \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt; minimum."

A translation of this passage reads:

:"Let the mass of the projectile be ''M'', and let its squared velocity resulting from its height be &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; while being moved over a distance ''ds''.   The body will have a momentum &lt;math&gt;M \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt; that, when multiplied by the distance ''ds'', will give &lt;math&gt;M ds \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt;, the momentum of the body integrated over the distance ''ds''.  Now I assert that the curve thus described by the body to be the curve (from among all other curves connecting the same endpoints) that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\int M ds \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt; or, provided that  ''M'' is constant, &lt;math&gt;\int ds \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt;."

As Euler states, &lt;math&gt;\int M ds \sqrt{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the integral of the momentum over distance traveled (note that here &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; contrary to usual notation denotes the ''squared'' velocity) which, in modern notation, equals the [[reduced action]] &lt;math&gt;\int p\,dq&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. In rather general terms he  wrote that "Since the fabric of the Universe is most perfect and is the work of a most wise Creator, nothing whatsoever takes place in the Universe in which some relation of maximum and minimum does not appear."
However, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.

Maupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician [[Samuel König]], who claimed that it had been invented by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1707.  Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works.  König himself showed a ''copy'' of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to [[Jacob Hermann (mathematician)|Jacob Hermann]] with the principle, but the ''original'' letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery,{{ref|Oco03}} and even the King of Prussia entered the debate, defending Maupertuis, while [[Voltaire]] defended König. Euler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752.{{ref|Oco03}} The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by [[C.I. Gerhardt]] in 1898{{ref|Ger98}} and [[W. Kabitz]] in 1913{{ref|Kab13}} uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]] archives.

==Further developments of the extremal-action principle==
Euler continued to write on the topic; in his ''Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature'' (1748), he called the quantity "effort". His expression corresponds to what we would now call [[potential energy]], so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.

The full importance of the principle to mechanics was stated by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] in 1760,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although the variational principle was not used to derive the equations of motion until almost 75 years later, when [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1834 and 1835 {{ref|Ham34}} applied the variational principle to the function &lt;math&gt;L=T-V&lt;/math&gt; to obtain what are now called the '''[[Lagrangian equations of motion]]'''.

==Other formulations of the extremal-action principle==
In 1842, [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] tackled the problem of whether the variational principle found minima or other extrema (e.g. a [[saddle point]]); most of his work focused on geodesics on two-dimensional surfaces. {{ref|Jac42}} The first clear general statements were given by [[Marston Morse]] in the 1920s and 1930s, {{ref|Mor34}} leading to what is now known as [[Morse theory]]. For example, Morse showed that the number of conjugate points in a trajectory equaled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.

Other extremal principles of [[classical mechanics]] have been formulated, such as [[Gauss' principle of least constraint]] and its corollary, [[Gauss' principle of least constraint|Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Variational principles in electromagnetism==
The action for electromagnetism is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} =  -\int \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} \, \mathrm{d}^4x  \, F^{\alpha\beta} F_{\alpha\beta} - \int \mathrm{d}^4x \, j^{\alpha}A_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

==Variational principles in relativity theory==
The [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] which gives rise to the vacuum [[Einstein field equations]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}[g] =\frac{c^4}{16 \pi G}\int_{\mathcal{M}} R \sqrt{-g} \, \mathrm{d}^4 x&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;g=\det(g_{\alpha\beta})&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of a spacetime [[Lorentz metric]] and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar curvature]].

==Variational principles in quantum mechanics==
* Sum over possible paths, Feynman approach. See [[Path integral formulation]]
* Dirac-Frenkel Variational Principle

==Apparent teleology?==
Although equivalent mathematically, there is an important ''philosophical'' difference between the [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] and their [[integral equation|integral]] counterpart.  The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time.  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; states that the ''instantaneous'' force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; applied to a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; produces an acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; at the same ''instant''.  By  contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) extended region of space.  Moreover, in the usual formulation of [[classical physics|classical]] action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,

:''Given that the particle begins at position &lt;math&gt;x_{1}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and ends at position &lt;math&gt;x_{2}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an extremum of the action integral.''

In particular, the fixing of the ''final'' state appears to give the action principle a [[teleology|teleological character]] which has been controversial historically.  This apparent [[teleology]] is eliminated in the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] version of the action principle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5042">In the theory of [[partial differential equations]], '''Holmgren's uniqueness theorem''', or simply '''Holmgren's theorem''', named after the Swedish mathematician [[Erik Albert Holmgren]] (1873&amp;ndash;1943), is a uniqueness result for linear [[partial differential equations]] with [[real analytic]] coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Holmgren, "Über Systeme von linearen partiellen Differentialgleichungen", Öfversigt af Kongl. Vetenskaps-Academien Förhandlinger, 58 (1901), 91–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simple form of Holmgren's theorem==

We will use the [[multi-index notation]]:
Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\}\in  \N_0^n,&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;\N_0&lt;/math&gt; standing for the nonnegative integers;
denote &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|=\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_x^\alpha = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right)^{\alpha_1} \cdots \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right)^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Holmgren's theorem in its simpler form could be stated as follows:

:Assume that ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;|''&amp;alpha;''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;(x)&amp;part;{{su|p=''&amp;alpha;''|b=x}}  is an [[elliptic operator|elliptic]] [[partial differential operator]] with [[real-analytic]] coefficients. If ''Pu'' is real-analytic in a connected open neighborhood ''&amp;Omega;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''u'' is also real-analytic.

This statement, with "analytic" replaced by "smooth", is [[Hermann Weyl]]'s classical lemma on [[hypoellipticity|elliptic regularity]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=2528466|last=
Stroock|first = W.|chapter=Weyl's lemma, one of many|title=Groups and analysis|pages=164&amp;ndash;173|series=London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser.|volume=354|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If ''P'' is an elliptic differential operator and ''Pu'' is smooth in ''&amp;Omega;'', then ''u'' is also smooth in ''&amp;Omega;''.

This statement can be proved using [[Sobolev space]]s.

==Classical form==

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a connected open neighborhood in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; be an analytic hypersurface in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, such that there are two open subsets &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{-}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, nonempty and connected, not intersecting &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; nor each other, such that &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\Omega_{-}\cup\Sigma\cup\Omega_{+}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;P=\sum_{|\alpha|\le m}A_\alpha(x)\partial_x^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be a differential operator with real-analytic coefficients.

Assume that the hypersurface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is noncharacteristic with respect to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; at every one of its points:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\rm Char}P\cap N^*\Sigma=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

Above,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\rm Char}P=\{(x,\xi)\subset T^*\R^n\backslash 0:\sigma_p(P)(x,\xi)=0\},\text{ with }\sigma_p(x,\xi)=\sum_{|\alpha|=m}i^{|\alpha|}A_\alpha(x)\xi^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

the [[symbol of a differential operator|principal symbol]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;N^*\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[conormal bundle]] to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
&lt;math&gt;N^*\Sigma=\{(x,\xi)\in T^*\R^n:x\in\Sigma,\,\xi|_{T_x\Sigma}=0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The classical formulation of Holmgren's theorem is as follows:

:'''Holmgren's theorem'''
:''Let &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be a distribution in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Pu=0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; vanishes in &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{-}&lt;/math&gt;, then it vanishes in an open neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;[[François Treves]],
"Introduction to pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators", vol. 1, Plenum Press, New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the Cauchy&amp;ndash;Kowalevski theorem==

Consider the problem

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t^m u=F(t,x,\partial_x^\alpha\,\partial_t^k u),
\quad
\alpha\in\N_0^n,
\quad
k\in\N_0,
\quad
|\alpha|+k\le m,
\quad
k\le m-1,&lt;/math&gt;

with the Cauchy data

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t^k u|_{t=0}=\phi_k(x), \qquad 0\le k\le m-1,&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that &lt;math&gt;F(t,x,z)&lt;/math&gt; is real-analytic with respect to all its arguments in the neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;t=0,x=0,z=0&lt;/math&gt;
and that &lt;math&gt;\phi_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; are real-analytic in the neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Theorem''' (Cauchy&amp;ndash;Kowalevski)
:''There is a unique real-analytic solution &lt;math&gt;u(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; in the neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;(t,x)=(0,0)\in(\R\times\R^n)&lt;/math&gt;''.

Note that the Cauchy&amp;ndash;Kowalevski theorem does not exclude the existence of solutions which are not real-analytic.

On the other hand, in the case when &lt;math&gt;F(t,x,z)&lt;/math&gt; is polynomial of order one in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t^m u = F(t,x,\partial_x^\alpha\,\partial_t^k u)
= \sum_{\alpha\in\N_0^n,0\le k\le m-1, |\alpha| + k\le m}A_{\alpha,k}(t,x) \, \partial_x^\alpha \, \partial_t^k u,&lt;/math&gt;

Holmgren's theorem states that the solution &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is real-analytic and hence, by the Cauchy&amp;ndash;Kowalevski theorem, is unique.

'''Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology''' ('''ISMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]] organised by the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB). The principal focus of the conference is on the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems. The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown to become one of the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linial2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linial | first1 = M. | last2 = Mesirov | first2 = J.

Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB).

The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]]. Most presentations are given in multiple parallel tracks; however, keynote talks are presented in a single track and are chosen to reflect outstanding research in bioinformatics. Notable ISMB keynote speakers have included eight Nobel laureates. The recipients of the ISCB [[Overton Prize]] and [[ISCB Senior Scientist Awards|ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award]] are invited to give keynote talks as part of the programme. The proceedings of the conference are currently published by the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.

==History==
[[File:Larry hunter computer scientist.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white portrait of Lawrence Hunter|[[Lawrence Hunter]], co-chair of the first ISMB conference.]]

===Early meetings===
The origins of the ISMB conference lie in a workshop for [[artificial intelligence]] researchers with an interest in [[molecular biology]] held in November 1991.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Todd A.|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in ISMB|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e1002679|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002679|pmid=22952443|pmc=3431341|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop was organised by [[United States of America|American]] researcher [[Lawrence Hunter]], then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Searls1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Searls|first=D.|author2=Shavlik, J. |author3=Hunter, L. |title=The First International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|journal=AI Magazine|year=1994|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–13|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1082/1000|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the [[National Science Foundation]], made it clear that a regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="about-ismb"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISMB|url=http://www.iscb.org/about-ismb|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having successfully applied for grants from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and the [[Office of Science#Biological and Environmental Research|Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research]], the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, [[David Searls]] (research associate professor at [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]) and [[Jude Shavlik]] (assistant professor of computer science at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries,&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; submitting 69 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt;

The success of the first conference prompted the announcement of a second ISMB conference at the end of the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in [[Seattle]]. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at [[Stanford University]] in August 1994 and was organised by [[Russ Altman]], a research scientist at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt; To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at [[Robinson College, Cambridge]]. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. [[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]] Board member and Director of the [[Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute]] [[Alfonso Valencia]] has stated that, in 1995, "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, there has to be more focus in biology."&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt;

===Formation of ISCB and expansion===
ISMB 1997 was held in [[Halkidiki]], [[Greece]] and marked the foundation of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB).&lt;ref name="about-ismb" /&gt; ISCB was formed with a focus on managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences. ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the [[University of California, San Diego]]) was attended by over 1,000 delegates,&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; submitting 141 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held at a university, due to size limitations.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

===Partnership with ECCB===
[[File:Wfm secc front.jpg|thumb|alt=The entrance to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|The first joint conference with [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] was held in 2004 at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]].]]
In 2004, ISMB was jointly held with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] for the first time. The conference was also co-located with the Genes, Proteins and Computers conference. This meeting, held in [[Glasgow]], [[UK]], was the largest [[bioinformatics]] conference ever held,&lt;ref name=iscb-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|work=www.iscb.org|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended by 2,136 delegates, submitting 496 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=ismbeccb2004&gt;{{cite web|title=ISMB/ECCB 2004|url=http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2004/|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso Valencia considers ISMB/ECCB 2004 to be an important milestone in the history of ISMB: "it was the first one where the balance between Europe and the States became an important part of the conference. It was here that we established the rules and the ways and the spirit of collaboration between the Americans and the Europeans."&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; The success of the joint conference paved the way for future European ISMB meetings to be held jointly with ECCB.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt;

===Recent meetings===
By the end of 2006, ISCB was in financial difficulty. Two conferences (ISMB 2003, in [[Brisbane]] and ISMB 2006, in [[Fortaleza]]) had drastically reduced numbers of participants due to their location, with a corresponding reduction in income.&lt;ref name="Rost2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rost|first=B.|title=ISCB: past-present perspective for the International Society for Computational Biology|journal=Bioinformatics|date=14 November 2013|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt629|pmid=24234004|pmc=5994947|volume=29|issue=24|pages=3243–3245}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allow more delegates to attend, it was decided to limit conference locations to North America and Europe. In January 2007, ISMB and ECCB agreed to hold joint conferences in Europe every other year, beginning with ISMB/ECCB 2007.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; ISMB would be held in North America in the years between joint meetings. {{As of|2016}}, this pattern has been confirmed to continue until at least 2019. ISMB/ECCB 2007 (held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) marked the first conference for which ISCB took full responsibility for organising.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; Vienna became the first city to host ISMB twice with ISMB/ECCB 2011. This 'return visit' was an experiment intended to reduce the increasing effort required to find suitable conference venues. Although the return to Vienna was only deemed partially successful due to price increases, [[Boston]] (which hosted ISMB 2010 and 2014) is predicted to become a 'safe' site which ISMB can periodically return to.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

ISMB celebrated its 20th meeting with ISMB 2012, held in [[Long Beach, California]]. This event attracted around 1,600 delegates,&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; submitting 268 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; Richard H. Lathrop and Lawrence Hunter presented a special keynote presentation, looking back at previous ISMB meetings and attempting to predict where the field of [[bioinformatics]] may head in the future.&lt;ref name=ismb2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012-program/ismb2012-keynotes|work=ISMB 2012|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISMB/ECCB 2013 was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and was attended by around 2,000 delegates, submitting 233 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Ben-Tal2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben-Tal|first=N.|title=Editorial|journal=Bioinformatics|date=21 June 2013|volume=29|issue=13|pages=i1–i2|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt282|pmid=23812973|pmc=3694647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

===Main conference===
The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]].&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

[[Academic paper]]s at ISMB were traditionally presented in a single track.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on [[Protein structure prediction#Secondary structure|protein secondary structure prediction]], [[sequence analysis]] and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively.&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; including multiple [[proceedings]] tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. [[Christopher Rawlings]] (head of Computational and Systems Biology at [[Rothamsted Research]] and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: "There were a lot of people who wanted to keep it more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t."&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; As the number of submitted [[proceedings]] papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by [[AAAI Press]]. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISMB Proceedings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb-proceedings|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunak|first=S.|author2=Krogh, A.|title=ISMB 2001|journal=Bioinformatics|date=1 June 2001|volume=17|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S1–S4|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994;&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

[[File:Gunnar von Heijne ISMB 2012 (7803463978).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gunnar von Heijne|[[ISCB Senior Scientist Awards|ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award]] winner [[Gunnar von Heijne]] giving his keynote talk at ISMB 2012.]]
[[Keynote|Keynote talks]] are presented in a single track and generally attract the largest audience.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; These presentations are chosen to highlight outstanding research in the field of [[bioinformatics]]. Notable [[List of Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology keynote speakers|ISMB keynote speakers]] have included eight [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]]: [[Richard J. Roberts]] (keynote speaker in 1994, 2006), [[John Sulston]] (1995), [[Manfred Eigen]] (1999), [[Gerald Edelman]] (2000), [[Sydney Brenner]] (2003), [[Kurt Wüthrich]] (2006), [[Robert Huber]] (2006) and [[Michael Levitt]] (2015).&lt;ref name=about-ismb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neshich2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neshich|first=Goran|author2=Bourne, Philip E. |author3=Brunak, Søren |title=ISMB 2006|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=1 January 2006|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e11|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020011|pmid=16758006|pmc=1378106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ismb2015keynotes&gt;{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015-program/ismbeccb2015-keynotes|work=ISMB/ECCB 2015|publisher=ISCB|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, ISMB runs on a budget in excess of $1.5M and, in terms of proceeds, brings in four times that of the other ISCB conferences (ISCB-Latin America, [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Bioinformatics Conference|ISCB-Africa]], ISCB-Asia, Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference, [[CSHALS]] and the Great Lakes Bioinformatics Conference) combined.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; Standard registration fees (as of 2013) are around $1,000 for academics who are ISCB members ($1,350 for non-members), with lower rates for students and higher rates for corporate delegates respectively. Discounts are provided for early registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGISTER|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-registration#registrationfee|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite events===
Pre-conference tutorials have played an important role in ISMB since the first conference.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to [[genetic algorithms]], [[neural networks]], [[artificial intelligence|AI]] for molecular biologists and [[molecular biology]] for computer scientists.&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; Tutorials on computational [[mass spectrometry]]-based [[proteomics]] and [[ENCODE]] data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.&lt;ref name=iscbeccb2013-tutorials&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutorials|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-tutorials|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As attendance at ISMB grew in the late 1990s, several satellite meetings and special interest group (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over one or two days before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference.&lt;ref name=ismbeccb2013-sigs&gt;{{cite web|title=SIGs &amp; Satellite Meetings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-satellite-meetings|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable SIG meetings include the [[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000&lt;ref name=bosc&gt;{{cite web|title=BOSC - Open Bioinformatics Foundation|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Past_BOSC_conferences |publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last1=Bodenreider|author-first1=Olivier|author-last2=Stevens|author-first2=Robert|title=Bio-ontologies: current trends and future directions|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=256–274|doi=10.1093/bib/bbl027|pmid=16899495|pmc=1847325|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.&lt;ref name=3dsig-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=3DSIG 2013 - Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics, Berlin 2013|url=http://bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/3dsig13/|work=3DSIG 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camda-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMDA 2013 Conference - CAMDA 2013|url=http://dokuwiki.bioinf.jku.at/doku.php|work=CAMDA 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioana Dumitriu''' (born July 6, 1976) is a [[Romanian-American]] mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.math.washington.edu/~dumitriu/cv_2009.pdf Curriculum vitae], 2009, retrieved 2014-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Her research interests include the theory of [[random matrix|random matrices]], [[numerical analysis]], [[scientific computing]], and [[game theory]].

==Life==
Dumitriu is the daughter of two Romanian electrical engineering professors from [[Bucharest]]. Early in her life she was identified as having mathematical talent, and at age 11 won a national mathematics contest. She entered mathematics training camps in preparation for participation on the Romanian team at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], although her highest level of participation in the olympiad was the national semifinal.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;
 
As a 19-year-old freshman at NYU, Dumitriu already was taking graduate-level classes in mathematics.&lt;ref name="schafer"/&gt; She graduated [[summa cum laude]] from NYU in 1999 with a B.A. in mathematics and a minor in computer science.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; She earned her Ph.D. in 2003 from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] under the supervision of [[Alan Edelman]], with a thesis on ''Eigenvalue statistics for beta-ensembles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=76759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thesis"&gt;{{cite thesis|first=Ioana|last=Dumitriu|title=Eigenvalue statistics for beta-ensembles|date=2003|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|mr=2717094}}&lt;/ref&gt; After postdoctoral research as a [[Miller Research Fellows|Miller Research Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], she joined the faculty of the [[University of Washington]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Dumitriu won the [[Alice T. Schafer]] prize for excellence in mathematics by an undergraduate woman in 1996,&lt;ref name="schafer"&gt;[http://www.awm-math.org/schaferprize/1996.html Seventh Annual Alice T. Schafer Prize], [[Association for Women in Mathematics]], retrieved 2014-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]] (given to a young [[numerical analysis]] researcher who excels both mathematically and in presentation skills) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ima.org.uk/about_us/awards_and_medals/ima_leslie_fox_prize/previous_winners.html IMA Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis Winners], retrieved 2014-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she received a [[National Science Foundation CAREER Awards|CAREER Award]] from the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0847661|title=CAREER Award|website=nsf.gov|access-date= 2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she became one of the inaugural [[fellow]]s of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2014-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First female Putnam fellow===
In 1996, as a sophomore at New York University, Dumitriu became the first woman to become a Putnam Fellow, meaning that she earned one of the top five scores at the [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citation|title=Q: How Many Women Have Won the Top Math Contest?|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|first=Karen W.|last=Arenson|date=May 1, 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/01/nyregion/q-how-many-women-have-won-the-top-math-contest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, 1996, and 1997 she won the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Award that is given to the top woman in the contest, a record that was not matched until ten years later when [[Alison Miller]] also won the same award in three consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/news/putnam-competition-results-harvard-captures-top-prize Putnam Competition Results: Harvard Captures Top Prize], [[Mathematical Association of America]], March 17, 2008, retrieved 2014-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">In mathematics, '''Jacobi transform''' is an [[integral transform]] named after the mathematician [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]], which uses [[Jacobi polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;P_n^{\alpha,\beta}(x)&lt;/math&gt; as kernels of the transform.&lt;ref&gt;Debnath, L. "On Jacobi Transform." Bull. Cal. Math. Soc 55.3 (1963): 113-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debnath, L. "SOLUTION OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS BY JACOBI TRANSFORM." BULLETIN OF THE CALCUTTA MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY 59.3-4 (1967): 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, E. J. "Jacobi transforms." (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jacobi transform of a function &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref&gt;Debnath, Lokenath, and Dambaru Bhatta. Integral transforms and their applications. CRC press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverse Jacobi transform is given by

:&lt;math&gt;J^{-1}\{f^{\alpha,\beta}(n)\} = F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\delta_n} f^{\alpha,\beta}(n) P_n^{\alpha,\beta}(x), \quad \text{where}

When the matrix is a [[square matrix]], both the matrix and its [[determinant]] are referred to as the '''Jacobian''' in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Jacobian.html|title=Jacobian|first=Weisstein, Eric|last=W.|date=|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103144419/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Jacobian.html|archivedate=3 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose {{math|'''f''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a function which takes as input the vector {{math|'''x''' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and produces as output the vector {{math|'''f'''('''x''') ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Then the Jacobian matrix {{math|'''J'''}} of {{math|'''f'''}} is an {{math|''m''×''n''}} matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}\\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
    \dfrac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, component-wise:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} .&lt;/math&gt;

This matrix, whose entries are functions of {{math|'''x'''}}, is also denoted by {{math|D'''f'''}}, {{math|'''J'''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{sfrac|''∂''(''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)|''∂''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. (Note that some literature defines the Jacobian as the [[transpose]] of the matrix given above.)

The Jacobian matrix is important because if the function {{math|'''f'''}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a point {{math|'''x'''}} (this is a slightly stronger condition than merely requiring that all partial derivatives exist at {{math|'''x'''}}), then the Jacobian matrix defines a [[linear map]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is the best (pointwise) [[linear approximation]] of the function {{math|'''f'''}} near the point {{math|'''x'''}}. This linear map is thus the generalization of the usual notion of derivative, and is called the ''derivative'' or the ''differential'' of {{math|'''f'''}} at {{math|'''x'''}}.

If {{math|''m''}} = {{math|''n''}}, the Jacobian matrix is a square matrix, and its [[determinant]], a function of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the '''Jacobian determinant''' of {{math|'''f'''}}. It carries important information about the local behavior of {{math|'''f'''}}. In particular, the function {{math|'''f'''}} has locally in the neighborhood of a point {{math|'''x'''}} an [[inverse function]] that is differentiable if and only if the Jacobian determinant is nonzero at {{math|'''x'''}} (see [[Jacobian conjecture]]). The Jacobian determinant also appears when changing the variables in [[multiple integral]]s (see [[Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables|substitution rule for multiple variables]]).

If {{math|''m''}} = 1, {{math|'''f'''}} is a [[scalar field]] and the Jacobian matrix is reduced to a [[row vector]] of partial derivatives of {{math|'''f'''}}—i.e. the [[transpose]] of the [[gradient]] of {{math|'''f'''}}, when denoted as column vector with respect to the ordered basis &lt;math&gt;\{\hat{\mathbf{x}}_1,\cdots,\hat{\mathbf{x}}_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

These concepts are named after the [[mathematician]] [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] (1804–1851).

== Jacobian matrix ==

The Jacobian generalizes the [[gradient]] of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued function of multiple variables, which itself generalizes the derivative of a scalar-valued function of a single variable. In other words, the Jacobian for a scalar-valued [[multivariate function]] is the gradient and that of a scalar-valued function of single variable is simply its derivative. The Jacobian can also be thought of as describing the amount of "stretching", "rotating" or "transforming" that a transformation imposes locally. For example, if {{math|(''x''′, ''y''′) {{=}} '''f'''(''x'', ''y'')}} is used to transform an image, the Jacobian {{math|'''J'''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'')}}, describes how the image in the neighborhood of {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is transformed.

If a function is differentiable at a point, its derivative is given in coordinates by the Jacobian, but a function does not need to be differentiable for the Jacobian to be defined, since only the [[partial derivative]]s are required to exist.

If {{math|'''p'''}} is a point in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|'''f'''}} is [[derivative|differentiable]] at {{math|'''p'''}}, then its derivative is given by {{math|'''J'''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''p''')}}. In this case, the [[linear map]] described by {{math|'''J'''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''p''')}} is the best [[linear approximation]] of {{math|'''f'''}} near the point {{math|'''p'''}}, in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf f(\mathbf x) = \mathbf f(\mathbf p) + \mathbf J_{\mathbf f}(\mathbf p)(\mathbf x - \mathbf p) + o(\|\mathbf x - \mathbf p\|)&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|'''x'''}} close to {{math|'''p'''}} and where {{math|''o''}} is the [[Big_O_notation#Little-o_notation|little o-notation]] (for {{math|'''x''' → '''p'''}}) and {{math|‖'''x''' − '''p'''‖}} is the [[Euclidean distance|distance]] between {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''p'''}}. (See [[Total derivative#The total derivative as a linear map]].)

Compare this to a [[Taylor series]] for a scalar function of a scalar argument, truncated to first order:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(p) + f'(p) (x - p) + o(x - p) .&lt;/math&gt;

In a sense, both the [[gradient]] and Jacobian are "[[derivative|first derivatives]]"—the former the first derivative of a ''scalar function'' of several variables, the latter the first derivative of a ''vector function'' of several variables.

The Jacobian of the gradient of a scalar function of several variables has a special name: the [[Hessian matrix]], which in a sense is the "[[second derivative]]" of the function in question.

== Jacobian determinant ==

[[File:Jacobian_determinant_and_distortion.svg|thumb|400px|A nonlinear map &lt;math&gt;f \colon \mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; sends a small square (left, in red) to a distorted parallelogram (right, in red). The Jacobian at a point gives the best linear approximation of the distorted parallelogram near that point (right, in translucent white), and the Jacobian determinant gives the ratio of the area of the approximating parallelogram to that of the original square.]]

If {{math|1=''m'' = ''n''}}, then {{math|'''f'''}} is a function from {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to itself and the Jacobian matrix is a [[square matrix]]. We can then form its [[determinant]], known as the '''Jacobian determinant'''. The Jacobian determinant is sometimes referred to as "the Jacobian".

The Jacobian determinant at a given point gives important information about the behavior of {{math|'''f'''}} near that point. For instance, the [[continuously differentiable function]] {{math|'''f'''}} is [[invertible]] near a point {{math|'''p''' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} if the Jacobian determinant at {{math|'''p'''}} is non-zero. This is the [[inverse function theorem]]. Furthermore, if the Jacobian determinant at {{math|'''p'''}} is [[positive number|positive]], then {{math|'''f'''}} preserves orientation near {{math|'''p'''}}; if it is [[negative number|negative]], {{math|'''f'''}} reverses orientation. The [[absolute value]] of the Jacobian determinant at {{math|'''p'''}} gives us the factor by which the function {{math|'''f'''}} expands or shrinks [[volume]]s near {{math|'''p'''}}; this is why it occurs in the general [[substitution rule]].

The Jacobian determinant is used when making a [[Integration by substitution#Substitution for multiple variables|change of variables]] when evaluating a [[multiple integral]] of a function over a region within its domain. To accommodate for the change of coordinates the magnitude of the Jacobian determinant arises as a multiplicative factor within the integral. This is because the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional {{math|''dV''}} element is in general a [[parallelepiped]] in the new coordinate system, and the {{math|''n''}}-volume of a parallelepiped is the determinant of its edge vectors.

The Jacobian can also be used to solve [[matrix differential equation|systems of differential equations]] at an [[equilibrium point]] or approximate solutions near an equilibrium point.

== Inverse ==

According to the [[inverse function theorem]], the [[Invertible matrix|matrix inverse]] of the Jacobian matrix of an [[invertible function]] is the Jacobian matrix of the ''inverse'' function.  That is, if the Jacobian of the function {{math|'''f''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is continuous and nonsingular at the point {{math|'''p'''}} in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then {{math|'''f'''}} is invertible when restricted to some neighborhood of {{math|'''p'''}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf f^{-1}} \circ \mathbf f = {\mathbf J_{\mathbf f}}^{-1} .&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, if the Jacobian determinant is not zero at a point, then the function is ''locally invertible'' near this point, that is, there is a [[neighbourhood]] of this point in which the function is invertible.

The (unproved) [[Jacobian conjecture]] is related to global invertibility in the case of a polynomial function, that is a function defined by ''n'' [[polynomial]]s in ''n'' variables. It asserts that, if the Jacobian determinant is a non-zero constant (or, equivalently, that it does not have any complex zero), then the function is invertible and its inverse is a polynomial function.

== Critical points ==

{{main|Critical point (mathematics)|l1=Critical point}}

If {{math|'''f''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a [[differentiable function]], a ''critical point'' of {{math|'''f'''}} is a point where the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the Jacobian matrix is not maximal. This means that the rank at the critical point is lower than the rank at some neighbour point. In other words, let {{math|''k''}} be the maximal dimension of the [[open ball]]s contained in the image of {{math|'''f'''}}; then a point is critical if all [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]]s of rank {{math|''k''}} of {{math|'''f'''}} are zero.

In the case where {{math|1=1 = ''m'' = ''n'' = ''k''}}, a point is critical if the Jacobian determinant is zero.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===

Consider the function {{math|'''f''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix}
  x^2 y \\
  5 x + \sin y \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then we have
:&lt;math&gt;f_1(x, y) = x^2 y&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;f_2(x, y) = 5 x + \sin y&lt;/math&gt;
and the Jacobian matrix of {{math|'''F'''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf f}(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial y}\\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} &amp; \dfrac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
  2 x y &amp; x^2    \\
  5     &amp; \cos y \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and the Jacobian determinant is
:&lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf J_{\mathbf f}(x, y)) = 2 x y \cos y - 5 x^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 2: polar-Cartesian transformation ===

The transformation from [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''φ'')}} to [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'', ''y''), is given by the function {{math|'''F''': ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; × [0, 2{{pi}}) → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} with components:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp;= r \cos \varphi ; \\
y &amp;= r \sin \varphi .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf F}(r, \varphi) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial\varphi}\\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial\varphi} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\varphi &amp; - r\sin \varphi \\
  \sin\varphi &amp;   r\cos \varphi \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Jacobian determinant is equal to {{math|''r''}}.  This can be used to transform integrals between the two coordinate systems:
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_{\mathbf F(A)} f(x, y) \,dx \,dy = \iint_A f(r \cos \varphi, r \sin \varphi) \, r \, dr \, d\varphi .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 3: spherical-Cartesian transformation ===

The transformation from [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} to [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z''), is given by the function {{math|'''F''': ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; × [0, ''π''] × [0, 2 ''π'') → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} with components:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp;= r \sin \theta \cos \varphi ; \\
y &amp;= r \sin \theta \sin \varphi ; \\
z &amp;= r \cos \theta .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Jacobian matrix for this coordinate change is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf F}(r, \theta, \varphi) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} &amp; \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \varphi} \\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \theta} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \varphi} \\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial r} &amp; \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \theta} &amp; \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \varphi}\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
      \sin \theta \cos \varphi &amp; r \cos \theta \cos \varphi &amp; - r \sin \theta \sin \varphi \\
      \sin \theta \sin \varphi &amp; r \cos \theta \sin \varphi &amp; r \sin \theta \cos \varphi \\
      \cos \theta &amp; - r \sin \theta &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[determinant]] is {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin ''θ''}}.  As an example, since {{math|''dV'' {{=}} ''dx'' ''dy'' ''dz''}} this determinant implies that the [[differential volume element]] {{math|''dV'' {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin ''θ'' ''dr'' ''dθ'' ''dφ''}}. Unlike for a change of [[Cartesian coordinates]], this determinant is not a constant, and varies with coordinates ({{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}}).

=== Example 4 ===

The Jacobian matrix of the function {{math|'''F''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} with components

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y_1 &amp;= x_1 \\
y_2 &amp;= 5 x_3 \\
y_3 &amp;= 4 x_2^2 - 2 x_3 \\
y_4 &amp;= x_3 \sin x_1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf F}(x_1, x_2, x_3) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \dfrac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_3} \\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_3} \\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial y_3}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_3}{\partial x_2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_3}{\partial x_3} \\[1em]
  \dfrac{\partial y_4}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_4}{\partial x_2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial y_4}{\partial x_3} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 \\
  0 &amp; 8 x_2 &amp; -2 \\
  x_3\cos x_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \sin x_1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This example shows that the Jacobian need not be a square matrix.

=== Example 5 ===

The Jacobian determinant of the function {{math|'''F''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} with components

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  y_1 &amp;= 5x_2 \\
  y_2 &amp;= 4x_1^2 - 2 \sin (x_2x_3) \\
  y_3 &amp;= x_2 x_3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  0 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 \\
  8 x_1 &amp; -2 x_3 \cos(x_2 x_3) &amp; -2 x_2 \cos (x_2 x_3) \\
  0 &amp; x_3 &amp; x_2
\end{vmatrix} = -8 x_1 \begin{vmatrix}
  5 &amp; 0 \\
  x_3 &amp; x_2
\end{vmatrix} = -40 x_1 x_2.&lt;/math&gt;

From this we see that {{math|'''F'''}} reverses orientation near those points where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} have the same sign; the function is [[locally]] invertible everywhere except near points where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}. Intuitively, if one starts with a tiny object around the point {{math|(1, 2, 3)}} and apply {{math|'''F'''}} to that object, one will get a resulting object with approximately {{math|40 × 1 × 2 {{=}} 80}} times the volume of the original one, with orientation reversed.

== Other uses ==

The Jacobian serves as a linearized [[design matrix]] in statistical [[regression analysis|regression]] and [[curve fitting]]; see [[non-linear least squares]].

=== Dynamical systems ===

Consider a [[dynamical system]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = F(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt; is the (component-wise) derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the [[evolution parameter]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (time), and &lt;math&gt;F \colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable.  If &lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{x}_{0}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[stationary point]] (also called a [[steady state]]). By the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]], the behavior of the system near a stationary point is related to the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_{F} \left( \mathbf{x}_{0} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the Jacobian of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; at the stationary point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. K. |last=Arrowsmith |first2=C. M. |last2=Place |title=Dynamical Systems: Differential Equations, Maps, and Chaotic Behaviour |chapter=The Linearization Theorem |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-412-39080-9 |pages=77–81 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qCcP7KNaZ0C&amp;pg=PA77 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if the eigenvalues all have real parts that are negative, then the system is stable near the stationary point, if any eigenvalue has a real part that is positive, then the point is unstable. If the largest real part of the eigenvalues is zero, the Jacobian matrix does not allow for an evaluation of the stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morris |last=Hirsch |first2=Stephen |last2=Smale |title=Differential equations, dynamical systems and linear algebra |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newton's method ===

A square system of coupled nonlinear equations can be solved iteratively by [[Newton's method#Nonlinear systems of equations|Newton's method]].  This method uses the Jacobian matrix of the system of equations.

===Surface analysis===
Let ''n'' = 2 so the Jacobian is a [[2 × 2 real matrix]]. Suppose a [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] [[diffeomorphism]] f: ''U'' → ''V'' in the neighborhood of ''p'' in ''U'' is written &lt;math&gt;(u(x,y),\ v(x,y)) .&lt;/math&gt; The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf f}(\mathbf p)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a complex number: ordinary, split, or dual. Furthermore, since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf f}(\mathbf p)&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, the complex number has a [[polar decomposition]] or an [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|alternative planar decomposition]].

And again, each such complex number represents a [[group action]] on the tangent plane at ''p''. The action is dilation by the norm of the complex number, and rotation respecting [[angle]], [[hyperbolic angle]], or [[slope]], according to the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J_{\mathbf f}(\mathbf p) .&lt;/math&gt; Such action corresponds to a [[conformal mapping#Pseudo-Riemannian geometry|conformal mapping]].

'''Jean Henri Gallier''' (born 1949) is a researcher in [[computational logic]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he holds appointments in the Computer and Information Science Department and the Department of Mathematics.

==Biography==
Gallier was born January 5, 1949 in [[Nancy, France]], and holds dual French and American citizenship. He earned his [[baccalauréat]] at the [[Lycée Jean Pierre Vernant|Lycée de Sèvres]] in 1966, and a degree in [[civil engineering]] at the [[École des ponts ParisTech|École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées]] in 1972.{{r|cv}}
He then moved to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] for his graduate studies, earning a Ph.D. in computer science in 1978 under the joint supervision of [[Sheila Greibach]] and Emily Perlinski Friedman. His dissertation was entitled ''Semantics and Correctness of Classes of Deterministic and Nondeterministic Recursive Programs''.{{r|cv|mg}}
After postdoctoral study at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], he joined the University of Pennsylvania Department of Computer and Information Science in 1978. At Pennsylvania, he was promoted to full professor in 1990, gained a secondary appointment to the Department of Mathematics in 1994, and directed the French Institute of Culture and Technology from 2001 to 2004.{{r|cv}}

==Contributions==
Gallier's most heavily cited research paper, with his student William F. Dowling, gives a [[linear time]] algorithm for [[Horn-satisfiability]].{{ran|DG84}}
This is a variant of the [[Boolean satisfiability]] problem: its input is a Boolean formula in [[conjunctive normal form]] with at most one positive [[Literal (mathematical logic)|literal]] per clause, and the goal is to assign [[truth value]]s to the variables of the formula to make the whole formula true. Solving Horn-satisfiability problems is the central computational paradigm in the [[Prolog]] programming language.{{r|dechter}}

Gallier is also the author of five books in computational logic,{{ran|G86}}
[[computational geometry]],{{ran|G99}}{{ran|G00}}
[[low-dimensional topology]],{{ran|GX13}}
and [[discrete mathematics]].{{ran|G11}}

'''Joan Sylvia Lyttle Birman''' (born May 30, 1927 in New York City&lt;ref name=LRiddleBio&gt;Larry Riddle. "[https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/birman.htm Joan S. Birman]", ''Biographies of Women Mathematicians'', at [[Agnes Scott College]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American mathematician, specialising in [[low-dimensional topology]]. She has given contributions to the study of [[Knot theory|knots]], [[3-manifold|3-manifolds]], [[Mapping class group of a surface|mapping class groups]] of surfaces, [[geometric group theory]], [[Contact geometry|contact structures]] and [[Dynamical system|dynamical systems]]. Birman is currently Research Professor Emerita at [[Barnard College]], [[Columbia University]], where she has been since 1973.

== Family ==
Her parents were George and Lillian Lyttle, both [[Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsBio&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Birman.html|title=Birman biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was from Russia but grew up in Liverpool, England. Her mother was born in New York and her parents were Russian-Polish immigrants. At age 17, George emigrated to the US and became a successful dress manufacturer. He appreciated the opportunities from having a business but he wanted his daughters to focus on education. She has three children. Her late husband, Joseph Birman, was a physicist and a leading advocate for human rights for scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/updates/josephbirman.cfm|title=Joseph L. Birman (1927-2016)|website=www.aps.org|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
After high school, Birman entered Swarthmore College, a coeducational institution in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, and majored in mathematics. However, she disliked living in the dorms so she transferred to Barnard College, a women's only college affiliated to Columbia University, to live at home.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsBio/&gt;

Birman received her B.A. (1948) in mathematics from Barnard College and an M.A. (1950) in physics from Columbia University.
After working in the industry from 1950 to 1960, she did a PhD in mathematics at the [[Courant Institute]] ([[New York University|NYU]]) under the supervision of [[Wilhelm Magnus]], graduating in 1968. Her dissertation was titled ''Braid groups and their relationship to mapping class groups''.&lt;ref name="MGP"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=24360|title=Joan Sylvia Lyttle Birman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Birman's first position was at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (1968–1973).  She also was a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]] during part of this period.  In 1973, she joined the faculty at Barnard College.
In 1987 she was selected by the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] to be a [[Noether Lecturer]]; this lecture honors women who have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noether Lectures|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/noether-lectures|website=Association for Women in Mathematics|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in the summer of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/ Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been a [[Sloan Fellows|Sloan Foundation Fellow]] (1974–76) and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation Fellow]] (1994–95). In 1996, she won the [[Chauvenet Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Birman, Joan|title=New Points of View in Knot Theory|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.)|volume=28|year=1993|pages=253–287|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/new-points-of-view-in-knot-theory|doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-1993-00389-6|arxiv=math/9304209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2005, she won the New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology.&lt;ref name=LRiddleBio/&gt;

In 2012, she became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; She supervised 21 doctoral students, and has a total of 50 academic descendants. Her doctoral students include [[Józef Przytycki]].&lt;ref name="MGP" /&gt;

In 2017, she endowed the Joan and Joseph Birman Fellowship for Women Scholars at the American Mathematical Society to support mathematical research by mid-career women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/programs/ams-fellowships/Birman-fellow|title=American Mathematical Society - The Joan and Joseph Birman Fellowship for Women Scholars|website=www.ams.org|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Birman's scientific work includes 77 research publications and 16 expository articles or reviews. She is the author of the research monograph ''Braids, Links, and Mapping Class Groups.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">'''Louis-Gustave du Pasquier''' (18 August 1876, [[Auvernier]] – 31 January 1957, [[Cornaux]]) was a Swiss mathematician and historian of mathematics and mathematical sciences.

==Education and career==
Du Pasquier studied at l'[[École Polytechnique]], the [[University of Zurich]], [[La Sorbonne]], the [[Collège de France]], and the Collège Libre des Sciences Sociales. He received his doctorate in 1906 from the University of Zurich with dissertation ''Zahlentheorie der Tettarionen'' under the supervision of [[Adolf Hurwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=9704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Du Pasquier, L.-Gustave|title=Zahlentheorie der Tettarionen|year=1906|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000469679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Pasquier then taught at La Chaux-de-Fonds, Kusnacht, Frauenfeld, Winterthur, and Zurich before he became in 1911 a professor at the [[University of Neuchâtel]]. Du Pasquier wrote more than 60 articles published in scientific journals. He did research on number theory, probability theory, relativity theory, astronomy, and actuarial science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Du Pasquier, Louis-Gustave|website=Éditions Jacques Gabay|url=http://www.gabay-editeur.com/AUTEURS/D/DU-PASQUIER}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Du Pasquier, Louis Gustave (1876–1957)|website=IdRef|url=http://www.idref.fr/032885954}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the 7th volume of the collected works of [[Leonhard Euler]].

Du Pasquier was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1920 at Strasbourg, in 1924 at Toronto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Du Pasquier, L. Gustave|chapter=Propositions concernant l'unification de la terminologie dans la numération parlée|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, August 11–16. 1924|volume=vol. 2|pages=975–981|chapter-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928 at Bologna, and in 1932 at Zurich.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73459">[[File:LCS_conceptual2.pdf|400px|right|thumb| Individual trajectories in a model flow generally show vastly different behavior from trajectories starting from the same initial condition of the real flow. This is due to the inevitable accumulation of errors and uncertainties, as well as sensitive dependence on initial conditions, in any realistic flow model. Yet an attracting LCS (such as the unstable manifold of a saddle point) is remarkably robust with respect to modelling errors and uncertainties. LCSs are, therefore, ideal tools for model validation and benchmarking]]

'''Lagrangian coherent structures''' ('''LCSs''') are distinguished surfaces of [[trajectories]] in a [[dynamical system]] that exert a major influence on nearby trajectories over a time interval of interest.&lt;ref name=Haller&amp;Yuan2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00142-1| title = Lagrangian coherent structures and mixing in two-dimensional turbulence| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 147| issue = 3–4| pages = 352| year = 2000| last1 = Haller | first1 = G.| last2 = Yuan | first2 = G.| bibcode = 2000PhyD..147..352H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/PT.3.1886| title = Lagrangian coherent structures: The hidden skeleton of fluid flows| journal = Physics Today| volume = 66| issue = 2| pages = 41| year = 2013| last1 = Peacock | first1 = T. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | bibcode = 2013PhT....66b..41P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2015&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322| title = Lagrangian Coherent Structures| journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics| volume = 47| pages = 137| year = 2015| last1 = Haller | first1 = G. | bibcode = 2015AnRFM..47..137H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of this influence may vary, but it invariably creates a coherent trajectory pattern for which the underlying LCS serves as a theoretical centerpiece. In observations of tracer patterns in nature, one readily identifies coherent features, but it is often the underlying structure creating these features that is of interest.

As illustrated on the right, individual tracer trajectories forming coherent patterns are generally sensitive with respect to changes in their initial conditions and the system parameters. In contrast, the LCSs creating these trajectory patterns turn out to be robust and provide a simplified skeleton of the overall dynamics of the system.&lt;ref name=Haller2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BozorgMagham&amp;al.2013&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2013.05.003| title = Real-time prediction of atmospheric Lagrangian coherent structures based on forecast data: An application and error analysis| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 258| pages = 47| year = 2013| last1 = Bozorgmagham | first1 = A.

While LCSs generally exist in any dynamical system, their role in creating coherent patterns is perhaps most readily observable in fluid flows. The images below are examples of how different types of LCSs hidden in geophysical flows shape tracer patterns.

== General definitions ==

=== Material surfaces ===
[[File:material surface.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Figure 1: An invariant manifold in the extended phase space, formed by an evolving material surface.]]

On a [[phase space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; and over a time interval &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}=[t_0 ,t_1]&lt;/math&gt; , consider a non-autonomous dynamical system defined through the flow map &lt;math&gt;F^t_{t_0}\colon x_0 \mapsto x(t,t_0,x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, mapping initial conditions &lt;math&gt;x_0\in{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; into their position &lt;math&gt;x(t,t_0,x_0)\in{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; for any time  &lt;math&gt;t\in{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;. If the flow map &lt;math&gt;F^t_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[diffeomorphism]] for any choice of &lt;math&gt;t\in {\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;, then for any smooth set &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; of initial conditions in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt;, the set

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathcal M}=\{(x,t)\in{\mathcal P} \times {\mathcal I}\,\colon [F^t_{t_0}]^{-1}(x)\in{\mathcal M}(t_0)\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[invariant manifold]] in the extended [[phase space]] &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal P} \times {\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;. Borrowing terminology from [[fluid dynamics]], we refer to the evolving time slice &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t)= F^t_{t_0}({\mathcal M}(t_0)) &lt;/math&gt; of the manifold &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}&lt;/math&gt; as a  '''[[material surface]]''' (see Fig. 1). Since any choice of the initial condition set &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; yields an invariant manifold &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}\in{\mathcal P} \times {\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;, invariant manifolds and their associated material surfaces are abundant and generally undistinguished in the extended phase space. Only few of them will act as cores of coherent trajectory patterns.

=== LCSs as exceptional material surfaces ===
[[File:2DLCS.jpg|thumb|Figure 2a: Hyperbolic LCS (attracting in red and repelling in blue)  and elliptic LCS (boundaries of green regions) in a two-dimensional turbulence simulation. (Image: Mohammad Farazmand)]]
In order to create a coherent pattern, a material surface &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t)&lt;/math&gt; should exert a sustained and consistent action on nearby trajectories throughout the time interval &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;. Examples of such action are attraction, repulsion,  or shear. In principle, any well-defined mathematical property qualifies that creates coherent patterns out of randomly selected nearby initial conditions.

Most such properties can be expressed by strict [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]. For instance, we call a [[material surface]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t)&lt;/math&gt; ''attracting'' over the interval &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; if all small enough initial perturbations to &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; are carried by the flow into even smaller final perturbations to &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t_1)&lt;/math&gt;. In classical [[dynamical systems]] theory, [[invariant manifold]]s satisfying such an attraction property over infinite times are called [[attractor]]s. They are not only special, but even locally unique in the phase space: no continuous family of attractors may exist.

In contrast, in [[dynamical systems]] defined over a finite time interval &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;, strict inequalities do not define ''exceptional'' (i.e., locally unique) material surfaces. This follows from the [[continuity (mathematics)|continuity]] of the flow map &lt;math&gt;F^t_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; . For instance, if a material surface  &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t)&lt;/math&gt; attracts all nearby trajectories over the time interval &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt;, then so will any sufficiently close other material surface.

Thus, attracting, repelling and shearing material surfaces are necessarily stacked on each other, i.e., occur in continuous families. This leads to the idea of seeking LCSs in finite-time dynamical systems as ''exceptional'' material surfaces that exhibit a coherence-inducing property ''more strongly'' than any of the neighboring material surfaces. Such LCSs, defined as extrema (or more generally, stationary surfaces) for a finite-time coherence property, will indeed serve as observed centerpieces of trajectory patterns. Examples of attracting, repelling and shearing LCSs are in a direct numerical simulation of 2D turbulence are shown in Fig.2a.

=== LCSs vs. classical invariant manifolds ===
Classical [[invariant manifold]]s are invariant sets in the [[phase space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; of an [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] dynamical system. In contrast,
LCSs are only required to be invariant in the extended phase space. This means that even if the underlying dynamical system is [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]], the LCSs of the system over the interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; will generally be time-dependent, acting as the evolving skeletons of observed coherent trajectory patterns. Figure 2b shows the difference between an attracting LCS and a classic unstable manifold of a saddle point, for evolving times, in an [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] dynamical system.&lt;ref name=Haller2015/&gt;
[[File:LCS_vs_invariant_manifolds.tif|550px|center|thumb| Fig. 2b: An attracting LCS is the locally most attracting material line (invariant manifold in the extended phase space of position and time), acting as the backbone curve of deforming tracer patterns over a finite time interval. In contrast, the unstable manifold of a saddle-type fixed point is an invariant curve in the phase space, acting as the asymptotic target for tracer patterns over infinite time intervals.

=== Objectivity of LCSs ===

Assume that the phase space of the underlying dynamical system is the material configuration space of a continuum, such as a fluid or a deformable body. For instance, for a dynamical system generated by an unsteady velocity field

:: &lt;math&gt;

v=v(x,t),\qquad x\in U\subset {\mathbb R}^3,

&lt;/math&gt;

the open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of possible particle positions is a material configuration space. In this space,  LCSs are material surfaces, formed by trajectories. Whether or not a material trajectory is contained in an LCS is a property that is independent of the choice of coordinates, and hence cannot depend of the observer. As a consequence, LCSs are subject to the basic [[Material objectivity|objectivity (material frame-indifference)]]  requirement of continuum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Haller2015/&gt;  The objectivity of LCSs requires them to be invariant with respect to all possible observer changes, i.e., linear coordinate changes of the form

:: &lt;math&gt;

x=Q(t)y+b(t),

&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y\in{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the transformed coordinates; &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary   &lt;math&gt;3\times 3&lt;/math&gt; proper orthogonal matrix representing time-dependent rotations; and &lt;math&gt;b(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary  &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector representing time-dependent translations. As a consequence, any self-consistent LCS definition or criterion should be expressible in terms of quantities that are frame-invariant.  For instance,  the [[Strain rate tensor|strain rate]] &lt;math&gt;S(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; and the spin tensor &lt;math&gt;W(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; defined as

:: &lt;math&gt;

S(x,t)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla v(x,t)+ (\nabla v(x,t))^T\right),\qquad W(x,t)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla v(x,t)- (\nabla v(x,t))^T\right),

&lt;/math&gt;

transform under Euclidean changes of frame into the quantities

: &lt;math&gt;

{\tilde S}(y,t)=Q(t)^TS(x,t)Q(t),\qquad {\tilde W}(y,t)=Q(t)^TS(x,t)Q(t)-Q(t)^T{\dot Q}(t).

&lt;/math&gt;

A Euclidean frame change is, therefore, equivalent to a [[Matrix similarity|similarity transform]] for  &lt;math&gt;S(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;, and hence an LCS approach depending only on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;S(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2001b&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1403336| title = Lagrangian structures and the rate of strain in a partition of two-dimensional turbulence| journal = Physics of Fluids| volume = 13| issue = 11| pages = 3365| year = 2001| last1 = Haller | first1 = G.| bibcode = 2001PhFl...13.3365H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2005&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0022112004002526| title = An objective definition of a vortex| journal = Journal of Fluid Mechanics| volume = 525| pages = 1| year = 2005| last1 = Haller | first1 = G.| bibcode = 2005JFM...525....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt; is automatically frame-invariant. In contrast, an LCS approach depending on the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;W(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is generally not frame-invariant.

A number of frame-independent quantities, such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla v(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{W}(y,t)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\nabla F^t_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;, as well as the averages or eigenvalues of these quantities, are routinely used in heuristic LCS detection. While such quantities may effectively mark features of the instantaneous velocity field &lt;math&gt;v(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;, the ability of these quantities to capture material mixing, transport, and coherence is limited and a priori unknown in any given frame. As an example, consider the linear unsteady fluid particle motion&lt;ref name=Haller2015 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;

{\dot x}=v(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix} \sin{4t} &amp;2+\cos{4t}\\
-2+\cos{4t}&amp; -\sin{4t}
\end{pmatrix}x,

&lt;/math&gt;

which is an exact solution of the two-dimensional [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. The  (frame-dependent) Okubo-Weiss criterion classifies the whole domain in this flow as elliptic (vortical) because &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{1}{2}( {\vert S\vert}^2-{\vert W \vert}^2)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; holds, with &lt;math&gt;\vert\,\cdot \,\vert&lt;/math&gt; referring to the Euclidean matrix norm.  As seen in Fig. 3,  however, trajectories grow exponentially along a rotating line and shrink exponentially along another rotating line.&lt;ref name=Haller2015 /&gt; In material terms, therefore, the flow is hyperbolic (saddle-type) in any frame.

[[File:Vortex advection.jpg|600px|center|thumb|Figure 3: Instantaneous streamlines and the evolution of trajectories starting from the interior of one of them in a linear solution of the Navier–Stokes equation. This dynamical system is classified as elliptic by a number of frame-dependent coherence diagnostics, such as the Okubo–Weiss criterion. (Image: Francisco Beron-Vera)]]

Since [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's 2nd Law|Newton’s equation]] for particle motion and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for fluid motion are well known to be frame-dependent, it might first seem counterintuitive to require frame-invariance for LCSs, which are composed of solutions of these frame-dependent equations. Recall, however, that the Newton and Navier–Stokes equations represent objective physical principles for '''material particle trajectories'''. As long as correctly transformed from one frame to the other, these equations generate physically the same material trajectories in the new frame. In fact, we decide how to transform the equations of motion from an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-frame to a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-frame through a coordinate change  &lt;math&gt;x=Q(t)y+b(t)&lt;/math&gt; precisely by upholding that trajectories are mapped into trajectories, i.e., by requiring  &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Q(t)y(t)+b(t)&lt;/math&gt; to hold for all times. Temporal differentiation of this identity and substitution into the original equation in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-frame then yields the transformed equation in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-frame. While this process adds new terms (inertial forces) to the equations of motion, these inertial terms arise precisely to ensure the invariance of material trajectories. Fully composed of material trajectories, LCSs remain invariant in the transformed equation of motion defined in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-frame of reference. Consequently, any self-consistent LCS definition or detection method must also be frame-invariant.

== Hyperbolic LCSs ==
[[File:Attracting repelling LCS.jpeg|300px|right|thumb|Figure 4. Attracting and repelling LCSs in the extended phase space of a two-dimensional dynamical system.]]

Motivated by the above discussion, the simplest way to define an '''attracting LCS''' is by requiring it to be a locally strongest attracting material surface in the extended [[phase space]] &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal P} \times {\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; (see. Fig. 4) . Similarly, a '''repelling LCS''' can be defined as a locally strongest repelling material surface. Attracting and repelling LCSs together are usually referred to as '''hyperbolic LCSs''',&lt;ref name=Haller&amp;Yuan2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2015 /&gt; as they provide a finite-time genearalization of the classic concept of [[normally hyperbolic invariant manifold]]s in [[dynamical systems]].

=== Diagnostic approach: Finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) ridges ===

Heuristically, one may seek initial positions &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal M}(t_0 )&lt;/math&gt; of repelling LCSs as set of initial conditions at which infinitesimal perturbations to trajectories starting from &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal M}(t_0 )&lt;/math&gt; grow locally at the highest rate relative to trajectories starting off of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t_0 )&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Haller&amp;Yuan2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00199-8| title = Distinguished material surfaces and coherent structures in three-dimensional fluid flows| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 149| issue = 4| pages = 248| year = 2001| last1 = Haller | first1 = G.| bibcode = 2001PhyD..149..248H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heuristic element here is that instead of constructing a highly repelling material surface,  one simply seeks points of large particle separation. Such a separation may well be due to strong shear along the set of points so identified; this set is not at all guaranteed to exert any normal repulsion on nearby trajectories.

The growth of an infinitesimal perturbation &lt;math&gt;{\xi}(t)&lt;/math&gt; along a trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t,t_0 ,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is governed by the flow map gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla F^t_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;. Let  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon{\xi}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; be a small perturbation to the initial condition &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, and with &lt;math&gt;{\xi}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; denoting an arbitrary unit vector in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. This perturbation generally grows along the trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t,t_0 ,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; into the perturbation vector  &lt;math&gt;{\xi}_\epsilon(t_1;x_0)= \nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0)\epsilon{\xi}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the maximum relative stretching of infinitesimal perturbations at the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\delta^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0) &amp; =\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\frac{1}{\epsilon}\max_{\left|\xi(t_{0})\right|=1}\left|\xi_{\epsilon}(t_{1};x_{0})\right| \\
&amp; = \max_{\left|\xi(t_{0})\right|=1}\sqrt{\left\langle \nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\xi(t_{0}),\nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\xi(t_{0})\right\rangle } \\
&amp; = \max_{\left|\xi(t_{0})\right|=1}\sqrt{\left\langle \xi(t_{0}),C_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\xi(t_{0})\right\rangle } \\
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;C^{t_1}_{t_0}=\left[ \nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\right]^T\nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Finite strain theory#The Right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor|right Cauchy–Green strain tensor]]. One then concludes&lt;ref name="Haller&amp;Yuan2000"/&gt; that the maximum relative stretching experienced along a trajectory starting from &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is just  &lt;math&gt; \delta^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0)=\sqrt{\lambda_n (x_0)} &lt;/math&gt;. As this relative stretching tends to grow rapidly, it is more convenient to work with its growth exponent &lt;math&gt; (\log{\delta^{t_1}_{t_0 }})/(t_1-t_0)&lt;/math&gt;, which is then precisely the finite-time [[Lyapunov exponent]] (FTLE)

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})=\frac{1}{2(t_{1}-t_{0})}\log\lambda_{n}(x_{0}).
 &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Skeleton turbulence.png|400px|right|thumb|Figure 5a. Attracting (red) and repelling (blue)  LCSs extracted as FTLE ridges from a two-dimensional turbulence experiment (Image: Manikandan Mathur)&lt;ref name=Mathur2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mathur | first1 = M. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | last3 = Peacock | first3 = T. | last4 = Ruppert-Felsot | first4 = J. | last5 = Swinney | first5 = H. | title = Uncovering the Lagrangian Skeleton of Turbulence | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.144502 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 98 | issue = 14 | pages = 144502 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17501277| pmc = |bibcode = 2007PhRvL..98n4502M }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Therefore, one expects hyperbolic LCSs to appear as codimension-one local maximizing surfaces (or ''[[ridge]]s'') of the FTLE field.&lt;ref name="Haller&amp;Yuan2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2002&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1477449| title = Lagrangian coherent structures from approximate velocity data| journal = Physics of Fluids| volume = 14| issue = 6| pages = 1851| year = 2002| last1 = Haller | first1 = G.| bibcode = 2002PhFl...14.1851H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This expectation turns out to be justified in the majority of cases: time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; positions of repelling LCSs are marked by ridges of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt;. By applying the same argument in backward time,
we obtain that time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; positions of attracting LCSs are marked by ridges of the backward FTLE field &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{1}}^{t_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The classic way of computing [[Lyapunov exponent]]s is solving a linear differential equation for the linearized flow map &lt;math&gt;\nabla F^{t}_{t_0}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. A more expedient approach is to compute the FTLE field from a simple finite-difference approximation to the deformation gradient.&lt;ref name="Haller&amp;Yuan2000"/&gt;
For example, in a three-dimenisonal flow, we launch a trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t;t_0,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; from any element &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; of a grid of initial conditions. Using the coordinate representation &lt;math&gt;x=(x^1,x^2,x^3)&lt;/math&gt; for the evolving trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t;t_0,x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, we approximate the gradient of the flow map as
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t}(x_{0})\approx
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\delta_{1})-x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\delta_{1})}{\left|2\delta_{1}\right|} &amp; \frac{x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\delta_{2})-x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\delta_{2})}{\left|2\delta_{2}\right|} &amp; \frac{x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}+\delta_{3})-x^{1}(t;t_{0},x_{0}-\delta_{3})}{\left|2\delta_{3}\right|}\\

====Issues with inferring hyperbolic LCSs from FTLE ridges====

FTLE ridges have proven to be a simple and efficient tool for the visualize hyperbolic LCSs in a number of physical problems, yielding intriguing images of initial positions of hyperbolic LCSs in different applications  (see, e.g., Figs. 5a-b).  However,  FTLE ridges obtained over sliding time windows  &lt;math&gt; [t_{0}+T,t_{1}+T]&lt;/math&gt;  do not form material surfaces. Thus, ridges of  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}+T}^{t_{1}+T}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; under varying &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; cannot be used to  ''define'' Lagrangian objects, such as hyperbolic LCSs. Indeed, a locally strongest repelling material surface over &lt;math&gt;[t_{0},t_{1}]&lt;/math&gt; will generally not play the same role over &lt;math&gt;[t_{0}+T,t_{1}+T]&lt;/math&gt; and hence its evolving position at time &lt;math&gt;t_0+T&lt;/math&gt; will not be a ridge for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FTLE}_{t_{0}+T}^{t_{1}+T}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Local variational approach: Shrink and stretch surfaces ===
The local variational theory of hyperbolic LCSs builds on their original definition as strongest repelling or repelling material surfaces in the flow over the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0,t_1]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Haller&amp;Yuan2000"/&gt; At an initial point &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; , let &lt;math&gt;n_{0} &lt;/math&gt;
denote a unit normal to an initial material surface &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(t_{0})&lt;/math&gt; (cf. Fig. 6). By the invariance of material lines, the [[tangent space]]  &lt;math&gt;T_{x_0}\mathcal{M}(t_{0})&lt;/math&gt;  is mapped into the [[tangent space]] of  &lt;math&gt;T_{x_1}\mathcal{M}(t_{1})&lt;/math&gt;
by the linearized flow map &lt;math&gt;\nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, the image of the normal &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; normal under &lt;math&gt;\nabla F_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; generally does not remain normal to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(t_{1})&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, in addition to a normal component of length &lt;math&gt;\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0,}n_{0})&lt;/math&gt;, the advected normal also develops a tangential component of length &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0})&lt;/math&gt; (cf. Fig. 7).

[[File:Localvari.jpeg|500px|center|thumb|Figure 7. Linearized flow geometry along an evolving material surface.]]

If &lt;math&gt; \rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0})&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then the evolving material surface &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(t)&lt;/math&gt; strictly repels nearby trajectories by the end of the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0,t_1]&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0})&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;
signals that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(t)&lt;/math&gt; strictly attracts nearby trajectories along its normal directions.  A '''repelling (attracting) LCS''' over the interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0,t_1]&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as a material surface &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(t)&lt;/math&gt; whose net repulsion &lt;math&gt;\rho^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_{0},n_{0})&lt;/math&gt; is pointwise maximal (minimal) with respect to perturbations
of the initial normal vector field &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. As earlier, we refer to repelling and attracting LCSs collectively as '''hyperbolic LCSs'''.&lt;ref name="Haller&amp;Yuan2000"/&gt;

Solving these local extremum principles for hyperbolic LCSs in two and three dimensions yields unit normal vector fields to which hyperbolic LCSs should everywhere be tangent.&lt;ref name=Farazmand2012b&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2011.09.013| title = Erratum and addendum to "A variational theory of hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures" [Physica D 240 (2011) 574–598]| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 241| issue = 4| pages = 439| year = 2012| last1 = Farazmand | first1 = M. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | bibcode = 2012PhyD..241..439F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farazmand2013&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3690153| title = Computing Lagrangian coherent structures from their variational theory| journal = Chaos: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science| volume = 22| pages = 013128| year = 2012| last1 = Farazmand | first1 = M. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | bibcode = 2012Chaos..22a3128F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blazevski2014&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2014.01.007| title = Hyperbolic and elliptic transport barriers in three-dimensional unsteady flows| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 273-274| pages = 46| year = 2014| last1 = Blazevski | first1 = D. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | bibcode = 2014PhyD..273...46B|arxiv = 1306.6497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of such normal surfaces also requires a [[Frobenius theorem (differential topology)|Frobenius-type integrability condition]]  in the three-dimensional case.

Repelling LCSs are obtained as most repelling shrink lines, starting from local maxima of &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 (x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Attracting LCSs are obtained as most attracting stretch lines, starting from local minima of &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 (x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. These starting points serve are initial positions of exceptional saddle-type trajectories in the flow.  An example of the local variational computation of a repelling LCS is shown in FIg. 8. The computational algorithm is available in LCS Tool.

In 3D flows, instead of solving the Frobenius PDE (see table above)  for hyperbolic LCSs, an easier approach is to construct intersections of hyperbolic LCSs with select 2D planes, and fit a surface numerically to a large number of such intersection curves. Let us denote the unit normal of a 2D plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n_\Pi&lt;/math&gt;. The intersection curve of a 2D repelling LCS surface with the plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is normal to both &lt;math&gt;n_\Pi&lt;/math&gt; and to the unit normal &lt;math&gt;\xi_3(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; of the LCS. As a consequence, an intersection curve &lt;math&gt;x_0(s)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the ODE

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{\prime}_0 =\xi_3(x_{0})\times n_\Pi,
&lt;/math&gt;

whose trajectories we refer to as '''reduced shrink lines'''.&lt;ref name=Blazevski2014/&gt; (Strictly speaking, this equation is not an ordinary differential equation, given that its right-hand side is not a vector field, but a direction field, which is generally not globally orientable).  Intersections of hyperbolic LCSs with &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; are fastest contracting reduced shrink lines. Determining such shrink lines in a smooth family of nearby &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; planes, then fitting a surface to the curve family so obtained yields a numerical approximation of a 2D repelling LCS.&lt;ref name=Blazevski2014/&gt;

=== Global variational approach: Shrink- and stretchlines as null-geodesics ===

A general material surface experiences shear and strain in its deformation, both of which depend continuously on initial conditions by the continuity of the map &lt;math&gt; F^t_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
The averaged strain and shear within a strip of &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal O}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close material lines, therefore, typically show &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal O}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; variation within such a strip.
The two-dimensional '''geodesic theory of LCSs''' seeks exceptionally coherent locations where this general trend fails, resulting in an order of magnitude smaller variability in shear or strain than what is normally expected across an &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal O}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; strip. Specifically, the geodesic theory searches for LCSs as special material lines around which &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal O}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; material strips show no &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal O}(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; variability either in the material-line
averaged shear ('''Shearless LCSs''') or in the material-line averaged strain ('''Strainless''' or '''Elliptic LCSs'''). Such LCSs turn out to be null-geodesics of appropriate [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensors]] defined by the deformation field—hence the name of this theory.

Shearless LCSs are found to be [[Geodesics in general relativity|null-geodesics]] of a [[Lorentzian metric]] tensor &lt;math&gt;D_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; defined as&lt;ref name=Farazmand2014&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2014.03.008| title = Shearless transport barriers in unsteady two-dimensional flows and maps| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 278-279| pages = 44| year = 2014| last1 = Farazmand | first1 = M. | last2 = Blazevski | first2 = D. | last3 = Haller | first3 = G. | bibcode = 2014PhyD..278...44F|arxiv = 1308.6136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})=\frac{1}{2}\left[C_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\Omega-\Omega C_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(x_{0})\right],\qquad \Omega=

\begin{pmatrix}
0  &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
.
&lt;/math&gt;

Such null-geodesics can be proven to be tensorlines of the Cauchy–Green strain tensor, i.e., are tangent to the direction field formed by the strain eigenvector fields &lt;math&gt;\xi_i(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Farazmand2014 /&gt; Specifically, '''repelling LCSs''' are trajectories of &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{\prime}=\xi_{1}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; starting from local maxima of the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; eigenvalue field. Similarly,  '''attracting LCSs''' are trajectories of &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{\prime}=\xi_{2}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; starting from local minims of the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; eigenvalue field. This agrees with the conclusion of the local variational theory of LCSs. The geodesic approach, however, also sheds more light on the robustness of hyperbolic LCSs: hyperbolic LCSs only prevail as stationary curves of the averaged shear functional under variations that leave their endpoints fixed. This is to be contrasted with parabolic LCSs (see below), which are also shearless LCSs but prevail as stationary curves to the shear functional even under arbitrary variations. As a consequence, individual trajectories are objective, and statements about the coherent structures they form should also be objective.

A sample application is shown in Fig. 9, where the sudden appearance of a hyperbolic core (strongest attracting part of a stretchline) within the oil spill caused the ''notable Tiger-Tail instability'' in the shape of the oil spill.

== Elliptic LCSs ==

Elliptc LCSs are closed and nested material surfaces that act as building blocks of the Lagrangian equivalents of vortices, i.e., rotation-dominated regions of trajectories that generally traverse the phase space without substantial stretching or folding. They mimic the behavior of [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) tori]]  that form elliptic regions is [[Hamiltonian system]]s. There coherence can be approached either through their homogeneous material rotation or through their homogeneous stretching properties.

=== Rotational coherence from the polar rotation angle (PRA) ===

As a simplest approach to rotational coherence, one may define an '''elliptic LCS''' as a tubular material surface along which small material volumes complete the same net rotation over the time intervall &lt;math&gt;[t_0 ,t_1]&lt;/math&gt; of interest.&lt;ref name=Farazmand2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Mohammad|last2=Haller|first2=George|title=Polar rotation angle identifies elliptic islands in unsteady dynamical systems|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|date=2016|volume=315|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.physd.2015.09.007|arxiv = 1503.05970 |bibcode = 2016PhyD..315....1F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A challenge in that in each material volume element, all individual material fibers (tangent vectors to trajectories) perform different rotations.

To obtain a well-defined bulk rotation for each material element, one may employ the unique left and right [[polar decomposition]]s of the flow gradient in the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}=R^{t_1}_{t_0}U^{t_1}_{t_0}=V^{t_1}_{t_0}R^{t_1}_{t_0},
&lt;/math&gt;
where the proper orthogonal tensor &lt;math&gt;R^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Finite strain theory#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|rotation tensor]] and the symmetric, positive definite tensors &lt;math&gt;U^{t_1}_{t_0},V^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[Finite strain theory#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|left stretch tensor]] and [[Finite strain theory#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|right stretch tensor]], respectively.

Since the Cauchy–Green strain tensor can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
C^{t_1}_{t_0}=[\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}]^T\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}=U^{t_1}_{t_0}U^{t_1}_{t_0}=V^{t_1}_{t_0}V^{t_1}_{t_0},
&lt;/math&gt;
the local material straining described by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;C^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; are fully captured by the singular values and singular vectors of the stretch tensors. The remaining factor in the deformation gradient is represented by &lt;math&gt;R^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;, interpreted as the bulk solid-body rotation component of volume elements. In planar motions, this rotation is defined relative to the normal of the plane. In three dimensions, the rotation is defined relative to the axis defined by the eigenvector of &lt;math&gt;R^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to its unit eigenvalue. In higher-dimensional flows, the rotation tensor cannot be viewed as a rotation about a single axis.

In two and three dimensions, therefore, there exists a '''polar rotation angle (PRA) '''  &lt;math&gt;\theta_{t_{0}}^{t_1}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; that characterises the material rotation generated by &lt;math&gt;R^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; for a volume element centered at the initial condition &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. This PRA is well-defined up to multiples of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. For two-dimensional flows, the PRA can be computed from the invariants of &lt;math&gt;C^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; using the formulas&lt;ref name=Farazmand2016 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cos\theta_{t_{0}}^{t_1}&amp;=\frac{\langle \xi_{i},\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\xi_{i}\rangle }{\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}},\quad i=1\,\,or\,\,\,2,\\
\sin\theta_{t_{0}}^{t_1}&amp;=\left(-1\right)^{j}\frac{\langle \xi_{i},\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\xi_{j}\rangle }{\sqrt{\lambda_{j}}},\qquad (i,j)=(1,2)\,\,or\,\,(2,1),\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which yield a four-quadrant version of the PRA via the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}=\left[1-{\rm sign\,}\left(\sin\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}\right)\right]\pi+{\rm sign\,}\left(\sin\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}\right)\cos^{-1}\left(\cos\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

For three-dimensional flows, the PRA can again be computed from the invariants of &lt;math&gt;C^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; from the formulas&lt;ref name=Farazmand2016 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cos\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{3}\frac{\left\langle \xi_{i},\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\xi_{i}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}}-1\right),\\
\sin\theta_{t_{0}}^{t} &amp;=\frac{\left\langle \xi_{i},\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\xi_{j}\right\rangle -\left\langle \xi_{j},\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\xi_{i}\right\rangle }{2\epsilon_{ijk}e_{k}},\qquad i\neq j,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]],  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}=\left\{ e_{k}\right\} &lt;/math&gt; is the eigenvector corresponding to the unit eigenvector of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\left[K_{t_{0}}^{t}\right]_{jk}=\left\langle \xi_{j},\nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}\xi_{k}\right\rangle/{\sqrt{\lambda_{k}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The time  &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; positions of elliptic LCSs are visualized as tubular level sets of the PRA distribution &lt;math&gt;\theta_{t_{0}}^{t}&lt;/math&gt;. In two-dimensions,  therefore, (polar) elliptic LCSs are simply closed level curves of the PRA, which turn out to be objective.&lt;ref name=Farazmand2016 /&gt; In three dimensions, (polar) elliptic LCSs are toroidal or cylindrical level surfaces of the PRA, which are, however, not objective and hence will generally change in rotating frames. Coherent Lagrangian vortex boundaries can be visualized as outermost members of nested families of elliptic LCSs. Two- and three-dimensional examples of elliptic LCS revealed by tubular level surfaces of the PRA are shown in Fig. 10a-b.

=== Rotational coherence from the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation (LAVD) ===

The level sets of the PRA are objective in two dimensions but not in three dimensions. An additional shortcoming of the polar rotation tensor is its dynamical inconsistency:  polar rotations computed over adjacent sub-intervals of a total deformation do not sum up to the rotation computed for the full-time interval of the same deformation.&lt;ref name="Haller2016a"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dynamic rotation and stretch tensors from a dynamic polar decomposition|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509615301988|doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2015.10.002|last1=Haller|first1=George|arxiv = 1510.05367 |bibcode = 2016JMPSo..86...70H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, while &lt;math&gt; R_{t_{0}}^{t_1} &lt;/math&gt; is the closest rotation tensor to &lt;math&gt; \nabla F^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;  in the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm over a fixed time interval &lt;math&gt; [t_0,t_1] &lt;/math&gt;, these piecewise best fits do not form a family of rigid-body rotations as &lt;math&gt; t_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;,t_1&lt;/math&gt; are varied.

An alternative to the classic polar decomposition provides a resolution to both the non-objectivity and the dynamic inconsistency issue. Specifically, the Dynamic Polar Decomposition (DPD)&lt;ref name=Haller2016a /&gt; of the deformation gradient is also of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla F^{t}_{t_0}=O_{t_{0}}^{t}M_{t_{0}}^{t}=N_{t_{0}}^{t}O_{t_{0}}^{t},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the proper orthogonal tensor &lt;math&gt;O^{t}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Finite strain theory#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|dynamic rotation tensor]] and the non-singular tensors &lt;math&gt;M^{t}_{t_0},N^{t}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Finite strain theory#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|left dynamic stretch tensor]] and [[Finite strain theory#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|right dynamic stretch tensor]], respectively. Just as the classic polar decomposition, the DPD is valid in any finite dimension. Unlike the classic polar decomposition, however, the dynamic rotation and stretch tensors are obtained from solving linear differential equations, rather than from matrix manipulations. In particular, &lt;math&gt; O_{t_{0}}^{t}=\nabla_{a_{0}}a(t)&lt;/math&gt;  is the deformation gradient of the purely rotational flow

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{a}=W\left(x(t;x_{0}),t\right)a,
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; M_{t_{0}}^{t}=\nabla_{b_{0}}b(t)&lt;/math&gt;  is the deformation gradient of the purely straining flow

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{b}=O_{t}^{t_{0}}S\left(x(t;x_{0}),t\right)O_{t_{0}}^{t}b.
&lt;/math&gt;.

The dynamic rotation tensor &lt;math&gt;O_{t_{0}}^{t}&lt;/math&gt; can further be factorized into two deformation gradients: one for a spatially uniform (rigid-body) rotation, and one that deviates from this uniform rotation:

:&lt;math&gt;
O_{t_{0}}^{t}=\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}\Theta_{t_{0}}^{t}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As a spatially independent rigid-body rotation, the proper orthogonal relative rotation tensor &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}=\partial_{\alpha_{0}}\alpha(t)&lt;/math&gt; is dynamically consistent, serving as the deformation gradient of the relative rotation flow

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\alpha}=\left[W\left(x(t;x_{0}),t\right)-\bar{W}\left(t\right)\right]\alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, the proper orthogonal mean rotation tensor &lt;math&gt;\Theta_{t_{0}}^{t}=D_{\beta_{0}}\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the deformation gradient of the mean-rotation flow

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\beta}=\Phi_{t}^{t_{0}}\bar{W}\left(t\right)\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}\beta.
&lt;/math&gt;
The dynamic consistency of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}&lt;/math&gt; implies that the total angle swept by  &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{t_{0}}^{t}&lt;/math&gt; around its own axis of rotation is dynamically consistent. This '''intrinsic rotation angle''' &lt;math&gt;\psi_{t_{0}}^{t}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; is also objective, and turns out to equal to one half of the '''Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation''' ('''LAVD''').&lt;ref name=Haller2016b /&gt; The LAVD is defined as the trajectory-averaged magnitude of the deviation of the vorticity from its spatial mean. With the vorticity &lt;math&gt; \omega (x,t)=\nabla\times v(x,t) &lt;/math&gt; and its spatial mean

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\omega}(t)=\frac{\int_{U(t)}\omega(x,t)\,dV}{\mathrm{vol}\,(U(t))},
&lt;/math&gt;
the LAVD over a time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0,t_1]&lt;/math&gt; therefore takes the form&lt;ref name=Haller2016b /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{LAVD}_{t_{0}}^{t_1}(x_{0}):=\int_{t_{0}}^{t_1}\left|\omega(x(s;x_{0}),s)-\bar{\omega}(s)\right|\,ds,
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt; denoting the (possibly time-varying) domain of definition of the velocity field &lt;math&gt; v(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;. This result applies both in two-  and three dimensions, and enables the computation of a well-defined, objective and dynamically consistent material rotation angle along any trajectory.

]]

Outermost complex tubular level curves of the LAVD define initial positions of rotationally coherent material vortex boundaries in two-dimensional unsteady flows (see Fig. 11a). By construction, these boundaries may exhibit transverse filamentation, but any developing filament keeps rotating with the boundary, without global transverse departure form the material vortex. (Exceptions are inviscid flows where such a global departure of LAVD level surfaces from a vortex is possible as fluid elements preserve their material rotation rate for all times&lt;ref name=Haller2016b /&gt;). Remarkably, centers of rotationally coherent vortices (defined by local maxima of the LAVD field) can be proven to be the observed centers of attraction or repulsion for finite-size (inertial) particle motion in geophysical flows (see Fig. 11b).&lt;ref name=Haller2016b /&gt; In three-dimensional flows, tubular level surfaces of the LAVD define initial positions of two-dimensional eddy boundary surfaces  (see Fig. 11c) that remain rotationally coherent over a time intcenter|erval &lt;math&gt; [t_0,t_1]&lt;/math&gt; (see Fig. 11d).

=== Stretching-based coherence from a local variational approach: Shear surfaces ===

The local variational theory of elliptic LCSs targets material surfaces that locally maximize material shear over the finite time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0,t_1]&lt;/math&gt; of interest. This means that at initial point each point &lt;math&gt;x_0\in{\mathcal M}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; of an elliptic LCS &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the tangent space &lt;math&gt;T_{x_0}{\mathcal M}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the plane along which the local Lagrangian shear &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is maximal (cf. Fig 7).

Introducing the two-dimensional shear vector field

:&lt;math&gt;
\eta^{\pm}(x_{0}):=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-1}{\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\xi_{1}(x_{0})\pm\sqrt{\frac{1-\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}{\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\xi_{2}(x_{0}),
&lt;/math&gt;

and the three-dimensional shear normal vector field

:&lt;math&gt;n_{\pm}(x_{0})=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}{\sqrt{\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}+\sqrt{\lambda_{3}(x_{0})}}}\xi_{1}(x_{0})\pm\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{\lambda_{3}(x_{0})}}{\sqrt{\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}+\sqrt{\lambda_{3}(x_{0})}}}\xi_{3}(x_{0}),
&lt;/math&gt;

the criteria for two- and three-dimensional elliptic LCSs can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=Blazevski2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller&amp;Beron-Vera2012&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2012.06.012| title = Geodesic theory of transport barriers in two-dimensional flows| journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena| volume = 241| issue = 20| pages = 1680| year = 2012| last1 = Haller | first1 = G. | last2 = Beron-Vera | first2 = F.

|}

For 3D flows, as in the case of hyperbolic LCSs, solving the Frobenius PDE can be avoided. Instead, one can construct intersections of a tubular elliptic LCS with select 2D planes, and fit a surface numerically to a large number of these intersection curves. As for hyperbolic LCSs above, let us denote the unit normal of a 2D plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n_\Pi&lt;/math&gt;. Again, the intersection curves of elliptic LCSs with the plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; are normal to both &lt;math&gt;n_\Pi&lt;/math&gt; and to the unit normal &lt;math&gt;n_{\pm}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt; of the LCS. As a consequence, an intersection curve &lt;math&gt;x_0(s)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the reduced shear ODE

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{\prime}_0 =n_{\pm}(x_{0})\times n_\Pi,
&lt;/math&gt;

whose trajectories we refer to as '''reduced shear lines'''.&lt;ref name=Blazevski2014/&gt; (Strictly speaking, the reduced shear ODE is not an ordinary differential equation, given that its right-hand side is not a vector field, but a direction field, which is generally not globally orientable).  Intersections of tubular elliptic LCSs with &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; are limit cycles of the reduced shear ODE. Determining such limit cycles in a smooth family of nearby &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; planes, then fitting a surface to the limit cycle family yields a numerical approximation for 2D shear surface. A three-dimensional example of this local variational computation of an elliptic LCS is shown in Fig. 11.&lt;ref name=Blazevski2014/&gt;

[[File:Wikipedia image 2.png|370px|right|thumb|Figure 13.

As noted above under hyperbolic LCSs, a global variational approach has been developed in two dimensions to capture elliptic LCSs as closed stationary curves of the material-line-averaged Lagrangian strain functional.&lt;ref name=Haller2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller&amp;Beron-Vera2013&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/jfm.2013.391| title = Coherent Lagrangian vortices: The black holes of turbulence| journal = Journal of Fluid Mechanics| volume = 731| pages = R4| year = 2013| last1 = Haller | first1 = G.| last2 = Beron-Vera | first2 = F. J.| bibcode = 2013JFM...731R...4H|arxiv = 1308.2352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such curves turn out to be closed null-geodesics of the generalized Green–Lagrange strain tensor family &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(C^{t_1}_{t_0}-\lambda I)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a positive parameter (Lagrange multiplier). The closed null-geodesics can be shown to coincide with limit cycles of the family of direction fields

&lt;math&gt;
\eta^{\pm}_\lambda(x_{0}):=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\lambda^2}{\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\xi_{1}(x_{0})\pm\sqrt{\frac{\lambda^2-\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}{\lambda_{2}(x_{0})-\lambda_{1}(x_{0})}}\xi_{2}(x_{0}),
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for &lt;math&gt;\lambda =1&lt;/math&gt;, the direction field  &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\pm}_\lambda(x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the direction field &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\pm}(x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; for shearlines obtained above from the local variational theory of LCSs.

Trajectories of &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\pm}_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are referred to as &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-lines. Remarkably, they are initial positions of material lines that are ''infinitesimally uniformly stretching'' under the flow map &lt;math&gt;F^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, any subset of a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-line is stretched by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; between the times &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Parabolic LCSs''' are shearless material surfaces that delineate cores of jet-type sets of trajectories. Such LCSs are characterized by both low stretching (because they are inside a non-stretching structure), but also by low shearing (because material shearing is minimal in jet cores).

=== Diagnostic approach: Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) trenches ===

Since both shearing and stretching are as low as possible along a parabolic LCS, one may seek initial positions of such material surfaces as [[trench]]es of the FTLE field &lt;math&gt;FTLE^{t_1}_{t_0}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Beron-Vera2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3271342| title = Invariant-tori-like Lagrangian coherent structures in geophysical flows| journal = Chaos: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science| volume = 20| pages = 017514| year = 2010| last1 = Beron-Vera | first1 = F.

=== Global variational approach: Heteroclinic chains of null-geodesics ===

In two dimensions, parabolic LCSs are also solutions of the global shearless variational principle described above for hyperbolic LCSs.&lt;ref name=Farazmand2014/&gt;  As such, parabolic LCSs are composed of shrink lines and stretch lines that represent geodesics of the [[Lorentzian metric|Lorentzian]] [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;D^{t_1}_{t_0}&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast to hyperbolic LCSs, however, parabolic LCSs satisfy more robust boundary conditions: they remain stationary curves of the material-line-averaged shear functional even under variations to their endpoints. This explains the high degree of robustness and observability that jet cores exhibit in mixing. This is to be contrasted with the highly sensitive and fading footprint of hyperbolic LCSs away from strongly hyperbolic regions in diffusive tracer patterns.

Under variable endpoint boundary conditions, initial positions of parabolic LCSs turn out to be alternating chains of shrink lines and stretch lines that connect singularities of these line fields.&lt;ref name=Haller2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farazmand2014/&gt; These singularities occur at points where  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(x_0)=\lambda_2(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, and hence no infinitesimal deformation takes place between the two time instances  &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;. Fig. 14b shows an example of parabolic LCSs in Jupiter's atmosphere, located using this variational theory.&lt;ref name=Hadjighasem&amp;Haller2016/&gt; The chevron-type shapes forming out of circular material blobs positioned along the jet core is characteristic of tracer deformation near parabolic LCSs.

[[File:Triangular grid graph.svg|thumb|Triangular grid graph]]
A '''lattice graph''', '''mesh graph''', or '''grid graph''', is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose [[graph drawing|drawing]], [[Embedding|embedded]] in some [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, forms a [[regular tiling]]. This implies that the [[group (algebra)|group]] of [[Bijection|bijective transformation]]s that send the graph to itself is a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in the [[Group theory|group-theoretical sense]].

Typically, no clear distinction is made between such a graph in the more abstract sense of [[graph theory]], and its drawing in space (often the plane or 3D space). This type of graph may more shortly be called just a '''lattice''', '''mesh''', or '''grid'''. Moreover, these terms are also commonly used for a finite section of the infinite graph, as in "an 8×8 square grid".

The term '''lattice graph''' has also been given in the literature to various other kinds of graphs with some regular structure, such as the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of a number of [[complete graph]]s.&lt;ref name= weiss-lg&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=LatticeGraph|title=Lattice graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Square grid graph==
A common type of a lattice graph (known under different names, such as '''square grid graph''') is the graph whose vertices correspond to the points in the plane with integer coordinates, x-coordinates being in the range 1,..., n, y-coordinates being in the range 1,..., m, and two vertices are connected by an edge whenever the corresponding points are at distance 1. In other words, it is a [[unit distance graph]] for the described point set.&lt;ref name= weiss-gg/&gt;

===Properties===
A square grid graph  is a [[Cartesian product of graphs]], namely, of two [[path graph]]s with {{tmath|n - 1}} and {{tmath|m - 1}} edges.&lt;ref name= weiss-gg/&gt; Since a path graph is a [[median graph]], the latter fact implies that the square grid graph is also a median graph. All grid graphs are [[bipartite graph|bipartite]], which is easily verified by the fact that one can color the vertices in a checkerboard fashion.

A path graph may also be considered to be a grid graph on the grid ''n'' times 1. A 2x2 grid graph is a [[cycle graph|4-cycle]].&lt;ref name= weiss-gg&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=GridGraph|title=Grid graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every [[planar graph]] ''H'' is a [[Graph minor|minor]] of the ''h''×''h''-grid, where &lt;math&gt;h = 2|V(H)| + 4|E(H)|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=N.|last2=Seymour|first2=P.|last3=Thomas|first3=R.|title=Quickly Excluding a Planar Graph|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B|date=November 1994|volume=62|issue=2|pages=323–348|doi=10.1006/jctb.1994.1073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other kinds==

A '''triangular grid graph''' is a graph that corresponds to a triangular grid.

A [[Hanan grid]] graph for a finite set of points in the plane is produced by the grid obtained by intersections of all vertical and horizontal lines through each point of the set.

The [[rook's graph]] (the graph that represents all legal moves of the [[Rook (chess)|rook]] [[chess piece]] on a [[chessboard]]) is also sometimes called the '''lattice graph'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7425">A '''leading zero''' is any [[0 (number)|0]] [[numerical digit|digit]] that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in [[positional notation]].&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{citation|title=The Chicago Guide to Writing about Numbers|first=Jane E.|last=Miller|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2008|isbn=9780226526324|page=276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arV2jdWdo9cC&amp;pg=PA276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Bond]]'s famous identifier, 007, has two leading zeros.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Microsoft C: programming for the IBM|first=Robert W.|last=Lafore|authorlink=Robert Lafore|publisher=H.W. Sams|year=1987|page=294|isbn=9780672225154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When leading zeros occupy the most significant digits of an [[integer]], they could be left [[Space (punctuation)|blank]] or omitted for the same numeric value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Basic Math and Pre-Algebra Workbook For Dummies|first=Mark|last=Zegarelli|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781118828304|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SS_4AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the usual [[decimal]] notation of [[integer]]s does not use leading zeros except for the [[0 (number)|zero itself]], which would be denoted as an [[empty string]] otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tcl/Tk: A Developer's Guide|first=Clif|last=Flynt|publisher=Elsevier|year=2012|isbn=9780123847171|pages=752–753|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlzh-xMPYD4C&amp;pg=PA753}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[decimal fraction]]s strictly between −1 and 1, the leading zeros digits between the [[decimal point]] and the first nonzero digit are necessary for conveying the magnitude of a number and cannot be omitted,&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt; while [[Trailing zero|trailing zeroes]] – zeroes occurring after the decimal point and after the last nonzero digit – can be omitted without changing the meaning.

== Occurrence ==
Often, leading zeros are found on non-electronic [[digital display]]s or on such electronic ones as [[seven-segment display]]s, that contain fixed sets of digits. These devices include manual counters, [[stopwatch]]es,&lt;ref name="hfc"&gt;{{citation|title=Head First C#|first1=Jennifer|last1=Greene|first2=Andrew|last2=Stellman|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781449358884|page=770|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mcWDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA770}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[odometer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Digital Electronics|first1=Robert|last1=Dueck|first2=Ken|last2=Reid|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9781133708964|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZYJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[digital clock]]s.&lt;ref name="hfc"/&gt; Leading zeros are also generated by many older computer programs when creating values to assign to new records, accounts and other files, and as such are likely to be used by utility billing systems, human resources information systems and government databases. Many [[digital camera]]s and other electronic media recording devices use leading zeros when creating and saving new files to make names of the equal length.

Leading zeros also present whenever the number of digits is technically fixed (such as in a [[memory register]]), but the stored value is not large enough to result in a non-zero [[most significant digit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The digital information age: an introduction to electrical engineering|first=Roman|last=Kuc|page=67|publisher=PWS Pub. Co.|year=1999|isbn=9780534953157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[count leading zeros]] operation efficiently determines the number of leading zero [[bit]]s in a [[machine word]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Guide to RISC Processors: for Programmers and Engineers|first=Sivarama P.|last=Dandamudi|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9780387274461|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6aVptEpdGkC&amp;pg=PA139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading zero appears in [[roulette]] in the United States, where "00" is distinct from "0" (a wager on "0" will not win if the ball lands in "00", and vice versa). Sports where competitors are numbered follow this as well; a [[stock car]] numbered "07" would be considered distinct from one numbered "7". [[Benito Santiago]], a [[Major League Baseball]] catcher who wore the number 09 for several years, is the only [[major professional sports league]] player to use a [[squad number|jersey number]] with a leading zero, not counting several who have worn the number 00. This is most common with single-digit numbers.

== Advantages ==
;Collation
Leading zeros are used to make ascending order of numbers correspond with [[Collation#Issues with numbers|alphabetical order]]: e.g., 11 comes alphabetically before 2, but after 02. (See, e.g., [[ISO 8601]].) This does not work with [[negative number]]s, though, whether leading zeroes are used or not: &amp;minus;23 comes alphabetically after &amp;minus;01, &amp;minus;1, and &amp;minus;22, although it is less than all of them. 

; Error prevention
Leading zeros in a sentence also make it less likely that a careless reader will overlook the decimal point. For example, in modern [[pharmacy]] there is a widely followed convention that leading zeros must not be omitted from any [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|dose]] or dosage value in [[prescription drug|drug prescribing]]. Likewise, just as leading zeros are mandatory, [[trailing zero]]s are forbidden. In both cases, the reason is the same: to prevent misreading and the resultant misdose by one or several [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]].

; Fraud prevention
Leading zeros can also be used to prevent fraud by filling in character positions that might normally be empty. For example, adding leading zeros to the amount of a [[cheque|check]] (or similar financial document) makes it more difficult for fraudsters to alter the amount of the check before presenting it for payment.

== 0 as a prefix ==
{{see also|Octal #In computers|Data types}}
A prefix &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is used in [[C (programming language)|C]] to specify string representations of [[octal]] numbers, as required by the [[ANSI C]] standard for the "strtol" function (the '''str'''ing '''to''' '''l'''ong integer converter) in the "stdlib.h" library. Many other programming languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python 2]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], and the Unix shell [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]] also follow this specification for converting strings to numbers. As an example, "&lt;code&gt;0020&lt;/code&gt;" does not represent 20&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ('''2'''×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + '''0'''×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), but rather 20&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 16&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ('''2'''×8&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ '''0'''×8&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= '''1'''×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ '''6'''×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;). Decimal numbers written with leading zeros will be interpreted as octal by languages that follow this convention and will generate errors (not just unexpected results) if they contain "8" or "9", since these digits do not exist in octal. This behavior can be quite a nuisance when working with sequences of strings with embedded, zero-padded [[decimal]] numbers (typically file names) to facilitate alphabetical sorting (see above) or when validating inputs from users who would not know that adding a leading zero triggers this base conversion.

'''Model-based specification''' is an approach to [[formal specification]] where the system specification is expressed as a [[system model|system state model]]. This state model is constructed using well-understood mathematical entities such as sets and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. System operations are specified by defining how they affect the state of the system model.

The most widely used notations for developing model-based specifications are [[VDM specification language|VDM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Another well-known approach to formal specification is [[algebraic specification]].

'''Natascha Artin Brunswick''', née '''Jasny''' (June 11, 1909 – February 3, 2003) was a German-American [[mathematician]] and [[photographer]].

== St. Petersburg and Hamburg ==
Natascha Artin Brunswick was the daughter of {{ill|Naum Jasny|ru|Ясный, Наум Михайлович}}, a Russian Jewish [[economist]] from [[Kharkiv]]. Her mother was a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian orthodox]] [[aristocrat]] and [[dentist]]. Since at the time Russian orthodox Christians were prohibited from marrying Jews, she converted to [[Protestantism]]. They were married in [[Finland]].

Naum Jasny was an adherent of the [[Mensheviks]] and fled to [[Tbilisi]] after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. Natascha, her sister, and her mother followed in 1920. After the [[Bolsheviks]] took control of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the family lived in [[Austria]] from 1922 to 1924, for a brief period in 1924 in [[Berlin]], and finally moved to [[Langenhorn, Hamburg]], where they remained until 1937. Natascha Jasny attended the [[Progressive education|progressive]] [[Lichtwark school]]. While still in school, she photographed with a simple [[box camera]] and processed her own pictures in the bathroom at home, which served as a makeshift [[darkroom]].

Natascha graduated in 1928. She hoped to study [[architecture]] at the [[Bauhaus#Dessau|Bauhaus Dessau]], but the family's financial situation made this impossible. She instead studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Hamburg]], where she also took courses in [[art history]] from [[Aby Warburg]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]]. She graduated from the university in 1930 with a [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] degree.

On August 29, 1929 she married her mathematics professor [[Emil Artin]], who had been teaching in Hamburg since 1923. In 1933, the Artins had a daughter, Karin, and in 1934 a son, [[Michael Artin|Michael]].

Because his wife was half Jewish, Emil Artin was forced into early retirement from his teaching position under the [[National Socialist|Nazi Party]] [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]]. On September 27, 1934, Artin already had to sign a declaration that his wife was not "[[Aryan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zum Gedenken an Emil Artin|journal=Hamburger Universitätsreden, Neue Folge|volume=9|page=30|url=http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2008/57/pdf/HamburgUP_HUR09_Artin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artin family managed to leave Germany for the [[United States]] on October 21, 1937. Since they were prohibited from taking larger sums of money with them, the Artins shipped their entire household, which reflected their modernist sensibilities.

== Life in the United States ==
Natascha's husband first obtained a teaching position at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and in 1938 moved to [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. The Artins had their third child, son Thomas (Tom), in 1938. During [[World War II]], Natascha Artin was classified an [[enemy alien]]. The [[United States Army]] nevertheless hired her in 1942 to teach Russian to soldiers under [[Army Specialized Training Program]] at Indiana University.

In 1946, Emil was hired by [[Princeton University]], and the Artins moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. They divorced in 1958, after which Emil Artin returned to Hamburg. Natasha Artin remarried in 1960. Her second husband was [[composer]] [[Mark Brunswick]].

Artin Brunswick returned to Hamburg as an official guest of the [[Hamburg|City of Hamburg]] in 1998, on the occasion of Emil Artin's 100th birthday. She lived in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] until her death in 2003.

== Work as a mathematician ==
After her move to Princeton, Natascha Artin joined the group around [[Richard Courant]] at the mathematics department of [[New York University]]. She became the technical editor of the journal ''[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]],'' founded at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] in 1948, and in 1956 became the primary translation editor for the journal ''[[Theory of Probability and Its Applications]],'' a position she held until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Louis Nirenberg|title = In Memoriam: Natascha Artin Brunswick, Editor Emeritus| journal = Theory of Probability &amp; Its Applications| volume = 47|issue = 2| pages = 189|year = 2003| doi = 10.1137/TPRBAU000047000002000189000001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of her long-standing membership of over 50 years, she was made an Honorary Member of the [[American Mathematical Society]].

== Work as photographer ==
Artin Brunswick never saw herself as a professional photographer. She considered it a "private passion, nevertheless, it was a bit more than just taking snapshots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salomon|first1=Bettina|title=Warum diese Fotos im Schrank nichts verloren haben. "Hamburg – wie ich es sah": Das Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe zeigt historische Aufnahmen von Natascha Brunswick|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article463700/Warum-diese-Fotos-im-Schrank-nichts-verloren-haben.html|work=Die Welt|date=July 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After they married in 1929, Emil Artin, who shared her passion for photography, gave her a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] compact camera. She was encouraged in her photography by the painter [[Heinrich Stegemann]], a family friend. She first took pictures of family members, friends, and landscapes, but later explored [[Hamburg]] and photographed scenes such as the  [[Port of Hamburg]], the [[Jungfernstieg]], and the main [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|railway station]]. She was particularly interested in architecture, and, influenced by the ideas of the [[Bauhaus]], preferred clear, bright lines in her photographs.

As she was classified an [[enemy alien]] during [[World War II]], her camera was provisionally confiscated by police in 1942. By the time it was returned to her, she had lost her passion for photography. Her prints from the time in Hamburg, however, survived through her emigration. Her son Tom rediscovered them about forty years later in a cabinet.  He recognized their importance and contacted galleries in Hamburg. Artin Brunswick's photographs were first shown at the ''Kunstgenuss'' gallery in [[Hamburg-Eppendorf]] in 1999.  In 2001, the  [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg|Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]] organized an exhibition of 227 original prints under the title ''Hamburg, As I Saw It. Photographs from the 1920s and 30s.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-first=Natascha A.|author1-last=Brunswick|editor1-last=Phillip|editor1-first=Claudia G.|title=Hamburg – wie ich es sah: Photographien aus den zwanziger und dreißiger Jahren|date=2001|publisher=Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe|location=Hamburg|isbn=3-923859-51-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her advanced age of 91 years, Natascha Brunswick took the trip from New York to attend the opening. The museum now holds 230 original prints; the negatives are in the possession of the Artin family.

==Extensions==

[[standard example]]

The relationship between partial and total cyclic orders is more complex than the relationship between partial and total linear orders. To begin with, not every partial cyclic order can be extended to a total cyclic order. An example is the following relation on the first thirteen letters of the alphabet: {''acd, bde, cef, dfg, egh, fha, gac, hcb''} ∪ {''abi, cij, bjk, ikl, jlm, kma, lab, mbc''} ∪ {''hcm, bhm''}. This relation is a partial cyclic order, but it cannot be extended with either ''abc'' or ''cba''; either attempt would result in a contradiction.{{sfn|Megiddo|1976|pp=274–275}}

The above was a relatively mild example. One can also construct partial cyclic orders with higher-order obstructions such that, for example, any 15 triples can be added but the 16th cannot. In fact, cyclic ordering is [[NP-complete]], since it solves [[3SAT]]. This is in stark contrast with the recognition problem for linear orders, which can be solved in [[linear time]].{{sfn|Megiddo|1976|pp=275–276}}{{sfn|Galil|Megiddo|1977|p=179}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4480">In [[mathematics]], a '''positive harmonic function''' on the [[unit disc]] in the [[complex numbers]] is characterized  as the [[Poisson integral]] of a finite [[positive measure]] on the circle. This result, the ''Herglotz representation theorem'', was proved by [[Gustav Herglotz]] in 1911. It can be used to give a related formula and characterization for any [[holomorphic function]] on the unit disc with positive real part. Such functions had already been characterized in 1907 by [[Constantin Carathéodory]] in terms of the [[Positive definite function on a group|positive definiteness]] of their [[Taylor coefficient]]s.

==Herglotz representation theorem for harmonic functions==
A positive function ''f'' on the unit disk with ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is harmonic if and only if there is a [[probability measure]] μ on the unit circle such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(re^{i\theta})=\int_0^{2\pi}  {1-r^2\over 1-2r\cos (\theta-\varphi) + r^2} \, d\mu(\varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

The formula clearly defines a positive harmonic function with ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

Conversely if ''f'' is positive and harmonic and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; increases to&amp;nbsp;1, define

:&lt;math&gt; f_n(z)=f(r_nz). \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt; f_n(re^{i\theta}) = {1\over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} {1-r^2\over 1-2r\cos(\theta-\varphi) + r^2 }\, f_n(\varphi)\,d\phi =\int_0^{2\pi}{1-r^2\over 1-2r\cos(\theta-\varphi) + r^2 } d\mu_n(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; d\mu_n(\varphi)={1\over 2\pi} f(r_n e^{i\varphi})\,d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

is a probability measure.

By a compactness argument (or equivalently in this case
[[Helly's selection theorem]] for [[Stieltjes integral]]s), a subsequence of these probability measures has a weak limit which is also a probability measure μ.

Since ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; increases to 1, so that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') tends to ''f''(''z''), the Herglotz formula follows.

==Herglotz representation theorem for holomorphic functions==
A holomorphic function ''f'' on the unit disk with ''f''(0) = 1 has positive real part if and only if there is a probability measure μ on the unit circle such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(z) =\int_0^{2\pi} {1 + e^{-i\theta}z\over 1 -e^{-i\theta}z} \,  d\mu(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from the previous theorem because:

* the Poisson kernel is the real part of the integrand above 
* the real part of a holomorphic function is harmonic and determines the holomorphic function up to addition of a scalar
* the above formula defines a holomorphic function, the real part of which is given by the previous theorem

==Carathéodory's positivity criterion for holomorphic functions==
Let

:&lt;math&gt; f(z)=1 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

be a holomorphic function on the unit disk. Then ''f''(''z'') has positive real part on the disk
if and only if

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_m\sum_n a_{m-n} \lambda_m\overline{\lambda_n} \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

for any complex numbers λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt; a_0=2,\,\,\, a_{-m} =\overline{a_m}&lt;/math&gt;
 
for ''m'' &gt; 0.

In fact from the Herglotz representation for ''n'' &gt; 0

:&lt;math&gt; a_n =2\int_0^{2\pi} e^{-in\theta}\, d\mu(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_m\sum_n a_{m-n} \lambda_m\overline{\lambda_n} =\int_0^{2\pi} \left|\sum_{n} \lambda_n e^{-in\theta}\right|^2 \, d\mu(\theta) \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, setting λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{m-n} \lambda_m\overline{\lambda_n} = 2(1-|z|^2) \,\Re\, f(z).&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Procrustes transformation''' is a geometric transformation that involves only [[translation (geometry)|translation]], [[rotation]], [[uniform scaling]], or a [[Function composition|combination]] of these [[Linear transformation|transformations]]. Hence, it may change the size, but not the [[shape]] of a geometric object.

Named after the mythical Greek robber, [[Procrustes]], who made his victims fit his bed either by stretching their limbs or cutting them off.

{{General geometry |concepts}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''Pythagorean theorem''', also known as '''Pythagoras' theorem''', is a fundamental relation in [[Euclidean geometry]] among the three sides of a [[right triangle]]. It states that the square of the [[hypotenuse]] (the side opposite the [[right angle]]) is equal to the sum of the squares of the [[Cathetus|other two sides]]. The [[theorem]] can be written as an [[equation]] relating the lengths of the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', often called the "Pythagorean equation":&lt;ref name="Sally0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Roots to research: a vertical development of mathematical problems |author1=Judith D.

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' represents the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the triangle's other two sides.

Although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him,&lt;ref name=Pos /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 --&gt;[[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] and [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematicians]] all discovered the theorem independently and, in some cases, provided proofs for special cases.

The theorem has been given numerous [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s{{spndash}}possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. They are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but ''n''-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.

==Pythagorean proof==
[[File:Pythagoras-proof-anim.svg|thumb|The Pythagorean proof (click to view animation)]]The Pythagorean theorem was known long before Pythagoras, but he may well have been the first to prove it.&lt;ref name=Pos&gt;Posamentier, Alfred. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fHFuCkSrfysC&amp;pg=PA23 The Pythagorean Theorem: The Story of Its Power and Beauty]'', p. 23 (Prometheus Books 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the proof attributed to him is very simple, and is called a proof by rearrangement.

The two large squares shown in the figure each contain four identical triangles, and the only difference between the two large squares is that the triangles are arranged differently. Therefore, the white space within each of the two large squares must have equal area. Equating the area of the white space yields the Pythagorean theorem, [[Q.E.D.]]&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Donald. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&amp;pg=PA172 The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies]'', pp. 172–173 (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

That Pythagoras originated this very simple proof is sometimes inferred from the writings of the later Greek philosopher and mathematician [[Proclus]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA63 The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History]'', p. 61 (Princeton University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Several other proofs of this theorem are described below, but this is known as the Pythagorean one.

==Other forms of the theorem==
If ''c'' denotes the [[length]] of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' denote the lengths of the other two sides, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:
: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
If the length of both ''a'' and ''b'' are known, then ''c'' can be calculated as
: &lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
If the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' and of one side (''a'' or ''b'') are known, then the length of the other side can be calculated as
: &lt;math&gt;a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} &lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
The Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum.

A generalization of this theorem is the [[law of cosines]], which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them. If the angle between the other sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation.

==Other proofs of the theorem==
This theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] being another contender for that distinction); the book ''The Pythagorean Proposition'' contains 370 proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Loomis|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof using similar triangles===
[[File:Pythagoras similar triangles simplified.svg|thumb|Proof using similar triangles]]
This proof is based on the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of the sides of two [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangles, that is, upon the fact that the [[ratio]] of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.

Let ''ABC'' represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at ''C'', as shown on the figure. Draw the [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]] from point ''C'', and call ''H'' its intersection with the side ''AB''. Point ''H'' divides the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' into parts ''d'' and ''e''. The new triangle ''ACH'' is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to triangle ''ABC'', because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at ''A'', meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as ''θ'' in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle ''CBH'' is also similar to ''ABC''. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the [[triangle postulate]]: the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]]. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{BC}{AB}=\frac{BH}{BC} \text{ and } \frac{AC}{AB}=\frac{AH}{AC}.&lt;/math&gt;
The first result equates the [[cosine]]s of the angles ''θ'', whereas the second result equates their [[sine]]s.

These ratios can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;BC^2 = AB \times BH \text{ and } AC^2=AB \times AH. &lt;/math&gt;
Summing these two equalities results in
:&lt;math&gt;BC^2+AC^2=AB\times BH+AB\times AH=AB\times(AH+BH)=AB^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
which, after simplification, expresses the Pythagorean theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;BC^2+AC^2=AB^2 \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the ''Elements'', and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Maor|2007| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22why+did+Euclid+choose+this+particular+proof%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WckoTLv4JIKknQecwvWoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22why%20did%20Euclid%20choose%20this%20particular%20proof%22&amp;f=false  39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;

This proof first appeared after a computer program was set to check Euclidean proofs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euclid's proof===
[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|thumb|Proof in Euclid's ''Elements'']]
In outline, here is how the proof in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]], proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.

Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a right triangle, with a right angle at ''A''. Drop a perpendicular from ''A'' to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.

For the formal proof, we require four elementary [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmata]]:
# If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent ([[side angle side|side-angle-side]]).
# The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.
# The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.
# The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).

Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.slu.edu/classes/maymk/GeoGebra/Pythagoras.html Pythagorean theorem by shear mapping], Saint Louis University website Java applet&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem3.svg|thumb|Showing the two congruent triangles of half the area of rectangle BDLK and square BAGF]]
The proof is as follows:
#Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.
#On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.&lt;ref name=Gullberg&gt;

{{cite book |title=Mathematics: from the birth of numbers |author=Jan Gullberg |page=435 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E09fBi9StpQC&amp;pg=PA435 |isbn=0-393-04002-X |year=1997 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
#From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.
#Join CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.
#Angles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are [[Line (geometry)#Collinear points|collinear]]. Similarly for B, A, and H.
#Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.
#Since AB is equal to FB and BD is equal to BC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC.
#Since A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2)
#Since C is collinear with A and G, square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC.
#Therefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Similarly, it can be shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Adding these two results, AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + AC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = BD × BK + KL × KC
#Since BD = KL, BD × BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC
#Therefore, AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + AC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = BC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, since CBDE is a square.

This proof, which appears in Euclid's ''Elements'' as that of Proposition&amp;nbsp;47 in Book&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0085:book=1:proposition=47 Elements 1.47] by Euclid. Retrieved 19 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pythagoras&gt;The proof by Pythagoras probably was not a general one, as the theory of proportions was developed only two centuries after Pythagoras; see {{Harv |Maor|2007 |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proofs by dissection and rearrangement===
We have already discussed the Pythagorean proof, which was a proof by rearrangement. The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}}, containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; uncovered, the second of which leaves square ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

A second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, from four identical right triangles with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides ''a'' and ''b'' by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which must have the same area as the initial large square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#10 |title= Pythagorean theorem, proof number 10|author=[[Alexander Bogomolny]] |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called [[dissection problem|dissection]]. This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones.&lt;ref name=specifics&gt;{{Harv|Loomis|1968|loc= Geometric proof 22 and Figure 123| page= 113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement===
[[File:Altitude of a right triangle.svg|thumb|Right triangle on the hypotenuse dissected into two similar right triangles on the legs, according to Einstein's proof]]
[[Albert Einstein]] gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces need not get moved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schroeder |first=Manfred Robert |title=Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise |publisher= Courier Corporation |year=2012|pages=3–4|isbn=0486134784|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see [[#Similar figures on the three sides]]).  In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.  Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle.  Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.

===Algebraic proofs===

The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', arranged inside a square with side ''c'' as in the top half of the diagram.&lt;ref name=rotate&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The triangles are similar with area &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12ab&lt;/math&gt;, while the small square has side {{nowrap|''b'' − ''a''}} and area {{nowrap|(''b'' − ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The area of the large square is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;(b-a)^2+4\frac{ab}{2} = (b-a)^2+2ab = b^2-2ab+a^2+2ab = a^2+b^2. &lt;/math&gt;

But this is a square with side ''c'' and area ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2. &lt;/math&gt;

A similar proof uses four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side ''c'', as shown in the lower part of the diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#4 |title=Cut-the-knot.org: Pythagorean theorem and its many proofs, Proof #4 |author=Alexander Bogomolny |date= |work=Cut the Knot |publisher= |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a larger square, with side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} and area {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The four triangles and the square side ''c'' must have the same area as the larger square,

:&lt;math&gt;(b+a)^2 = c^2 + 4\frac{ab}{2} = c^2+2ab,&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 = (b+a)^2 - 2ab = b^2+2ab+a^2-2ab = a^2 + b^2.&lt;/math&gt;

A related proof was published by future U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] (then a [[U.S. Representative]]).&lt;ref name=Garfield&gt;Published in a weekly mathematics column: {{cite journal |journal=The New England Journal of Education|title=Pons Asinorum |volume=3|issue=14 |page=161 |year=1876 |author=James A Garfield |ref=harv|url=http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-james-a-garfields-proof-of-the-pythagorean-theorem}} as noted in {{cite book |title=The mathematical universe: An alphabetical journey through the great proofs, problems, and personalities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3tG_FRQ9N1QC&amp;cd=1&amp;dq=%22mathematical+universe%22+inauthor%3AWilliam+inauthor%3ADunham&amp;q=New+England+Journal#search_anchor |author=William Dunham |year=1997 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-17661-3 |page=96}} and in [http://www.math.usma.edu/people/rickey/hm/Dates/April.pdf A calendar of mathematical dates: April 1, 1876] by V.

The [[trapezoid#Area|area of the trapezoid]] can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(b+a)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result.

===Proof using differentials===
One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing [[calculus]].&lt;ref name="Staring"&gt;

{{cite journal |author= Bruce C. Berndt |title= Ramanujan – 100 years old (fashioned) or 100 years new (fangled)? |journal= The Mathematical Intelligencer |volume= 10 |pages= 24 |year= 1988 |doi=10.1007/BF03026638 |ref= harv |issue= 3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The triangle ''ABC'' is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with ''BC'' the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length ''y'', the side ''AC'' of length ''x'' and the side ''AB'' of length ''a'', as seen in the lower diagram part.

[[File:Pythag differential proof.svg|thumb|Diagram for differential proof]]
If ''x'' is increased by a small amount ''dx'' by extending the side ''AC'' slightly to ''D'', then ''y'' also increases by ''dy''. These form two sides of a triangle, ''CDE'', which (with ''E'' chosen so ''CE'' is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to ''ABC''. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac xy.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;y \, dy=x \, dx&lt;/math&gt; , which is a [[differential equation]] that can be solved by direct integration:
:&lt;math&gt;\int y \, dy=\int x \, dx\,,&lt;/math&gt;
giving
:&lt;math&gt;y^2=x^2+C.&lt;/math&gt;
The constant can be deduced from ''x'' = 0, ''y'' = ''a'' to give the equation
:&lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^2 + a^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of ''dx'' and ''dy''.

==Converse==
The [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of the theorem is also true:&lt;ref name=Sally1&gt;

{{cite book |title= Roots to Research |author1=Judith D. Sally |author2=Paul J. Sally Jr. |pages = 54–55 |chapter=Theorem 2.4 (Converse of the Pythagorean theorem). |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHxBw-WlECUC&amp;pg=PA54 | publisher= [[American Mathematical Society]]
|isbn=0-8218-4403-2 |date=2007-12-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For any three positive numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, there exists a triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An alternative statement is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For any triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', if {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,}} then the angle between ''a'' and ''b'' measures 90°.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This converse also appears in Euclid's ''Elements'' (Book I, Proposition 48):&lt;ref&gt;
[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI48.html Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 48] From [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html D.E. Joyce's web page] at Clark University
&lt;/ref&gt; {{blockquote|text="If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right."}}

It can be proven using the [[law of cosines]] or as follows:

Let ''ABC'' be a triangle with side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', with {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.}} Construct a second triangle with sides of length ''a'' and ''b'' containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length ''c'' = {{radic|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', the triangles are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' in the original triangle is a right angle.

The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proven without assuming the Pythagorean theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Stephen, "The converse of the theorem of Pythagoras", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 92, July 2008, 309–313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Douglas W., "Feedback on 92.47", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 93, March 2009, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[corollary]] of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let ''c'' be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b'' &gt; ''c''}} (otherwise there is no triangle according to the [[triangle inequality]]). The following statements apply:&lt;ref name=Wilczynski&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* If {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,}} then the [[Right triangle|triangle is right]].
* If {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,}} then the [[Acute Triangle|triangle is acute]].

[[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] has stated this proposition about acute, right, and obtuse triangles in this language:

where ''α'' is the angle opposite to side ''a'', ''β'' is the angle opposite to side ''b'', ''γ'' is the angle opposite to side ''c'', and sgn is the [[sign function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD975.html|title=On the theorem of Pythagoras|first= Edsger W.|last=Dijkstra|authorlink=Edsger W.

==Consequences and uses of the theorem==

===Pythagorean triples===
{{Main article|Pythagorean triple}}
A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', such that {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.}} In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths.&lt;ref name=Sally0/&gt; Such a triple is commonly written {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'').}} Some well-known examples are {{nowrap|(3, 4, 5)}} and {{nowrap|(5, 12, 13).}}

A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are [[coprime]] (the [[greatest common divisor]] of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' is 1).

The following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100:
&lt;!-- Please don't add NON-PRIMITIVE Pythagorean triples to this list such as (6,8,10) or (15,20,25) or (10,24,26). --&gt;

:(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97)

===Incommensurable lengths===
[[File:Euclid Corollary 5.svg|thumb|The [[spiral of Theodorus]]: A construction for line segments with lengths whose ratios are the square root of a positive integer]]
One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] (so the ratio of which is not a [[rational number]]) can be constructed using a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|straightedge and compass]]. Pythagoras's theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the [[square root]] operation.

The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer.&lt;ref name=Euclid_5&gt;{{cite book |title=The Elements of Euclid: with many additional propositions, and explanatory notes, to which is prefixed an introductory essay on logic |first=Henry |last=Law |publisher=John Weale |year=1853 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ssb_OnVOGLgC&amp;pg=PA49 |page=49 |chapter=Corollary 5 of Proposition XLVII (''Pythagoras's Theorem'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each triangle has a side (labeled "1") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras's theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as {{radical|2}}, {{radical|3}}, {{radical|5}}&amp;nbsp;. For more detail, see [[Quadratic irrational]].

Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit.&lt;ref name=Lavine0&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to one legend, [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]] (''ca.'' 470&amp;nbsp;B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable.&lt;ref name=drown&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex numbers===
[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex number ''z'' is the distance ''r'' from ''z'' to the origin]]
For any [[complex number]]
:&lt;math&gt;z = x + iy,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[absolute value]] or modulus is given by
:&lt;math&gt;r = |z|=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
So the three quantities, ''r'', ''x'' and ''y'' are related by the Pythagorean equation,
:&lt;math&gt;r^2 = x^2 + y^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that ''r'' is defined to be a positive number or zero but ''x'' and ''y'' can be negative as well as positive. Geometrically ''r'' is the distance of the ''z'' from zero or the origin ''O'' in the [[complex plane]].

This can be generalised to find the distance between two points, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; say. The required distance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;|z_1 - z_2|=\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2},&lt;/math&gt;
so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation,
:&lt;math&gt;|z_1 - z_2|^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Euclidean distance in various coordinate systems===
The distance formula in [[Cartesian coordinates]] is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.&lt;ref name=Macdonald&gt;

{{cite book |title=Mastering algorithms with Perl |author1=Jon Orwant |author2=Jarkko Hietaniemi |author3=John Macdonald |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9xMfXGoWd0C&amp;pg=PA426 |page=426 |chapter=Euclidean distance |isbn=1-56592-398-7 |year=1999 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc}}

&lt;/ref&gt; If {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the [[Euclidean distance]], is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]], the Euclidean distance between two points, &lt;math&gt;A\,=\,(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\,=\,(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined, by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If Cartesian coordinates are not used, for example, if [[polar coordinates]] are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if [[curvilinear coordinates]] are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the [[Legendre polynomials#Applications of Legendre polynomials in physics|applications of Legendre polynomials in physics]]. The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras's theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates {{nowrap|(''r'', ''θ'')}} can be introduced as:

:&lt;math&gt; x = r \cos \theta, \ y = r \sin \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Then two points with locations {{nowrap|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are separated by a distance ''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 = (r_1 \cos \theta_1 -r_2 \cos \theta_2 )^2 + (r_1 \sin \theta_1 -r_2 \sin \theta_2)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Performing the squares and combining terms, the Pythagorean formula for distance in Cartesian coordinates produces the separation in polar coordinates as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}s^2 &amp;= r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \left( \cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 +\sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 \right)\\
 &amp;= r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \cos \left( \theta_1 - \theta_2\right)\\
 &amp;=r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \cos \Delta \theta, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
using the trigonometric [[List of trigonometric identities#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|product-to-sum formulas]]. This formula is the [[#Law of cosines|law of cosines]], sometimes called the generalized Pythagorean theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; From this result, for the case where the radii to the two locations are at right angles, the enclosed angle {{nowrap|Δ''θ'' {{=}} {{pi}}/2,}} and the form corresponding to Pythagoras's theorem is regained: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2.&lt;/math&gt; The Pythagorean theorem, valid for right triangles, therefore is a special case of the more general law of cosines, valid for arbitrary triangles.

===Pythagorean trigonometric identity===
{{Main article|Pythagorean trigonometric identity}}
[[File:Trig functions.svg|thumb|Similar right triangles showing sine and cosine of angle θ]]
In a right triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and hypotenuse ''c'', [[trigonometry]] determines the [[sine]] and [[cosine]] of the angle ''θ'' between side ''a'' and the hypotenuse as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{b}{c}, \quad \cos \theta = \frac{a}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

From that it follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\cos}^2 \theta + {\sin}^2 \theta = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where the last step applies Pythagoras's theorem. This relation between sine and cosine is sometimes called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity.&lt;ref name= Leff&gt;
{{cite book |title=PreCalculus the Easy Way |author=Lawrence S. Leff |url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_7yrqrHTb4C&amp;pg=PA296 |page=296 |isbn=0-7641-2892-2 |edition=7th |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles, and depend upon the angles. Consequently, in the figure, the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin ''θ'' and adjacent side of size cos ''θ'' in units of the hypotenuse.

===Relation to the cross product===
[[File:Cross product parallelogram.svg|right|thumb|The area of a parallelogram as a cross product; vectors '''a''' and '''b''' identify a plane and {{nowrap|'''a × b'''}} is normal to this plane.]]
The Pythagorean theorem relates the [[cross product]] and [[dot product]] in a similar way:&lt;ref name=Massey&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2323537 |title=Cross products of vectors in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces |author=WS Massey |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=90 |date=Dec 1983 |pages=697–701 |jstor=2323537 |issue=10 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|^2 + (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product, as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} &amp;= ab \mathbf{n} \sin{\theta} \\
 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &amp;= ab \cos{\theta}, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with '''n''' a unit vector normal to both '''a''' and '''b'''. The relationship follows from these definitions and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.

This can also be used to define the cross product. By rearranging the following equation is obtained

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition, for example in [[seven-dimensional cross product|seven dimensions]].&lt;ref name=n_dimensions&gt;{{cite book |title=Clifford algebras and spinors |author=Pertti Lounesto |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kOsybQWDK4oC&amp;pg=PA96 |page=96 |chapter=§7.4 Cross product of two vectors |isbn=0-521-00551-5 |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2nd}}

==Generalizations==

===Similar figures on the three sides===
A generalization of the Pythagorean theorem extending beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to [[similar figures]] was known by [[Hippocrates of Chios]] in the 5th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Heath, T. L., ''A History of Greek Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 1921; reprinted by Dover, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and was included by [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'':&lt;ref name=Euclid_VI&gt;Euclid's ''Elements'': Book VI, Proposition VI 31: "In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If one erects similar figures (see [[Euclidean geometry]]) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are ''a:b:c'').&lt;ref name=Putz&gt;Putz, John F. and Sipka, Timothy A. "On generalizing the Pythagorean theorem", ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 34 (4), September 2003, pp. 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).&lt;ref name=Putz/&gt;

The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are erected on sides with corresponding lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' then:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{a^2} = \frac{B}{b^2} = \frac{C}{c^2}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow A + B = \frac{a^2}{c^2}C + \frac{b^2}{c^2}C\, .&lt;/math&gt;

But, by the Pythagorean theorem, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C''.

Conversely, if we can prove that ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle ''C'' on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (''A'' and ''B'' ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]]. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

where θ is the angle between sides ''a'' and ''b''.

When θ is 90 degrees ({{pi}}/2 radians), then cos''θ'' = 0, and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem.

&lt;/ref&gt; Lower panel: reflection of triangle ABD (top) to form triangle DBA, similar to triangle ABC (top).]]
At any selected angle of a general triangle of sides ''a, b, c'', inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base θ are the same as the selected angle. Suppose the selected angle θ is opposite the side labeled ''c''. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle ''ABD'' with angle θ opposite side ''a'' and with side ''r'' along ''c''. A second triangle is formed with angle θ opposite side ''b'' and a side with length ''s'' along ''c'', as shown in the figure. [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as:&lt;ref name=Sayii&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a^2 +b^2 =c(r+s) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
As the angle θ approaches {{pi}}/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths ''r'' and ''s'' overlap less and less. When θ = {{pi}}/2, ''ADB'' becomes a right triangle, ''r'' + ''s'' = ''c'', and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained.

One proof observes that triangle ''ABC'' has the same angles as triangle ''ABD'', but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex B, both contain the angle θ, and so also have the same third angle by the [[triangle postulate]].) Consequently, ''ABC'' is similar to the reflection of ''ABD'', the triangle ''DBA'' in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{a} = \frac{a}{r} \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise, for the reflection of the other triangle,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{b} = \frac{b}{s} \ . &lt;/math&gt;
[[Clearing fractions]] and adding these two relations:
:&lt;math&gt; cr +cs = a^2 +b^2 \ , &lt;/math&gt;
the required result.

The theorem remains valid if the angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is obtuse so the lengths ''r'' and ''s'' are non-overlapping.

===General triangles using parallelograms===
[[File:Pythagoras for scalene triangle.svg|thumb|Generalization for arbitrary triangles,&lt;br&gt;green {{nowrap|area {{=}} blue}} area]]
[[File:Pythagoras construction.svg|thumb|Construction for proof of parallelogram generalization]]
[[Pappus's area theorem]] is a further generalization, that applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares (squares are a special case, of course). The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras's theorem, and was considered a generalization by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] in 4&amp;nbsp;AD&lt;ref name=Jennings&gt;For the details of such a construction, see {{cite book |title=Modern geometry with applications: with 150 figures |author=George Jennings |chapter=Figure 1.32: The generalized Pythagorean theorem |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6OhcE7YQY8QC&amp;pg=PA23 |isbn=0-387-94222-X |year=1997 |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudi Alsina, Roger B. Nelsen: ''Charming Proofs: A Journey Into Elegant Mathematics''. MAA, 2010, {{isbn|9780883853481}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;77–78 ({{Google books|mIT5-BN_L0oC|excerpt|page=77}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base ''b'' and height ''h''. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms.

===Solid geometry===
{{main article|Solid geometry}}
[[File:Pythagoras 3D.svg|thumb|Pythagoras's theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides.]]
[[File:Tetrahedron vertfig.svg|thumb|A tetrahedron with outward facing right-angle corner]]
In terms of solid geometry, Pythagoras's theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure. The length of diagonal ''BD'' is found from Pythagoras's theorem as:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{BD}^{\,2} = \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal ''BD'' and the vertical edge ''AB'', the length of diagonal ''AD'' then is found by a second application of Pythagoras's theorem as:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BD}^{\,2} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
or, doing it all in one step:
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

This result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector '''v''' (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;} (the three mutually perpendicular sides):

:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^3 \|\mathbf{v}_k\|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras's theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.

A substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is [[de Gua's theorem]], named for [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]: If a [[tetrahedron]] has a right angle corner (like a corner of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]]), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the "''n''-dimensional Pythagorean theorem":&lt;ref name=Bhatia&gt;

{{cite book |title=Matrix analysis |author=Rajendra Bhatia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eay3HALl620C&amp;pg=PA21 |page=21 |isbn=0-387-94846-5 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|text=Let &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_n &lt;/math&gt; be orthogonal vectors in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider the ''n''-dimensional simplex ''S'' with vertices &lt;math&gt;0,x_1,\ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. (Think of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional simplex with vertices &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; not including the origin as the "hypotenuse" of ''S'' and the remaining (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional faces of ''S'' as its "legs".) Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of ''S'' is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the ''n'' legs.}}

This statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The "hypotenuse" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the "legs" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the "legs" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras's theorem applies. In a different wording:&lt;ref name=Wong&gt;

For an extended discussion of this generalization, see, for example, [http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ww278/papers/gp.pdf Willie W. Wong] 2002, ''A generalized n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem''.

===Inner product spaces===

The Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to [[inner product space]]s,&lt;ref name=van_der_Heijden&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional [[Euclidean spaces]]. For example, a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] may be considered as a [[vector space|vector]] with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in [[functional analysis]].&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;

{{cite book |title=Finite element methods: accuracy and improvement |author1=Qun Lin |author2=Jiafu Lin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMvAqzMuAWgC&amp;pg=PA23 |page=23 |isbn=7-03-016656-6 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

In an inner product space, the concept of [[perpendicular]]ity is replaced by the concept of [[orthogonal]]ity: two vectors '''v''' and '''w''' are orthogonal if their inner product &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbf{v} , \mathbf{w}\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is zero. The [[Inner product space#Definition|inner product]] is a generalization of the [[dot product]] of vectors. The dot product is called the ''standard'' inner product or the ''Euclidean'' inner product. However, other inner products are possible.&lt;ref name=Rorres&gt;

{{cite book |title=Elementary Linear Algebra: Applications Version |author1=Howard Anton |author2=Chris Rorres |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PJ-WHepeBsC&amp;pg=PA336 |page=336 |isbn=0-470-43205-5 |year=2010 |edition=10th |publisher=Wiley}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of length is replaced by the concept of the [[normed vector space|norm]] ||'''v'''|| of a vector '''v''', defined as:&lt;ref name=Saxe&gt;

{{cite book |title=Beginning functional analysis |author=Karen Saxe|authorlink= Karen Saxe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QALoZC64ea0C&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7 |chapter=Theorem 1.2 |isbn=0-387-95224-1 |year=2002 |publisher=Springer}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lVert \mathbf{v} \rVert \equiv \sqrt{\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\rangle} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In an inner-product space, the '''Pythagorean theorem''' states that for any two orthogonal vectors '''v''' and '''w''' we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 = \left\| \mathbf{v} \right\|^2 + \left\| \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
Here the vectors '''v''' and '''w''' are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] '''v'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''w'''. This form of the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the [[Inner product space#Definition|properties of the inner product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 =\langle \mathbf{ v+w},\ \mathbf{ v+w}\rangle = \langle \mathbf{ v},\ \mathbf{ v}\rangle +\langle \mathbf{ w},\ \mathbf{ w}\rangle +\langle\mathbf{ v,\ w }\rangle + \langle\mathbf{ w,\ v }\rangle \ = \left\| \mathbf{v}\right\|^2 + \left\| \mathbf{w}\right\|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where the inner products of the cross terms are zero, because of orthogonality.

A further generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in an inner product space to non-orthogonal vectors is the ''[[Parallelogram equality#Normed vector spaces satisfying the parallelogram law|parallelogram law]]'' :&lt;ref name=Saxe/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2\|\mathbf v\|^2 +2 \|\mathbf w\|^2 = \|\mathbf {v + w} \|^2 +\| \mathbf{v-w}\|^2 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which says that twice the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Any norm that satisfies this equality is ''[[ipso facto]]'' a norm corresponding to an inner product.&lt;ref name=Saxe/&gt;

{{anchor|Decomposition}}
The Pythagorean identity can be extended to sums of more than two orthogonal vectors. If '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are pairwise-orthogonal vectors in an inner-product space, then application of the Pythagorean theorem to successive pairs of these vectors (as described for 3-dimensions in the section on [[#Solid geometry|solid geometry]]) results in the equation&lt;ref name='Douglas1998'&gt;{{cite book | last = Douglas | first = Ronald G. | title = Banach Algebra Techniques in Operator Theory, 2nd edition | publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, Inc | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 60–61 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-OdfXeNmrT0C&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-387-98377-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\|\sum_{k=1}^n\mathbf{v}_k\right\|^2=\sum_{k=1}^n\|\mathbf{v}_k\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Sets of ''m''-dimensional objects in ''n''-dimensional space===

Another generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applies to [[Lebesgue-measurable]] sets of objects in any number of dimensions.  Specifically, the square of the measure of an ''m''-dimensional set of objects in one or more parallel ''m''-dimensional [[Flat (geometry)|flats]] in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] projections of the object(s) onto all ''m''-dimensional coordinate subspaces.&lt;ref name=Conant&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematical terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu^2_{ms} = \sum_{i=1}^{x}\mathbf{\mu^2}_{mp_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mu_m&lt;/math&gt; is a measure in ''m''-dimensions (a length in one dimension, an area in two dimensions, a volume in three dimensions, etc.).
* &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a set of one or more non-overlapping ''m''-dimensional objects in one or more parallel ''m''-dimensional flats in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space.
* &lt;math&gt;\mu_{ms}&lt;/math&gt; is the total measure (sum) of the set of ''m''-dimensional objects.
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; represents an ''m''-dimensional projection of the original set onto an orthogonal coordinate subspace.
* &lt;math&gt;\mu_{mp_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the measure of the ''m''-dimensional set projection onto ''m''-dimensional coordinate subspace &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  Because object projections can overlap on a coordinate subspace, the measure of each object projection in the set must be calculated individually, then measures of all projections added together to provide the total measure for the set of projections on the given coordinate subspace.
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of orthogonal, ''m''-dimensional coordinate subspaces in ''n''-dimensional space ({{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}) onto which the ''m''-dimensional objects are projected (''m'' ≤ ''n''):

===Non-Euclidean geometry===

&lt;/ref&gt;)
In other words, in non-Euclidean geometry, the relation between the sides of a triangle must necessarily take a non-Pythagorean form. For example, in [[spherical geometry]], all three sides of the right triangle (say ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'') bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to {{pi}}/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

Here two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered—[[spherical geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane geometry]]; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines.

However, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say ''A''+''B'' = ''C''. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters ''a'' and ''b'' equals the area of the circle with diameter ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Victor Pambuccian|title=Maria Teresa Calapso's Hyperbolic Pythagorean Theorem|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=32|date=December 2010|page =2|doi=10.1007/s00283-010-9169-0|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spherical geometry====
{{main article|Spherical geometry}}
[[File:Triangle sphérique.svg|thumb|Spherical triangle]]
For any right triangle on a sphere of radius ''R'' (for example, if γ in the figure is a right angle), with sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', the relation between the sides takes the form:&lt;ref name=O&gt;
{{cite book |title=Elementary differential geometry |author=Barrett O'Neill |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OtbNXAIve_AC&amp;pg=PA441 |chapter=Exercise 4 |page=441 |isbn=0-12-088735-5 |year=2006 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cos \left(\frac{c}{R}\right)=\cos \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)\cos \left(\frac{b}{R}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be derived as a special case of the [[spherical law of cosines]] that applies to all spherical triangles:

:&lt;math&gt; \cos \left(\frac{c}{R}\right)=\cos \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)\cos \left(\frac{b}{R}\right) +\sin\left(\frac{a}{R}\right) \sin\left(\frac{b}{R}\right) \cos \gamma \ .&lt;/math&gt;

By expressing the [[Maclaurin series]] for the cosine function as an [[asymptotic expansion]] with the remainder term in [[big O notation]],

:&lt;math&gt; \cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + O(x^4) \text{ as } x \to 0\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

it can be shown that as the radius ''R'' approaches infinity and the arguments ''a/R'', ''b/R'', and ''c/R'' tend to zero, the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle approaches the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. Substituting the asymptotic expansion for each of the cosines into the spherical relation for a right triangle yields

:&lt;math&gt;1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{c}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right) = \left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right) \right]\left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{b}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right) \right] \text{ as }R\to\infty\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The constants ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''c''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; have been absorbed into the big ''O'' remainder terms since they are independent of the radius ''R''. This asymptotic relationship can be further simplified by multiplying out the bracketed quantities, cancelling the ones, multiplying through by −2, and collecting all the error terms together:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{c}{R}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right)\text{ as }R\to\infty\ .&lt;/math&gt;

After multiplying through by ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the Euclidean Pythagorean relationship ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is recovered in the limit as the radius ''R'' approaches infinity (since the remainder term tends to zero):

:&lt;math&gt;c^2= a^2 + b^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^2}\right)\text{ as }R\to\infty\ .&lt;/math&gt;

For small right triangles (''a'', ''b'' &lt;&lt; ''R''), the cosines can be eliminated to avoid [[loss of significance]], giving
:&lt;math&gt; \sin^2 \frac{c}{2R} = \sin^2 \frac{a}{2R} + \sin^2 \frac{b}{2R} - 2 \sin^2 \frac{a}{2R} \sin^2 \frac{b}{2R} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|[[Hyperbolic triangle]] ]]
In a hyperbolic space with uniform curvature −1/''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for a right triangle with legs ''a'', ''b'', and hypotenuse ''c'', the relation between the sides takes the form:&lt;ref name=Stahl&gt;

{{cite book |title=The Poincaré half-plane: a gateway to modern geometry |author=Saul Stahl |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TABicHVMQhMC&amp;pg=PA122 |chapter=Theorem 8.3| isbn=0-86720-298-X |year=1993 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cosh \frac{c}{R} = \cosh \frac{a}{R} \, \cosh \frac{b}{R} &lt;/math&gt;

where cosh is the [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic cosine]]. This formula is a special form of the [[hyperbolic law of cosines]] that applies to all hyperbolic triangles:&lt;ref name=Gilman&gt;

{{cite book |title=Two-generator discrete subgroups of PSL(2,R) |author=Jane Gilman|authorlink=Jane Piore Gilman |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YRFz9Zj_vAAC&amp;pg=PA74 |chapter=Hyperbolic triangles |isbn=0-8218-0361-1 |year=1995 |publisher=American Mathematical Society Bookstore}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cosh \frac{c}{R} = \cosh \frac{a}{R} \ \cosh \frac{b}{R} - \sinh \frac{a}{R} \ \sinh \frac{b}{R} \ \cos \gamma \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with γ the angle at the vertex opposite the side ''c''.

By using the [[Maclaurin series]] for the hyperbolic cosine, {{nowrap|cosh ''x'' ≈ 1 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2}}, it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small (that is, as ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' all approach zero), the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras's theorem.

For small right triangles (''a'', ''b'' &lt;&lt; ''R''), the hyperbolic cosines can be eliminated to avoid [[loss of significance]], giving
:&lt;math&gt; \sinh^2 \frac{c}{2R} = \sinh^2 \frac{a}{2R} + \sinh^2 \frac{b}{2R} + 2 \sinh^2 \frac{a}{2R} \sinh^2 \frac{b}{2R} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

====Very small triangles====
For any uniform curvature ''K'' (positive, zero, or negative), in very small right triangles (|''K''|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, |''K''|''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;&lt; 1) with hypotenuse ''c'', it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt; c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \frac{K}{3} a^2 b^2 - \frac{K^2}{45} a^2 b^2 (a^2 + b^2) - \frac{2 K^3}{945} a^2 b^2 (a^2 - b^2)^2 + O (K^4 c^{10}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Differential geometry===
{{main article|Differential geometry}}
[[File:Line elements2.svg|thumb|Distance between infinitesimally separated points in [[Cartesian coordinates]] (top) and [[polar coordinates]] (bottom), as given by Pythagoras's theorem]]
On an infinitesimal level, in three dimensional space, Pythagoras's theorem describes the distance between two infinitesimally separated points as:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 +dz^2,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ds'' the element of distance and (''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'') the components of the vector separating the two points. Such a space is called a [[Euclidean space]]. However, in [[Riemannian geometry]], a generalization of this expression useful for general coordinates (not just Cartesian) and general spaces (not just Euclidean) takes the form:&lt;ref name=Chow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \sum_{i,j}^n g_{ij}\, dx_i\, dx_j &lt;/math&gt;

which is called the [[Metric tensor#Arclength and the line element|metric tensor]]. (Sometimes, by abuse of language, the same term is applied to the set of coefficients {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.) It may be a function of position, and often describes [[curved space]]. A simple example is Euclidean (flat) space expressed in [[curvilinear coordinates]]. For example, in [[polar coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plimpton 322.jpg|thumb|The [[Plimpton 322|Plimpton 322 tablet]] records Pythagorean triples from Babylonian times.&lt;ref name=Neugebauer/&gt;]]
There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once, or many times in many places, and the date of first discovery is uncertain, as is the date of the first proof.  According to Joran Friberg, a historian of mathematics, evidence indicates that the Pythagorean theorem was well-known to the mathematicians of the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] (20th to 16th centuries BC), which would have been over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born, thus an example of [[Stigler's law of eponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friberg, Joran|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joeran_Friberg/publication/222892801_Methods_and_traditions_of_Babylonian_mathematics_Plimpton_322_Pythagorean_Triples_and_the_Babylonian_Triangle_Parameter_Equations/links/0deec52810c5445463000000.pdf|title=Methods and Traditions of Babylonian Mathematics|journal= Historia Mathematica|volume=8|pages=277, 306|year=1991|doi=10.1016/0315-0860(81)90069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Yale]]'s  [[Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage]]'s 3-D scan of a cuneiform tablet depicting the proof is one of their mostly widely used images.)&lt;ref name="YBC 7289, Old Babylonian Period Mathematical Text,"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2016-04-year-journey-classroom.html | title=A 3,800-year journey from classroom to classroom | publisher=Phys.org | date=2016-04-12 | accessdate=2016-04-13 | author=Lynch, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources, such as a book by [[Leon Lederman]] and [[Dick Teresi]], mention that Pythagoras discovered the theorem,&lt;ref&gt;Lederman, Leon and Teresi, Dick.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=jMOOQDHxWyIC&amp;pg=PT80 The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?], p. 80 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; although Teresi subsequently stated that the Babylonians developed the theorem "at least fifteen hundred years before Pythagoras was
born."&lt;ref&gt;Teresi, Dick.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=pheL_ubbXD0C&amp;pg=PA7 Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science – from the Babylonians to the Maya], p. 8 (Simon and Schuster 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of [[Pythagorean triples]], knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a [[right triangle]], knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system.

[[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]] (1903–1996) conjectured that Pythagorean triples were discovered [[algebra]]ically by the Babylonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|van_der_Waerden|1983|p=5}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Written between 2000 and 1786&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] [[Egypt]]ian ''[[Berlin Papyrus 6619]]'' includes a problem whose solution is the [[Pythagorean triple]] 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The [[Mesopotamia]]n tablet ''[[Plimpton 322]]'', written between 1790 and 1750&amp;nbsp;BC during the reign of [[Hammurabi]] the Great, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.

In [[India]], the ''[[Baudhayana]] [[Sulba Sutras|Sulba Sutra]]'', the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Plofker |title=Mathematics in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHvThPNp9yMC |year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-12067-6 |pages=17–18, with footnote 13 for Sutra identical to the Pythagorean theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a list of [[Pythagorean triples]] discovered algebraically, a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and a [[geometry|geometrical]] proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an [[isosceles]] right triangle.
The ''[[Apastamba]] Sulba Sutra'' (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BC) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem, using an area computation. Van der Waerden believed that "it was certainly based on earlier traditions". Carl Boyer states that the Pythagorean theorem in ''[[Shulba Sutras|Śulba-sũtram]]'' may have been influenced by ancient Mesopotamian math, but there is no conclusive evidence in favor or opposition of this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Pythagoras]], whose dates are commonly given as 569–475&amp;nbsp;BC, used algebraic methods to construct Pythagorean triples, according to [[Proclus]]'s commentary on [[Euclid]]. Proclus, however, wrote between 410 and 485&amp;nbsp;AD. According to [[T. L. Heath|Thomas L. Heath]] (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Euclid|1956|p=351}} [https://books.google.com/?id=UhgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 page 351]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when authors such as [[Plutarch]] and [[Cicero]] attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted.&lt;ref name="heath144"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heath3&gt;

An extensive discussion of the historical evidence is provided in {{Harv|Euclid|1956|p=351}} [https://books.google.com/?id=UhgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 page=351]&lt;/ref&gt; "Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, [...] one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics."&lt;ref name=Fritz/&gt;

Around 400&amp;nbsp;BC, according to Proclus, [[Plato]] gave a method for finding Pythagorean triples that combined algebra and geometry. Around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], the oldest extant [[Mathematics|axiomatic proof]] of the theorem is presented.&lt;ref name= Aaboe&gt;

''Political Analysis'', ''9''(2), 137–63. http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/137.short&lt;/ref&gt; Rare events encompass natural phenomena (major earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, asteroid impacts, solar flares, etc.), [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] hazards (warfare and related forms of violent conflict, acts of terrorism, industrial accidents, financial and commodity market crashes, etc.), as well as phenomena for which natural and anthropogenic factors interact in complex ways (epidemic disease spread, global warming-related changes in climate and weather, etc.).

==Overview==
Rare events are discrete occurrences that are statistically “improbable” in that they are very infrequently observed. Despite being statistically improbable, such events are plausible insofar as historical instances of the event (or a similar event) have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;Morio, J., Balesdent, M. (2015). ''Estimation of Rare Event Probabilities in Complex Aerospace and Other Systems''. Elsevier Science. http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780081000915&amp;pagename=search&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholarly and popular analyses of rare events often focus on those events that could be reasonably expected to have a substantial negative impact on a society—either economically&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, D. (2002). The management of losses arising from extreme events. Paper presented at General Insurance Convention. http://www.actuaries.org.uk/research-and-resources/documents/management-losses-arising-extreme-events&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of human casualties&lt;ref&gt;Clauset, A., &amp; Woodard, R. (2013). Estimating the historical and future probabilities of large terrorist events. ''Annals of Applied Statistics'',''7''(4),1838–1865. doi:10.1214/12-AOAS614. https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0089&lt;/ref&gt; (typically, both). Examples of such events might include an 8.0+ Richter magnitude earthquake, a nuclear incident that kills thousands of people, or a 10%+ single-day change in the value of a stock market index.&lt;ref&gt;Ghil, M., P. Yiou, S. Hallegatte, B. D. Malamud, P. Naveau, A. Soloviev, P. Friederichs, et al. (2011). Extreme events: Dynamics, statistics and prediction.

S., Bunde, A., Dimri,V.P., &amp; [[Daniel N. Baker|Baker,D.N.]] (2013). ''Extreme events and natural hazards: The complexity perspective''.

Bunched black (and grouped grey) swans: Dissipative and non-dissipative models of correlated extreme fluctuations in complex geosystems. ''Geophysical Research Letters'', ''40''(2), 402–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling and analysis==
Rare event modeling (REM) refers to efforts to characterize the [[statistical distribution]] parameters, generative processes, or dynamics that govern the occurrence of statistically rare events, including but not limited to high-impact natural or human-made catastrophes. Such “modeling” may include a wide range of approaches, including, most notably, statistical models derived from historical event data and computational software models that attempt to simulate rare event processes and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Embrechts, P., Klüppelberg, C., &amp; Mikosch, T. (1997). ''Modelling extremal events: For insurance and finance''. (Vol. 33). Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; REM also encompasses efforts to forecast the occurrence of similar events over some future time horizon, which may be of interest for both scholarly and applied purposes (e.g., risk mitigation and planning).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, P., &amp; Wright,G. (2010). The limits of forecasting methods in anticipating rare events. ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', ''77''(3), 355–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant data sets==
In many cases, rare and catastrophic events can be regarded as extreme-magnitude instances of more mundane phenomena. For example, seismic activity, stock market fluctuations, and acts of organized violence all occur along a continuum of extremity, with more extreme-magnitude cases being statistically infrequent.&lt;ref&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C., Newman, M.E.J. (2009). Power-law distributions in empirical data. ''SIAM Review (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications)'', ''51'',(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111. Retrieved August 29, 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, rather than viewing rare event data as its own class of information, data concerning “rare” events often exists as a subset of data within a broader parent event class (e.g., a seismic activity data set would include instances of extreme earthquakes, as well as data on much lower-intensity seismic events).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9538">[[File:Simplicial depth.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Simplicial depth with respect to the six red sample points, using the modified definition of Burr et al. The large black numbers are the depths within each region, and the small blue numbers are the depths along the blue line segments.]]
In [[robust statistics]] and [[computational geometry]], '''simplicial depth''' is a measure of [[central tendency]] determined by the [[Simplex|simplices]] that contain a given point. For the [[Euclidean plane]], it counts the number of [[triangle]]s of sample points that contain a given point.

==Definition==
The simplicial depth of a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], with respect to a set of sample points in that space, is the number of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional simplices (the [[convex hull]]s of sets of &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt; sample points) that contain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
The same notion can be generalized to any probability distribution on points of the plane, not just the [[Empirical distribution function|empirical distribution]] given by a set of sample points, by defining the depth to be the probability that a randomly chosen &lt;math&gt;(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;-tuple of points has a convex hull that {{nowrap|contains &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.}} This probability can be calculated, from the number of simplices that {{nowrap|contain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;,}} by dividing by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{d+1}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sample points.{{ran|L88}}{{ran|L90}}

Under the standard definition of simplicial depth, the simplices that have &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on their boundaries count equally much as the simplices with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in their interiors. In order to avoid some problematic behavior of this definition, {{harvtxt|Burr|Rafalin|Souvaine|2004}} proposed a modified definition of simplicial depth, in which the simplices with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on their boundaries count only half as much. Equivalently, their definition is the average of the number of open simplices and the number of closed simplices that {{nowrap|contain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.{{ran|BRS}}}}

==Properties==
Simplicial depth is robust against outliers: if a set of sample points is represented by the point of maximum depth, then up to a constant fraction of the sample points can be arbitrarily corrupted without significantly changing the location of the representative point. It is also invariant under [[affine transformation]]s of the plane.{{ran|D}}{{ran|ZS}}{{ran|BRS}}

However, simplicial depth fails to have some other desirable properties for robust measures of central tendency. When applied to centrally symmetric distributions, it is not necessarily the case that there is a unique point of maximum depth in the center of the distribution. And, along a ray from the point of maximum depth, it is not necessarily the case that the simplicial depth decreases monotonically.{{ran|ZS}}{{ran|BRS}}

==Algorithms==
For sets of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; sample points in the [[Euclidean plane]] {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt;),}}
the simplicial depth of any other point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in time {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;,{{ran|KM}}{{ran|GSW}}{{ran|RR}}}}
optimal in some models of computation.{{ran|ACG}}
In three dimensions, the same problem can be solved in time {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.{{ran|CO}}}}

It possible to construct a data structure using [[ε-net (computational geometry)|ε-nets]] that can approximate the simplicial depth of a query point (given either a fixed set of samples, or a set of samples undergoing point insertions) in near-constant time per query, in any dimension, with an approximation whose error is a small fraction of the total number of triangles determined by the samples.{{ran|BCE}} In two dimensions, a more accurate approximation algorithm is known, for which the approximation error is a small multiple of the simplicial depth itself. The same methods also lead to fast [[approximation algorithm]]s in higher dimensions.{{ran|ASS}}

[[Spherical depth]], &lt;math&gt;SphD(q; F)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the probability that a point &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is contained inside a random closed [[Ball (mathematics)|hyperball]] obtained from a pair of points from &lt;math&gt;F \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. While the time complexity of most other data depths grows exponentially, the spherical depth grows only linearly in the dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; – the straightforward algorithm for computing the spherical depth takes &lt;math&gt;O(dn^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Simplicial depth (SD) is linearly bounded by spherical depth (&lt;math&gt;SphD \ge \frac{2}{3}SD&lt;/math&gt;).{{ran|BS}}

The '''Sonkin enterprise multiple''' ('''Sonkin ratio''') was named after by [[Paul D. Sonkin]], a graduate of [[Columbia Business School]]. This ratio can be used when [[Value investing]], and can be calculated using the following formula:

Sonkin ratio = ([[market capitalization]] + debt – cash) / ([[earnings before interest and taxes]] – tax)

The Sonkin ratio is an alternative to the [[P/E ratio]] (price to earnings ratio) and represents the multiple of operating earnings an investor would pay if using the company's cash. A lower multiple means that an investor will pay less to own the after-tax operating earnings of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saville|first=Adrian|title=Why You Want That Sonkin Feeling|url=http://www.adriansaville.com/blogs/2007/why-you-want-sonkin-feeling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Sonkin Resources Page|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/paul-sonkin/|publisher=Value Walk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''Tannaka–Krein duality''' theory concerns the interaction of a [[compact group|compact]] [[topological group]] and its category of [[linear representation]]s. It is a natural extension of [[Pontryagin duality]], between compact and discrete [[commutative]] topological groups, to groups that are compact but [[noncommutative]]. The theory is named for two men, the Soviet mathematician [[Mark Grigorievich Krein]], and the Japanese [[Tadao Tannaka]]. In contrast to the case of [[commutative]] groups considered by [[Lev Pontryagin]], the notion dual to a noncommutative [[compact group]] is not a group, but a [[category of representations]] Π(''G'') with some additional structure, formed by the finite-dimensional representations of ''G''.  

Duality theorems of Tannaka and Krein describe the converse passage from the category Π(''G'') back to the group ''G'', allowing one to recover the group from its category of representations. Moreover, they in effect completely characterize all categories that can arise from a group in this fashion. [[Alexander Grothendieck]] later showed that by a similar process, Tannaka duality can be extended to the case of [[algebraic group]]s: see [[tannakian category]]. Meanwhile, the original theory of Tannaka and Krein continued to be developed and refined by [[mathematical physics|mathematical physicists]]. A generalization of Tannaka–Krein theory provides the natural framework for studying representations of [[quantum groups]], and is currently being extended to quantum [[Supergroup (physics)|supergroups]], [[quantum groupoid]]s and their dual [[Hopf algebroid]]s.

==  The idea of Tannaka–Krein duality: category of representations of a group ==
In Pontryagin duality theory for [[locally compact]] commutative groups, the dual object to a group ''G'' is its [[character group]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{G},&lt;/math&gt; which consists of its one-dimensional [[unitary representation]]s. If we allow the group ''G'' to be noncommutative, the most direct analogue of the character group is the set of equivalence classes of irreducible [[unitary representation]]s of ''G''. The analogue of the product of characters is the [[tensor product of representations]]. However, [[irreducible representation]]s of ''G'' in general fail to form a group, or even a monoid, because a tensor product of irreducible representations is not necessarily irreducible. It turns out that one needs to consider the set Π(''G'') of all finite-dimensional representations, and treat it as a [[monoidal category]], where the product is the usual tensor product of representations, and the dual object is given by the operation of the [[contragredient representation]].

A '''representation''' of the category Π(''G'') is a monoidal [[natural transformation]] from the identity functor &lt;math&gt;id_{\Pi(G)}&lt;/math&gt; to itself. In other words, it is a non-zero function φ that associates with any &lt;math&gt;T\in Ob \Pi(G)&lt;/math&gt; an endomorphism of the space of ''T'' and satisfies the conditions of compatibility with tensor products, &lt;math&gt;\phi(T\otimes U)=\phi(T)\otimes\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and with arbitrary [[intertwining operator]]s ''f:'' ''T'' → ''U'', namely, &lt;math&gt;f\circ \phi(T) = \phi(U) \circ f&lt;/math&gt;. The collection Γ(Π(''G'')) of all representations of the category Π(''G'') can be endowed with multiplication φψ(''T'') = φ(''T'') ψ(''T'') and topology, in which convergence is defined pointwise, i.e. a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_a\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to some &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_a(T)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;\phi(T)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;T\in Ob\Pi(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be shown that the set Γ(Π(''G'')) thus becomes a compact (topological) group.

== Theorems of Tannaka and Krein ==
'''Tannaka's theorem''' provides a way to reconstruct the [[compact group]] ''G'' from its category of representations Π(''G''). 

Let ''G'' be a compact group and let ''F:'' Π(''G'') → Vect&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; be the forgetful functor from finite-dimensional complex representations of ''G'' to complex finite-dimensional vector spaces. One puts a topology on the [[natural transformation]]s ''τ:'' ''F'' → ''F'' by setting it to be the coarsest topology possible such that each of the projections End(''F'') → End(''V'') given by &lt;math&gt;\tau \mapsto \tau_V&lt;/math&gt; (taking a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to its component &lt;math&gt;\tau_V&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;V \in \Pi(G)&lt;/math&gt;) is a continuous function. We say that a natural transformation is '''tensor-preserving''' if it is the identity map on the trivial representation of ''G'', and if it preserves tensor products in the sense that &lt;math&gt;\tau_{V \otimes W} = \tau_V \otimes \tau_W&lt;/math&gt;. We also say that τ is '''self-conjugate''' if &lt;math&gt;\overline{\tau} = \tau&lt;/math&gt; where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Then the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of all tensor-preserving, self-conjugate natural transformations of ''F'' is a closed subset of End(''F''), which is in fact a (compact) group whenever ''G'' is a (compact) group. Every element ''x'' of ''G'' gives rise to a tensor-preserving self-conjugate natural transformation via multiplication by ''x'' on each representation, and hence one has a map &lt;math&gt;G \to \mathcal{T}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. Tannaka's theorem then says that this map is an isomorphism.

'''Krein's theorem''' answers the following question: which categories can arise as a dual object to a compact group? 

Let Π be a category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, endowed with operations of tensor product and involution. The following conditions are necessary and sufficient in order for Π to be a dual object to a compact group ''G''.
: 1. There exists an object &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; with the property that &lt;math&gt;I\otimes A \approx A&lt;/math&gt; for all objects ''A'' of Π (which will necessarily be unique up to isomorphism).
: 2. Every object ''A'' of Π can be decomposed into a sum of minimal objects.
: 3. If ''A'' and ''B'' are two minimal objects then the space of homomorphisms Hom&lt;sub&gt;Π&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'', ''B'') is either one-dimensional (when they are isomorphic) or is equal to zero.

If all these conditions are satisfied then  the category Π = Π(''G''), where ''G'' is the group of the representations of Π.

== Generalization ==
Interest in Tannaka–Krein duality theory was reawakened in the 1980s with the discovery of [[quantum group]]s in the work of [[Drinfeld]] and [[Michio Jimbo|Jimbo]]. One of the main approaches to the study of a quantum group proceeds through its finite-dimensional representations, which form a category akin to the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal categories]] Π(''G''), but of more general type, [[braided monoidal category]]. It turned out that a good duality theory of Tannaka–Krein type also exists in this case and plays an important role in the theory of quantum groups by providing a natural setting in which both the quantum groups and their representations can be studied. Shortly afterwards different examples of braided monoidal categories were found in [[rational conformal field theory]]. Tannaka–Krein philosophy suggests that braided monoidal categories arising from conformal field theory can also be obtained from quantum groups, and in a series of papers, Kazhdan and Lusztig proved that it was indeed so.  On the other hand, braided monoidal categories arising from certain quantum groups were applied by Reshetikhin and Turaev to construction of new invariants of knots.

The '''Doplicher–Roberts theorem'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (due to [[Sergio Doplicher]] and [[John E.

{{Table Numeral Systems}}
The '''ternary''' [[numeral system]] (also called '''base 3''') has [[3 (number)|three]] as its [[Base (exponentiation)|base]]. Analogous to a [[bit]], a ternary [[numerical digit|digit]] is a '''trit''' ('''tr'''inary dig'''it'''). One trit is equivalent to log₂3 (about 1.58496) bits of [[Units of information|information]].

Although ''ternary'' most often refers to a system in which the three digits are all non–negative numbers, specifically {{num|0}}, {{num|1}}, and {{num|2}}, the adjective also lends its name to the [[balanced ternary]] system, comprising the digits [[−1]], 0 and +1, used in comparison logic and [[ternary computer]]s.

Representations of [[integer number]]s in ternary do not get uncomfortably lengthy as quickly as in [[binary numeral system|binary]]. For example, decimal [[365 (number)|365]] corresponds to binary 101101101 (nine digits) and to ternary 111112 (six digits). However, they are still far less compact than the corresponding representations in bases such as [[decimal]]{{snd}}see below for a compact way to codify ternary using nonary and [[septemvigesimal]].

As for [[rational number]]s, ternary offers a convenient way to represent 1÷3 (as opposed to its cumbersome representation as an infinite string of [[recurring decimal|recurring digits]] in decimal); but a major drawback is that, in turn, ternary does not offer a finite representation for 1÷2 (neither for 1÷4, 1÷8, etc.), because [[2 (number)|2]] is not a [[Prime number|prime]] [[factorization|factor]] of the base; as with base 2, 1÷10 is not representable exactly (that would need e.g. base 10); nor is 1÷6.

===Sum of the digits in ternary as opposed to binary===
The value of a binary number with ''n'' bits that are all 1 is 2''ⁿ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1.

Similarly, for a number ''N''(''b'', ''d'') with base ''b'' and ''d'' digits, all of which are the maximal digit value ''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1, we can write:

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''bᵈ''⁻¹ + (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''bᵈ''⁻² + … + (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''b''¹ + (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''b''⁰
,

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) (''bᵈ''⁻¹ + ''bᵈ''⁻² + … + ''b''¹ + 1),

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''M''.

:''bM'' = ''bᵈ'' + ''bᵈ''⁻¹ + … + ''b''² + ''b''¹, and

:-''M'' = -''bᵈ''⁻¹&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''bᵈ''⁻²&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;b¹&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1, so

:''bM''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''M'' = ''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1, or

:''M'' = (''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)÷(''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1).

Then

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)''M'',

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) (''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)÷(''b'' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1), and

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = ''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1.

For a three-digit ternary number, ''N''(3, 3) = 3³&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1 = 26 = 2 × 3² + 2 × 3¹ + 2 × 3⁰ = 18 + 6 + 2.

===Compact ternary representation: base 9 and 27===
Nonary (base 9, each digit is two ternary digits) or [[septemvigesimal]] (base 27, each digit is three ternary digits) can be used for compact representation of ternary, similar to how [[octal]] and [[hexadecimal]] systems are used in place of [[binary numeral system|binary]].

==Practical usage==
In certain analog logic, the state of the circuit is often expressed ternary. This is most commonly seen in [[CMOS]] circuits, and also in [[Transistor–transistor logic]] with totem-pole output. The output is said to either be low (grounded), high, or open ([[High impedance|high–Z]]). In this configuration the output of the circuit is actually not connected to any voltage reference at all. Where the signal is usually grounded to a certain reference, or at a certain voltage level, the state is said to be high impedance because it is open and serves its own reference. Thus, the actual voltage level is sometimes unpredictable.

A rare "ternary point" is used to denote fractional parts of an [[inning]] in [[baseball]]. Since each inning consists of three [[Out (baseball)|outs]], each out is considered one third of an inning and is denoted as '''.1'''. For example, if a player pitched all of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings, plus 2 outs of the 7th inning, his [[Innings pitched]] column for that game would be listed as '''3.2''', meaning 3⅔. In this usage, only the fractional part of the number is written in ternary form.

Ternary numbers can be used to convey self–similar structures like the [[Sierpinski triangle]] or the [[Cantor set]] conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed. The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the digit 1.&lt;ref name="Soltanifar_2006_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soltanifar_2006_2"/&gt; Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non-zero term followed by the term one less than the last nonzero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos. For example: .1020 is equivalent to .1012222... because the expansions are the same until the "two" of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.

Ternary is the integer base with the lowest [[radix economy]], followed closely by [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[Quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]. It has been used for some computing systems because of this efficiency. It is also used to represent three-option ''trees'', such as phone menu systems, which allow a simple path to any branch.

A form of [[redundant binary representation]] called [[balanced ternary]] or [[signed-digit representation]] is sometimes used in low-level software and hardware to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate carries.&lt;ref name="Phatak_1994"/&gt;

===Binary-coded ternary===
Simulation of ternary computers using binary computers, or interfacing between ternary and binary computers, can involve use of binary-coded ternary (BCT) numbers, with two bits used to encode each trit.&lt;ref name="Frieder_1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parhami_2013"/&gt; BCT encoding is analogous to [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) encoding. If the trit values 0, 1 and 2 are encoded 00, 01 and 10, conversion in either direction between binary-coded ternary and binary can be done in [[Time complexity#Logarithmic time|logarithmic time]].&lt;ref name="Jones_2016_1"/&gt; A library of [[C (programming language)|C code]] supporting BCT arithmetic is available.&lt;ref name="Jones_2016_2"/&gt;

===Tryte===
Some [[ternary computer]]s such as the [[Setun]] defined a '''tryte''' to be six trits&lt;ref name="Impagliazzo_2006"/&gt; or approximately 9.5 [[bit]] (holding more information than the ''de facto'' [[Binary number|binary]] [[byte]]).&lt;ref name="Brousentsov_2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">In [[type theory]], a '''type rule''' is an [[inference rule]] that describes how a [[type system]] assigns a type to a syntactic construction. These rules may be applied by the type system to determine if a [[Computer program|program]] is well typed and what type [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]s have.  A prototypical example of the use of type rules is in defining [[type inference]] in the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], which is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]].

== Notation ==
 &lt;!-- historical reference (what it the paper by Luca Cardelli that introduce this notation?) --&gt;
An expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;e\!:\!\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[typing environment]] is written as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The notation for inference is the usual one for [[sequent]]s and [[inference rule]]s, and has the following general form

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma_1 \vdash e_1\!:\!\tau_1 \quad \cdots \quad \Gamma_n \vdash e_n\!:\!\tau_n}{\Gamma \vdash e\!:\!\tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

The sequents above the line are the premises that must be fulfilled for the rule to be applied, yielding the conclusion: the sequents below the line. This can be read as: ''if expression &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; in [[Typing environment|environment]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i=1..n&lt;/math&gt;, then the expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; will have an environment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;''.

For example, a simple language to perform arithmetic calculations on real numbers may have the following rules

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e_1\!:\!real \quad \Gamma \vdash e_2\!:\!real}{\Gamma \vdash e_1+e_2\!:\!real}
\qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash e_1\!:\!integer \quad \Gamma \vdash e_2 : integer}{\Gamma \vdash e_1+e_2\!:\!integer} \qquad \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

A type rule may have no premises, and usually the line is omitted in these cases. A type rule may also change an environment by adding new variables to a previous environment; for example, a declaration may have the following type rule, where a new variable &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;,
with type &lt;math&gt;\tau'&lt;/math&gt;, is added to &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e'\!:\!\tau' \quad \Gamma, id\!:\!\tau' \vdash e\!:\!\tau}{\Gamma \vdash \text{let id = } e' \text{ in } e \text{ end} :\!\tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the syntax of the let expression is that of [[Standard ML]]. Thus type rules can be used to derive the types of composed expressions, much like in [[natural deduction]].

In [[formal language]] theory, and in particular the theory of [[nondeterministic finite automata]], it is known that the '''union of two regular languages''' is a [[regular language]]. This article provides a proof of that statement.

==Theorem==

For any regular languages &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, language &lt;math&gt;L_{1}\cup L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is regular.''

''Proof'' 

Since &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are regular, there exist [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFAs]] &lt;math&gt;N_{1},\  N_{2}&lt;/math&gt; that recognize &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let 

::&lt;math&gt; N_{1} = (Q_{1},\ \Sigma ,\ T_{1},\ q_{1},\ A_{1})&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; N_{2} = (Q_{2},\ \Sigma ,\ T_{2},\ q_{2},\ A_{2})&lt;/math&gt;{{clarify|reason=Discuss the case where Sigma1 differs from Sigma2, or require their equality in the theorem.|date=July 2014}}
  
Construct

::&lt;math&gt;N = (Q,\ \Sigma ,\ T,\ q_{0},\ A_{1}\cup A_{2})&lt;/math&gt;
	
where

::&lt;math&gt;Q = Q_{1}\cup Q_{2}\cup\{q_{0}\}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;T(q,x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
											T_{1}(q,x) &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; q\in Q_{1} \\
											T_{2}(q,x) &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; q\in Q_{2} \\
											\{q_{1}, q_{2}\} &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; q = q_{0}\ and\ x =\epsilon\\
											\emptyset &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; q = q_{0}\ and\ x\neq\epsilon
											\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the following, we shall use &lt;math&gt;p\stackrel{x,T}{\rightarrow}q&lt;/math&gt; to denote &lt;math&gt;q\in E(T(p,x))&lt;/math&gt;{{clarify|reason=Introduce the meaning of 'E' somewhere.|date=July 2014}}

Let &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; be a string from &lt;math&gt;L_{1}\cup L_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Without loss of generality]] assume &lt;math&gt;w\in L_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;w = x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{m}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m\geq 0, x_{i}\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;N_{1}&lt;/math&gt;  accepts &lt;math&gt;x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{m}&lt;/math&gt;, there exist &lt;math&gt;r_{0}, r_{1},\cdots r_{m}\in Q_{1}&lt;/math&gt; such that{{clarify|reason=Discuss the case that N1 uses epsilon-transitions to accept w.|date=July 2014}}
	
::&lt;math&gt;	q_{1}\stackrel{\epsilon , T_{1}}{\rightarrow}r_{0}\stackrel{x_{1} , T_{1}}{\rightarrow}r_{1}\stackrel{x_{2} , T_{1}}{\rightarrow}r_{2}\cdots r_{m-1}\stackrel{x_{m} , T_{1}}{\rightarrow}r_{m}, r_{m}\in A_{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;T_{1}(q,x) = T(q,x)\ \forall q\in Q_{1}\forall x\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;

::	&lt;math&gt;r_{0}\in E(T_{1}(q_{1},\epsilon ))\Rightarrow r_{0}\in E(T(q_{1},\epsilon ))&lt;/math&gt;

::	&lt;math&gt;r_{1}\in E(T_{1}(r_{0},x_{1} ))\Rightarrow r_{1}\in E(T(r_{0},x_{1} ))&lt;/math&gt;

::::	&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;

::	&lt;math&gt;r_{m}\in E(T_{1}(r_{m-1},x_{m} ))\Rightarrow r_{m}\in E(T(r_{m-1},x_{m} ))&lt;/math&gt;


We can therefore substitute &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;T_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and rewrite the above path as


	&lt;math&gt;q_{1}\stackrel{\epsilon , T}{\rightarrow}r_{0}\stackrel{x_{1} , T}{\rightarrow}r_{1}\stackrel{x_{2} , T}{\rightarrow}r_{2}\cdots r_{m-1}\stackrel{x_{m} , T}{\rightarrow}r_{m}, r_{m}\in A_{1}\cup A_{2}, r_{0}, r_{1},\cdots r_{m}\in Q&lt;/math&gt;


Furthermore,

::	&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
T(q_{0}, \epsilon) = \{q_{1}, q_{2}\} &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; q_{1}\in T(q_{0}, \epsilon)\\
						\\ &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; q_{1}\in E(T(q_{0}, \epsilon))\\
						\\ &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; q_{0}\stackrel{\epsilon , T}{\rightarrow}q_{1}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

and 

::	&lt;math&gt;q_{0}\stackrel{\epsilon , T}{\rightarrow}q_{1}\stackrel{\epsilon , T}{\rightarrow}r_{0}\Rightarrow q_{0}\stackrel{\epsilon , T}{\rightarrow}r_{0}
&lt;/math&gt;


The above path can be rewritten as


:&lt;math&gt;q_{0}\stackrel{\epsilon , T}{\rightarrow}r_{0}\stackrel{x_{1} , T}{\rightarrow}r_{1}\stackrel{x_{2} , T}{\rightarrow}r_{2}\cdots r_{m-1}\stackrel{x_{m} , T}{\rightarrow}r_{m}, r_{m}\in A_{1}\cup A_{2}, r_{0}, r_{1},\cdots r_{m}\in Q
&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; accepts &lt;math&gt;x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{m}&lt;/math&gt; and the proof is complete.{{clarify|reason=As noted on the talk page, it remains to be shown that L(N) is a subset of L1 union L2.|date=July 2014}}


'''Note:'''    The idea drawn from this mathematical proof for constructing a machine to recognize &lt;math&gt;L_{1}\cup L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is to create an initial state and connect it to the initial states of &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; arrows.
