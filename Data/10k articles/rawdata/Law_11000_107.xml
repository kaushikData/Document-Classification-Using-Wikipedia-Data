'''Agrarian socialism''' is a political ideology which combines an [[agrarian society|agrarian]] way of life with a [[socialism|socialist]] economic system.

==Description==
When compared to standard [[socialist]] systems which are generally [[Urbanisation|urban]]/industrial  and more [[Progressivism|progressive]] in terms of social orientation, many agrarian socialist movements have tended to be [[Ruralism|rural]] (with an emphasis on decentralization and non-state forms of collective ownership), locally focused, and traditional/conservative.

The emphasis of agrarian socialists is therefore on control, ownership and utilisation of land rather than other [[means of production]].

A 17th-century movement called the [[diggers]] based their ideas on agrarian [[communism]].{{sfn|Campbell|2009|pp=127–129}}

== The Russian "populist" tradition and the Socialist Revolutionary Party ==
[[File:1917PartiyaSoz-Rev.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Socialist–Revolutionary election poster, 1917. The caption in red reads "партия соц-рев" (in Russian), short for Party of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The banner bears the party's motto "В борьбе обретешь ты право свое" ("In struggle you take your rights"), and the globe bears the slogan "земля и воля" ("land and freedom") expressing the agrarian socialist ideology of the party.]] The [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the [[Russian Revolution]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badcock|first=Sarah|date=2001|title='We're for the Muzhiks' Party!' Peasant Support for the Socialist Revolutionary Party during 1917|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=53|issue=1|pages=133–149|jstor=826242}}&lt;/ref&gt;In November 1917, it [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|won a plurality of the national vote]] in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]), but soon split and the remaining faction of this party which remained loyal to [[Alexander Kerensky]] was defeated and destroyed by the [[Bolsheviks]] in the course of the [[Russian Civil War]] and subsequent persecution.

The party's ideology was built upon the philosophical foundation of Russia's [[narodnik]]–[[populism|Populist]] movement of the 1860s-70s and its worldview developed primarily by [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Pyotr Lavrov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Macfarlane|first=Leslie J.|date=1998|pages=142–174|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-26987-7_9|isbn=9781349269891|title=Socialism, Social Ownership and Social Justice|chapter=From Russian Socialism to Soviet Communism}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of decline and marginalization in the 1880s, the Populist/narodnik school of thought about social change in Russia was revived and substantially modified by a group of writers and activists known as "neonarodniki" (neo-Populists), particularly [[Viktor Chernov]]. Their main innovation was a renewed dialogue with [[Marxism]] and the integration of some of the key Marxist concepts into their thinking and practice. In this way, with the economic spurt and industrialization in Russia in the 1890s, they attempted to broaden their appeal in order to attract the rapidly growing urban workforce to their traditionally peasant-oriented program. The intention was to widen the concept of the 'people' so that it encompassed all elements in the society that were opposed to the [[Tsar]]ist regime.

The party's program was both [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and agrarian socialist in nature; it garnered much support among Russia's rural [[peasantry]], who in particular supported their program of ''land-socialization'' as opposed to the [[Bolshevik]] program of land-nationalization—division of land among peasant tenants rather than [[collectivization]] in state management. Their policy platform differed from that of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Social Democratic Labour Parties]]—both [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]]—in that it was not officially [[Marxist]] (though some of its ideologues considered themselves such); the SRs believed that the 'laboring peasantry', as well as the industrial proletariat, would be the revolutionary class in Russia. Whereas Russian SDs defined class membership in terms of ownership of the means of production, Chernov and other SR theorists defined class membership in terms of extraction of surplus value from labor. On the first definition, small-holding subsistence farmers who do not employ wage labor are, as owners of their land, members of the petty bourgeoisie; on the second definition, they can be grouped with all who provide, rather than purchase, labor-power, and hence with the proletariat as part of the 'laboring class'. Chernov nevertheless considered the proletariat the 'vanguard', with the peasantry forming the 'main body' of the revolutionary army.&lt;ref&gt;Hildermeier, M., Die Sozialrevolutionäre Partei Russlands. Cologne 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Associate justice''' or '''associate judge''' is the title for a member of a judicial panel who is not the [[Chief Justice|chief justice]] in some jurisdictions. The title "Associate Justice" is used for members of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and some [[state supreme court]]s, and for some other courts in [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries, as well as for members of the [[Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia#Judicial branch|Supreme Court]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], a former United States [[United Nations Trust Territories|Trust Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr012810.htm "The Federated States of Micronesia Mourns the loss of one of its Founding Fathers: Chief Justice Andon Amaraich"], Government of the F.S. Micronesia, January 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In other [[common law]] jurisdictions, the equivalent position is called "[[Puisne Justice]]".

In the United States, judicial panels are non-hierarchical, so an associate judge has the same responsibilities with respect to cases as the chief judge. 

An associate judge usually has fewer or different administrative responsibilities than the chief. On the Supreme Court of the United States, the most junior associate justice (currently Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]]), has the task of answering the door when the Justices are in private conference.{{fact|date=December 2013}}

There are eight [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justices on the United States Supreme Court]], and three associate justices on the Supreme Court of the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmlaw.org/fsm/rules/index.htm "THE SUPREME COURT OF THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA"], official Legal Information Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of associate justices vary depending on the Court they preside in. In the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]], associate justices of the [[New South Wales Supreme Court]] hear civil trials and appeals from lower courts amongst other matters &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|sca1970183|Supreme Court Act 1970|118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Associate justices can sit either as a single judge or may sit on the [[New South Wales Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|sca1970183|Supreme Court Act 1970|117A}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[New Zealand]], associate judges of the [[High Court of New Zealand]] supervise preliminary processes in most civil proceedings. associate judges have jurisdiction to deal with such matters as: summary judgment applications, company liquidations, bankruptcy proceedings, and some other types of civil proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.govt.nz/courts/high_court.html |title=New Zealand High Court |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003103241/http://www.courts.govt.nz/courts/high_court.html |archivedate=2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Zealand legal system, associate judges were formerly known as [[Master (judiciary)|masters]].

'''''Association belge des Consommateurs Test-Achats ASBL v Conseil des ministres''''' (2011) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62009CJ0236&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-236/09] is a decision of the [[European Court of Justice]] which invalidated a provision of [[Directive 2004/113/EC]] of the [[European Union]] which permitted the continence of sexual discrimination in the provision of insurance services provided that it was based on "relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data." The practical result of the decision was the prohibition of [[sexual discrimination]] in insurance policies.

==Facts==
A Belgian consumer association, [[Test-Achats]], against the Belgian government claiming that the legal measure adopted by the government to [[transposition (law)|transpose]] the Gender Directive into [[European Union law|EU law]] violated the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The Constitutional Court asked the European Court of Justice for a [[preliminary ruling]] on the validity of Article 5(2) of the directive.

==Judgment==
On 1 March 2011 the ECJ ruled in favour of Test-Achats that Article 5(2) was in breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and therefore void. However the court ruled that there would be a transitional period to enable insurance companies to comply with the ruling this lasted until the 21 December 2012.

The ruling means that after the transitional period ended all new insurance contracts entered into in the 27 [[European Union member states]] could no longer use gender to determine premiums paid or benefits granted. The ruling benefits male drivers and male purchasers of [[life insurance]], who tend to experience claims more than women in these areas;  it will also benefit female purchasers of [[health insurance]] who tend to experience health claims more than men and female purchasers of [[life annuity]] products, who tend to live longer than men. Naturally it is likely that female drivers and life insurance purchasers, and male health insurance purchasers, will pay more.

The ruling was welcomed by many as a step forward for gender equality and for ending outdated practices but met with some controversy particularly from United Kingdom conservative politicians who felt the court was overstepping its power and in effect making its own legislation.

'''Building officials''' of developed countries are generally the jurisdictional administrator of building and construction codes, engineering calculation supervision, permits, facilities management, and accepted construction procedures.

==Qualifications==
In some jurisdictions building officials act as [[project engineer]] or [[project manager]] for the chief building official who is the jurisdiction's formally recognized building official.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Usual qualifications are a bachelor's degree in Administration, Engineering, or Architecture, or Building Surveying or Construction Management, with an extensive building construction background, and in some instances are licensed as a [[Professional Engineer]] or [[Architect]] or Building Surveyors or Building Certifiers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Building officials can be certified.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}
==Australia==
Law

Australian law is governed under individual state laws &amp; territories generally made from state Acts &amp; Regulations governing ...
Qld, NSW, Vic, Tas, South Aust, West Aust, Nth Territory, Aust Capital Territory, various off shore islands &amp; Aust protectorates within the 200 nautical mile limit of the Commonwealth of Australia. 

 
Town Planning &amp; Development 

Concepts of planning &amp; development are primarily approved under state Town Planning Acts &amp; Regulations, which outline the procedures &amp; protocols for various types of projects. 

Town Planning is a separate university degree discipline, which is usually guided by the interest of the general community &amp; attempts to solve development problems. 

Individual project concepts are approved under Local Authority Codes which are generally Council Town Planners acting as the preliminary Assessment Authority to issue preliminary development approvals, or state bodies eg Transport, Main Roads, Port or Airport Authorities. 
Town Planners deal with expected community concepts, according to zoning principles ie residential land, high density living, city hubs, farm land, industrial areas, infrastructure, the safety of the natural environment &amp; its natural resources. 

 
Building &amp; Construction

Australian Building law is governed under individual state laws &amp; territories generally made from state Building Acts &amp; Building Regulations 

Within the state Acts &amp; Regulations, the procedures &amp; protocols of preliminary approvals required are outlined, before a building development permit is issued by the Licensed Building Certifier or Building Assessment Manager for various types of projects.  
The Acts also detail time frame limitations, registration &amp; licensing body requirements of building professionals, practitioners &amp; trade contractors. Offences &amp; penalties are also gazetted under the Acts for proven non-compliance with minimum requirements. Appeals of development decisions can be undertaken via state tribunals or state Planning Courts.   

Building officials, or regulators that decide if building applications for construction works can proceed, are called Building Surveyors or Building Certifiers. 

These officials are either employed by Federal, State or Local Government or more commonly in private practice companies. Building Surveying is a tertiary degree qualification &amp; encompasses all aspects of construction from the concept stage to the finished building. 

The Architect, Designer, Builder or Owner engage the Licensed Building Certifier/Building Surveyor as the Building Assessment Manager, to regulate or manage a project, on behalf of the local authority (usually Council), generally after a preliminary approval is required, or to determine that a project meets all the relevant minimum Planning Code requirements, under the Building Certifier's guidance, or as part of a discretionary process. 

The Building Certifier interacts with all professionals &amp; often the Senior trade contractors engaged within the building &amp; inspects the works as they proceed, during mandatory inspection phases of footings, slab, frame, fire separation &amp; final, to ensure compliance with the approved plans, the NCC &amp; relevant Australian Standards. 
Building Surveyors or Building Certifiers are licensed by the state they practice in &amp; have 3 different levels. 

Building Surveyors were first conceived after the Great Fire of London in 1666 in the UK, where their primary focus is the safe construction &amp; use of the building concerning the life-health &amp; safety of the occupants.


Plumbing Works

Plumbing works are generally approved &amp; inspected at various stages, by the Local Authority (Council) Plumbing Inspectors who have a Hydraulic/Plumbing trade qualification &amp; experience, to ensure public potable water safety, contain the spread waste-water products &amp; regulate responsible ground water discharge.
Larger infrastructure i.e. dams, pipe line networks, roadway drainage, flood mitigation works, etc, calls for a Civil Engineering background.


National Construction Code (NCC)

All state building acts &amp; regulations refer to the minimum standards required within the Building Code of Australia (BCA), now the National Construction Code (NCC) since 2011, of which there are 3 volumes, which deals with individual aspects of buildings in categorised sections, based on the use (class), size of the building &amp; type of construction, A, B or C, where Type C is the least fire resistant.     

Volume 1 - Buildings classes 2 to 9 - larger commercial buildings - ie 2 residential units, 3 motels, 4 caretakers residence in a larger building, 5 office, 6 shop, 7 warehouse, 8 factory, 9 public buildings eg schools, hospitals, etc. 

Volume 2 -  Buildings classes 1 &amp; 10 - smaller residential buildings ie 1A house, 1B small residential boarding house, 10A carport, 10B swimming pool.

Volume 3 - Plumbing &amp; Drainage - including fire fighting, gas, solar water heating, air con &amp; on site waste water systems - for all buildings &amp; external civil works.

The NCC is up-graded bi-annually to consider new products, improvements or methods of construction, by senior officials of trade bodies, Institutes of Architects /Engineers / Building Surveyors, state officials &amp; governed by the Australian Building Codes Board (ACBC).
The NCC references individual minimum Australian Standards (AS- No.- Year of introduction) for each aspect of the type of contractor's work, or suppliers product, eg the minimum standard for Waterproofing of wet areas uses AS 3740-2004.

In Australia, the valuation for sale of a project is another discipline of Building Valuer, unlike the UK where the Building Valuer is the Building Surveyor.

==New Zealand==
The government of New Zealand has set up a mediation service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbh.govt.nz/whrs-index Weathertight Homes Resolution Service]&lt;/ref&gt; to resolve cases of houses that failed watertightness.
==United States== 
In the United States, there were three major nonprofit organizations developing building codes for the governing of building constructions, but they have since been merged into one in 1994, the [[International Code Council]] (ICC). ICC publishes the [[International Building Code]]s, used by most of the jurisdictions within the United States. The former organizations included Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), and Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI).

There are several other major code publishers in the United States. The [[Uniform Plumbing Code]] (UPC) and the [[Uniform Mechanical Code]] (UMC) are both written by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, also known as [[IAPMO]], an organization that was established by code officials.

On May 17, 1926, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813120922/http://www.iapmo.org/] the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, or [[IAPMO]], began with a mandate “to advance the latest and most improved methods of sanitation; to promote the welfare of and harmony between the owner, the builder, and the craftsman; to accomplish a uniformity in the application of the provisions of the ordinances; and to promulgate the mutual benefit of the members."  IAPMO also publishes the [[Uniform Solar Energy and Hydronics Code]] (USEHC) and [[Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code]] (USPSHTC) as part of their family of [[Uniform Codes]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

==England &amp; Wales==

In England and Wales building control bodies (BCB) may be of two primary forms, either established under Local Authority control or private bodies (Approved Inspectors).  Applicants wishing to carry out work controlled under the Building Act have the choice to select either the local Building Control or an Approved Inspector.  However, where local legislation is prevalent the Approved Inspector will be charged with liaising with the relevant local authority body for the necessary approvals.

The Secretary of State issues guidance in support of the Building Regulations in the form of Approved Documents which are not mandatory.  The Building Regulations are functional and therefore designers are free to offer alternative solutions to satisfying the functional requirements.  The burden of proof is then placed on the designers to demonstrate that the alternative solution proposed offers a level of performance which satisfies the intent of the functional requirement.  There is nothing in the Regulations which imposes a duty on the applicant under those circumstances to use the guidance as a benchmark of performance, although this is of course a route often taken as  a way of demonstrating that an alternative approach is of an acceptable standard.

Appeals against decisions made by BCBs are to the Secretary of State who will make a determination after considering all of the facts of a particular case.

The '''Case of Mines''' or ''R v Earl of Northumberland'' was decided in 1568. 

Rather than the usual four judges a full panel of twelve common law senior judges, on appeal, decided “that by the law all mines of gold and silver within the realm, whether they be in the lands of the Queen, or of subjects, belong to the [[Royal prerogative|Queen by prerogative]], with liberty to dig and carry away the ores thereof, and with other such incidents thereto as are necessary to be used for the getting of the ore.” 

The decision was in the [[law of England and Wales]] and was later confirmed by courts to be applicable in the monarch's other realms and dominions. The [[royalty payment|royalties]] payable by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|custom]] to the UK government have been passed by British [[statute]] to the former dominions early in their recognition as dominions.

==Facts==
The Earl of Northumberland in 1568 was [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland]].  The Queen was [[Elizabeth I of England]].

Some copper miners in [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] found an admixture of gold in copper mined from lands belonging to the Earl of Northumberland.  Due to concerns about revenue and the possibility of a renewed war with Spain, the Queen’s advisers were anxious to claim prerogative rights to the gold. A suit was brought in the Court of Exchequer Chamber and judgment was for the Queen founding [[the Crown]]’s right to mine gold or silver.

The challenge by the Earl of Northumberland was on the ground that the work was within the Royalties granted to his family in a former reign.

==Judgment==
Twelve judges decided in favour of the Queen, that,

{{Cquote|that by the law all mines of gold and silver within the realm, whether they be in the lands of the Queen, or of subjects, belong to the Queen by prerogative, with liberty to dig and carry away the ores thereof, and with other such incidents thereto as are necessary to be used for the getting of the ore.}}

The neglect of the Earl and his predecessors to work the minerals during seventy years 'had made that questionable which for ages was out of question', and the prerogative was revoked.&lt;ref name="Hulme"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hulme |first=E. Wyndham |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1896 |url=http://www.ipmall.fplc.edu/hosted_resources/PatentHistory/pohulme.htm |title=The History of the Patent System under the Prerogative and at Common Law (Extract from The Law Quarterly Review, Vol 46, April 1896, pages 141-154) |work=E. Wyndham Hulme articles on early English patent system |publisher=Pierce Law IP Mall - www.ipmall.info |accessdate=2006-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108225154/http://www.ipmall.fplc.edu/hosted_resources/PatentHistory/pohulme.htm |archivedate=2007-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This illustrates that in theory all gold and silver belongs to the queen, and that most authorities to extract minerals granted have a "use it, or lose it" component.

==Significance==
On 28 May 1568 two mining monopolies were created, the [[Company of Mineral and Battery Works]] and the [[Society of Mines Royal]].  The effects of the decision were limited by the [[Mines Royal Act 1689|Mines Royal Act]] 1690, which removed the monopoly of these two companies. 

===Reporting of the case===
One report featured in the later [[English Reports]] series. Plowden’s extensive report was published some years after the judgment.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;

===Subsequent cases===
The case has remained the leading case in [[New Zealand constitution|New Zealand law]] on the royal prerogative to the royal metals of gold and silver; by statute all related royalties flow to the government of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite journal | last = Williams | first = David | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 2003 | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2003/11.html | title = Gold, The Case of Mines (1568) and the Waitangi Tribunal |volume=7 |issue=2 |page=157 | work =  | journal = Australian Journal of Legal History | accessdate = 2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was also the authority on which the controversial [[Miner's Licence]]s in Australia were introduced at the time of the [[Australian gold rushes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blainey | first = Geoffrey | authorlink = Geoffrey Blainey | title = The Rush That Never Ended | year = 1963  | publisher = Melbourne University Press | pages = 20–21 | isbn = 0-522-84557-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collective punishment''' is a form of retaliation whereby a suspected perpetrator's [[kin punishment|family members]], friends, acquaintances, [[sect]], neighbors or entire ethnic group is targeted. The punished group may often have no direct association with the other individuals or groups, or direct control over their actions. In times of war and armed conflict, collective punishment has resulted in atrocities, and is a violation of the [[laws of war]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Garner|editor1-first=Bryan A.|editor1-link=Bryan A. Garner|title=Black's Law Dictionary|date=2007|publisher=Thomson West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=0314151990|page=280|edition=8th|quote=Collective punishment was outlawed in 1949 by the Geneva Convention.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[Military occupation|occupying powers]] have used collective punishment to retaliate against and deter attacks on their forces by [[Resistance movement]]s (such as destroying entire towns and villages which were believed to have harboured or aided such resistance movements).

==History==
===2nd century BC===
During the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China (221–207 BC), emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] upheld his rule by enforcing strict laws, with the most serious of crimes, such as [[treason]], punishable by what is known as [[nine familial exterminations]] – this involved the execution of the perpetrator's entire families as well as the perpetrators themselves, where the members are categorized into nine groups. The process of familial extermination was carried on by subsequent Chinese dynasties for serious crimes, with a significant number of recorded sentences during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), until the punishment was officially repealed by the government of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912) in 1905.

===9th–15th centuries===
{{see also|Sippenhaft}}
In the [[Tithing]], groups of ten men swearing the [[Frankpledge]], the compulsory sharing of responsibility and punishment, was in use at least since the time of [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century. The [[Statute of Winchester]] of 1285 provided that "the whole [[hundred (division)|hundred]] … shall be answerable" for any theft or robbery.

===16th century===
During the [[Ming dynasty]] of China, 16 palace women [[Renyin palace rebellion|attempted to assassinate]] the [[Jiajing Emperor]]. All were sentenced to death by [[Lingchi|slow slicing]]. Ten members of the women's families were also beheaded, while a further 20 were enslaved and gifted to ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1=History Office | title=明實錄：明世宗實錄 | language=Chinese | trans-title=Veritable Records of the Ming: Veritable Records of Shizong of Ming | url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;res=309093 | publisher=Ctext | date=1620s | volume=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The [[Intolerable Acts]] were seen as a collective punishment of [[Massachusetts]] for the [[Boston Tea Party]].

===19th century===
The principle of collective punishment was laid out by Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in his [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 120|Special Field Order 120]], November 9, 1864, which laid out the rules for his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|"March to the sea"]] in the [[American Civil War]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;V. To army corps commanders alone is entrusted the power to destroy mills, houses, cotton-gins, etc..., and for them this general principle is laid down: In districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested, no destruction of such property should be permitted; but should guerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless according to the measure of such hostility.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman, William T.]], ''[http://www.sonshi.com/sherman.html Memoirs of General W.T. Sherman]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', 2nd ed., D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1913 (1889), Chapter XXI. Reprinted by the [[Library of America]], 1990, {{ISBN|0-940450-65-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British forces in the [[Boer Wars]] and the Germans in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] justified such actions as being in accord with the laws of war then in force.&lt;ref&gt;"The laws of war as to conquered territory" by William Miller Collier, New York Times, November 29, 1914, p. SM6&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
====United States====
In 1906, [[Brownsville Affair|167 black U.S. soldiers stationed]] in Brownsville, Texas, were dishonorably discharged on orders of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in response to the shooting of two white citizens in the middle of the night of August 13, 1906. One man was killed and the other, a police lieutenant, was injured and it was never discovered who the shooter(s) were, though they were presumed to have been members of the nearby Fort Brown.  The soldiers of Companies Bravo, Charlie, and Delta of the 25th infantry regiment, many of whom served in the [[Philippines]] and [[Cuba]] during [[Spanish–American War|America's war with Spain]], were punished for the crime collectively and were denied army pensions.&lt;ref&gt;"The Brownsville Raid" by John D. Weaver&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War I====
During the [[First World War]], the German [[Rape of Belgium|invasion of Belgium]] was marked by numerous acts of collective punishment, in response to real or perceived acts of resistance. Some 6,000 civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes burned during this period.&lt;ref name="Lipkes"&gt;Lipkes J. (2007) ''Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914'', Leuven University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

====Russian Revolution====
During the 1917 uprising against [[Nicholas II]] during [[World War I]], many of Nicholas' distant relatives in Russia were killed
by revolutionaries during that year's uprising. In July 1918, less than a year after the [[October revolution]] that overthrew [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government]] and early in the [[Russian Civil War]] that began shortly afterwards, Nicholas II and his immediate family and remaining servants were shot by their captors.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

Total: 5.6 million."&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany also applied collective punishment elsewhere. In the summer of 1941, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] troops executed several hundred people in [[Massacre of Kondomari|Kondomari]], [[Alikianos executions|Alikianos]], [[Razing of Kandanos|Kandanos]] and elsewhere in retaliation for the participation of [[Crete|Cretan]] civilians in the [[Battle of Crete]]. During its [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupation]] by the Axis from 1941 to 1944, [[Greece]] suffered a remarkably high death toll due to reprisals against the support and involvement of the population in the [[Greek Resistance|Resistance]]. Large-scale massacres were carried out in places such as [[Domenikon Massacre|Domeniko]], [[Kommeno]], [[Holocaust of Viannos|Viannos]], [[Drakeia massacre|Drakeia]], [[Massacre of Kalavryta|Kalavryta]], [[Mesovouno massacres|Mesovouno]], [[Distomo massacre|Distomo]], [[Holocaust of Kedros|Kedros]], [[The Massacre of Chortiatis|Chortiatis]] and many others.

In Yugoslavia (now [[Serbia]]), Nazi troops killed 434 men in three villages near Kragujevac on October 19, 1941 as punishment for previous actions of the Serbian resistance movement. In the next two days, the Nazis also killed more than 13,000 people in Kraljevo, Kragujevac, and Sumarice, including 300 students from Kragujevac First High School. In 1942, the Germans destroyed the village of [[Lidice]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the [[Czech Republic]]) killing 340 inhabitants as collective punishment or [[reprisal]] for that year's assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] by nearby commandos (the village [[Ležáky]] was also destroyed in retribution). In the French village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] 642 of its inhabitants – men, women, and children – were slaughtered by the German [[Waffen-SS]] in 1944, as were 335 Italians in that same year's [[Ardeatine massacre]] in caves outside Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057248/Oradour-sur-Glane|title=Oradour-sur-Glane|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dutch village of [[Putten]]&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.putten.nl Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian villages of [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/world/italian-town-lost-in-history-now-fears-memories-of-nazis.html|title=Italian Town, Lost in History, Now Fears Memories of Nazis|first=Clifford J.|last=Levy|date=April 18, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=December 18, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marzabotto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html#Italy|title=Massacres and Atrocities of WWII in the Axis Countries|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194232/http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html#Italy|archive-date=March 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the Soviet village of [[Kortelisy]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ukrhistory.tripod.com/page-20.html World War II in Ukraine] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64HKWGqzR?url=http://ukrhistory.tripod.com/page-20.html |date=December 28, 2011 }}: Kortelisy (Ukraine), Lidice (Czechoslovakia) &amp; Oradour-sur-Glane (France): Razed Villages.''&lt;/ref&gt; (in what is now [[Ukraine]]), large-scale reprisal killings were carried out by the Germans. The Massacre of Borovë occurred on July 9, 1943, in the village of Borovë, in southeastern Albania. German forces killed 107 civilians as a reprisal for a partisan attack on a German convoy the days before.

=====Against Germany=====
The [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of German speaking population groups after World War II]] by the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia represent one of the greatest examples of collective punishment in terms of the number of victims. The goal was to punish the Germans;&lt;ref name="Ulf Brunnbauer p.91"&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer, Michael G.

Nicosia p.130,131"/&gt;

====British Empire====
According to ''The New York Times'', the British planned "'collective punishment' for aiding Reds, rewards and more troops" in Malaya in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"British to step up Malaya campaign; 1951 plans include 'collective punishment' for aiding Reds, rewards and more troops" New York Times, December 17, 1950, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; The British used collective punishment as an official policy to suppress the [[Mau Mau]] uprising in Kenya in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;"Labor's censure over Kenya fails" New York Times, December 17, 1952, p16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Britain officially used collective punishment in [[Cyprus]] in the form of evicting families from their homes and closing shops anywhere British soldiers and police had been murdered, to obtain information about the identities of the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Britain punishes Cypriote balking in informer role" New York Times, March 17, 1956, p1&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered by most nations contradictory to the modern concept of [[due process]], where each individual receives separate treatment based on their own role(s) in the crime in question. Article 33 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] specifically forbids collective punishment.

====USSR====
[[Joseph Stalin]]'s mass [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of many nationalities of the USSR to remote regions (including the [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Volga Germans]] and many others) is an example of officially orchestrated collective punishment.

The partial removal of potentially trouble-making ethnic groups was a technique used consistently by Stalin during his career: [[Poles]] (1939–41 and 1944–45), [[Romanians]] (1941 and 1944–53), [[Estonians]], [[Latvians]], [[Lithuanians]] (1941 and 1945–49), [[Volga Germans]] (1941), [[Chechen people|Chechens]], and [[Ingush people|Ingushes]] (1944). Shortly before, during and immediately after [[World War II]], Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf |title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 1941 and 1949 nearly 3.3&amp;nbsp;million were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Boobbyer|title=The Stalin Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYMsIE5KjmMC&amp;pg=PA130|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18298-0|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some estimates up to 43% of the resettled population died of [[infectious disease|diseases]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/USSR.TAB1B.GIF|title=Soviet Transit, Camp, and Deportation Death Rates|publisher=|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportations started with Poles from [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and European Russia (see [[Poles in the former Soviet Union]]) 1932–36. [[Koryo-saram|Koreans]] in the [[Russian Far East]] were deported in 1937 (see [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union]]). After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] following the corresponding [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion]] that marked the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] annexed eastern parts (so-called "''[[Kresy]]''") of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. During 1939–41 1.45&amp;nbsp;million people inhabiting the region were deported by the Soviet regime, of whom 63% were [[Poles]], and 7% were [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Poland's Holocaust, Tadeusz Piotrowski, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7864-0371-3}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The same followed in the [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/History-of-Occupation/briefing-paper4/ Soviet Mass Deportations from Latvia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709020049/http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/History-of-Occupation/briefing-paper4/ |date=July 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940–1953. 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html The Baltic States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175950/http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html |date=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm|title=Taig|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010301223347/http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm|archivedate=March 1, 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[June deportation]], [[Operation Priboi]], [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]]) [[Volga Germans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volgagermans.net/volgagermans/Volga%20German%20Deportation.htm Deportation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806104429/http://www.volgagermans.net/volgagermans/Volga%20German%20Deportation.htm |date=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seven (overwhelmingly [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] or non-[[Slavic Peoples|Slavic]]) nationalities of the [[Crimea]] and the northern [[Caucasus]] were deported: the [[Crimean Tatars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronet.nl/users/sota/statshist.html Deportation of Crimean Tatars by Stalin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015035819/http://www.euronet.nl/users/sota/statshist.html |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalmykia|Kalmyks]], [[Chechens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3509933.stm|title=Remembering Stalin's deportations|publisher=BBC News – Europe|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ingushetia|Ingush]], [[Balkars]], [[Karachays]], and [[Meskhetian Turks]]. All [[Crimean Tatars]] were deported ''en masse'', in a form of collective punishment.

[[Pogrom]]s may be considered examples of unofficial collective punishment which resemble rioting. About 14 million East Germans were moved out of what was Germany; three million of them died.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

====Azerbaijan====
[[Black January]] was a [[List of events named massacres|massacre]] of civilians committed by the [[Red Army]] in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1990. The [[Human Rights Watch]] report entitled "Black January in Azerbaijan" states: "Indeed, the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 was so out of proportion to the resistance offered by Azerbaijanis as to constitute an exercise in collective punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azembassy.ro/eng/news/press_releases/002.htm|title=Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijanin Romania|first=|last=FS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
====North Korea====
In [[North Korea]], political prisoners are sent to the [[Kwan-li-so]] concentration camps along with their relatives without any fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/10/AR2008121003855.html |title="Escapee Tells of Horrors in North Korean Prison Camp", Washington Post, December&amp;nbsp;11, 2008 |work=The Washington Post  |date= December 11, 2008|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean citizens convicted of more serious political crimes are sentenced to life imprisonment, and the summary two generations of their family (children and grandchildren) will be born in the camps as part of the "3 generations of punishment" policy instigated by state founder [[Kim Il-Sung]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaechon internment camp]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[North Korea]]'s [[political imprisonment|political]] [[penal labor]] [[Penal colony|colonies]], transliterated ''kwalliso'' or ''kwan-li-so'', constitute one of three forms of political imprisonment in the country, the other two being what Hawk (2012)&lt;ref name="Hawk2012"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hawk, David|title=The Hidden Gulag – Exposing North Korea's Prison Camps| work=[[U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|The Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] | url= http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf | accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; translates as "short-term [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]]/forced-labor centers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Korean|context=north|mr=chipkyŏlso|rr=jipgyeolso|hangul=집결소|hanja=[[wikt:集結#Korean|集結]] [[wikt:所|所]]}}, literally "place(s) of gathering"&lt;/ref&gt; and "long-term prison [[labor camp]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{Korean|context=north|mr=kyohwaso|rr=gyohwaso|hangul=교화소|hanja=[[wikt:敎|敎]] [[wikt:化|化]]所}}, literally "place(s) of [[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]]"&lt;/ref&gt; for [[misdemeanor]] and [[felony]] offences respectively. In total, there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 political prisoners housed within the [[Prisons in North Korea|North Korean imprisonment system]].&lt;ref name="Hawk2012" /&gt; In contrast to these other systems, the condemned are sent there without any form of [[judicial process]] as are their immediate three generations of family members as [[kin punishment]].
North Korea's kwalliso consist of a series of sprawling encampments measuring kilometers long and kilometers wide. The number of these encampments has varied over time. They are located mainly in the valleys between high mountains, mostly in the northern provinces of North Korea. There are between 5,000 and 50,000 prisoners per kwalliso, totaling perhaps some 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners throughout North Korea. The kwalliso are usually surrounded at their outer perimeters by barbed-wire fences punctuated with guard towers and patrolled by heavily armed guards. The encampments include self-contained closed "village" compounds for single persons, usually the alleged wrongdoers, and other closed, fenced-in "villages" for the extended families of the wrongdoers.

====Israel====
The current [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade of Gaza]] has been criticized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], in a United Nations report, and by various other organisations as collective punishment aimed at the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8257301.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza | date=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10306193 | work=BBC News | title=ICRC says Israel's Gaza blockade breaks law | date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15163640 | work=BBC News | title=US Congress freeze on $200m Palestinian aid criticised | date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alamarin v.

====India====
The [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]] or the 1984 Sikh Massacre was a riot directed against Sikhs in India, by anti-Sikh mobs, in response to the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]] by her Sikh bodyguards. This caused more than 3000 deaths. The CBI is of the opinion that the acts of violence were well organized with support from the officials in the Delhi police and central government at the time, headed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv, a [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] member who was sworn in as the Prime Minister after his mother's death, when asked about the riots said "When a big tree falls, the earth shakes".

In 2011, Human Rights Watch reported the Government of India had "yet to prosecute those responsible for the mass killings". The 2011 WikiLeaks cable leaks revealed that the United States was convinced regarding the complicity of the Indian government led by the [[Indian National Congress]] in the riots, and termed it as "opportunism" and "hatred" of the Congress government against Sikhs. Also in 2011, a new set of mass graves were discovered in Haryana, and Human Rights Watch reported that "Widespread anti-Sikh attacks in Haryana were part of broader revenge attacks" in India.

====Pakistan====
On May 20, 2008, the [[Pakistan Army]] conducted collective punishment against a village called [[Spinkai]], located in the frontier province of [[Pakistan]]. The operation was called 'zalzala', which is Arabic for earthquake. At first, the Pakistan Army swept through with helicopter gunships, artillery and tanks. After four days of heavy fighting, 25 militants and six soldiers died. The rest of the militants retreated up the valley. After the capture of the village the army discovered bomb factories, detonation-ready suicide jackets and schools for teenage suicide bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/20/pakistan|title=Demolished by the Pakistan army: the frontier village punished for harboring the Taliban|work=The Guardian|author=Declan Walsh|date=May 20, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-30|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakistan Army immediately decided to punish the village for harboring the [[Taliban]] and allowing the militants to operate in and from the village to conduct further terror attacks in Pakistan. Bulldozers and explosives experts turned Spinkai's bazaar into a mile-long pile of rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/in_pictures/7421903.stm|title=In pictures: Pakistan's most feared militant|work=BBC News (news.bbc.co.uk)|accessdate=2008-06-30|date=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrol stations, shops, and even parts of the hospital were leveled or blown up. The villagers were forbidden from returning to their homes.

Pakistani commanders, who were speaking to the media, insisted they had been merciful in their application of "collective punishment" – a practice invented by the British who demarcated the tribal areas over a century ago.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====South Africa====
South Africa still retains the [[Apartheid]]-era law of [[common purpose]], by which those who make up part of a group can be punished for the crimes of other group members, even if they were not themselves actively involved. In August 2012 this came to public attention when 270 miners were threatened with prosecution for participating in a demonstration. During the demonstration at the Marikana mine, 34 miners were shot by police. Many of the miners were armed. When prosecutors said they would pursue charges against other miners who were part of the protest, there was a public outcry.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19438343 | title=Marikana murder charges: South Africa minister wants explanation | publisher=BBC | accessdate=August 31, 2012 | date=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syria====
Throughout most of Syria's ongoing [[Syrian civil war|civil war]], collective punishment has been a recurring method used by the Syrian government to quell opposition cities and suburbs throughout the country, whereby entire cities are besieged, shelled, and destroyed if that city is deemed as pro-opposition.

Upon retaking the capital Damascus after the [[Battle of Damascus (2012)]], the Syrian government began a campaign of collective punishment against Sunni suburbs in-and-around the capital which had supported FSA presence in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/03/us-syria-crisis-bulldozers-idUSBRE8820BC20120903 | work=Reuters | title=Syria army destroys houses in "collective punishment" | date=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Syria+army+bulldozes+houses+Sunni+Muslim+areas+collective+punishment/7187238/story.html  accessdate=2012-09-26] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Rather than attempt to discover some "contra-causal free will", modern philosophers will usually use notions of [[intention]] to establish individual moral responsibility. This [[Kantian ethics|Kantian]] approach may not be the only way to assess responsibility, especially considering groups may need a unique approach to individuals.&lt;ref name=StanfordCollective&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/#5 Collective Responsibility. At Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. First published Mon August 8, 2005; substantive revision Mon June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there is the issue that consistent (not [[hypocritical]]) individuals may nevertheless experience a [[discursive dilemma]] when they try to act as a group.

Philosopher Kenneth Shockley suggests we focus on group faults and the punishments that would bring change. Punishments, for a group, might include: full or partial disbanding, weakening bonds between members, or de-institutionalizing some of the group's norms. Neta Crawford says groups can be expected to change, but also apologize and make amends. That might mean groups must forfeit important parts of themselves.&lt;ref name=StanfordCollective/&gt; In this case, groups are being held responsible for organizing or incentivizing harmful behaviors. Shockley calls this the group's "coordinating control" over members. He says group responsibility can mitigate individual responsibility.&lt;ref name=StanfordCollective/&gt;

'''''Collins v. United States''''' is a class-action lawsuit filed on November 10, 2010, against the United States in the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] that ended in a settlement on January 7, 2013.

The lead plaintiff, former U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Richard Collins, was honorably discharged under "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT) after nine years of service after two civilian co-workers saw him kissing his civilian boyfriend. Once discharged, Collins discovered that his separation pay was half that normally paid to servicemembers separated from the military under the designation "honorably discharged". The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) had an established policy that provided that servicemembers honorably discharged receive half the normal separation pay if they were not eligible for reenlistment. Those discharged as homosexuals under DADT as well as those discharged for medical reasons were ineligible for reenlistment and therefore received half the standard separation pay.

On Collins' behalf, the ACLU and the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] filed requests for the revision of the policy with the DoD. When the DoD refused that request, Joshua Block of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], Laura Schauer Ives of the ACLU of New Mexico, and Sara Berger of Albuquerque, New Mexico, filed suit on November 10 and opened participation in the case to all veterans discharged under the policy since November 20, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/collins-v-united-states-class-action-military-separation-pay|title = Collins v. United States - Class Action for Military Separation Pay|publisher = American Civil Liberties Union|date = November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2011, while detailing the repeal of DADT in accordance with the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], the DoD announced that those discharged under the policy would not receive any additional compensation and that their separation pay would not be adjusted. The ACLU expressed disappointment with the DoD's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/defense-department-says-it-will-deny-full-separation-pay-gay-and-lesbian-service-members|title = Defense Department Says It Will Deny Full Separation Pay For Gay And Lesbian Service Members Honorably Discharged Under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" |publisher = [[American Civil Liberties Union]]|date = January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Christine Odell Cook Miller heard arguments in the case on September 22, 2011, two days after the end of the DADT policy. Justice Department lawyer L. Misha Preheim argued on behalf of the government that the Secretary of Defense has sole jurisdiction over back pay for discharged soldiers and that the courts cannot rewrite military regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/22/ap/government/main20110380.shtml|title = Gov't opposes full severance pay for military gays|publisher = Associated Press via CBS News|date = September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government. It provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under DADT since November 10, 2004, who had previously been granted only half that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=Servicemembers Kicked Out Under Military's Gay Ban Since '04 To Receive Full Separation Pay|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/servicemembers-kicked-out-under-militarys-gay-ban|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=Buzz Feed|date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this agreement, some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muñoz|first=Carlo|title='Don't ask, don't tell' dischargees to receive full back pay from DOD |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/275971-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-receive-full-back-pay |accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Greece}}

In the [[history of modern Greece|modern history of Greece]], starting from the [[Greek War of Independence]], the Constitution of 1975/1986/2001 is the last in a series of democratically adopted Constitutions (with the exception of the Constitutions of 1968 and 1973 imposed by a [[Regime of the Colonels|dictatorship]]). 

==Greek War of Independence==
{{main|First Hellenic Republic}}
During the Greek War of Independence, three constitutional texts (Constitutions of 1822, 1823 and 1827) were adopted by the [[Greek National Assembly|Greek National Assemblies]], the national representative political gatherings of the [[Greece|Greek]] revolutionaries. These constitutions were influenced by:

*the French Constitutions of [[French Constitution of 1793|1793]] and [[Constitution of the Year III|1795]],
*the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]],
*the Draft Constitution of [[Rigas Velestinlis]],&lt;ref&gt;Consisting of two main parts: 35 articles concerning the Human Rights and 124 articles concerning the legislative, judicial and executive powers. See the full text of the Draft Constitution in {{cite book | last=Mavrias Kostas | first=Pantelis Antonis | title=Constitutional Texts (in Greek) | publisher=Antonis Sakkoulas | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the three Constitutions of the [[Ionian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |last=Alivizatos |first=Nicos |authorlink=:el:Νίκος Αλιβιζάτος|title=Introduction of the Greek Constitutional History-Volume I (in Greek) |publisher=Antonis Sakkoulas |year=1996 |page=27 etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year before the adoption of the [[Greek Constitution of 1822]], local Assemblies had ratified the so-called [[Greek local statutes]], such as the [[Senate Organization of Western Greece]], the [[Legal Order of Eastern Greece]] and the [[Peloponnesian Senate Organization]].

==From the absolute to the constitutional monarchy (1833–1924)==
[[File:Constitution 1844.jpg|thumb|right|In the name of the Holy, Consubstantial and Indivisible Trinity...are the first words of the Greek Constitution of 1844.]]
King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] governed for more than 10 years without any constitutional restrictions, since the "hegemonical" [[Greek Constitution of 1832]] was never implemented. On 3 September 1843, the infantry, led by Colonel [[Dimitrios Kallergis]] and the Revolutionary captain [[Ioannis Makriyannis]], [[3 September 1843 Revolution|assembled]] in the square in front of the palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much of the population of the small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the king agreed to grant a constitution. Left with little recourse, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed to the demands of the crowd over the objections of his opinionated [[Queen Amalia of Greece|Queen]]. This square was renamed to Constitution Square ([[Syntagma Square]]) to commemorate the events of September 1843.

The [[Greek Constitution of 1844]] defined Greece as a [[constitutional monarchy]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |last=Alivizatos |first=Nicos |title=Introduction of the Greek Constitutional History-Volume I (in Greek) |publisher=Antonis Sakkoulas |year=1996 |page=62 etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing for a [[bicameral]] parliament, consisting of a [[Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Senate]]. The [[Greek Constitution of 1864]] was somewhat more liberal, and transferred most of the real power to the parliament. In 1874 [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] published a manifesto entitled "Who's to blame?", naming King [[George I of Greece|George I]] as the answer. Specifically, he condemned the king for bypassing parliamentary opinion in his selection of Prime Ministers. The article landed him briefly in jail, but also boosted his popularity significantly. A year later, on 8 May 1874 he mustered a parliamentary plurality and George reluctantly named him as Prime Minister. Thanks to Trikoupis' article, a new constitutional principle was recognized and implemented: the king was required to give the largest party in parliament first choice of forming a government. In 1911 [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] amended 54 of the 110 articles of the Constitution, trying to bring the constitution in line with his [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]]'s principles. Nevertheless, the [[National schism]] of 1916 caused a huge constitutional crisis, as two governments were formed: one in [[Athens]] and one in [[Thessaloniki]].

==The Second Hellenic Republic and the Restoration (1925–1941)==
[[File:Greek Constitution of 1927 - front page.png|thumb|right|Front page of the 1927 Constitution]]
{{main|Second Hellenic Republic|Metaxas Regime}}
The [[Greek Constitution of 1925|Constitution of 1925]] provided for a Republic in accordance with the results of the plebiscite of [[Greek plebiscite, 1924|1924]]. Nonetheless, on 24 June 1925, officers loyal to [[Theodoros Pangalos (general)|Theodoros Pangalos]], fearing that the political instability was putting the country at risk, overthrew the government in a coup and violated the Constitution. On 24 August 1926, a counter-coup deposed him and [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]] returned as President.

Since the previous Constitution was not fully implemented, it was the [[Greek Constitution of 1927|Constitution of 1927]] which formally established the Second Hellenic Republic and provided for a largely ceremonial president as [[head of state]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |last=Alivizatos |first=Nicos |title=Introduction of the Greek Constitutional History-Volume I (in Greek) |publisher=Antonis Sakkoulas |year=1996 |page=140 etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Greek plebiscite, 1935|plebiscite of 1935]], King [[George II of Greece|George II]] was restored, but the Third Revisionary Parliament of 1936 did not have the time to replace or amend the Constitution of the Republic. Instead, the Constitution of 1911 was restored, ostensibly on a temporary basis.  The elections of 1936 had produced a political deadlock and, thereby, George II appointed [[Ioannis Metaxas]] to be interim prime minister. Widespread industrial unrest in May allowed Metaxas to declare a [[state of emergency]].  On 4 August, he suspended the parliament indefinitely and suspended various articles of the constitution, with the king's approval. For all intents and purposes, Metaxas was now a dictator.  No constitutional amendment was adopted before [[German invasion of Greece|Germany invaded Greece]] in 1941.

==The Kingdom of Greece after the Second World War (1942–1967)==
After the end of the [[Second World War]], King [[George II of Greece|George II]] was once again restored by virtue of the plebiscite of [[Greek plebiscite, 1946|1946]]. The implications of the [[Greek Civil War]] did not allow the ratification of the liberal [[Draft Constitution of 1948]]. A more conservative [[Greek Constitution of 1952|Constitution]] was passed in 1952, which imposed restrictions on basic human rights and banned the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE). 

==The Colonels' Regime (1967–1974)==
On 21 April 1967, a coup took place by right-wing officers, which established a dictatorship known as the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Colonels' Regime]]. An attempted counter-coup by King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] in December failed, forcing him to leave the country. Thus, legally, there was no government and no Head of State in Athens. Thereby, the Revolutionary Council of [[Stylianos Pattakos]], [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Makarezos]] made a brief appearance to cause a Resolution to be published in the Government Gazette, appointing another member to the military administration, Major General [[Georgios Zoitakis]], as Regent. Zoitakis then appointed Papadopoulos as Prime Minister. [[Greek Constitution of 1968|A new constitution]] was adopted by referendum in 1968.  King Constantine was officially retained as head of state, though he would not be allowed to return until the first parliamentary election unless the government recalled him sooner.  Many of the guarantees of civil rights were suspended, and elections were postponed until the "Revolution of April 21" (as the coup was called) had reformed the "Greek mentality."

Five years later, during Papadopoulos' attempts at controlled democratization, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president.  A plebiscite formally abolished the monarchy on 29 July 1973. A new [[Greek Constitution of 1973|Constitution]] was drafted, providing for a popularly elected president with wide-ranging powers, effectively establishing a [[presidential republic]]. After the hard-liners' coup on 25 November 1973 deposed Papadopoulos, the regime retained the trappings of the Republic, but reverted to exclusively military control until its final collapse in the wake of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Cyprus crisis]] in August 1974.

==The Third Hellenic Republic==
With the return of civilian rule under [[Constantine Karamanlis]], the new government, acting under extraordinary circumstances, issued a "Constituting Act" which voided the 1973 constitution.  Pending a referendum on a new constitution, the 1952 constitution was temporarily restored, "except for the articles dealing with the form of the State"; the last phrase referring to whether the monarchy would be restored or not. In the meantime, the functions of the king were to be discharged by the [[President of Greece|president of the republic]].

The matter was settled by [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|plebiscite]] on 8 December 1974, by which the monarchy was definitively abolished. A new [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]], adopted by Parliament and promulgated on 11 June 1975, established a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a president as head of state.  In practice, however, most of the power was vested in the prime minister.  This constitution was revised in 1985 to codify this practice.  It was amended again in 2001, and is in force today.

A '''constitutional right''' can be a prerogative or a duty, a power or a restraint of power, recognized and established by a [[sovereign state]] or union of states. All constitutional [[rights]] are expressly stipulated and written in a consolidated national [[constitution]], which is the supreme law of the land, meaning that any other laws which are in contradiction with it are considered unconstitutional and thus regarded as invalid. Usually any constitution defines the structure, functions, powers, and limits of the national government and the individual freedoms, rights, and obligations which will be protected and enforced when needed by the national authorities.

Nowadays, most countries have a written constitution comprising similar or distinct constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://constitutionalrights.constitutioncenter.org/app/home/world/|title= Constitutional Rights Origins and Travels|access-date=29 July 2015}} )&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1789, along with the [[Constitution of the United States of America]] (hereinafter U.S. Constitution), which is the oldest and shortest written constitution still in force,&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last=Jordan |first=Terry L.|title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Edition |publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company |place=Naperville IL|year=2013|page=25}})&lt;/ref&gt; around 220 other similar constitutions were adopted around the world by independent states.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, [[Thomas Jefferson]] predicted that a period of 20 years will be the optimal time for any Constitution to still be in force since "the earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead." &lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s23.html/|title=Thomas Jefferson to James Madison |publisher=Papers 15:392--97|date=6 September 1789 |website=Popular Basis of Political Authority|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidence or not, according to recent studies &lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Zachary, |first1=Elkins|last2=Ginsburg |first2=Tom|last3=Melton|first3=James| title= The Endurance of National Constitutions|publisher= Cambridge University Press. |place=New York|year=2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; the average life expectancy of any new written constitution is around 19 years. However, a great number of constitutions do not exceed more than 10 years and around 10% do not last more than 1 year, as it was the case of the [[France|French]] Constitution from 1971&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Zachary, |first1=Elkins|last2=Ginsburg |first2=Tom|last3=Melton|first3=James| title= The Endurance of National Constitutions|publisher= Cambridge University Press. |place=New York|year=2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; and not only.

The most common reasons for these continuous changes are the political desire of an immediate outcome and the scarcity of time devoted to the constitutional drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 2009 showed that the average time allocated for the drafting part of the process is around 16 months &lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Does%20the%20Process%20of%20Constitution-Making%20Matter.pdf/|title=Does the Process of Constitution-Making Matter?|last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Zachary, |first2=Elkins |last3=Blount, |first3=Justin |publisher=Annu.

For example, the [[Myanmar]] 2008 Constitution was secretly drafted for more than 17 years,&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; whereas on the other extreme, like the case of the [[Japan]]'s 1946 Constitution, the bureaucrats drafted everything in no more than a week.Nevertheless, the record for the shortest overall process of drafting, adoption and ratification of a national Constitution belongs to the [[Romania]]'s 1938 Constitution which installed a royal dictatorship in less than a month.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Does%20the%20Process%20of%20Constitution-Making%20Matter.pdf/|title=Does the Process of Constitution-Making Matter?|last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Zachary, |first2=Elkins |last3=Blount, |first3=Justin |publisher=Annu. Rev. Law Soc. Sci.5:201–23|website=University of Chicago Law School |date=2009|place=Chicago, IL|page=204|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on the matter showed as a general conclusion that usually non-democracies where the registered extreme cases where the constitution-making process either takes too long or is incredibly short.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Does%20the%20Process%20of%20Constitution-Making%20Matter.pdf/|title=Does the Process of Constitution-Making Matter?|last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Zachary, |first2=Elkins |last3=Blount, |first3=Justin |publisher=Annu. Rev. Law Soc. Sci.5:201–23|website=University of Chicago Law School |date=2009|place=Chicago, IL|page=203|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; Important not to forget or make any confusions about it is that constitutional rights are not a specific  characteristic of democratic countries, but also non-democratic countries have Constitutions, such as [[North Korea]] for example, which officially grants every citizen, among other rights, the [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| ssrn=2477530|title=Do Constitutional Rights Make a Difference?|last1= Chilton |first1=Adam S. |last2=Versteeg |first2=Mila |publisher=Coase-Sandor Institute for Law &amp; Economics Working Paper No. 694|website=Coase-Sandor Institute for Law &amp; Economics  |date=2014|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Other coded set of laws have existed before the first Constitutions were developed having some similar purpose and functions, like the United Kingdom's 1215 [[Magna Carta]] or the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |page=2|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Federal constitution===

On September 17, 1787 the [[United States Constitution]] was signed during the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]] which took place at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, now the [[Independence Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=31}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest person signing the Constitution was [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the founding fathers, being 81 years old at the time and requesting assistance during the process, whereas the youngest one was [[Jonathan Dayton]] from New Jersey, being only 26 years old. [[James Madison]] and [[George Washington]] were the only two signers that later became Presidents of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=26}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first fascinating fact about the U.S. Constitution is its length, containing only 4.400 words and thus being the shortest and oldest written Constitution in the world.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=25}})&lt;/ref&gt; Only on December 15, 1791 the Bill of Rights comprising the first 10 Amendments became part of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=45}})&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, other 17 Amendments were added. Thus, the U.S Constitution is summing a total of 27 Amendments and 7 Articles. During all this time, only one amendment overturned a previous one, more precisely the twenty-first Amendment ratified on December 5, 1933 repealed the [[prohibition of alcohol]] established by the eighteenth Amendment on January 16, 1919.

The provisions providing for rights under the Bill of Rights were originally binding upon only the federal government. In time, most of these provisions became binding upon the states through [[selective incorporation]] into the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. When a provision is made binding on a state, a state can no longer restrict the rights guaranteed in that provision.

Examples of provisions made binding upon the states are the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution which was made "fully applicable" by being Incorporated with the 14th Amendment in 2010, see, McDonald vs. City of Chicago; the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th Amendment]]'s guarantee of a right to confrontation of witnesses, known as the [[Confrontation Clause]], and the various provisions of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]], guaranteeing the freedoms of speech, the press, government and assembly.

For example, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protects the right to [[grand jury]] proceedings in federal criminal cases. However, because this right was not selectively incorporated into the due process clause of the 14th amendment, it is not binding upon the states. Therefore, persons involved in state criminal proceedings as a defendant have no federal constitutional right to grand jury proceedings. Whether an individual has a right to a grand jury becomes a question of state law.

The content of each Article and Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is easy to predict since they start with a suggestive title. For example, the [[First Amendment]] guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, and the press along with the rights of assembly and petition, the Second Amendment the right to bear arms and so on. However, in order to be easier to distinguish, the legal professionals have divided the constitutional rights into two categories: process rights and [[substantive rights]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Feinman, |first1=Jay M.| title= Law 101, 4th Ed.|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York |year=2014 |page=49}})&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, the process rights refer to the powers and obligations of the government with respect to individuals, the substantive rights, more diverse than the process ones, incorporate the individual freedoms granted and protected by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Feinman, |first1=Jay M.| title= Law 101, 4th Ed.|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York |year=2014 |pages=50–51}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===State constitutions===

Each of the United States has its own governing Constitution. The States Constitutions are usually longer and written in much more detail than the U.S. Constitution. For example, the [[Alabama]] Constitution has more than 600 pages and the [[New Jersey]] Constitution of 1947 is three times longer than the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Feinman, |first1=Jay M.| title= Law 101, 4th Ed.|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York |year=2014 |page=12}})&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this difference between the federal Constitution and the states Constitutions is what Justice Brennan called 'the new judicial federalism'.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/4649/|title=Justice Brennan and Federalism |last=Post |first=Robert |publisher=Faculty Scholarship Series. Paper 4649. |website=Faculty Scholarship Series|date=1990|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that rights granted by the States Constitutions can be broader than those comprised by the federal Constitution but not narrowed.

State constitutions cannot reduce legal protections afforded by the federal charter, but they can provide additional protections. ''California v. Ramos'', 463 U.S. 992, 1014, 103 S.Ct. 3446, 77 l.Ed.2d 1171 (1983).  Even where the text of a state constitution matches verbatim that of the federal constitution, the state document may be held to provide more to the citizen.  State constitutional rights can also include those entirely unaddressed in the federal constitution, such as the right to adequate education or the right to affordable housing.

==Other nations==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
{{See also|Human rights in Germany|Constitution of Japan}}
Many other [[democracy|democratic]] nations have followed the US model in enshrining certain rights in their constitutions. Countries whose written constitutions include a [[bill of rights]] include [[Germany]], [[India]] and [[Japan]].

The United Kingdom, as it has an [[uncodified constitution]], does not have a constitutional bill of rights, although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] fulfills a similar role.

The [[European Convention of Human Rights]] applies in those nations which are members of the [[Council of Europe]]. Persons who have experienced Convention-infringing human rights violations on the territory of ECHR-signatory nations can appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

In [[authoritarian]] regimes there are generally few or no guaranteed inalienable rights; alternatively, such rights may exist but be unobserved in practice (as was generally the case in the former [[Francoist Spain]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9907">'''Copyright claims on Bikram Yoga''' are the claims made by [[Bikram Choudhury]] ("Bikram") that his [[yoga]] practice, [[Bikram Yoga]], was under [[copyright]] and that it could not be taught or presented by anyone whom he had not authorized. Bikram began making copyright claims on [[Bikram Yoga]] in 2002. In 2011 Choudhury started a lawsuit against [[Yoga to the People]], a competing yoga studio founded by a former student of Bikram's and with a location near one of the Bikram Yoga studios in New York. As a result of that lawsuit, the [[United States Copyright Office]] issued a clarification that yoga postures (''[[asanas]]'') could not be copyrighted in the way claimed by Bikram, and that Yoga to the People and others could continue to freely teach these exercises. In 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court ruling that the Bikram Yoga Sequence was not copyrightable subject matter. 

==Background==
Bikram Choudhary goes by his first name, "Bikram".&lt;ref name="Economist 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/node/2765973 |title=Face value: The litigious yogi &amp;#124; The Economist |first= |last=staff |work=economist.com |date=17 June 2004 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is most known in popular culture for [[mass marketing]] his yoga practice into a [[franchising]] system of 900 yoga studios as of 2004.&lt;ref name="Economist 2002"/&gt; Bikram insists that classes be taught in these studios in a certain way, and that they taught only certain [[asana|yoga postures]].&lt;ref name="Economist 2002"/&gt; Starting in 2002, Bikram began having his lawyers send out [[cease and desist]] letters to any yoga studio which presented his Bikram Yoga postures without his authorization.&lt;ref name="Economist 2002"/&gt;

In the United States, Choudhury has claimed, and been aggressive in threatening suit over, broad copyrights in most aspects of the practice, teaching, and business of the system. Choudhury extracted settlements from a number of yoga teachers and studios.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0921/entrepreneurs-franchising-bikram-yoga-new-twists.html | title=Bikram Yoga's New Twists | last=Farrell |first=Maureen |date=September 3, 2009 |publisher=Forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baddogtales.com/yogainc.html|title=Yoga, Inc.|publisher=Bad Dog Tales, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012, the US Copyright Office concluded that copyright for Bikram's sequence of 26 postures had been issued in error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr37605.pdf| title = Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 121 / Friday, June 22, 2012 / Rules and Regulations| accessdate = 9 February 2013 | format = PDF | publisher = U. S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led a federal district court, and later the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, to reject Choudhury's claims and rule that the sequence of postures was not copyrightable. 

==Bikram Yoga versus Yoga to the People==
[[Yoga to the People]] is a yoga studio established by one of [[Bikram Choudhury]]'s former work associates. After Yoga to the People opened a yoga studio near a [[Bikram Yoga]] studio, Bikram started a lawsuit to have them cease presenting Bikram Yoga [[asana|postures]] at their studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/02/06/steamed |title=Steamed - The New Yorker |first=Ben |last=McGrath |work=newyorker.com |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20111130/lower-east-side-east-village/bikram-originator-sues-yoga-people-for-stealing-poses |title=Bikram Originator Sues Yoga to the People for 'Stealing' Poses - East Village &amp; Lower East Side - DNAinfo.com New York |first=Serena |last=Solomon |work=dnainfo.com |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223151026/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20111130/lower-east-side-east-village/bikram-originator-sues-yoga-people-for-stealing-poses |archivedate=23 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoga to the People sought public attention to the lawsuit in [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/12/yoga_to_the_peo.php |title=Yoga to the People Takes on Bikram Choudhury on Facebook &amp;#124; Village Voice |first=Rosie |last=Gray|work=blogs.villagevoice.com |date=6 December 2011|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of that lawsuit, the [[United States Copyright Office]] issued a clarification that yoga postures (''[[asanas]]'') could not be copyrighted in the way claimed by Bikram, and that Yoga to the People and others could continue to freely teach these exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://brooklynbased.com/blog/2013/04/19/the-fallout-from-a-downward-facing-dog-fight/ |title=The Fallout From A Downward-Facing Dog Fight &amp;#124; Brooklyn Based |first=Kate |last=Brack |work=brooklynbased.com |date=13 April 2013 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that clarification Yoga to the People and Bikram came to an agreement that Yoga to the People would not present Bikram Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/12/yoga-to-the-people-settles-lawsuit-still-cheap.html|title=Yoga to the People Settles Lawsuit, Stays Cheap -- NYMag|last2=Thorn|first2=Max|date=12 December 2012|publisher=|first1=|last1=Coscarelli|work=nymag.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite not having a court-ordered obligation to do so, Yoga to the People ceased to present Bikram Yoga postures in its studios and instead began using its own postures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/feeling-the-heat-yoga-chain-bows-to-bikram-despite-federal-ruling/?_r=0 |title=Yoga to the People to Stop Offering Hot Yoga to Settle Bikram Suit - NYTimes.com |first=Andy |last=Newman |work=cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com |date=10 December 2012|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130103/williamsburg/yoga-people-unveils-26-plus-6-bikram-yoga-replacement |title=Yoga to the People Unveils '26 Plus 6' Bikram Yoga Replacement - Williamsburg - DNAinfo.com New York |first=Meredith |last=Hoffman |work=dnainfo.com |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223145732/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130103/williamsburg/yoga-people-unveils-26-plus-6-bikram-yoga-replacement |archivedate=23 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/12/hot_yoga_tk.php |title=The Hot Yoga War's Messy End: Why Yoga to the People Won't Be Teaching Bikram Yoga Anymore &amp;#124; Village Voice |first=Rebecca |last=Moss |work=blogs.villagevoice.com |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the settlement, Bikram said ""I win, he lose, and that's it... Nobody will ever be able to steal Bikram yoga anymore."&lt;ref name="Moss 2012"/&gt;

==Bikram's Yoga College v. Evolation Yoga==
Evolation Yoga was also founded by a previous associate of [[Bikram Choudhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/news/hold-that-pose-federal-judge-rules-that-bikram-yoga-cannot-be-copyrighted-6718126 |title=Hold that Pose: Federal Judge Rules that Bikram Yoga Cannot be Copyrighted |first=Rebecca |last=Moss |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choudhury similarly sued Evolation Yoga for teaching hot yoga with the same sequence of postures as Bikram Yoga. 

On December 17, 2012, U.S. District Court Judge [[Otis D. Wright II|Otis Wright]] ruled that Bikram Choudhury does not have copyright protection for the sequence of 26 yoga postures and two breathing exercises commonly known as “Bikram Yoga.” The ruling, in favor of Evolation Yoga LLC and its founders Mark Drost and Zefea Samson, meant that non-Bikram studios are allowed to offer [[hot yoga]] classes utilizing that same 26-posture sequence—a legal right Choudhury actively and vigorously contested for several years.&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomberg "Yoga, AstraZeneca, Intel, UN: Intellectual Property" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-17/yoga-astrazeneca-intel-un-intellectual-property.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=BIKRAM’S YOGA COLLEGE OF INDIA, L.P.; BIKRAM CHOUDHURY, v.

On October 8, 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the sequence of yoga postures was not copyrightable subject matter under 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) and that Choudhury's copyright in a book describing his system did not give him copyright over the sequence itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=BIKRAM’S YOGA COLLEGE OF INDIA, L.P.; BIKRAM CHOUDHURY, v.

subject of copyright protection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contract law]] and [[administrative law]], '''delegation''' (Latin ''intercessio'') is the act of giving another person the responsibility of carrying out the performance agreed to in a contract. Three parties are concerned with this act - the party who had incurred the obligation to perform under the contract is called the ''delegator''; the party who assumes the responsibility of performing this duty is called the ''delegatee''; and the party to whom this performance is owed is called the ''obligee''.

==Contract law==
===Delegable contracts===
A delegation will be null and void if it poses any threat to the commercially reasonable expectations of the obligee. For example, a task requiring specialized skills or based on the unique characteristics of the promisee can not be delegated. If a specific celebrity was hired to make a speech, they could not delegate the task to another person, even if the other person would give the same speech, word for word. However, a delegation of performance that does not pose such a threat will be held to be valid. In such a case, the obligee will be under an affirmative duty to cooperate with the delegatee to the extent necessary for the fulfillment of the delegator's obligations

===Breach of a delegated contract===
If the delegatee fails to perform satisfactorily, the obligee may elect to treat this failure as a breach of the original contract by the delegator ''or'' may assert himself as a [[third party beneficiary]] of the contract between the delegator and the delegatee, and can claim all remedies due to a third party beneficiary.

If the delegation is without [[consideration]], the delegator remains liable for nonperformance, while the delegatee will not be liable to anyone for anything. Unlike an assignment, a delegation is virtually always for consideration, and never donative - few people are going to accept the charitable offer to perform a task contracted to someone else.

===Compare: assignment===
A parallel concept to delegation is [[assignment (law)|assignment]], which occurs when one party transfers his present rights to receive the benefits accruing to the assignor under that contract. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although the right to sue for nonpayment always stays with delegator. Under the [[common law]], a contract clause prohibiting assignment also prohibits delegation. Another common law rule requires that a party to a contract can not delegate performance that involves special skills or reputation (although it is possible to have a [[novation]] under such circumstances).

==Administrative law==
In [[Administrative Law]] (the law that controls government action and decisions) a delegation is the process of handing some administrative action or decision to a subordinate. It is achieved through two mechanism:

# Where a [[statute]] or [[Delegated legislation]] appoints an "authorized person" to manage the power for a [[government minister|minister]] or [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]]. Here the delegate acts in their own name, and the delegation is a position that does not cease with the appointment of a new delegate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|278|1985|litigants=Kelly v Watson |parallelcite=(1985) 10 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 305 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# In some circumstances a person in whom some power is vested can authorize another person to exercise that power on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Carltona"&gt;[[Carltona doctrine#The judgment in Carltona|Carltona v Commisioners of Works]] [1943] 2 All ER 560.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|47|1983|litigants=O’Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners |parallelcite=(1983) 153 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |date=14 April 1983 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the underling is appointed to act as if they were the authorized person,&lt;ref name="Carltona"/&gt; usually for the ''Administrative necessity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1983|litigants=[[Sandra Investments Pty Ltd v Booth]] [1983] HCA 46  |parallelcite=(1983) 153 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 153 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|47|1983|litigants=O’Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners |parallelcite=(1983) 153 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}  per Brennan J.&lt;/ref&gt; of managing huge work loads in a government department. Here the delegate acts in person of the authorized person rather than in their own name, and the delegator can still exercise the powers as necessary&lt;ref&gt;Huth v Clarke (1890) 25 QBD 391 at 395 per Wills J.&lt;/ref&gt; even though much of the day to day operations are enacted by subordinates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6290">[[File:Siricius.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Pope Siricius]], author of the ''Directa'' decretal]]The '''''Directa''  [[decretal]]''' was written by [[Pope Siricius]] in February AD 385. It took the form of a long letter to Spanish bishop [[Himerius of Tarragona]] replying to the bishop’s requests for ''directa'' on various subjects sent several months earlier to [[Pope Damasus I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/cms_content?page=223465&amp;event=6450SBF%7C221593%7C6450  Christian Cochini, S.J., ''The Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy''].
&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first of a series of documents published by the [[Magisterium]] that claimed [[apostolic succession|apostolic origin]] for [[clerical celibacy]] and reminded ministers of the altar of the perpetual [[Sexual continence|continence]] required of them.

==Background==

It is known that the [[First Ecumenical Council]] which took place at [[Nicaea]] included in its legislation a discipline of the priesthood known as clerical [[Sexual continence|'continence']] or celibacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.org/miscellaneous/celibacy_for_deacons.htm Ivan Gobry, "The Controversy over celibacy for deacons", from ''The Angelus'',  August 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the requirement of all priests and bishops to refrain from [[Human sexual activity|sexual contact]] with their wives or with any other woman. Thus, for a married man to become a priest, his wife had to agree to abstain from all sexual relations. This discipline added to the legislation of various councils, particularly the [[Council of Elvira]], the date of which cannot be determined with precision, but believed to have been in the first quarter of the fourth century, in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Council of Elvira}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisismagazine.com/october2006/ryland.htm Rev. Ray Ryland, "The Gift: A Married Priest Looks at Celibacy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

While priests of the East and West were required to refrain from all sexual contact by virtue of their presiding at sacrifices, this was an exceedingly difficult discipline to maintain. Just as the [[Levite|Levite priests]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple in Jerusalem]] had been required to abstain from sexual contact (in order to achieve ritual purity) merely ''for a lengthy period prior to'' the periodic performance of the sacrifices of the temple, so the priests of the Early Church were required by ecclesiastical law to abstain from sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimmerman.catholic.ac/p-celibacy.htm Fr. Anthony Zimmerman, STD, "Celibacy dates back to the Apostles"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022044253/http://zimmerman.catholic.ac/p-celibacy.htm |date=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christian priests presided at the sacrifice of the [[Eucharist]] every Sunday as well as the annual feasts of the various martyrs. Thus, Christian priests were not afforded by the Christian calendar periods in which they could be sexually active with their wives.

==The ''Directa'' Decretal==

In the ''Directa'', the Pope dealt with the fact that clerics (deacons, priests, and bishops) were still living with their wives and having children, thus contravening the [[Council of Elvira]] and the [[First Ecumenical Council]]. Priests were justifying this by referring to the traditions of the [[Levite|Levitical priesthood]] of the [[Old Testament]]. Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_01011993_chisto_en.html Roman Cholij, "Priestly celibacy in patristics and in the history of the Church"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219140232/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_01011993_chisto_en.html |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe ''temporary'' continence when serving in [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]], but that the [[Nativity of Jesus|coming of Christ]] had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to ''perpetual'' continence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/mcgovern/celhist1.html Father Thomas McGovern, ""Celibacy: a historical perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen points are studied in the decretal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/cms_content?page=223465&amp;event=6450SBF%7C221593%7C6450 Cochini, ''op. cit''.]&lt;/ref&gt; but the key passage is that
{{cquote|The Lord Jesus formally stipulated in the Gospel that he had not come to abolish the law, but to bring it to perfection; this is also why he wanted the beauty of the Church whose Bridegroom he is to shine with the splendor of chastity so that when he returns, on the Day of Judgment, he will find her without stain or wrinkle, as his Apostle taught. It is through the indissoluble law of these decisions that all of us, priests and deacons, are bound together from the day of our ordination, and [held to] put our hearts and our bodies to the service of sobriety and purity; may we be pleasing to our God in all things, in the sacrifice we offer daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/celibacy.html#The%20Early%20Church%20and%20Celibacy Christian Cochini, S.J., "Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy", (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1990)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sexual continence|Continence]] was required of all Christian priests by [[ecclesiastical law]] until the [[East-West Schism|great schism]], and is still required of [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priests]] today;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Celibacy of the Clergy}}&lt;/ref&gt; many [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] do not require celibacy of their priests.

'''Eastern Party''' is a concept that has long been used by mainstream historians&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Chinese History'', edited by David G. Atwill &amp; Yurong Y.Atwill,  Prentice Hall, 2010. -Arnold Toynbee, ''Le monde et l'Occident'', Paris, Editions Gonthier,1964. -Jean Pellerin, ''La faillite de l'Occident'', Montréal, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; to define the reaction of a section of the population in the [[Third World]] countries against [[Westernization]] and the import of Western values in their societies. Rather than a specific political party, the term refers to a current in the public opinion of the said countries opposed to a "Western Party" of modernizers, who tend to accept Westernization as an inevitable phenomenon, which finally benefits the overall progress of Third World societies. Particularly in the [[history of Greece]] and [[History of the Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], this concept has been largely used by noted historians like [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Leften Stavrianos]], [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]], at the beginning of the 20th century and later by [[Dimitri Kitsikis]].

==Greece as Third World country==
American historian Stavrianos was a follower of British historian Toynbee and wrote in 1972 that&lt;ref&gt;Λ.Σ. Σταυριανός,''Η Ελλάδα σε επαναστατική περίοδο. Σαράντα χρόνια αγώνες'', Athens, Kalvos, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; "the first teaching given to us by History is that Greece is an underdeveloped country and therefore is part of the [[Third World]]". Toynbee, who, in 1922, had published a famous book on the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greek-Turkish War]] of 1919-1922,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, ''The Western Question in Greece and Turkey. A Study in the Contact of Civilizations'', New York,Howard Fertig, 1970. First edition: 1922&lt;/ref&gt; he also had placed Greece in the Third World. Furthermore, he considered Greece a victim of the West and condemned [[Western civilization]] as a failed civilization&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, "Why I Dislike Western Civilization", G.H. Muller, ed. ''The McGraw-Hill Reader'', New York, McGraw-Hill, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Party in China and Greece==
The concept of an Eastern Party, as a reaction to the West, existed in [[China]] in the 17th century. In the last days of the [[Ming dynasty]], the Chinese people were divided, like the Byzantines some centuries earlier, between supporters of Western [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and supporters of the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Mongols]]. The first were collaborating with the "[[Franks]]", the second with the "[[Tatars]]".&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Stavrianos, ''Global Rift. The Third World Comes of Age'', New York, Norton, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Eastern Party prevailed, and [[Beijing]] gave itself to the Tatars. Supported by the [[Jesuits]], the Chinese empress, the wife of the last Ming, was baptized as a Roman Catholic under the name Anne, and the heir of the throne, as a Catholic, had taken the name Constantine. The two queen mothers and many members of the royal court were also baptized as Roman Catholics.

Helen, a queen mother, sent, in 1650, a message to Pope [[Innocent X]] (1644-1655) and to the general of the Jesuits to beg for at least spiritual help for the rescue of the Ming dynasty. Finally, pro-Latin emperor [[Yongli]] was defeated. He fled to [[Burma]] and died there.

==Modern history==
From the first conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders in [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|1204]] to the second conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Fall of Constantinople|1453]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] raged the struggle between the two parties, the pro-Latin Western Party and the pro-Turkish Eastern Party. Final victory came to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Vasiliev, ''History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453'', Madison, University of Wisconsin Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Hellenoturkism]], in the 19th century, the opposition of the Eastern Party to the newly-born Greek nation state of 1821 continued. At the eve of the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-1913, three friends (writer Pericles Giannopoulos, diplomat [[Ion Dragoumis]] and officer Athanase Souliotis-Nikolaidis) struggled in their writings and political action to defeat the so-called "Frankish fanatics".&lt;ref&gt;D. Xanalatos, "The Greeks and the Turks on the Eve of the Balkan Wars: a Frustrated Plan", ''Balkan Studies'', Thessaloniki, no.2, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today ==
Historian [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], as a follower of Dragoumis, has relentlessly supported in all his writings, after the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, ''Συγκριτικὴ Ἱστορία Ἑλλάδος καὶ Τουρκίας στὸν 20ο αἰῶνα'', Athens, Hestia, 1978. (See the Comparative Table of the Western and Eastern Parties with their chief characteristics, p.31)&lt;/ref&gt; the ideology of the Eastern Party,&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, "Η ανατολική παράταξη στην Ελλάδα", ''Τότε'',no. 27, August 1985,p.54-68&lt;/ref&gt; along with a growing number of Greek scholars who followed in his path as [[John S. Romanides]]&lt;ref&gt;Ιωάννης Σ. Ρωμανίδης, ''Ῥωμηοσύνη, Ῥωμανία, Ῥούμελη'', Thessalonica, Pournaras, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;[[George Metallinos]],&lt;ref&gt;Γεώργιος Μεταλληνός, ''Πολιτικὴ και Θεολογία -Ἰδεολογία καὶ πράξη τοῦ ῥιζοσπάστη πολιτικοῦ Γεωργίου Τυπάλδου- Ἰακωβάτου'', Katerini, Tertios, 1990. (Biography of a chief promoter of the Eastern Party in the 19th century)&lt;/ref&gt; Kostas Sardelis,&lt;ref&gt;Κώστας Σαρδελής, ''Ἡ προδομένη παράδοση'',Tinos,2 volumes, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Christos Yannaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Χρήστος Γιανναράς, ''Orthodoxy and the West'',2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the first head of state of independent Greece, in 1828 to 1831, who was assassinated by the pro-Westerners, is considered the most famous leader of the Eastern Party in the history of Modern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Hélène E. Koukkou Jean Capodistria, 1776-1831 : ministre des affaires étrangères de Russie (1815-1822), premier gouverneur de la Grèce libérée (1828-1831)- Athens, Kauffmann, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction of Western Party==
The Eastern Party was understood from the civilizational point of view rather than that of a political party (in Greek παράταξη rather than κόμμα) and found itself in opposition to the Western Party, the Greek pro-Westerners, at least since the 15th century Italian Renaissance. Then, scores of Byzantine intellectuals fled to the West, to escape from the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. [[Plethon]] and [[Bessarion]] were some of the famous philosophers and theologians who fled to Italy at that time.

The gist of the intellectual differences between the two parties was explained by the minister of Foreign Affairs of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] in 1919, [[Alexandros Diomidis]] (who signed Dioméde in French) in the following words: "Monasticism, especially Mount Athos, a bastion of radical Orthodoxy... was overwhelmingly directing what we call today public opinion.... This uncompromising Byzantine mentality as represented by the leaders of the reactionary party, [Joseph] Bryennios [1350-1431], Markos Evgenikos and [[Gennadius II|Gennadios]], with their Easternized psychosynthesis and their phanatical antipathy to any Greek classical education, was nearer to the mentality of the Eastern Turks than to the spirit of classical Antiquity which flourished in the West. The Byzantine and Muslim worlds with time and with their continuous promiscuity had adopted common characteristics.... Both were anti-progressive and fatalists".&lt;ref&gt;Αλ. Ν. Διομήδης, Βυζαντιναὶ Μελέται, Athens, Papazisis, 1942, p.235 &amp; 371-372&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in the Summer 1993 issue of ''Foreign Affairs'', [[Samuel P. Huntington]] published his article [[Clash of Civilizations]] in which he disputed the idea that Greece belonged to the Western civilization, Westernizing professors of the Greek Universities Thanos Veremis and Theodore Couloumbis expressed their opposition to such a stand, which aimed at excluding Greece from Western civilization and accused their American colleague "of discovering new barbarians".&lt;ref&gt;"Και η Ελλάδα μεταξύ των νέων βαρβάρων: έτσι μας βλέπουν στις ΗΠΑ" ("Greece is Also Among the New Barbarians: That is How They View Us in the USA"), Eleftherotypia, Athens, 11 August 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute between the Western and the Eastern Parties took paramount proportions after the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek economic crisis]] started in 2009 and in the summer of 2015, with the decision of the leftist [[Alexis Tsipras|Tsipras]] government to organize a referendum on the relations of the country with the [[European Union]], Greece was once more split between West and East.&lt;ref&gt;"Δύση ή Ανατολή;Το ερώτημα του δημοψηφίσματος" («West or East? The Question of the Referendum»), Kathimerini, Athens, 28 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; "More than a Referendum. Will Greece exit the West?", Al Jazeera, 30 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emancipation Proclamation''', or '''Proclamation 95''', was a [[presidential proclamation]] and [[executive order]] issued by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863.  It changed the federal legal status of more than 3.5 million [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] in the designated areas of [[American South|the South]] from slave to free. As soon as a slave escaped the control of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the former slave became free. Ultimately, the rebel surrender [[Abolitionism#Civil War and final emancipation|liberated]] and resulted in the proclamation's application to all of the designated former slaves.  It did not cover slaves in Union areas that were freed by [[U.S. state|state]] action (or three years later by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]] in December 1865). It was issued as a war measure during the [[American Civil War]], directed to all of the areas in rebellion and all segments of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]] (including the Army and Navy) of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Political scientist Brian R. Dirck states: "The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order, itself a rather unusual thing in those days. Executive orders are simply presidential directives issued to agents of the executive department by its boss." {{cite book |author= Brian R. Dirck |title= The Executive Branch of Federal Government: People, Process, and Politics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wjSieiqLHzoC&amp;pg=PA102 |year=2007 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |page=102 |isbn= 978-1851097913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proclamation ordered the freedom of all slaves in ten states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Emancipation Proclamation |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration | accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was issued under the president's authority to suppress rebellion (war powers), it necessarily excluded areas not in rebellion, but still applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million slaves. The Proclamation was based on the president's constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emancipation Proclamation: Freedom's first steps|url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/emancipation-proclamation-freedoms-first-steps|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not a law passed by Congress. The Proclamation was issued in January 1863 after U.S government issued a series of warnings in the summer of 1862 under the [[Confiscation Acts|Second Confiscation Act]], allowing Southern Confederate supporters 60 days to surrender, or face confiscation of land and slaves. The Proclamation also ordered that suitable persons among those freed could be enrolled into the paid service of United States' forces, and ordered the Union Army (and all segments of the Executive branch) to "recognize and maintain the freedom of" the ex-slaves. The Proclamation did not compensate the owners, did not outlaw slavery, and did not grant citizenship to the ex-slaves (called [[Freedman|freedmen]]). It made the eradication of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] an explicit war goal, in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foner|2010|pp=239–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 25,000 to 75,000 slaves in regions where the US Army was active were immediately emancipated. It could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion, but, as the Union army took control of Confederate regions, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for freeing more than three and a half million slaves in those regions. Prior to the Proclamation, in accordance with the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], escaped slaves were either returned to their masters or held in camps as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] for later return. The Proclamation applied only to slaves in Confederate-held lands; it did not apply to those in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|four slave states]] that were not in rebellion ([[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[Missouri]], which were unnamed), nor to Tennessee (unnamed but occupied by Union troops since 1862) and lower Louisiana (also under occupation), and specifically excluded those counties of [[Virginia]] soon to form the state of [[West Virginia]]. Also specifically excluded (by name) were some regions already controlled by the Union army. Emancipation in those places would come after separate state actions or the December 1865 ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made slavery and [[indentured servitude]], except for those duly convicted of a crime, illegal everywhere subject to United States jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html | title=Amendments to the U.S. Constitution | accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state that did not end its rebellion against the Union by January 1, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur tells the story of the 100-day interval in ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the Confederate states restored themselves to the Union, and Lincoln's order was signed and took effect on January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation outraged white Southerners (and their sympathizers) who envisioned a race war. It angered some Northern Democrats, energized anti-slavery forces, and undermined elements in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: vol 6. War Becomes Revolution, 1862–1863'' (1960) pp. 231–41, 273&lt;/ref&gt; The Proclamation lifted the spirits of [[African American]]s both free and slave. It led many slaves to escape from their masters and get to Union lines to obtain their freedom, and to join the Union Army.

The Emancipation Proclamation broadened the goals of the Civil War. While slavery had been a major issue that led to the war, Lincoln's only mission at the start of the war was to maintain the Union. The Proclamation made freeing the slaves an explicit goal of the Union war effort. Establishing the abolition of slavery as one of the two primary war goals served to deter intervention by Britain and France.&lt;ref name="Howard Jones 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-2582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U.S., Lincoln pushed for passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], and insisted that [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] plans for Southern states require abolition in new state constitutions. Congress passed the 13th Amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote on January 31, 1865, and it was ratified by the states on December 6, 1865, ending legal slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] of 1787 did not use the word "slavery" but included several provisions about unfree persons. The [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] (in Article I, Section 2) allocated Congressional representation based "on the whole Number of free Persons" and "three fifths of all other Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Allain|title=The Legal Understanding of Slavery: From the Historical to the Contemporary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_KAvAjkEbsC&amp;pg=PA117|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=117|isbn=9780199660469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] (Article IV, Section 2), "[n]o person held to service or labour in one state" would be freed by escaping to another. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]] allowed Congress to pass legislation to outlaw the "Importation of Persons", but not until 1808.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——16"&gt;{{harvnb|Foner|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for purposes of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]—which states that, "No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"—slaves were understood as property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Allain|title=The Legal Understanding of Slavery: From the Historical to the Contemporary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_KAvAjkEbsC&amp;pg=PA119|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=119–120|isbn=9780199660469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property with ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857).&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 14. "Nineteenth century apologists for the expansion of slavery developed a political philosophy that placed property at the pinnacle of personal interests and regarded its protection to be the government's chief purpose. The Fifth Amendment's Just Compensation clause provided the proslavery camp with a bastion for fortifying the peculiar institution against congressional restrictions to its spread westward. Based on this property-rights centered argument, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in ''Dred Scott v. Sanford'' (1857), found the Missouri Compromise unconstitutionally violated due process."&lt;/ref&gt; Socially, slavery was also supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 18–23. "Constitutional protections of slavery coexisted with an entire culture of oppression. The peculiar institution reached many private aspects of human life, for both whites and blacks........ Even free Southern blacks lived in a world so legally constricted by racial domination that it offered only a deceptive shadow of freedom."&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, between 1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery, except the border states of Maryland and Delaware. Maryland did not abolish slavery until 1864,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/sc2600/sc2685/html/conv1864.html|title=Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1864|last=|first=|date=|website=msa.maryland.gov|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Delaware was one of the last states to hold onto slavery; it was still legal in Delaware when the thirteenth amendment was issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=Slavenorth.com|title=Slavery in Delaware|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost four million people at the beginning of the American Civil War, when most slave states sought to break away from the United States.&lt;ref name="Foner—2010——14&amp;amp;ndash;16"&gt;{{harvnb|Foner|2010|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery in peacetime was limited by the Constitution which before 1865, committed the issue to individual [[U.S. state|states]].&lt;ref name="Mackubin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |title=The Liberator |first=Thomas Owens |last=Mackubin |date=March 25, 2004 |work=National Review |publisher=National Review |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj?url=http://old.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the background of the [[American Civil War]], however, Lincoln issued the Proclamation under his authority as "[[Commander-in-chief|Commander in Chief]] of the Army and Navy" under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 2|Article II, section 2]] of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he claimed to have the martial power to free persons held as slaves in those states that were in rebellion "as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;Numerous slaves were being commanded to perform tasks to support the Confederate war effort, including making weapons.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not have Commander-in-Chief authority over the four [[Slave and free states|slave-holding states]] that were not in rebellion: [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]], and so those states were not named in the Proclamation.{{refn|The fourth paragraph of the proclamation explains that Lincoln issued it, "by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/transcript.html |title= The Emancipation Proclamation |date= January 1, 1863 |type= transcription |publisher= www.archives.gov |agency= U.S. National Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The fifth border jurisdiction, [[West Virginia]], where slavery remained legal but was in the process of being abolished, was, in January 1863, still part of the legally recognized, [[Restored Government of Virginia|"reorganized" state of Virginia]], based in Alexandria, which was in the Union (as opposed to the Confederate state of Virginia, based in Richmond).

==Coverage==
The Proclamation applied in the ten states that were still in rebellion in 1863, and thus did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland or Delaware) which were Union states. Those slaves were freed by later separate state and federal actions.

The state of [[Tennessee]] had already mostly returned to Union control, under a recognized Union government, so it was not named and was exempted. [[Virginia]] was named, but exemptions were specified for the 48 counties then in the process of forming the new state of [[West Virginia]], and seven additional counties and two cities in the Union-controlled [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freedmen and Southern Society Project|title=Freedom: a documentary history of emancipation 1861–1867 : selected from the holdings of the National Archives of the United States.

[[File:Am Arch Sculpt 4.jpg|thumb|left|The moment portrayed by [[Lee Lawrie]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]]]

The Emancipation Proclamation has been ridiculed, notably in an influential passage by [[Richard Hofstadter]] for "freeing" only the slaves over which the Union had no power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Striner| first=Richard|title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=192 (citing Hofstadter's 1948 essay, in which he relates, in part, a sardonic remark by [[William H. Seward|William Seward]])|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These slaves were freed due to Lincoln's "war powers". This act cleared up the issue of [[contraband]] slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidler| first=David| title=Encyclopedia of the American Civil War| year=2000| publisher=ABC-CLIO| page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt; It automatically clarified the status of over 100,000 now-former slaves. Some 20,000 to 50,000 slaves were freed the day it went into effect&lt;ref name=SIFBEP/&gt; in parts of nine of the ten states to which it applied (Texas being the exception).&lt;ref name=AEPLRES&gt;William C.

The Proclamation provided the legal framework for the emancipation of nearly all four million slaves as the Union armies advanced, and committed the Union to ending slavery, which was a controversial decision even in the North. Hearing of the Proclamation, more slaves quickly escaped to Union lines as the Army units moved South. As the Union armies advanced through the Confederacy, thousands of slaves were freed each day until nearly all (approximately 3.9 million, according to the 1860 Census)&lt;ref name=1860Census&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/slavery/slave-maps/slave-census.htm |title=Census, Son of the South |author= |year=1860|publisher=sonofthesouth.net |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were freed by July 1865.

While the Proclamation had freed most slaves as a war measure, it had not made slavery illegal.

==Background==

===Military action prior to emancipation===
The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners. During the war, Union generals such as [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] declared that slaves in occupied areas were [[contraband (American Civil War)|contraband of war]] and accordingly refused to return them.&lt;ref name="NYT_20110411"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html| date=April 1, 2011| title=How Slavery Really Ended in America| author=Adam Goodheart| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was controversial because it implied [[diplomatic recognition|recognition]] of the Confederacy as a separate, independent sovereign state under international law, a notion that Lincoln steadfastly denied. As a result, he did not promote the contraband designation. In addition, as contraband, these people were legally designated as "property" when they crossed Union lines and their ultimate status was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/cwdw/historyculture/living-contraband-former-slaves-in-the-capital-during-and-after-the-civil-war.htm | title=Living Contraband – Former Slaves in the Nation's Capital During the Civil War | publisher=National Park Service | work=Civil War Defenses of Washington | accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental action towards emancipation===
{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
In December 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message to Congress (the [[State of the Union Address]], but then typically given in writing and not referred to as such). In it he praised the free labor system, as respecting human rights over property rights; he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states, possibly through buying their freedom with federal taxes, and also the funding of strictly voluntary colonization efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Striner| first=Richard| title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=147–148|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1862, [[Thaddeus Stevens]], the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] leader in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves, arguing that emancipation, by forcing the loss of enslaved labor, would ruin the rebel economy. On March 13, 1862, Congress approved a "Law Enacting an Additional Article of War", which stated that from that point onward it was forbidden for Union Army officers to return fugitive slaves to their owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S., Statutes at Large, Treaties, and Proclamations of the United States of America |volume=12 |location=Boston |year=1863 |page=354.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1862, Congress declared that the federal government would compensate slave owners who freed their slaves. Slaves in the [[Geography of Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] were freed on April 16, 1862, and their owners were compensated.

On June 19, 1862, Congress prohibited slavery in all current and future [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States#List of organized incorporated territories|United States territories]] (though not in the states), and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation. By this act, they repudiated the 1857 opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott Case]]'' that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories.&lt;ref&gt;Guminski, Arnold.

This joint action by Congress and President Lincoln also rejected the notion of [[popular sovereignty]] that had been advanced by [[Stephen A.

In July, Congress passed and Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]], containing provisions for court proceedings to liberate slaves held by convicted "rebels", or of slaves of rebels that had escaped to Union lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact2.htm |title=The Second Confiscation Act, July 17, 1862 |publisher=History.umd.edu | accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act applied in cases of criminal convictions and to those who were slaves of "disloyal" masters.  However, Lincoln's position continued to be that Congress lacked power to free all slaves within the borders of rebel held states, but Lincoln as commander in chief could do so if he deemed it a proper military measure,&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David.

[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] had long been urging Lincoln to free all slaves. In the summer of 1862, Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential [[New York Tribune]] wrote a famous editorial entitled "The Prayer of Twenty Millions" demanding a more aggressive attack on the Confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves: "On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one ... intelligent champion of the Union cause who does not feel ... that the rebellion, if crushed tomorrow, would be renewed if slavery were left in full vigor and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Holzer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA4lXY3W8hkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President]'', Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln responded in his [[q:Abraham Lincoln#Letter to Horace Greeley (1862)|Letter To Horace Greeley]] from August 22, 1862, in terms of the limits imposed by his duty as president to save the Union:

{{quote|If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.... I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume V, p. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln scholar [[Harold Holzer]] wrote in this context about Lincoln's letter: "Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Holzer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA4lXY3W8hkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President]'', Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Richard Striner argues that "for years" Lincoln's letter has been misread as "Lincoln only wanted to save the Union."&lt;ref name="Striner"&gt;{{cite book| last=Striner| first=Richard| title=Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=176|isbn=978-0-19-518306-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time.&lt;ref name="Striner"/&gt; In his 2014 book, ''[[Lincoln's Gamble]]'', journalist and historian [[Todd Brewster]] asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war—not as the mission itself.&lt;ref name="Brewster"&gt;{{cite book| last=Brewster| first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War|year=2014|publisher=Scribner|page=59|isbn=978-1451693867}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, [[Edward Bates]], for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Brewster| first=Todd| title=Lincoln's Gamble: The Tumultuous Six Months that Gave America the Emancipation Proclamation and Changed the Course of the Civil War|year=2014|publisher=Scribner|page=236|isbn=978-1451693867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicting advice, to free all slaves, or not free them at all, was presented to Lincoln in public and private. [[Thomas Nast]], a cartoon artist during the Civil War and the late 1800s considered "Father of the American Cartoon", composed many works including a two-sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after President Lincoln signed the Proclamation. Nast believed in equal opportunity and equality for all people, including enslaved Africans or free blacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nast]]&lt;/ref&gt; A mass rally in Chicago on September 7, 1862, demanded an immediate and universal emancipation of slaves. A delegation headed by [[William W. Patton]] met the president at the [[White House]] on September 13. Lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves. Even used as a war power, emancipation was a risky political act. Public opinion as a whole was against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOFHPTQYqzgC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There would be strong opposition among [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead]] Democrats and an uncertain reaction from loyal border states. Delaware and Maryland already had a high percentage of free blacks: 91.2% and 49.7%, respectively, in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln first discussed the proclamation with his cabinet in July 1862. He drafted his "preliminary proclamation" and read it to Secretary of State William Seward, and Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles, on July 13. Seward and Welles were at first speechless, then Seward referred to possible anarchy throughout the South and resulting foreign intervention; Welles apparently said nothing. On July 22, Lincoln presented it to his entire cabinet as something he had determined to do and he asked their opinion on wording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/alhtml/almintr.html | title=Emancipation Proclamation | publisher=Library of Congress and Knox College | work=Lincoln Papers | year=2002 | accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Secretary of War Edwin Stanton supported it, Seward advised Lincoln to issue the proclamation after a major Union victory, or else it would appear as if the Union was giving "its last shriek of retreat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Doris|title=Team of Rivals|year=2005|publisher=Blithedale Productions|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862, the [[Battle of Antietam]] gave Lincoln the victory he needed to issue the Emancipation. In the battle, though the Union suffered heavier losses than the Confederates and [[General McClellan]] allowed the escape of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s retreating troops, Union forces turned back a Confederate invasion of Maryland. On September 22, 1862, five days after Antietam occurred, and while living at the [[President Lincoln's Cottage|Soldier's Home]], Lincoln called his cabinet into session and issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals_iv/sections/preliminary_emancipation_proclamation.html# U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, 1862]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Civil War historian [[James M. McPherson]], Lincoln told Cabinet members that he had made a covenant with God, that if the Union drove the Confederacy out of Maryland, he would issue the Emancipation Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, James M. ''Battle Cry of Freedom'', (1988), p. 557&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FTsl3N7hDpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=six+months+at+the+white+house+carpenter#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |first=Frank B |last=Carpenter |authorlink=Francis Bicknell Carpenter |title=Six Months at the White House |year=1866 |page=90 |accessdate=2010-02-20 |isbn=978-1-4290-1527-1}} as reported by Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Portland Chase, September 22, 1862. Others present used the word ''resolution'' instead of ''vow to God''.&lt;br&gt;
[[Gideon Welles]], ''Diary of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy Under Lincoln and Johnson'' (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1911), 1:143, reported that Lincoln made a covenant with God that if God would change the tide of the war, Lincoln would change his policy toward slavery. See also Nicolas Parrillo, "Lincoln's Calvinist Transformation: Emancipation and War", ''Civil War History'' (September 1, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln had first shown an early draft of the proclamation to Vice President [[Hannibal Hamlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangorinfo.com/Focus/focus_hannibal_hamlin.html |title=Bangor In Focus: Hannibal Hamlin |publisher=Bangorinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ardent abolitionist, who was more often kept in the dark on presidential decisions. The final proclamation was issued January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, "as a necessary war measure" as the basis of the proclamation, rather than the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment. Some days after issuing the final Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to Major General [[John McClernand]]: "After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the "institution"; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States. They chose to disregard it, and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity. And being made, it must stand."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6/1:84.1?rgn=div2;view=fulltext;q1=broken+eggs "The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln]" edited by Roy P.

Initially, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves, those who were behind Union lines in areas not exempted. Most slaves were still behind Confederate lines or in exempted Union-occupied areas. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] commented, "We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free." Had any slave state ended its secession attempt before January 1, 1863, it could have kept slavery, at least temporarily. The Proclamation only gave the Lincoln Administration the legal basis to free the slaves in the areas of the South that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. It effectively destroyed slavery as the Union armies advanced south and conquered the entire Confederacy.

The Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 blacks, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war/ |title=Teaching With Documents: The Fight for Equal Rights: Black Soldiers in the Civil War|work=[[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contributions gave the North additional manpower that was significant in winning the war. The Confederacy did not allow slaves in their army as soldiers until the last month before its defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/csenlist.htm |title=Confederate Law Authorizing the Enlistment of Black Soldiers, as Promulgated in a Military Order |date=March 23, 1865|work=CSA General Orders, No. 14|publisher=Department of History, University of Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the counties of Virginia that were soon to form [[West Virginia]] were specifically exempted from the Proclamation (Jefferson County being the only exception), a condition of the state's [[admittance to the Union]] was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery (an immediate emancipation of all slaves was also adopted there in early 1865). Slaves in the border states of [[Maryland]] and [[Missouri]] were also emancipated by separate state action before the Civil War ended. In Maryland, a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on November 1, 1864. The Union-occupied counties of eastern Virginia and parishes of Louisiana, which had been exempted from the Proclamation, both adopted state constitutions that abolished slavery in April 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Virginia_Convention_of_1864|title=Constitutional Convention, Virginia (1864)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/april-1864-civil-war.htm|title=American Civil War April 1864 - History Learning Site|newspaper=History Learning Site|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1865, Tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm |title=Freedmen and Southern Society Project: Chronology of Emancipation |publisher=History.umd.edu |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/timelines/timeline_1861-1865.htm |title=TSLA: This Honorable Body: African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee |publisher=State.tn.us |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves in [[Kentucky]] and [[Delaware]] were not emancipated until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.

The Proclamation was issued in two parts. The first part, issued on September 22, 1862, was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the second part, which officially went into effect 100 days later on January 1, 1863, during the second year of the Civil War. It was Abraham Lincoln's declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the Confederacy that had not already returned to federal control by January 1863. The ten affected states were individually named in the second part (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[slave state]]s of [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]]. Also not named was the state of [[Tennessee]], in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become [[West Virginia]], seven other named counties of [[Virginia]] including Berkeley and Hampshire counties, &lt;!-- "to" here? --&gt; which were soon added &lt;!--omit "to" here? --&gt;to West Virginia, [[New Orleans]] and 13 named parishes nearby.

|As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. ... Some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.}}

Emancipation took place without violence by masters or ex-slaves. The Proclamation represented a shift in the war objectives of the North—reuniting the nation was no longer the only goal. It represented a major step toward the ultimate abolition of [[slavery in the United States]] and a "new birth of freedom".

[[File:A Visit from the Old Mistress.jpg|thumb|left|Winslow Homer's 1876 "A Visit from the Old Mistress" depicts a tense meeting between a group of newly freed slaves and their former slaveholder. [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]]]]

Runaway slaves who had escaped to Union lines had previously been held by the Union Army as "contraband of war" under the [[Confiscation Acts]]; when the proclamation took effect, they were told at midnight that they were free to leave. The [[Sea Islands]] off the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free.

Slaves had been part of the "engine of war" for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodheart|first=Adam|title=1861: The Civil War Awakening|year=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Washington Albright, a teenage slave in [[Mississippi]], recalled that like many of his fellow slaves, his father escaped to join Union forces. According to Albright, plantation owners tried to keep the Proclamation from slaves but news of it came through the "grapevine". The young slave became a "runner" for an informal group they called the ''4Ls'' ("Lincoln's Legal Loyal League") bringing news of the proclamation to secret slave meetings at plantations throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Sally, and John Stauffer.

[[Robert E. Lee]] saw the Emancipation Proclamation as a way for the Union to bolster the number of soldiers it could place on the field, making it imperative for the Confederacy to increase their own numbers.  Writing on the matter after the sack of Fredericksburg, Lee wrote "In view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy, of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death, if we would save the honor of our families from pollution, our social system from destruction, let every effort be made, every means be employed, to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies, until God, in his mercy, shall bless us with the establishment of our independence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Civil War, a Narrative: Fredericksburg to Meridian|author=Shelby Foote|volume=Volume 2|year=1963|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's request for a drastic increase of troops would go unfulfilled.

The Proclamation was immediately denounced by [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery. [[Horatio Seymour]], while running for the governorship of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners, saying it was "a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe".&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite book|title=Copperheads: the rise and fall of Lincoln's opponents in the North|last=Weber|first=Jennifer L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power. Editor Henry A. Reeves wrote in Greenport's ''Republican Watchman'' that "In the name of freedom of Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test a utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their Stead."&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

Racism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North supported the war only as an effort to force the South to stay in the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery, were now declared lies by their opponents citing the Proclamation. Copperhead David Allen spoke to a rally in Columbiana, Ohio, stating, "I have told you that this war is carried on for the Negro. There is the proclamation of the President of the United States. Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Brithren&lt;!--quote in cited source uses 'i', not 'e'--&gt; of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weber|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k4aPFovq9m8C&amp;pg=PA65 65]}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut, H. B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to "those stupid thick-headed persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution".&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

[[War Democrats]] who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South, and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

Lincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the preliminary copy of the Emancipation Proclamation by [[Habeas corpus in the United States#Presidential suspension of habeas corpus|suspending habeas corpus]]. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|1862 elections]], the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Lincoln's friend Orville Hickman Browning told the president that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been "disastrous" for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Javis of Connecticut pronounced the election the "beginning of the end of the utter downfall of [[Abolitionism in the United States]]".&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

Historians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results looked very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and "at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party's in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican.... Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate."&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; McPherson states "If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln's conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies."&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

====Confederate response====
The initial Confederate response was one of expected outrage. The Proclamation was seen as vindication for the rebellion, and proof that Lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rebel Message: What Jefferson Davis Has to Say|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX-K12&amp;p_theme=ahnp_k12&amp;p_nbid=E59Q56PUMTMyNTY5MTAwNy4yOTAyNjM6MToxMzozOC4xMDUuOTYuMjM4&amp;p_action=timelinedoc&amp;p_docref=v2:11A050B7B120D3F8@EANX-11AE489CABB99E68@2401523-11AE489CB81982E0@0-11AE489D1F55ED48@The+Rebel+Message.+The+Document+in+Full.+What+Jeff.+Davis+Says+of+President+Lincoln%27s+Emancipation+Proclamation&amp;d_doclabel=The+Rebel+Message%3A+What+Jefferson+Davis+Has+to+Say|work=New York Herald|publisher=America's Historical Newspapers|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 1863 letter to President Lincoln, U.S. Army general [[Ulysses S. Grant]] observed that the Proclamation, combined with the usage of black soldiers by the U.S. Army, profoundly angered the Confederacy, saying that "the emancipation of the Negro, is the heaviest blow yet given the Confederacy. The South rave a great deal about it and profess to be very angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|quote=I have given the subject of arming the Negro my hearty support.

The Confederacy stated that the black U.S. soldiers captured while fighting against the Confederacy would be tried as slave insurrectionists in civil courts—a capital offense with automatic sentence of death. Less than a year after the law's passage, the Confederates massacred black U.S. soldiers at [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bruce|last=Tap|title=The Fort Pillow Massacre: North, South, and the Status of African Americans in the Civil War Era|publisher=Routledge|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Confederates welcomed the Proclamation, as they believed it would strengthen pro-slavery sentiment in the Confederacy and, thus, lead to greater enlistment of white men into the Confederate army. According to one Confederate man from Kentucky, "The Proclamation is worth three hundred thousand soldiers to our Government at least... It shows exactly what this war was brought about for and the intention of its damnable authors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McPherson|first=James M.|date=1997|quote=The Proclamation is worth three hundred thousand soldiers to our Government at least...

One Union soldier from New York stated worryingly after the Proclamation's passage, "I know enough of the Southern spirit that I think they will fight for the institution of slavery even to extermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qhEHVki8tEC&amp;pg=PA108|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=108|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M.

As a result of the Proclamation, the price of slaves in the Confederacy increased in the months after its issuance, with one Confederate from South Carolina opining in 1865 that "now is the time for Uncle to buy some negro women and children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qhEHVki8tEC&amp;pg=PA108|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=108|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M.

===International impact===
As Lincoln had hoped, the Proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the Union by gaining the support of anti-slavery countries and countries that had already abolished slavery (especially the developed countries in Europe such as Great Britain or France). This shift ended the Confederacy's hopes of gaining official recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. May|title=The Union, the Confederacy, and the Atlantic rim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIspT4gpgUAC|year=1995|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-061-5|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIspT4gpgUAC&amp;pg=PA29 29–68]|chapter=History and Mythology : The Crisis over British Intervention in the Civil War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Emancipation Proclamation made the eradication of slavery an explicit Union war goal, it linked support for the South to support for slavery. Public opinion in Britain would not tolerate direct support for slavery. British companies, however, continued to build and operate [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] for the South. As [[Henry Adams]] noted, "The Emancipation Proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy." In Italy, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] hailed Lincoln as "the heir of the aspirations of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]". On August 6, 1863, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: "Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure".&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Abel Haywood, a representative for workers from [[Manchester]], England, wrote to Lincoln saying, "We joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders: 'All men are created free and equal.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|author=James Lander|title=Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaTnoZ_uYlUC&amp;pg=PA221|year=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|page=221|isbn=9780809329908}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emancipation Proclamation served to ease tensions with Europe over the North's conduct of the war, and combined with the recent failed Southern offensive at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], to cut off any practical chance for the Confederacy to receive British support in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Phillips|title=The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, Civil Warfare, And The Triumph Of Anglo-America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tsir90xfo4C&amp;pg=PA493|year=2000|page=493|isbn=9780465013708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gettysburg Address==
Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in November 1863 made indirect reference to the Proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase "new birth of freedom". The Proclamation solidified Lincoln's support among the rapidly growing abolitionist element of the Republican Party and ensured that they would not block his re-nomination in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: vol 6. War Becomes Revolution, 1862–1863'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction (1863)==
In December 1863, Lincoln issued his ''[[Ten percent plan|Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction]]'', which dealt with the ways the rebel states could reconcile with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].  Key provisions required that the states accept the ''Emancipation Proclamation'' and thus the freedom of their slaves, and accept the [[Confiscation Acts]], as well as the Act banning of slavery in United States territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fa2_G9yaX38C&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=proclamation+of+amnesty+and+reconstruction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwPC9_abcAhUs94MKHau5BKs4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=proclamation%2520of%2520amnesty%2520and%2520reconstruction&amp;f=false |title=The A to Z of the Civil War and Reconstruction |last=Richter |first=William L. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780810863361 |pages=479-480 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postbellum==
[[File:EMANCI4.jpg|thumb|Emancipation from Freedmen's viewpoint, illustration from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' 1865]]

Near the end of the war, abolitionists were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation would be construed solely as a war measure, Lincoln's original intent, and would no longer apply once fighting ended. They were also increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect in November 1864. Slavery in Missouri was ended by executive proclamation of its governor, Thomas C. Fletcher, on January 11, 1865.

Winning re-election, Lincoln pressed the [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], banning slavery in all [[U.S. state]]s and territories. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were about 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.&lt;ref name="1860Census"/&gt;

==Critiques==
{{further information|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
As the years went on and American life continued to be deeply unfair towards blacks, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. Perhaps the strongest attack was [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett's]] ''[[Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream]]'' (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. In his ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation'', [[Allen C. Guelzo]] noted the professional historians' lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was the US's "last [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[politician]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOFHPTQYqzgC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such was dedicated to removing slavery strictly within the bounds of law.

Other historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished within the tensions of his cabinet and a society at war, for his own growth in political and moral stature, and for the promise he held out to the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Kearns Goodwin, ''A Team of Rivals'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As [[Eric Foner]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lincoln was not an abolitionist or Radical Republican, a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held racist views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027065400/http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |archivedate=2004-10-27 |deadurl=no |title=review of ''Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream'' by Lerone Bennett, Jr. |first=Eric |last=Foner |publisher=Los Angeles Times Book Review |date=April 9, 2000 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kal Ashraf wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps in rejecting the critical dualism–Lincoln as individual emancipator pitted against collective self-emancipators–there is an opportunity to recognise the greater persuasiveness of the combination. In a sense, yes: a racist, flawed Lincoln did something heroic, and not in lieu of collective participation, but next to, and enabled, by it. To venerate a singular –Great Emancipator' may be as reductive as dismissing the significance of Lincoln's actions. Who he was as a man, no one of us can ever really know.

==Legacy in the civil rights era==

===Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.===
[[File:President Barack Obama views the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office 2010-01-18.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] views the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office next to a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] made many references to the Emancipation Proclamation during the [[civil rights movement]]. These include a speech made at an observance of the hundredth anniversary of the issuing of the Proclamation made in New York City on September 12, 1962 where he placed it alongside the Declaration of Independence as an "imperishable" contribution to civilization, and "All tyrants, past, present and future, are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations". He lamented that despite a history where the United States "proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents", it "sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles". He concluded "There is but one way to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. That is to make its declarations of freedom real; to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world, and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/anti/historyculture/mlk-ep.htm|title=Dr. Martin Luther King on the Emancipation Proclamation|publisher=National Park Service|author=Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's most famous invocation of the Emancipation Proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] (often referred to as the "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech). King began the speech saying "Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/i-have-dream|title=I Have A Dream|publisher=The King Center|date=August 28, 1963|author=Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The "Second Emancipation Proclamation"====
{{Main article|Second Emancipation Proclamation}}
In the early 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates developed a strategy to call on President [[John F. Kennedy]] to bypass a Southern segregationist opposition in the Congress by issuing an [[executive order]] to put an end to segregation. This envisioned document was referred to as the "Second Emancipation Proclamation".

===President John F. Kennedy===
On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy appeared on national television to address the issue of civil rights. Kennedy, who had been routinely criticized as timid by some of the leaders of the civil rights movement, told Americans that [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|two black students had been peacefully enrolled]] in the University of Alabama with the aid of the National Guard despite the opposition of Governor [[George Wallace]].

John Kennedy called it a "moral issue"&lt;ref name=Peniel/&gt; Invoking the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation he said 

{{cquote|One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free. We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The [[Birmingham campaign|events in Birmingham]] and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=237 – Radio and Television Report to the American People on Civil Rights|date=June 11, 1963|author=John F.

In the same speech, Kennedy announced he would introduce comprehensive civil rights legislation to the United States Congress which he did a week later (he continued to push for its passage until his assassination in November 1963). Historian [[Peniel E. Joseph]] holds Lyndon Johnson's ability to get that bill, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], passed on July 2, 1964 was aided by "the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech" which turned "the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal".&lt;ref name=Peniel&gt;{{cite news |title=Kennedy's Finest Moment |author=Peniel E.

===President Lyndon B. Johnson===
During the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] invoked the Emancipation Proclamation holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented.

As Vice President while speaking from Gettysburg on May 30, 1963 (Memorial Day), at the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, Johnson connected it directly with the ongoing civil rights struggles of the time saying "One hundred years ago, the slave was freed. One hundred years later, the Negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin.... In this hour, it is not our respective races which are at stake—it is our nation. Let those who care for their country come forward, North and South, white and Negro, to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision.... Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent we shall have fallen short of assuring freedom to the free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson|date=May 30, 1963|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/630530.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329112921/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/630530.asp|archivedate=March 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As president, Johnson again invoked the proclamation in a speech presenting the [[Voting Rights Act]] at a joint session of Congress on Monday, March 15, 1965. This was one week after violence had been inflicted on peaceful civil rights marchers during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. Johnson said "... it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And [[We Shall Overcome#Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements|we shall overcome]]. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed—more than 100 years—since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln—a great President of another party—signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed—more than 100 years—since equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Shall Overcome|author=Lyndon B.

In [[List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes#Season Four (1963-64)|episode 86]] of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', Andy asks [[Barney Fife|Barney]] to explain the Emancipation Proclamation to [[Opie Taylor|Opie]] who is struggling with history at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvland.com/shows/andy-griffith-show/episode-guide/season-3|title=Episode Guide|work=tvland.com|publisher=[[TV Land]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113044056/http://www.tvland.com/shows/andy-griffith-show/episode-guide/season-3|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barney brags about his history expertise, yet it is apparent he cannot answer Andy's question.

'''''Estep v. United States''''', 327 U.S. 114 (1946), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a [[draft board]]'s refusal to classify a [[Jehovah's Witness]] as minister is, after exhausting administrative remedies, subject to [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name=caselaw&gt;{{ussc|name=Estep v. United States|volume=327|page=114|pin=|year=1946}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
According to the judicial opinion itself:&lt;ref name=caselaw/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Estep's local board classified him as I-A, i.e., as available for military service. Sec. 5(d) of the [[Selective Service Act of 1948|Selective Service Act]] exempts from training and service (but not from registration) "regular or duly ordained ministers of religion". Under the regulations those in that category are classified as IV-D. Estep, a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, claimed that he was entitled to that classification. The local board ruled against him. He took his case to the appeal board which classified him as I-A. He then asked the State and National Directors of Selective Service to appeal to the President for him. His request was refused. The local board thereupon ordered him to report for induction. He reported at the time and place indicated. He was accepted by the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. But he refused to be inducted, claiming that he was exempt from service because he was an ordained minister of the gospel. He was indicted under  11 of the Act for wilfully failing and refusing to submit to induction. He sought to defend on the ground that as a Jehovah's Witness he was a minister of religion and that he had been improperly denied exemption from service, because the classifying agencies acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to classify him as IV-D.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Firearm ownership law in the [[People's Republic of China]]''' heavily regulates [[firearms ownership]]. Generally, private citizens are not allowed to possess firearms.

==History==
[[File:Chengqilou gun hole.JPG|thumb|right|Gun port of Chengqilou in a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Fujian Tulou]].]]
[[File:Gun for defense.JPG|thumb|right| A firearm for defence against enemies in a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Fujian Tulou]].]]

During the Ming and Qing dynasties [[matchlock]] [[musket]]s were used in China. The Chinese used the term "bird-gun" to refer to muskets.&lt;ref name="Chase2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Warren Chase|title=Firearms: A Global History to 1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=7 July 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82274-9|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work ''Guangdong xinyu'', Cantonese scholar [[Qu Dajun]] recorded the use of guns by Cantonese boys in [[Guangdong]] province.&lt;ref&gt;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk3t096 203-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《廣東新語》卷十六，《器語》&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E5%BB%A3%E6%9D%B1%E6%96%B0%E8%AA%9E/%E5%8D%B702#.E6.A2.85.F0.A4.83.9C|title=廣東新語/卷02|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Solons]] were ordered by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] to stop using rifles and instead practice traditional archery issuing an edict for silver taels to be issued for guns to turned over to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchustudiesgroup.org/2013/03/09/the-solon-way-2012-edition/|title=Gun Control, Qing Style|work=Manchu Studies Group|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrows and bows instead of muskets were also demanded in Jilin of Manchu Bannermen by the [[Jiaqing Emperor]].&lt;ref name="Rhoads2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward J. M. Rhoads|title=Manchus and Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861–1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiM2pF5PDR8C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98040-9|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Family Magazine" stated in 1837 that
The possession of firearms is altogether forbidden by the jealous government, as may be seen from the following extract from a Peking gazette:—" For the people to have firearms in their possession, is contrary to law, and orders have already been issued to each provincial government to fix a period, within which all matchlocks belonging to individuals should be bought up at a valuation With regard to those firearms which are in immediate use for the safeguard of the country, the said governour has already directed the proper officers to carve on every matchlock the name of the person to whom it is delivered, and to preserve a general register of the whole. Let the governour also give strict charge to make diligent search, and prevent the illicit storing up of firearms for the future ; and let the workers in iron be rigidly looked after, lest they clandestinely manufacture and sell them ; the evil may thus be cut off in its commencement. Those officers who have made full and complete musters within the limited period, the governour is directed to notice properly as an encouragement to others." Those Chinese near Canton, who employ themselves in shooting wild-fowl for sale, are said to belong mostly to the militia of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Family Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Z7PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=military+examinations+administered+surprising+knowledge+of+firearms&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=possession%20of%20firearms%20is%20forbidden%20peking%20government&amp;f=false|year=1837|publisher=J. A. James &amp; Company|pages=309–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the New Policies Reform era of the late Qing, the government allowed the ordinary civilians to own firearms (matchlock or modern foreign gun) for self-defense. This policy lasted until the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[Taiwan under Qing rule]] the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] on Taiwan owned matchlock muskets. Han people traded and sold matchlock muskets to the [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. The Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets to defeat the Americans in the [[Formosa Expedition]]. During the [[Sino-French War]] the Hakka and Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets against the French in the [[Keelung Campaign]] and [[Battle of Tamsui]].

Liu Mingchuan took measures to reinforce Tamsui, in the river nine torpedo mines were planted and the entrance was blocked with ballast boats filled with stone which were sunk on September 3, matchlock armed "Hakka hill people" were used to reinforce the mainland Chinese battalion, and around the British Consulate and Customs House at the Red Fort hilltop, Shanghai Arsenal manufactured Krupp guns were used to form an additional battery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hlnKRaZ0f4QC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=taiwan+matchlocks+stones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZHBJVMP8HKz-sATi64HADQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=taiwan%20matchlocks%20stones&amp;f=false Tsai 2009,] [https://books.google.com/books?id=abMMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=taiwan+matchlocks+stones&amp;dq=taiwan+matchlocks+stones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZHBJVMP8HKz-sATi64HADQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw p. 97.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At Tamsui, the entrance of the river had been closed by laying down six torpedoes in the shape of a semi-circle on the inside of the bar. The Douglas steamers Fokien and Hailoong running to the port, as well as the German steamer Welle, were, whenever necessary, piloted over the torpedoes by the Chinese who had laid them down. The mandarins engaged in planting the guns that had been brought to the island by the latter steamer.

Trade was resumed during the middle of the month at Twatutia, it being regarded for the time as safe, and the country thereabouts had quieted down to such an extent that a good deal of tea was brought in. Life for the foreigners was very much cramped. They were prohibited from making trips into the country; and even in the settlement, with religious processions, crackers, and, gongs going at all times of day, and the watchmen making a great noise with bamboos all night, rest was well nigh impossible except to the Chinese guards told off to protect foreign hongs, who after disappearing all day, except at meal times, "return at night, and instead of guarding the property, turn in early and sleep as soundly as Rip van Winkle did till morning."

Under the impression that the French would attempt to enter the Tamsui river, ballast boats and junks loaded with stones were sunk at the entrance. A number of Hakka hillmen were added to the government force. They were armed with their own matchlocks, which in their ignc ranee they preferred to foreign rifles. Much was expected of them, as the life of warfare they had led on the savage border had trained them to be good shots and handy with their knives.
By the end of August the French had succeeded in holding the shore line at Kelung, but were unable to advance beyond it; and as Chinese soldiers had for some days been erecting earthworks and digging entrenchments on the hills on the east side of the bay overlooking the shipping, the French sent word ashore for the Europeans to come on board the Bayard, as they intended opening fire on the earthworks which were now just visible.1 The firing was not successful either that day or the next, the nature of the country being in favor of the Chinese; and for many days the shelling was a regular event, the Chinese not apparently suffering much damage themselves, or being able to inflict any upon the French. This condition of affairs continued through September, the French having gained only the summits of the near hills surrounding the harbor.

General Liu Ming-chuan left Kelung on the 9th to visit Tamsui and Taipehfu. On his arrival at the latter place he was met at the wharf by some 200 soldiers, 5 buglers, and 2 or 3 drummers. The march up the street with the soldiers in front, the band next, and the general in the rear in his chair, made an imposing parade. His presence is also said to have had a most stimulating effect on the soldiers on guard in the foreign hongs. All appeared in full force with uniforms and rifles, although for several days the muster in one hong had produced only one soldier and a boy in a soldier's coat.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Liu Ming-chuan with some 6,000 men was stationed at Taipehfu in the Banka plain, while the forces at Hobe were daily strengthened, until, in the middle of October, there were assembled about 6,000 men in the neighborhood. Among these were new levies of Hakka hillmen. They were considered by the foreigners to be a dangerous lot to have in the neighborhood, and as they did not speak the same language as the general and other officers, it was feared that misunderstandings might arise with serious results. The other soldiers present were principally northern men, and were said to be well armed. The Hakkas, although armed with their primitive matchlocks, were considered to be brave men and were hardened to the privations of warfare. Their matchlocks are described as long-barrelled guns, fixed into semi-circular shaped stocks, with pans for priming powder, and armlets made of rattan, worn around the right wrist and containing pieces of bark-cord, which, when lighted, would keep alight for hours, if necessary. When in action the Hakka pours a charge of powder down the muzzle; on top of that are dropped two or three slug shot or long pieces of iron, withouL wadding. The trigger is made to receive the lighted piece of bark, and when powder covers the priming pan and all is ready, • the trigger is pulled and if,—if the weather is dry, off goes the gun. The ordinary method of handling these weapons is to place the lower end of the butt against the right breast, high enough to enable the curved end to rest against the cheek, and the eye to look down the large barrel, upon which there are ordinarily no sights. This method is sometimes varied by discharging the guns from the hip, and it is quite customary for the Hakka to lie flat on his back, place the muzzle between his toes, and, raising his head sufficiently to sight along the barrel, to take deliberate aim and fire. He is able to make good practice; while his presence, especially when surrounded by rank grass, is decidedly difficult to determine.

Rev. Dr. Mackay's Tamsui Mission Hospital, with Dr. Johansen in charge, which had rendered such great services to the Chinese wounded and had no doubt been the means of saving many lives, was visited on the 19th by General Sun, who thanked the doctor in charge as well as Dr. Browne of the Cockcliafer (who had given valuable assistance) for their attentions to the sick and wounded. The patients then numbered only a dozen, a good many of the wounded having left, fearing that the French might land again and kill them; others, seeing their wounds healing nicely, went away into the town. One man who had been shot through the left shoulder, in the region of the collar bone, after a week or ten days' treatment suddenly shouldered his rifle and left for the front, preferring life with his comrades to being confined in the hospital. It was supposed that the bullet had pierced the upper part of his lungs. Another instance occurred seven days after the French landing, when a Chinese walked into the hospital with his skull wounded and the brain visible. Several others, shot through the thighs and arms, bones being splintered in many pieces, bore their pain most heroically. Soon after the engagement, when there were seventy men in the hospital, some being badly wounded with as many as three shots apiece, there was scarcely a groan to be heard. One of the wounded came to the hospital after having had a bullet in his calf for nine or ten days. Dr. Browne extracted the bullet, and off the man went back to the front. Many other instances like the foregoing might be recorded, all of which indicated that the Chinese could recover in a few days from wounds, which, if not actually fatal, would have laid foreign soldiers up for months.

Lin Ch'ao-tung (林朝棟) was the leader of the Hakka militia recruited by Liu Ming-ch'uan.&lt;ref&gt;Rouil, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hakka used their matchlock muskets to resist the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)]] and Han Taiwanese and Aboriginals conducted an insurgency against Japanese rule. The [[Beipu uprising]], [[Tapani incident]].

During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japan's rule on Taiwan]], Japan implemented anti-gun laws against the [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. This led to the outbreak of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule#Annexation and armed resistance|armed insurrection by Aboriginals against the Japanese]] in response to the Japanese confiscating Aboriginal guns. The Bunun and Atayal were described as the "most ferocious" Aboriginals, and police stations were targeted by Aboriginals in intermittent assaults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4gAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+savages+of++Taiyal+and+Bunun+tribes+are+known+as+the+most+ferocious+of+all+...+++++Occasional+raids+on+police+stations+and+head-hunting+of+innocent+people+were+committed+after+that,+owing+to+the+instigation+of+malcontents.+The+worst+outbreak+that+took+place+was+the+Musha+Incident+in+October,+1930,+which+culminated+in+the+sending+of+troops.&amp;dq=The+savages+of++Taiyal+and+Bunun+tribes+are+known+as+the+most+ferocious+of+all+...+++++Occasional+raids+on+police+stations+and+head-hunting+of+innocent+people+were+committed+after+that,+owing+to+the+instigation+of+malcontents.+The+worst+outbreak+that+took+place+was+the+Musha+Incident+in+October,+1930,+which+culminated+in+the+sending+of+troops.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cW8YVaiUBcWuggT0uIKYAQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA The Japan Year Book 1937], p. 1004.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1915, all Aboriginals in northern Taiwan were forced to hand over their guns to the Japanese, however head hunting and assaults on police stations by Aboriginals still continued after that year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4gAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+Four+Tribes+The+savages+of+the+Taiyal+and+Bunun+tribes+are+known+as+the+most+ferocious+of+all.+...+The+confiscation+of+their+arms+was+one+of+the+important+tasks.+All+arms+were+given+up+to+the+Japanese+authorities+by+the+northern+aborigines+in+1914.This+completed+the+task+of+aboriginal+pacification+in+January,+1915.+%C2%A3+Occasional+raids+on+police+stations+and+^+head-hunting+of+innocent+people+were+%22^+committed+after+that,+owing+to+...&amp;dq=The+Four+Tribes+The+savages+of+the+Taiyal+and+Bunun+tribes+are+known+as+the+most+ferocious+of+all.+...+The+confiscation+of+their+arms+was+one+of+the+important+tasks.+All+arms+were+given+up+to+the+Japanese+authorities+by+the+northern+aborigines+in+1914.This+completed+the+task+of+aboriginal+pacification+in+January,+1915.+%C2%A3+Occasional+raids+on+police+stations+and+^+head-hunting+of+innocent+people+were+%22^+committed+after+that,+owing+to+...&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lXMYVfnbCIHCggTqvYLwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA The Japan Year Book 1937], p. 1004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q13dXd25_04C&amp;q=The+Four+Tribes+The+savages+of+the+Taiyal+and+Bunun+tribes+are+known+as+the+most+ferocious+of+all.+...+The+confiscation+of+their+arms+was+one+of+the+important+tasks.+All+arms+were+given+up+to+the+Japanese+authorities+by+the+northern+aborigines+in+1914.This+completed+the+task+of+aboriginal+pacification+in+January,+1915.+%C2%A3+Occasional+raids+on+police+stations+and+^+head-hunting+of+innocent+people+were+%22^+committed+after+that,+owing+to+...&amp;dq=The+Four+Tribes+The+savages+of+the+Taiyal+and+Bunun+tribes+are+known+as+the+most+ferocious+of+all.+...+The+confiscation+of+their+arms+was+one+of+the+important+tasks.+All+arms+were+given+up+to+the+Japanese+authorities+by+the+northern+aborigines+in+1914.This+completed+the+task+of+aboriginal+pacification+in+January,+1915.+%C2%A3+Occasional+raids+on+police+stations+and+^+head-hunting+of+innocent+people+were+%22^+committed+after+that,+owing+to+...&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lXMYVfnbCIHCggTqvYLwAw&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ ed.

Raho Ari's revolt, called the Dafen incident [[w:zh:大分事件]] was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the Aboriginals in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over. The revolt began at Dafen when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari's clan in 1915. A settlement holding 266 people called Tamaho was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the Laonong River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause. Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese "guardline" of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YOoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Raho+Ari&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PTYSC8s1X1&amp;sig=C1LuNrDq0TwO2poUsitZyo8vjvw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEG3VKV2g66CBMLDgrAB&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Raho%20Ari&amp;f=false Crook 2014], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==

Firearms can be used by law enforcement, the military and [[paramilitary]], or security personnel protecting property of state importance (including the arms industry, financial institutions, storage of resources, and scientific research institutions).

Civilian ownership of firearms is largely restricted to non-individual entities such as sporting organisations, hunting reserves, and [[wildlife]] protection, management and research organizations. The chief exception to the general ban for individual gun ownership is for the purpose of [[hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd.xinhuanet.com/qdzfw/2006-03/02/content_6359961.htm |title=中华人民共和国枪支管理法 (Firearm Administration Law of the People's Republic of China)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who hold [[hunting permit]]s can apply to purchase and hold firearms for the purpose of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nre.cn/htm/04/flfg/2004-03-25-10816.htm |title=中华人民共和国猎枪弹具管理办法 (Hunting Firearm, Ammunition and Equipment Administration Regulation of the People's Republic of China)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal possession or sale of firearms may result in a minimum punishment of 3 years in prison, with the maximum being the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/21/content_856308.htm |title=China Reiterates Stance on Gun Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possession of traditional smoothbore blackpowder muskets is allowed to some [[Miao people|Miao]] hill people, the so-called Miao gun tribes, as an essential element of traditional dress and culture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Jason |date=23 August 2013|title=China's Last Armed Village|url=http://widerimage.reuters.com/story/chinas-last-armed-village|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|location= |access-date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, possession of gunpowder is regulated.

Even airsoft guns are tightly regulated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2008-02/27/content_902728.htm |title="Public Security Bureau notice of "Recognized standard of an imitation gun"" (Legal issues in airsoft)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and violation may lead to a criminal conviction for illegal possession of firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Jason |date=23 August 2013|title=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20160121/BLOG10/160129947/why-did-they-destroy-320-000-plastic-toy-guns|newspaper=[[Plastic News]]|location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guns and knives which were not logged and were unlawful were seized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1289052/beijing-bans-knife-sales-after-two-killing-sprees&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations were placed on knife vending due to terrorism and violent assaults where they were utilized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-c1-china-uighur-knives-20140917-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special Administrative Regions ==
Firearm ownership in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau is tightly controlled and possession is mainly in the hands of law enforcement, military, or private security firms (providing protection for jewelers and banks). Still, possessing, manufacturing, importing, or exporting [[airsoft gun]]s with a muzzle energy not above two joules of kinetic energy is legal to citizens in China's SARs.

Firearms control was inherited during British and Portuguese rule and more or less retained today. Under the Section 13 of Cap 238 [[Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance]] of the Hong Kong law, unrestricted firearms and ammunition requires a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/04_crime_matters/cpa/cpa_at_01.html|title=Do not carry restricted items in Hong Kong|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those found in possession without a license could be fined HKD$100,000 and imprisonment for up to 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/238/s13.html|title=CAP 238 FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION ORDINANCE s 13 Possession of arms or ammunition without licence|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HB 87 requires businesses in Georgia with more than 10 employees to use [[E-Verify]] to verify that prospective employees are eligible to work in the [[United States]] legally. The bill allows police in the state to attempt to determine the immigration status of some suspects.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt; It also makes the intentional transportation of undocumented immigrants while a crime is being committed punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and a prison sentence of up to a year. In addition, it punishes undocumented workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment with up to 15 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

==Similarity to Arizona's SB 1070==
Commentators noted that HB 87 was similar to other anti-illegal immigration laws that had recently been passed in other U.S. states, such as Arizona SB 1070.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt; Some of HB 87's critics dubbed it a "copycat" of SB 1070, a claim that [[PolitiFact]] rated "half true" because, although the two laws are similar, the authors of HB 87 tried to address concerns about the constitutionality of such legislation. For instance, HB 87 merely &lt;em&gt;allows&lt;/em&gt; police to check the immigration status of suspects, whereas SB 1070 &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/mar/07/georgia-association-latino-elected-officials/immigration-bill-foes-label-legislation-arizona-co/ |title=Immigration bill foes label legislation an Arizona "copycat" |last=Mariano |first=Willoughby |date=2011-03-07 |website=Politifact |language=en |access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
When HB 87 was signed into law, it was widely described as one of the toughest such laws in the country. Multiple organizations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), also publicly raised the possibility of suing Georgia over the law.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; The bill was also criticized by the leaders of the [[Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights]] and the [[Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; The government of [[Mexico]] also criticized Deal for signing the bill into law, saying in a statement that "The legislators and state executive ignored the many contributions of the immigrant community to the economy and society of Georgia."&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Some critics, including [[Azadeh N. Shahshahani]] and [[Wade Henderson]], criticized the bill on the basis that it would invite [[racial profiling]] of [[Latino]]s and other people of color.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jurist.org/hotline/2012/05/azadeh-shahshahani-georgia-hb87.php |title=HB 87 Negatively Impacts Georgia Economy and Reputation |last=Shahshahani |first=Azadeh |date=2012-05-18 |website=Jurist |language=en |access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics also criticized the law because they thought it would adversely effect trust in the police among immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/2624 |title=Georgia’s HB 87 Goes into Effect on July 1 |last=Altschulter |first=Daniel |date=2011-06-30 |website=Americas Quarterly |access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the bill generally argued that it would benefit Georgia taxpayers by reducing the economic burdens associated with providing for undocumented immigrants in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyhEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163 |title=Decolonizing Rhetoric and Composition Studies: New Latinx Keywords for Theory and Pedagogy |last=Ruiz |first=Iris D. |last2=Sánchez |first2=Raúl |date=2016-10-15 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137527240 |pages=163 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for the bill came from conservative groups that support strict immigration laws, including [[Americans for Immigration Control]], whose spokesman, Phil Kent, said that the bill was about protecting taxpayers from the costs of illegal immigration. Kent told CNN that "We just want to make sure that people are welcome here and that they come here legally. And then we can cut back on the illegal immigration."&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; The bill was also supported by [[Mark Krikorian]] of the [[Center for Immigration Studies]], who said that in passing it, Georgia "...seems to have addressed the top-priority matters a state can deal with," and by Catherine Davis, legislative director for the [[Network of Politically Active Christians]], who told the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' that the bill "will stop unscrupulous behavior."&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt;

==Effects==
HB 87 has since been criticized for allegedly having a negative impact on Georgia's economy, especially in the agricultural sector, because it decreased the number of undocumented workers who were available to work on farms in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Esses |first=Victoria M. |last2=Brochu |first2=Paula M. |last3=Dickson |first3=Karen R. |date=2012-12-01 |title=Economic Costs, Economic Benefits, and Attitudes Toward Immigrants and Immigration |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01269.x/abstract |journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy |language=en |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=133–137 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01269.x |issn=1530-2415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/georgias-harsh-immigration-law-costs-millions-in-unharvested-crops/240774/ |title=Georgia's Harsh Immigration Law Costs Millions in Unharvested Crops |last=McArdle |first=Megan |date=2011-06-21 |website=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=2017-09-03 |quote=Thanks to the resulting labor shortage, Georgia farmers have been forced to leave millions of dollars' worth of blueberries, onions, melons and other crops unharvested and rotting in the fields.

Deal responded that Georgians believed it was important to enforce the law, and that the bill had served to remind the federal government how important it was to address the issue of undocumented immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/carter-deal-clash-over-immigration/FKjj9iW9OHOzjRce4vXzCK/ |title=Carter, Deal clash over immigration |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |access-date=2017-09-20 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have also expressed concern that the law may adversely affect [[public health]] among Hispanic immigrants in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aponte-Rivera |first=Vivianne R. |last2=Dunlop |first2=Boadie W. |date=November 2011 |title=Public health consequences of state immigration laws |url=http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/sites/www.hivlawandpolicy.org/files/Public%20Health%20Consequences%20of%20State%20Immigration%20Laws%20(Aponte-Rivera%20and%20Dunlop).pdf |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=104 |issue=11 |pages=718–719 |doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e318233539b |issn=1541-8243 |pmid=22024776}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a 2013 study found that visits to the pediatric emergency department among Hispanics in Georgia decreased after the law was implemented, while the acuity of these visits tended to increase; in contrast, no other group in Georgia saw these trends during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Beniflah |first=Jacob D. |last2=Little |first2=Wendalyn K. |last3=Simon |first3=Harold K. |last4=Sturm |first4=Jesse |date=2013-12-01 |title=Effects of Immigration Enforcement Legislation on Hispanic Pediatric Patient Visits to the Pediatric Emergency Department |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0009922813493496 |journal=Clinical Pediatrics |language=en |volume=52 |issue=12 |pages=1122–1126 |doi=10.1177/0009922813493496 |issn=0009-9228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
Prior to Governor Deal signing HB 87 into law, numerous protesters gathered outside his office at the [[Georgia State Capitol]], and the group [[Southerners on New Ground]] called for a [[boycott]] of the state if the bill was enacted.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/13/georgia.immigration.law/index.html |title=Georgia governor signs controversial anti-illegal immigration law |last=CNN |first=From Gustavo Valdes, |date=2011-05-13 |work=CNN |access-date=2017-09-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2011, a rally took place outside the State Capitol to protest the law; the size of the crowd was estimated at between 8,000 and 14,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Haines |first=Errin |date=2011-07-02 |title=Protesters rally against Georgia immigration law  |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/07/02/us_georgia_immigration_protest/ |magazine=Salon |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legal challenges==
On June 2, 2011, the ACLU, the SPLC, the [[Asian Law Caucus]], and the [[National Immigration Law Center]] filed a lawsuit challenging HB 87, arguing that it was preempted by federal law and was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/02/nation/la-na-georgia-immigration-20110603 |title=Georgia immigration law taken to court |last=Ceasar |first=Stephen |date=2011-06-02 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2017-09-09 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] issued a permanent injunction which blocked multiple provisions of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/cases/georgia-latino-alliance-human-rights-et-al-v-deal |title=Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, et al. v.

== Icelandic constitution ==
In 930 AD, the constitution of [[Iceland]] was instituted which made Iceland a self-governing country with a people’s assembly called the [[Althing]] (''alþingi''). The Althing represented the people and met once a year to make laws and judge important cases. Matters of lesser importance were dealt with by local spring assemblies, regulated by local chiefs. The Althing was an important part of Icelandic culture and would be integral in their struggle to become an independent nation.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_40"&gt;{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iceland under Norway and Denmark ==
In 1262 Iceland swore allegiance to the king of [[Norway]], and in 1380 was under the rule of the newly united kingdom of Norway and [[Denmark]]. Nevertheless, the Althing continued to control the national politics of Iceland due to the indifference of the monarch to its remote population. In 1660, Denmark became an absolutist state and the power of the Althing was diminished significantly. It now held mainly judicial functions, without any legislative power, but was finally abolished in 1800.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_40"/&gt;

== Nationalist movements in Iceland ==
The nationalist movement in Iceland sprang from the romantic literary ideas of the Enlightenment such that nationalistic ideas were originally expressed in the literature of the period and were only later to be involved in the political events of the country.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_44"&gt;{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of the Althing was a shock to the identity of Iceland. It had not only served as a legislative and judicial body but also had brought the Icelandic communities together annually which served as a unifying force in society. It had become an important part of Icelandic culture and tradition. In 1843, the Althing was successfully re-established as an advisory board to the Danish government, which was a great victory for Icelandic nationalism after what the Althing had come to symbolize for the community.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_44"/&gt;

In 1851, the Althing proposed a separate constitution for Iceland, which resulted in the attempt of the Danish representatives to end the meeting, to the protest of the Icelanders. This was Iceland's first national conflict with Denmark in the political domain.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_44"/&gt;

By 1871, Iceland was still part of the Danish kingdom; however, by this point in time nationalists had managed to pass a law allowing Iceland to trade with all nations (1854) and had liberalized its election laws (1857). Iceland as such had control over much of its own affairs, although still under Danish rule.

A demand for their own constitution, giving legislative power to the Althing was granted in 1874, giving Iceland control of all internal affairs and in 1903 an Icelandic cabinet minister replaced the Danish governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastrup_45"&gt;{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1918 Iceland became a sovereign state in union with Denmark, and in 1944 Iceland was declared a sovereign republic.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_45"/&gt;

Importance was placed on the idea that the new nation must be based on Icelandic ideas, and not imported ones from [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thorhallson|2004|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions of the Icelandic people were to be used to guide the new republic, which hoped to develop independently from [[Europe]], with emphasis on its distinctive culture and history.

==Nationality laws==
{{main|Icelandic nationality law}}
Ancestry is considered by Icelandic nationality law to be the important factor in attaining citizenship, rather than place of birth. Therefore, one is not an Icelandic citizen just by being born in Iceland, but must be born of Icelandic parents.

==Emigration==
In the late 19th century Iceland was faced with a series of natural disasters that forced one fifth of the population to emigrate to North America by 1914. The volcanic eruption of Askja left the North East of Iceland covered in ash, where the largest number of people were forced to leave the country. Poor harvests, due to harsh winters and cold summers, throughout the country also forced large populations to leave Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Valgeir Thorvaldsson |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |title=Why emigrate? |publisher=Icelandic Emigration Center |url=http://www.hofsos.is/emigr.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224071008/http://www.hofsos.is/emigr.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those descendants born outside of Iceland, or who acquired citizenship from the country they emigrated to would lose their Icelandic citizenship. Before 2003, dual citizenship was not permitted, therefore naturalizing in a foreign country would mean losing your Icelandic citizenship. Those people who lost their citizenship in this manner, however, were given the chance to reclaim Icelandic citizenship after 2003, but only until July 1, 2007. At present, those born outside of Iceland will lose their Icelandic citizenship by age twenty two if they do not live in Iceland before this time or do not apply to retain their citizenship. They do not need to give up their citizenship in their country of residence.

==Rights==

===Education===
Public education is funded by the Icelandic government and is compulsory for students fifteen years and younger. Education is free for all citizens from the primary to the university level providing all citizens with the right to education.&lt;ref name="BDHRL"&gt;{{harvp|Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of refugees can be enrolled in public school after residing in the country for three months, providing education as a right not only for all citizens but also for all children in the country.

===Health care===
Prenatal and infant medical care is provided without cost to all citizens, while health care for children is highly subsidized. Refugees also have access to the health care services provided by the state.&lt;ref name="BDHRL"/&gt; Law provides the right of access to health care for all people who have been residing in the country for six months, regardless of nationality. Hospitalisation is free of charge, as well as long term care of the sick or elderly. Medication and treatment outside of hospitals requires the payment of specific fees, which are regulated by law.&lt;ref name="MIC"&gt;{{cite web |author=Multicultural and Information Center |title=Health |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |url=http://www.mcc.is/page.asp?Id=544&amp;sid=259&amp;topid=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
In Iceland, women hold equal rights as men under judicial and family law. Men, however, are still paid more than women working in the same field.&lt;ref name="BDHRL"/&gt; The Icelandic government helps to finance a variety of organizations and facilities to help women that are victims of violence. This aid is not restricted to citizens alone, but is open to all women, including immigrants who suffer from abuse.&lt;ref name="BDHRL"/&gt; With regards to political representation, in 2005, there were 23 women sitting in parliament out of 63 seats, and 4 women in the cabinet, which has 12 members. 2 out of the 9 Supreme Court members were women so that in government office, women hold roughly one third of the seats.&lt;ref name="BDHRL"/&gt;

==Freedom of speech and religion==
Freedom of speech is provided for by law, but public slander based on religion, race, nationality, sexual orientation or skin color is illegal and punishable by fines and imprisonment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Citizens, therefore, are provided the right to free speech, as long as it does not endanger or demean other people. The right to peaceful assembly and associations are also protected by the constitution, as well as freedom of religion. However, Lutheranism, the state religion, is provided with more funding than other religions and more priority in school curricula.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Taxation==
The main obligation to the state in Iceland is paying taxes. Anyone who lives in Iceland for six months or longer is considered a resident and is, therefore, subject to the states income taxes, as well as municipal taxes. This applies for both citizens and non-citizens. All permanent residents over the age of sixteen are considered taxpayers and are provided a tax card, which is used to calculate their contributions. If someone is planning on leaving the country, they must submit their tax return one month before their departure.&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

==Icelandic resistance to American involvement==
In 1946, Iceland joined the [[UN]] and as such became more involved in international affairs. Due to its strategic location for Trans-Atlantic flights, the United States took an interest in establishing an airbase in [[Keflavík]], for the needs of post war occupation of Germany. Keflavík was located only 50 kilometers from the capital, [[Reykjavík]], and as such there was fear that Icelandic culture would be compromised by this base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attempts to establish a 99-year control of this base by the Americans were met with great political outcry, as many saw this base as selling Iceland and its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the American Defense Force were given permission to operate the first television station in Iceland. This station was intended for use by the American base only, but by 1959, there were already concerns since Icelandic citizens were able to receive the television signals. By 1964 the resistance to this station increased as many intellectuals feared that exposure to American television would be destructive to Icelandic language and culture as children became more influenced by American media.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically it was seen as opposition to Icelandic sovereignty to allow a foreign country to operate an influential television station in Iceland, especially since it was in a foreign language. The American television station, as well as radio station, were therefore confined to the base and Icelandic radio stations and television stations became more numerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, a curfew was placed on the American servicemen requiring them to be in their base by ten o'clock, as a way to prevent their presence in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; American presence was seen as a threat to Icelandic culture and independence.

==Culture==
Icelandic culture plays an important part in the national identity of the country and as such there have been several attempts to preserve it. One of the most important parts of this traditional culture are its sagas, which were passed down from the early Viking settlement of the island, and hold a strong significance towards national identity.&lt;ref name="Grondal_13"&gt;{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Halldor Laxness's novel ''Atom Station'', the theme was of American presence damaging the culture in the south as compared to the pure saga culture of the north, as well as the use of Iceland as a base for an atomic war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Althing was also viewed as a part of Icelandic culture due to its long tradition in Iceland and its use as a unifying force for the citizens of the country, as well as its status as the oldest parliament in the world.&lt;ref name="Hastrup_40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grondal_13"/&gt;

Another aspect of culture held dear by many Icelanders is their history of non violence and neutrality. The idea of Iceland as an unarmed nation with no military force became a tradition which shaped the idea the population held about itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this pacifism which stopped Iceland from joining the [[United Nations]] in 1944, and although it made contributions to the Allies, it would not declare war. When it did join the UN in 1946, the terms were that there would be no military bases in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance placed on pacifism was a significant part of Icelandic national identity. When Iceland decided to join [[NATO]] in 1949, it resulted in a riot outside the Althing as this decision broke the historical tradition of neutrality that was viewed as important to Icelandic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language was also an important factor in Icelandic nationality, where an emphasis was placed on making laws in their native language. A common language served as a unifying factor for Icelanders, as well as a way to distinguish themselves from the Danish and the laws of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Icelandic language is very similar to that of the Middle Ages, not having changed drastically, making it a source of historical continuity and part of an ongoing perception of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an attempt since the seventeenth century to keep the language free from influence of foreign words, which continued as a means to reassert independence. Foreign words were associated with foreign domination, creating a need to preserve the Icelandic language in while under Danish rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; New vocabulary brought in by the [[Denmark|Danish]] or through [[Christianity]], therefore, were originally met with distrust, and seen as a threat to their autonomy. A national flag was also essential to the image of Iceland as an independent nation, asserting its distinctiveness from [[Denmark]].

==Nordic Council==
In 1952 Iceland became part of the [[Nordic Council]],an organization between [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] which consists of a governing body and five national secretariats, that meet annually and is attended by parliament members of the five countries. The council does not have any formal authority, but instead serves as an advisory council to the various governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ørvik|1974|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Sweden]] gave the right to vote in local elections to foreigners from countries within the [[Nordic Council]]. [[Denmark]] allowed the same right in 1977, followed by [[Norway]] in 1978 and [[Finland]] in 1981. In 1986. [[Iceland]] also granted members of the [[Nordic Council]] the right to vote in local elections but only after 3 years of residence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ronald Hayduk |title=Noncitizen voting around the world: an overview |publisher=Immigrant Voting Project |accessdate=November 23, 2007 |url=http://www.immigrantvoting.org/material/TIMELINE.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316090403/http://www.immigrantvoting.org/material/TIMELINE.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Icelandic citizens were given the right to vote in local elections in all other countries who were part of the [[Nordic Council]] by 1981, providing its citizens with some political rights if they emigrated to these countries, even if they had not become citizens. Also after, three years, non-citizens in Iceland could vote if they came from a [[Nordic Country]].

==Membership of the European Union==
Since May 2006, Iceland has opened its borders to workers that are part of the [[European Union]], who are now able to enter Iceland without the need of a work permit.&lt;ref name="Veal"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lowana Veal |date=November 22, 2006 |title=Iceland: migration appears here too |publisher=IPS |accessdate=November 23, 2007 |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35572}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers are permitted to stay in Iceland for six months while looking for a job but once a job is found, the employer must inform the Directorate of Labour of the employment of a foreigner. Because of this policy, the population of foreigners in Iceland has risen from 1.4% in 1985 to almost 7% in 2006.

These workers are paid the same as the Icelandic population in jobs with fixed rates, but in jobs such as trades, they are commonly paid less. These foreigners are mostly males looking for employment, and 64% of the recent immigrants work in construction.&lt;ref name="Veal"/&gt;

Preference is given to [[European Union|EU]] members over non-Europeans and therefore it is more difficult for non-Europeans to find work in Iceland as employers must prove that the job was advertised in the [[European Union|EU]] before a work permit can be given to a non-European. This causes a problems for non-Europeans already residing in Iceland, who are faced with more difficulty when attempting to bring family into the country.&lt;ref name="Veal"/&gt; Non-Europeans must find jobs for their family members before they would be allowed to enter the country, and since preference is given to members of the [[European Union]], finding jobs becomes more problematic.

== Passports and visas ==
[[Nordic Country]] members do not require any form of travel document or work permit to enter the country and are also provided the right to remain in Iceland for more than six months by providing a Nordic change of residence certificate.&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

Citizens of countries from the [[European Union|EU]] also do not require a visa and are able to stay in Iceland for six months while looking for work. They must prove, however, that they have the means to support themselves while looking for work in the country or while studying.&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

Members of countries outside of the EU and Nordic Countries, however, require a passport to enter the country, and if they intend to find employment they also require a visa. When applying for residence the person must provide proof that they have health insurance and have the means to support themselves, as well as proof of a place of residence for their stay in Iceland. They must also provide their criminal record, proving they are not a criminal, before they will be permitted in the country.&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt; It is, therefore, more difficult for members outside of the EU and the Nordic Countries to gain entrance into Iceland.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

In [[common law]], a '''hue and cry''' is a process by which bystanders are summoned to assist in the apprehension of a [[Crime|criminal]] who has been witnessed in the act of committing a [[crime]].

==History==
By the [[Statute of Winchester]] of 1285, 13 [[Edward I of England|Edw. I]] cc. 1 and 4, it was provided that anyone, either a [[constable]] or a private citizen, who witnessed a crime shall make hue and cry, and that the hue and cry must be kept up against the fleeing criminal from [[town]] to town and from [[county]] to county, until the felon is apprehended and delivered to the [[sheriff]]. All able-bodied men, upon hearing the shouts, were obliged to assist in the pursuit of the criminal, which makes it comparable to the ''[[posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]]''. It was moreover provided that "the whole [[hundred (division)|hundred]] … shall be answerable" for any [[theft]] or [[robbery]], in effect a form of [[collective punishment]]. Those who raised a hue and cry falsely were themselves guilty of a crime.&lt;ref name="googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTILAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;ots=1acfFeJFAJ&amp;dq=original%20text%20of%20Statute%20of%20Winchester%201285&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Statute of Winchester|editor=Adams, George Burton and Henry Morse Stephens|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oath of office for [[constables]] in Tennessee specifically mentions that it is the duty of the constable to sound the hue and cry.&lt;ref group=note&gt;T.C.A. 8-10-108(b): ...according to the 1960 federal census or any subsequent federal census, and in Fentress County and Hamblen County, every constable shall take an oath that the constable will well and truly serve the state in the office of constable; that the constable will cause the peace of the state to be kept, to the best of the constable's power; that the constable will arrest all such persons as go in the constable's sight armed offensively, or who commit any riot, affray, or other breach of the peace, or will use the constable's best endeavor, on complaint made, to apprehend all felons, rioters, or persons riotously assembled; and that, if such persons flee or make resistance, the constable will pursue, '''and make hue and cry''', according to law; that the constable will faithfully, and without delay, execute and return all lawful process directed to the constable; and that the constable will well and truly, according to the constable's power and ability, do and execute all other duties of the office of constable.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
It is possible that the term is an Anglicization via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|hutesium et clamor}}'', meaning "a horn and shouting".&lt;ref name="worldwidewords.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=What does Hue and Cry Mean? |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-hue1.htm |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources indicate that it has always been a somewhat redundant phrase meaning an outcry and cry, though such "redundancy" is a feature of the [[legal doublet]]. "Hue" appears to come from the [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|huer}}'', which means "to shout", and "cry" from Old French ''{{lang|fro|crier}}'' ("to cry").&lt;ref name="phrases.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hue and Cry |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/24/messages/1077.html |accessdate=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freedictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Compiled Definition and Etymology of Hue and Cry |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hue+and+cry |accessdate=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amheritage"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Soukhanov |editor-first=Anne H. |year=1992 |page=879 |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |isbn=978-0-395-44895-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
*From the late 18th century until 1839, ''Hue and Cry'' was a principal or variant title for the weekly newspaper, containing details of crimes and wanted people, that afterwards became better known as the ''[[Police Gazette (Great Britain and Ireland)|Police Gazette]]''. In [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837–9), chapter 15, the criminal [[Fagin]] is depicted "absorbed in the interesting pages of the ''Hue-and-Cry''".

The '''Immigration Ordinance''' is Chapter 115 of [[Hong Kong]]'s Ordinances. It regulates the immigration issues of Hong Kong such as [[Right of abode in Hong Kong|Right of Abode]], immigration control, enforcement of illegal immigration by [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]], etc...

First introduced in 1971 (as Cap 55), it replaced a number of smaller ordinances that dealt with immigration control from China into Hong Kong:

* Passport Ordinance 1923
* Travellers' Restriction Ordinance 1915
* Registration of Persons Ordinance 1916 - amended 1935
* Immigration Control Ordinance 1940; 1949
* Deportation Ordinance 1917
* Immigration and Passport Ordinance 1934

The previous ordinances reflected the flow of immigration prior to establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 which resulted in a large movement of immigrants and illegal immigration from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/documents/33/4/chen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This ordinance is often cited in controversial policies and restrictive nature of immigration in [[Hong Kong]] especially in regards to right of abode to non-Chinese immigrants&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/world/asia/hong-kong-court-denies-foreign-domestic-helpers-right-to-permanent-residency.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; after amendments in 1987 to deal with post-handover Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/124648520/Constitutional-Law-of-Hong-Kong---DOC&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pact of Friendship, Neutrality, and Nonaggression between Italy and the Soviet Union''', also known as the '''Italo-Soviet Pact''', was a diplomatic agreement between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Signed on 2 September 1933,&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{harvnb|Stocker|2003|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the agreement was in place until 22 June 1941 when Italy joined [[Nazi Germany]] in declaring war on the Soviet Union as part of the [[Axis powers]] during the [[Second World War]]. The pact built on earlier economic relations (traditionally strong between the countries), seeking to ensure security in the [[Balkans]] and for a time mutual suspicion of German intentions.

==Background==
The Soviet Union and Italy had maintained contacts since 26 December 1921 and full diplomatic relations since 7 February 1924, making Mussolini's Italy the first Western nation to recognize the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism 1914—1945'', Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the [[Italian Communist Party]], such as Luigi Tolentino from [[Palermo]] lived in exile in the Soviet Union, which caused some political friction and accusations of harbouring "subversives." On 6 May 1933, the two moved closer together by agreeing an economic pact supporting industrialisation goals; Italy required access to Soviet [[oil]] and [[coal]], while the Soviets were interested in Italian innovations in the [[aviation]],  [[automobile]] and [[naval]] industries.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt; The ideological controversy between [[Fascism]] and [[Bolshevism]] was largely considered as an internal matter and relations were built up nevertheless.

Reports in the ''[[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]]'' were keen to stress the military aspect of this. In September 1933, a Soviet military mission visited Rome and Vladimir Petrovich Potemkin who served as Soviet Ambassador to Italy from 1932 until 1934, expressed "gratitude for the exceptional attention devoted to the Soviet mission by the Italian command and government," while a general from the Italian military stated, "the [[Italian Army]] has feelings which go deeper than the usual professional ones toward the [[Red Army]]. These feelings have been strengthened as a result of the Italo-Soviet Pact."&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

Potemkin sent an invite to the Undersecretary of State, [[Fulvio Suvich]], for an Italian mission to visit the Soviet Union in return. Representatives of the Italian Army and the [[Italian Navy]], including a Brigadier General, toured the Soviet Union for two weeks, though the [[Italian Air Force]] did not as [[Italo Balbo]] blocked the plan. There were further friendly exchanges in 1933 as an Italian [[submarine]] visited [[Batum]] on the [[Black Sea]] and three Soviet vessels visited [[Naples]]. This was in preparation for the visit of [[Maxim Litvinov]]. There were plans that captains from the [[Red Fleet]] would meet [[Benito Mussolini]], but in the end this did not happen.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

These developments also coincided with [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in Germany and as there was an element of uncertainty not only between the Soviets and Germany at the time, but also Italy and Germany (not least over the issue of the potential annexation of [[Austria]] and furthermore Italian-controlled territories in [[South Tyrol]]). A third element to this relationship was the [[Turkish Republic]]. While the Soviet ships were in Naples, the Turkish Ambassador to Italy made a visit to the Soviet admiral on board. A potential Soviet-Italian-Turkish stability alliance troubled [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="refs"&gt;{{harvnb|Stocker|2003|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernardo Attolio]], who had been the Italian Ambassador to [[Moscow]] in 1930 and helped to pave the way for the 1932 agreement, called the military contacts a "tradition" and mutually beneficial, in that it helped to build Italian military and technological prestige. In the aftermath of these exchanges, Mussolini mobilised Italian troops in the summer of 1934 and had them placed on the [[Brenner Pass]], aiming to ensure Austrian independence against the [[July Putsch]].&lt;ref name="refs"/&gt;

Unlike the [[Stresa Front]] (Italy's brief agreements with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] in 1935), Italo-Soviet relations weathered the political controversy in the [[League of Nations]] which followed the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], as economic relations continued unabated with the Soviet Union.

Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one person, emphasizing a [[merit system]] administrator [[Shen Buhai]] (c. 400 BC – c. 337 BC) may have had more influence than any other, and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration.

Concerned largely with administrative and sociopolitical innovation, [[Shang Yang]] (390–338 BC) was a leading reformer of his time.&lt;ref name="historical context" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S.Y. Hsieh 1995. p.83" /&gt; His numerous reforms transformed the peripheral [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom. Much of Legalism was "principally the development of certain ideas" that lay behind his reforms, and it was these that helped lead to Qin's ultimate conquest of the other states of China in 221 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

==Historical background==
{{further information|Warring States period}}
The [[Zhou dynasty]] was divided between the masses and the hereditary noblemen. The latter were placed to obtain office and political power, owing allegiance to the local prince, who owed allegiance to the [[Son of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="K. Lee p.24"&gt;K. K. Lee, 1975 p.&amp;nbsp;24. Legalist School and Legal Positivism, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty operated according to the principles of [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] and punishment. The former was applied only to aristocrats, the latter only to commoners.&lt;ref&gt;Yu-lan Fung 1948. p.&amp;nbsp;155. A Short History of Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=HZU0YKnpTH0C&amp;pg=PA155&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Zhou kings]] kept a firm personal hand on the government, depending on their personal capacities, personal relations between ruler and minister, and upon military might. The technique of centralized government being so little developed, they deputed authority to feudal lords.&lt;ref name="Herrlee G. Creel p.124"&gt;Herrlee G. Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;124. Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Zhou kings could no longer grant new fiefs, their power began to decline, vassals began to identify with their own regions,&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Shaughnessy. China Empire and Civilization p26&lt;/ref&gt; and schismatic hostility occurred between the Chinese states. Aristocratic families became very important, by virtue of their ancestral prestige wielding great power and proving a divisive force.&lt;ref name="Herrlee G. Creel p.124"/&gt;

In the [[Spring and Autumn]] (771–476 BC) period, rulers began to directly appoint state officials to provide advice and management, leading to the decline of inherited privileges and bringing fundamental structural transformations as a result of what may be termed "social engineering from above."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Jay L. Garfield, William Edelglass 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;59 The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC&amp;pg=PA59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhengyuan Fu, 1996 China's Legalists p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; Most Warring States period thinkers tried to accommodate a "changing with the times" paradigm, and each of the schools of thought sought to provide an answer for the attainment of sociopolitical stability.&lt;ref name="historical context"&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 1.2 Historical Context. http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism, commonly considered to be China's ruling ethos, was articulated in opposition to the establishment of legal codes, the earliest of which were inscribed on bronze vessels in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;20. China's New Legalism&lt;/ref&gt; For the Confucians, the [[Chinese classics|Classics]] provided the preconditions for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Knoblox Xunzi 148&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Confucians tended to consider organizational details beneath both minister and ruler, leaving such matters to underlings,&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 107"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 107&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore wanted ministers to control the ruler.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.359"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;359 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA359&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned with "goodness", the Confucians became the most prominent, followed by the proto-[[Taoism|Taoists]] and the administrative thought that [[Sima Tan]] termed the Fa-Jia. But the Taoists focused on the development of inner powers,&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Lee, 1975 p.&amp;nbsp;26. Legalist School and Legal Positivism, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.

A new type of ruler emerged intent on breaking the power of the aristocrats and reforming their state's bureaucracies. Those that failed were conquered or deposed.&lt;ref name="khayutina.userweb.mwn.de"&gt;http://khayutina.userweb.mwn.de/LEGALISM_2013/FILES/Hulsewe_Legalists_Qin_Laws.pdf A. F. P. Hulsewe.

Creel, Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; they brought with them philosophy concerned foremost with organizational methodology.&lt;ref name="khayutina.userweb.mwn.de"/&gt; Successful reforms made the so-called "Fa-Jia" significant, promoting the rapid growth&lt;ref&gt;Peng He 2014. p.&amp;nbsp;81.

The goal of the Fa-Jia ruler was conquest and unification of all under heaven (or in the case of [[Shen Buhai]] at least defense),&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.345"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;345 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA345&lt;/ref&gt; and the writings of [[Han Fei]] and other Fa-Jia are almost purely practical, eschewing ethics in favour of strategy&lt;ref&gt;Jay L.

The ruler who follows Tao moves away from benevolence and righteousness, and discards reason and ability, subduing the people through Fa (statutes). Only an absolute ruler can restore the world.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.6-8"/&gt;

Though Han Fei espoused that his model state would increase quality of life, he did not consider this a legitimizing factor (rather, a side-effect of good order). He focused on the functioning of the state, the ruler's role as guarantor within it, and aimed in particular at making the state strong and the ruler the strongest person within it.&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei, De, Welfare.

DOI: 10.1080/09552367.2013.807584. , Database: Academic Search Elite&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, [[Shen Buhai]] and successor Han Fei are concerned in particular with "the role of the ruler and the means by which he may control a bureaucracy." 

Though the [[syncretic]] ''[[Han Feizi]]'' speaks on what may be termed law, so-called Legalists were concerned not mainly with law, but with administration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Anti-ministerialism===
The authority to make policy is a basic difference between [[Confucianism]] and the Fa-Jia. Proposing a return to feudal ideals, albeit his nobleman being anyone who possessed virtue,&lt;ref name="K.

Shen Buhai and his philosophical successor Han Fei considered the ruler to be in a situation of constant danger from his aides,&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.347"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;347 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA347&lt;/ref&gt; and the target of Han Fei's standards in particular are the scholarly bureaucracy and ambitious advisers – the Confucians.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.347"/&gt; Saying that "superior and inferior fight a hundred battles a day",&lt;ref&gt;Ross Terril 2003 p.&amp;nbsp;68. The New Chinese Empire. https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;pg=PA68&lt;/ref&gt; long sections of the ''Han Feizi'' provide example of how ministers undermined various rules, and focus on how the ruler can protect himself against treacherous ministers, emphatically emphasizing their mutually different interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]] Asian Philosophy Vol. 15, No. 2, 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;162, Han Feizi's Legalism Versus Kautilya's Arthashastra&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not exceptional, [[Sinologist]] [[Yuri Pines]] considers this selfish view of human nature to be a pillar of the Fa-Jia, and a number of chapters of the ''Book of Lord Shang'' consider men naturally evil. The Fa-Jia are therefore distinct from the Confucians (apart from their emphasis on Fa) in dismissing the possibility of reforming the elite, that being the ruler and ministers, or driving them by moral commitment. Every member of the elite pursues his own interests. Preserving and strengthening the ruler's authority against these may be considered the Fa-Jia's "singularly pronounced political commitment".&lt;ref name="chineselegalism"/&gt; On rare occasions, [[Han Fei]] lauds such qualities as benevolence and proper social norms; with due consideration for the times they were living in however, the Fa-Jia did not believe that the moral influence or virtue of the ruler was powerful enough to create order.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.6-8"&gt;Ellen Marie Chen, 1975 pp.&amp;nbsp;6–8, 10, 14 Reason and Nature in the Han Fei-Tzu, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Considering the power struggle between ruler and minister irreconcilable, and focusing on the prevention of evil rather than the promotion of good, the Fa-Jia largely rejected the utility of both virtue and the Confucian rule of man, insisting on impersonal norms and regulations in their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen 2016. p.&amp;nbsp;16.

Rather than aristocratic fiefs, Qin territory came under the direct control of the Qin rulers, directly appointing officials on the basis of their qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eno 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;4, The Qin Revolution and the Fall of the Qin http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Resources.html&lt;/ref&gt; With the state of Qin conquering all the Warring States and founding the "first" Chinese empire in 221 BC, the Fa-Jia had succeeded in propelling state centralization and laying the foundations of Chinese bureaucracy, establishing "efficient and effective" codes that "became the pattern for Chinese politics for the next two millennia."&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;21. China's New Legalism&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophies of the reformers fell with the Qin, but tendencies remained in the supposedly Confucian imperial government, and the [[Han Feizi]] would be studied by rulers in every dynasty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

R. Eno of [[Indiana University]] writes that "If one were to trace the origins of Legalism as far back as possible, it might be appropriate to date its beginnings to the prime ministership of [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC)",&lt;ref name="indiana.edu"&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Legalism.pdf R Eno, Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt; who "may be seen as the source of the notion that good government involved skilled systems design." The reforms of Guan Zhong applied levies and economic specializations at the village level instead of the aristocracy, and shifted administrative responsibility to professional bureaucrats.

The Mohists advocated a unified, utilitarian ethical and political order, posting some of its first theories and initiating philosophical debate in China. To unify moral standards, they supported a "centralized, authoritarian state led by a virtuous, benevolent sovereign managed by a hierarchical, merit-based bureaucracy".&lt;ref name="winterstanford"&gt;Fraser, Chris, "Mohism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/mohism/&lt;/ref&gt; That social order is paramount seems to be implicit, recognized by all.&lt;ref name="google145"&gt;Bo Mou 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;145,147. Routledge History of Chinese Philosophy Volume 3. https://books.google.com/books?id=UL1-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&lt;/ref&gt; They argued against nepotism, and, as with the later Fa "philosophers", for universal standards (or [[meritocracy]]) as represented by the centralized state, saying "If one has ability, then he is promoted. If he has no ability, then he is demoted. Promoting public justice and casting away private resentments – this is the meaning of such statements."&lt;ref&gt;Erica Brindley, The Polarization of the Concepts Si (Private Interest) and Gong (Public Interest) in Early Chinese Thought.

Often compared with Plato, the [[hermeneutics]] of the [[Mohists]] contained the philosophical germs of what Sima-Tan would term the "Fa-School" ("Legalists"), contributing to the political thought of contemporary reformers.&lt;ref name="winterstanford"/&gt; The Mohists and the [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] text attributed to [[Guan Zhong]] are of particular importance to understanding Fa,&lt;ref name="Paul R.

Of particular concern for the Fa-Jia and the [[Mohists]], the fourth century witnessed the emergence of discussions polarizing the concepts of self and private, commonly used in conjunction with profit and associated with fragmentation, division, partiality, and one-sidelines, with that of the state and "public", represented by the duke and referring to what is official or royal, that is, the ruler himself, associated with unity, wholeness, objectivity, and universality. The later denotes the "Universal Way".&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"&gt;Erica Brindley, The Polarization of the Concepts Si (Private Interest) and Gong (Public Interest) in Early Chinese Thought. pp.&amp;nbsp;6, 8, 12–13, 16, 19, 21–22, 24, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Legalism and Mohism are distinguished by this effort to obtain objectivity.&lt;ref name="google91"&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;91.

===Mohist Hermeneutics===

Mohist and Legalist thought is not based on entities, transcendentals or universals, but parts or roles ("names"),&lt;ref name="google147"&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;147. Name and Actuality in Early Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=GId_ASbEI2YC&amp;pg=PA147&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore relatable to the Confucian [[rectification of names]], which arguably originates in Mozi's development of Fa.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen p.348-349"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 pp.&amp;nbsp;348-349 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA348
* Chad Hansen.

Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E.. p.&amp;nbsp;265&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting the Confucian idea of parents as a moral model as particular and unreliable, the driving idea of the Mohists was the use of [[Hermeneutics]] to find objective models/standards (Fa) for ethics and politics, as was done in any practical field, to order or govern society. These were primarily practical rather than principles or rules,&lt;ref&gt;Bo Mou 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;143–144. Routledge History of Chinese Philosophy Volume 3. https://books.google.com/books?id=UL1-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&lt;/ref&gt; as in the square and plumb-line.&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"&gt;Chad Hansen, University of Hong Kong. Lord Shang. http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Lord%20Shang.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohists used Fa as "objective, particularly operational or measurement-like standards for fixing the referents of names",&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen. Shen Buhai http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Shen%20Bu%20Hai.htm#fa&lt;/ref&gt; hoping that analysis of language standards (Fa) would yield some objective way (dao) of moral reform.&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;367 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA367&lt;/ref&gt; For Mozi, if language is made objective, then language itself could serve as a source of information and argued that in any dispute of distinctions, one party must be right and one wrong.&lt;ref name="philosophy1"&gt;Chad Hansen. Philosophy of Language in Classical China. http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/lang.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

While other terms might denote mere command, in comparison to the Western concept of law, the essential characteristic of Fa is measurement.&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt; Mozi considered the elucidation of different "types" or "classes" to be the basis of both cognitive thinking and sociopolitical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Zhenbin Sun 2015. p.&amp;nbsp;113.

Fa is never merely arbitrary or the ruler's desire, nor does it aim at an intellectual grasp of a definition or principle, but the practical ability to perform a task (dao) successfully, or to "do something correctly in practice" — and in particular, to be able to distinguish various kinds of things from one another. Measuring to determine whether distinctions have been drawn properly,  Fa compares something against itself, and judges whether the two are similar, just as with the use of the compass or the L-square. What matches the standard is then the particular object, and thus correct. This constituted the basic conception of Mohist's practical reasoning and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, "Mohism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/mohism/

Mozi said, "Those in the world who perform tasks cannot do without models (Fa) and standards. There is no one who can accomplish their task without models and standards. Even officers serving as generals or ministers, they all have models; even the hundred artisans performing their tasks, they too all have models. The hundred artisans make squares with the set square, circles with the compass, straight lines with the string, vertical lines with the plumb line, and flat surfaces with the level. Whether skilled artisans or unskilled artisans, all take these five as models. The skilled are able to conform to them. The unskilled, though unable to conform to them, by following them in performing their tasks still surpass what they can do by themselves. Thus the hundred artisans in performing their tasks all have models to measure by. Now, for the greatest to order (zhi, also 'govern') the world and those the next level down to order great states without models to measure by, this is to be less discriminating than the hundred artisans."&lt;ref name="winterstanford"/&gt;

Applied to economy and institution, Shang Yang's Fa is total and anti-bureaucratic, calculating rank mathematically from the adherence to standards (Fa) in the performance of roles (models), namely that of soldiers and (to a lesser extent) farmers.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen Chad Hansen p.349,359"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"/&gt; Han Fei shows no revolutionary insight into rules; objectively-determined "models" (Fa) or "names" (titles/roles), being measured against, replace intuitive guidance, especially that of the ruler. It is these that enable control of a bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA346&lt;/ref&gt; Carine Defoort of New York university explains:

{{block quote | "Names are orders: by manipulating a network of names from his polar position, the ruler keeps everything under control.

Because Fa is necessary for articulating administrative terms, it is presupposed in any application of punishment, and Han Fei stressed measurement-like links between rewards and punishments and performance. Applied through incentives and disincentives, Fa provided guidance for behaviour, the performance of civil and military roles, and advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;349 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA349

{{block quote | Now Shen Buhai spoke about the need of Shu ("Technique") and [[Shang Yang]] practices the use of Fa ("Standards"). What is called Shu is to create posts according to responsibilities, hold actual services accountable according to official titles, exercise the power over life and death, and examine into the abilities of all his ministers; these are the things that the ruler keeps in his own hand. 

Fa includes mandates and ordinances promulgated to the government offices, penalties that are definite in the mind of the people, rewards that are due to the careful observers of standards, and punishments that are inflicted upon those who violate orders. It is what the subjects and ministers take as a model. If the ruler is without Shu he will be overshadowed; if the subjects and ministers lack Fa they will be insubordinate. Thus, neither can be dispensed with: both are implements of emperors and kings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/hanfei.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.43&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;doc.lang=bilingual

==Shang Yang (390–338 BC)==
[[File:BronzePlaque-EdictOfSecondEmperor-Qin-ROM-May8-08.png|thumbnail|Small bronze plaque containing an edict from the second emperor of the Qin dynasty. 209 BC.]]
[[File:Terracotta Army Pit 1 - 10.jpg|thumbnail|''Terracotta Army'']]

Hailing from Wei, as Prime Minister of the [[State of Qin]] [[Shang Yang]] or Gongsun Yang engaged in a "comprehensive plan to eliminate the hereditary aristocracy". Drawing boundaries between private factions and the central, royal state, he took up the cause of meritocratic appointment, stating "Favoring one's relatives is tantamount to using self-interest as one's way, whereas that which is equal and just prevents selfishness from proceeding."&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8" /&gt; 

As the first of his accomplishments, historiographer [[Sima Qian]] accounts Gongsun as having divided the populace into groups of five and ten, instituting a system of mutual responsibility&lt;ref name="JOHN K. FAIRBANK 2008. p.76"&gt;Denis Twitchett and John K. Fairbank, 2008. p.&amp;nbsp;76. Cambridge History of China.&lt;/ref&gt; tying status entirely to service to the state. It rewarded office and rank for martial exploits, going to far as to organize women's militias for siege defense. The second accomplishment listed is forcing the populace to attend solely to agriculture (or women cloth production, including a possible sewing draft) and recruiting labour from other states. He abolished the old fixed landholding system ([[Fengjian]]) and direct primogeniture, making it possible for the people to buy and sell ([[usufruct]]) farmland, thereby encouraging the peasants of other states to come to Qin. The recommendation that farmers be allowed to buy office with grain was apparently only implemented much later, the first clear-cut instance in 243 BC. Infanticide was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 94.

Gongsun deliberately produced equality of conditions amongst the ruled, a tight control of the economy, and encouraged total loyalty to the state, including censorship and reward for denunciation. Law was what the sovereign commanded, and this meant absolutism, but it was an absolutism of law as impartial and impersonal. Gongsun discouraged arbitrary tyranny or terror as destroying law.&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Lee, 1975 pp.&amp;nbsp;27–30, 40–41.

Insisting that it be made known and applied equally to all, posting it on pillars erected in the new capital. In 350, along with the creation of the new capital, a portion of Qin was divided into thirty-one counties, each "administered by a (presumably centrally appointed) magistrate". This was a "significant move toward centralizing Ch'in administrative power" and correspondingly reduced the power of hereditary landholders.&lt;ref name="S.Y. Hsieh 1995. p.83"&gt;S.Y.

==Shen Buhai (400–c. 337 BC)==
[[File:Archaic Bronze Candle Holder. Han Thru Warring States.jpg|thumbnail|Han state bronze candle holder]]
The basic structure and operation of the traditional Chinese state was not "legalistic" as the term is commonly understood. Though persisting, pre-modern mainstream Chinese thinking never really accepted the role of law and jurisprudence or the Shang Yang wing of the Fa-Jia. The Fa-Jia's most important contribution lies in the organization and regulation of centralized, bureaucratic government. Sinologist Creel called its philosophy administrative for lack of a better term, considering it to have been founded by [[Shen Buhai]] (400–337 BC), who likely played an "outstanding role in the creation of the traditional Chinese system of government". 

Shen was chancellor of [[Han (state)|Han]] for fifteen years (354–337 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 81,113

Adhering thereto, Shen utilized the same category of method (Fa) as others of the Fa-Jia, but emphasized its use in secrecy for purposes of investigation and personnel control, concerning himself with methods (Fa) of (impersonal bureaucratic) administration (namely methods of appointment and performance measurement) or the ruler's role in the control thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;32.

What Shen appears to have realized is that the "methods for the control of a bureaucracy" could not be mixed with the survivals of feudal government, or staffed merely by "getting together a group of 'good men{{'"}}, but rather must be men qualified in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.&amp;nbsp;86.

Compared with Shang Yang, Shen Buhai refers to the ruler in abstract terms: he is simply the head of a bureaucracy. In comparison with [[Han Fei]] though his system still required a strong ruler at the centre,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 59,60,63&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing that he trust no one minister.&lt;ref&gt;Zhengyuan Fu 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;120.

An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&lt;/ref&gt; Shen largely recommended that rulers investigate their ministers' performance, checking his ministers' reports while remaining calm and secretive ([[Wu wei]]).

Zalta (ed.), 5.2 Entrapped Sovereign? http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Shen Buhai insisted that the ruler must be fully informed on the state of his realm, but couldn't afford to get caught up in details and was advised to listen to no one. Listening to his courtiers might interfere with promotions, and he does not, as [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] says, have the time to do so. The way to see and hear independently is the grouping together of particulars into categories using mechanical or operational method (Fa). On the contrary the ruler's eyes and hears will make him "deaf and blind" (unable to obtain accurate information).&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.&amp;nbsp;81.

===Shu or "Technique"===
[[File:环形算盘.jpg|thumbnail|The earliest known written documentation for the Chinese abacus, the [[Suan Pan]], dates to the 2nd century BC (its original design is unknown).]]
Apart from Shang Yang's doctrine of penalties and mutual spying and denouncement among ministers, Han Fei recommends the ruler should protect himself through careful employment of doctrines that had earlier been recommended by Shen Buhai.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 5.2 Entrapped Sovereign? http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Because Fa has diverse meaning, for clarification [[Shen Buhai]]'s successors often used the term ''Shu'' (technique) for his administrative method (Fa) and other techniques (such as "Wu-wei"), and thus 20th century philosopher [[Feng Youlan]] called Shen the leader of the group [in the Legalist school] emphasizing Shu, or techniques of government.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, p.&amp;nbsp;80

Creel believed the term originally had the sense of numbers, with implicit roots in statistical or categorizing methods, using record keeping in financial management as a numerical measure of accomplishment.&lt;ref name="philosophy2"&gt;Chad Hansen, Shen Buhai http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Shen%20Bu%20Hai.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p pp. 49-67"&gt;Mark Czikszentmihalyi p.&amp;nbsp;50.

He defines it as "that by which one regulates the world of things; the algorithms of movement and stillness." Mastery of techniques was a necessary element of sagehood.&lt;ref name="MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI p 1997 pp. 49-67"/&gt;

Another example of Shu is Chuan-shu, or "political maneuvering". The concept of Ch'uan, or "weighing" figures in Legalist writings from very early times. It also figures in Confucian writings as at the heart of moral action, including in the Mencius and the Doctrine of the Mean. Weighing is contrasted with "the standard". Life and history often necessitate adjustments in human behavior, which must suit what is called for at a particular time. It always involves human judgement. A judge that has to rely on his subjective wisdom, in the form of judicious weighing, relies on Ch'uan. The Confucian [[Zhu Xi]], who was notably not a restorationist, emphasized expedients as making up for incomplete standards or methods.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Hymes, Conrad Schirokauer 1993 pp.&amp;nbsp;208–212. Ordering the World: Approaches to State and Society in Sung Dynasty China.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese Thought: An Introduction S.Y. Hsieh suggests a set of assumptions underlying the concept of (xing-ming).
* That when a large group of people are living together, it is necessary to have some form of government.
* The government has to be responsible for a wide range of things, to allow them to live together peacefully.
* The government does not consist of one person only, but a group.
* One is a leader that issues orders to other members, namely officials, and assigns responsibilities to them.
* To do this, the leader must know the exact nature of the responsibilities, as well as the capabilities of the officials.
* Responsibilities, symbolized by a title, should correspond closely with capabilities, demonstrated by performance. 
* Correspondence measures success in solving problems and also controls the officials. When there is a match, the leader should award the officials.
* It is necessary to recruit from the whole population. Bureaucratic government marks the end of feudal government.&lt;ref&gt;S.Y. Hsieh, 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;90 Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&amp;pg=PA90&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing a "crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity", what is termed Wu wei (or nonaction) would become the political theory of the Fa-Jia, if not becoming their general term for political strategy. The (qualified) non-action of the ruler ensures his power and the stability of the polity,&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.&amp;nbsp;198 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA198&lt;/ref&gt; and can therefore be considered his foremost technique.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames 1983. p.&amp;nbsp;51. Art of Rulership, The. https://books.google.com/books?id=OkTurZP__qAC&amp;pg=PA50&lt;/ref&gt; The "conception of the ruler's role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp" while leaving details to ministers, would have a "deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 99&lt;/ref&gt; Following Shen Buhai strongly advocated by [[Han Fei]], during the Han dynasty up until the reign of [[Han Wudi]] rulers confined their activity "chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials", a plainly "Legalist" practice inherited from the [[Qin dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 99
* Pan Ku. trans. Homer Dubs, The History of the Former Han Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking any metaphysical connotation, Shen used the term [[Wu wei]] to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 62–63

{{quote| text=The ruler is like a mirror, reflecting light, doing nothing, and yet, beauty and ugliness present themselves; (or like) a scale establishing equilibrium, doing nothing, and yet causing lightness and heaviness to discover themselves. (Administrative) method (Fa) is complete acquiescence. (Merging his) personal (concerns) with the public (weal), he does not act.

Though not a conclusive argument against proto-Taoist influence, Shen's Buhai's Taoist terms do not show evidence of explicit Taoist usage (Confucianism also uses terms like "Tao", or Wu wei), lacking any metaphysical connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Han Feizi'' has a commentary on the Tao Te Ching, but references Shen Buhai rather than Laozi for Wu wei.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bulk of both the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzhi appear to have been composed later, [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G.

* S.Y. Hsieh, 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;92 Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt;.

Shen Buhai argued that if the government were organized and supervised relying on proper method (Fa), the ruler need do little – and must do little.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69 
* Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;66. Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Legalists [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]], Shen did not consider the relationship between ruler and minister antagonistic necessarily.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Peerenboom 1993 p.&amp;nbsp;241. Law and Morality in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=ctWt6bvFaNAC&amp;pg=PA241&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently paraphrasing the [[Analects]], Shen Buhai's statement that those near him will feel affection, while the far will yearn for him,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 67, 81
* Creel, 1959 p.&amp;nbsp;201. The Meaning of Hsing-Ming. Studia Serica: Sinological studies dedicated to Bernhard Kalgren&lt;/ref&gt; stands in contrast to Han Fei, who considered the relationship between the ruler and ministers irreconcilable.&lt;ref name="chineselegalism"&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Shen still believed that the ruler's most able ministers are his greatest danger,&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.&amp;nbsp;35 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and is convinced that it is impossible to make them loyal without techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.&amp;nbsp;143 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA143&lt;/ref&gt; Creel explains: "The ruler's subjects are so numerous, and so on alert to discover his weaknesses and get the better of him, that it is hopeless for him alone as one man to try to learn their characteristics and control them by his knowledge... the ruler must refrain from taking the initiative, and from making himself conspicuous – and therefore vulnerable – by taking any overt action."&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 66"&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 66&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shen Buhai portrays the ruler as putting up a front to hide his dependence on his advisers. Aside from hiding the ruler's weaknesses, Shen's ruler therefore makes use of method (Fa) in secrecy. Even more than with Han Fei, Shen Buhai's ruler's strategies are a closely guarded secret, aiming for a complete independence that challenges "one of the oldest and most sacred tenets of (Confucianism)," that of respectfully receiving and following ministerial advice.&lt;ref&gt;Karyn Lai 2017. pp.&amp;nbsp;171–172, 185. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&lt;/ref&gt;

Though espousing an ultimate inactive end, the term does not appear in the ''[[Book of Lord Shang]]'', ignoring it as an idea for control of the administration.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 69"/&gt;

====Yin (passive mindfulness)====
Shen's ruler plays no active role in governmental functions. He should not use his talent even if he has it. Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries. However, [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] also argues that not getting involved in details allowed Shen's ruler to "truly rule", because it leaves him free to supervise the government without interfering, maintaining his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 65–66

In theory, the use of techniques requires the ruler not engage in any interference or subjective consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;90-91.

Monumenta Serica, 39, 87–114. {{JSTOR|40726902}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinologist]] [[John Makeham]] explains: "assessing words and deeds requires the ruler's dispassionate attention; (yin is) the skill or technique of making one's mind a tabula rasa, non-committaly taking note of all the details of a man's claims and then objectively comparing his achievements of the original claims."&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;90-91. The Legalist Concept of Hsing-Ming: An Example of the Contribution of Archaeological Evidence to the Re-Interpretation of Transmitted Texts.

A commentary to the Shiji cites a now-lost book as quoting Shen Buhai saying: "By employing (yin), 'passive mindfulness', in overseeing and keeping account of his vassals, accountability is deeply engraved." The Guanzi similarly says: "Yin is the way of non-action. Yin is neither to add to nor to detract from anything. To give something a name strictly on the basis of its form – this is the Method of yin."&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;90-91.

==Shen Dao (350–c. 275 BC)==
[[File:Qin Weight Iron.JPG|thumbnail|Iron weight dated from 221 BC with 41 inscriptions written in seal script about standardizing weights and measures during the 1st year of Qin dynasty
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where there is a scale, people cannot deceive others about weight; where there is a ruler, people cannot deceive others about length; and where there is Fa, people cannot deceive others about one's words and deeds.

[[File:Mold for making banliang coins.jpg|thumbnail|Mold for making banliang coins]]
[[Shen Dao]] argued for Wu wei in similar manner to Shen Buhai, saying
{{quote| text=The Dao of ruler and ministers is that the ministers labour themselves with tasks while the prince has no task; the prince is relaxed and happy while the ministers bear responsibility for tasks. The ministers use all their intelligence and strength to perform his job satisfactorily, in which the ruler takes no part, but merely waits for the job to be finished. As a result, every task is taken care of. The correct way of government is thus.&lt;ref&gt;L.K. Chen and H.C.W Sung 2015 p.&amp;nbsp;251 Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=L24aBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson. Shen Dao: Text and Translation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shen Dao also espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as Shen Buhai, and in contrast with Shang Yang emphasizes the use of talent&lt;ref&gt;John S. Major, Constance A. Cook. 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;207. Ancient China: A History. https://books.google.com/books?id=vh8xDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT207&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are "not the product of one man's efforts". Along this same line however he challenges the Confucian and Mohist esteem and appointment of worthies as a basis of order, pointing out that talented ministers existed in every age. 

Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue, eschewing Shen Buhai's administrative method in favour of a mechanical distribution ("the basis of fairness") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement. Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, also used by the [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] and [[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]], to Shen, given a "dimensional" difference through Fa, social relationships ("yin") and division.&lt;ref&gt;John Knoblock 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;172.

{{block quote | If one rabbit runs through a town street, and a hundred chase it, it is because its distribution has not been determined... If the distribution has already been determined, even the basest people will no for it. The way to control All-under-Heaven and the country lies solely in determining distribution.}}

The greatest function of Fa ("the principle of objective judgement) is the prevention of selfish deeds and argument. However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian Li's supplementation of Fa and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.&lt;ref&gt;Masayuki Sato 2003. pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135.

{{block quote | "The state has the li of high and low rank, but not a li of men of worth and those without talent. There is a li of age an youth, but not of age and cowardice. There is a li of near and distant relatives, but no li of love and hate."}}

For this reason he is said to "laugh at men of worth" and "reject sages", his order relying not on them but on the Fa.&lt;ref&gt;Benjanmin I. Schwartz 1985. p.&amp;nbsp;247. The World of Thought in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=kA0c1hl3CXUC&amp;pg=PA247&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Fa to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state,&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt; Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment,&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.202"&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.&amp;nbsp;202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard, or fa, as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy Fa, and Shen Dao's ruler therefore "does not show favoritism toward a single person."&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;

{{block quote | When an enlightened ruler establishes [gong] ("duke" or "public interest"), [private] desires do not oppose the correct timing [of things], favoritism does not violate the law, nobility does not trump the rules, salary does not exceed [that which is due] one's position, a [single] officer does not occupy multiple offices, and a [single] craftsman does not take up multiple lines of work... [Such a ruler] neither overworked his heart-mind with knowledge nor exhausted himself with self-interest (si), but, rather, depended on laws and methods for settling matters of order and disorder, rewards and punishments for deciding on matters of right and wrong, and weights and balances for resolving issues of heavy or light...&lt;ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/&gt;

The reason why those who apportion horses use ce-lots, and those who apportion fields use gou-lots, is not that they take ce and gou-lots to be superior to human wisdom, but that one may eliminate private interest and stop resentment by these means. Thus it is said: 'When the great lord relies on fa and does not act personally, affairs are judged in accordance with (objective) method (fa).' The benefit of fa is that each person meets his reward or punishment according to his due, and there are no further expectations of the lord. Thus resentment does not arise and superiors and inferiors are in harmony.

If the lord of men abandons method (Fa) and governs with his own person, then penalties and rewards, seizures and grants, will all emerge from the lord's mind. If this is the case, then those who receive rewards, even if these are commensurate, will ceaselessly expect more; those who receive punishment, even if these are commensurate, will endlessly expect more lenient treatment... people will be rewarded differently for the same merit and punished differently for the same fault. Resentment arises from this."&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.

A floating seed of the p'eng plant, meeting a whirlwind, may be carried a thousand li, because it rides on the power (shi) of the wind. If, in measuring an abyss, you know that it is a thousand fathoms deep, it is owing to the figures which you find by dropping a string. By depending on the power (shi) of a thing, you will reach a point, however, distant it may be, and by keeping the proper figures, you will find out the depth, however deep it may be.

Han Fei says: 
{{block quote | The reason why I discuss the power of position is for the sake of… mediocre rulers. These mediocre rulers, at best they do not reach the level of [the sages] Yao or Shun, and at worst they do not behave like [the arch-tyrants] Jie or Zhou. If they hold to the law and depend on the power of their position, there will be order; but if they abandon the power of their position and turn their backs on the law, there will be disorder. Now if one abandons the power of position, turns one's back on the law, and waits for a Yao or Shun, then when a Yao or a Shun arrives there will indeed be order, but it will only be one generation of order in a thousand generations of disorder... Nevertheless, if anyone devotes his whole discourse to the sufficiency of the doctrine of position to govern All-under-Heaven, the limits of his wisdom must be very narrow.&lt;ref name="hutton.philosophy.utah.edu"&gt;Eric L. Hutton 2008. p.&amp;nbsp;437 Han Feizi's Criticism of Confucianism and its Implications for Virtue Ethics. http://hutton.philosophy.utah.edu/HFZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Used in many areas of Chinese thought, Shih probably originated in the military field.&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p.&amp;nbsp;11. A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomats relied on concepts of situational advantage and opportunity, as well as secrecy (shu) long before the ascendancy of such concepts as sovereignty or law, and were used by kings wishing to free themselves from the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;92. A History of Chinese Civilization. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA92&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Tzu]] would go on to incorporate Taoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, and Legalist punishment and rewards as systematic measures of organization, recalling Han Fei's concepts of power (shih) and tactics (shu).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.&amp;nbsp;12. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Kissinger]]'s ''On China'' says: "Chinese statesmanship exhibits a tendency to view the entire strategic landscape as part of a single whole... Strategy and statecraft become means of 'combative coexistence' with opponents. The goal is to maneuver them into weakness while building up one's own shi, or strategic position." Kissinger considers the "maneuvering" approach an ideal, but one that ran in contrast to the conflicts of the Qin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger 2012 p.&amp;nbsp;31. On China&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shen Dao====
Searching out the causes of disorder, [[Shen Dao]] observed splits in the ruler's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Masayuki Sato 2003. p.&amp;nbsp;122. The Confucian Quest for Order. https://books.google.com/books?id=FXJuJl5XTqAC&amp;pg=PA134&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao's theory on power echoes [[Shen Buhai]], referenced by [[Xun Kuang]] as its originator, who says "He who (can become) singular decision-maker can become the sovereign of All under Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;A.C.

* Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.&amp;nbsp;205. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Shen Dao, "Power" (势 Shih) refers to the ability to compel compliance; it requires no support from the subjects, though it does not preclude this.&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; (Shih's) merit is that it prevents people from fighting each other; political authority is justified and essential on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. pp.&amp;nbsp;200,202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao says: "When All under Heaven lacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out the principles [of orderly government, li 理]…. Hence the Son of Heaven is established for the sake of All under Heaven... All under Heaven is not established for the sake of the Son of Heaven…"&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Talent cannot be displayed without power.&lt;ref name="Chen p.113"&gt;Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.&amp;nbsp;113. Leadership and Management in China&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Dao says: "The flying dragon rides on the clouds and the rising serpent wanders in the mists. But when the clouds disperse and the mists clear up, the dragon and the serpent become the same as the earthworm and the large winged black ant because they have lost what they ride."&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; Leadership is not a function of ability or merit, but is given by some a process, such as giving a leader to a group.&lt;ref&gt;John Emerson 2012. p.&amp;nbsp;11. 
A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt; "The ruler of a state is enthroned for the sake of the state; the state is not established for the sake of the prince.

A Study of Shen Dao.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually disregarded by the Fa-Jia, Shen Dao considers moral capability useful in terms of authority. If the ruler is inferior but his command is practised, it is because he is able to get support from people.&lt;ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/&gt; But his ideas otherwise constitute a "direct challenge" to Confucian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;B.W. Van Norden. 2013 p.&amp;nbsp;49. Han Fei and Confucianism: Toward a Synthesis. Dao Companion to the Han Feizi&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue is unreliable because people have different capacities. Both morality together with intellectual capability are insufficient to rule, while position of authority is enough to attain influence and subdue the worthy, making virtue "not worth going after."&lt;ref&gt;Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. pp.&amp;nbsp;202–205.

====Han Fei====
Like Shen Dao, Han Fei seems to admit that virtue or charisma can have persuasive power even in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric L. Hutton 2008. p.&amp;nbsp;442 Han Feizi's Criticism of Confucianism and its Implications for Virtue Ethics. http://hutton.philosophy.utah.edu/HFZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, he considers virtue instrumental, and Wu-wei, or nonaction, as it's essence.&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei, De, Welfare. Schneider, Henrique. Asian Philosophy. Aug2013, Vol. 23 Issue 3, p266,269. 15p.

==Han Fei (280–233 BC)==
Intending to abolish philosophy, [[Han Fei]] rejects moral reform or any natural basis for it, and considers philosophical disputation an attempt to replace the Confucians (obtain office). He inheres however to the tradition of Fa, considering coherent discourse essential for the functioning of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA366

Public, measurement-like standards for applying names (administrative standards or job contracts) can "plausibly make it hard for clever ministers to lie, (or) for glib talkers to take people (or the ruler) in with sophistries... (They make it possible to) correct the faults of superiors, expose error, check excess, and unify standards... Laws, by themselves, cannot prevent the ruler from being fooled or deceived. The ruler needs Fa." Han Fei's arguments for "rule by law" (Fa) would not have as much persuasive power as they do if not for Fa, without which its objectives cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="Hansen, Chad p435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;367 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA367&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects Confucian Li, scholarly interpretation and opinion, worldly knowledge, and reputation: models must be measured, dissolving behaviour and disputes of distinction into practical application.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;366 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA366

Han Fei considers Xing-Ming an essential element of autocracy, saying that "In the way of assuming Oneness names are of first importance. When names are put in order, things become settled down; when they go awry, things become unfixed.”&lt;ref&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;114.

Monumenta Serica, 39, 87–114. {{JSTOR|40726902}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes that through this system, initially developed by Shen Buhai, uniformity of language could be developed,&lt;ref name="philosophy1"/&gt; functions could be strictly defined to prevent conflict and corruption, and objective rules (Fa) impervious to divergent interpretation could be established, judged solely by their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="google91"/&gt; By narrowing down the options to exactly one, discussions on the "right way of government" could be eliminated.

Though recommending use of [[Shen Buhai]]'s techniques, Han Fei's Xing-Ming is both considerably narrower and more specific. The functional dichotomy implied in Han Fei's mechanistic accountability is not readily implied in Shen's, and might be said to be more in line with the later thought of the Han dynasty linguist [[Xu Gan]] than that of either Shen Buhai or his teacher [[Xun Kuang]].&lt;ref&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;82.

====The "Two Handles"====
[[File:백호 조선고적도보.jpg|alt=|thumb|Mythical White Tiger. Qin Shi Huang was called the "Tiger of Qin"

The two August Lords of high antiquity grasped the handles of the Way and so were established in the center. Their spirits mysteriously roamed together with all transformations and thereby pacified the four directions. [[Huainanzi]]]]

Though not entirely accurately, most Han works identify Shang Yang with penal law.&lt;ref name="Creel, What Is Taoism?, 100"&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 100&lt;/ref&gt; Its discussion of bureaucratic control is simplistic, chiefly advocating punishment and reward.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; Shang Yang was largely unconcerned with the organization of the bureaucracy apart from this.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 100, 102&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these "two handles" (punishment and reward) nonetheless forms a primary premise of Han Fei's administrative theory.&lt;ref&gt;Christian von Dehsen Christian von Dehsen, Philosophers and Religious Leaders https://books.google.com/books?id=XZrbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT400&lt;/ref&gt; However, he includes it under his theory of Shu in connection with Xing-Ming.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.367"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;367 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA367&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of illustration, if the "keeper of the hat" lays a robe on the sleeping Emperor, he has to be put to death for overstepping his office, while the "keeper of the robe" has to be put to death for failing to do his duty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Eileen Tamura 1997 p.&amp;nbsp;54. China: Understanding Its Past, Volume 1. https://books.google.com/books?id=O0TQ_Puz-w8C&amp;pg=PA54&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of the "Two Handles" likens the ruler to the tiger or leopard, which "overpowers other animals by its sharp teeth and claws"(rewards and punishments). Without them he is like any other man; his existence depends upon them. To "avoid any possibility of usurpation by his ministers", power and the "handles of the law" must "not be shared or divided", concentrating them in the ruler exclusively.

In practice, this means that the ruler must be isolated from his ministers. The elevation of ministers endangers the ruler, with which he must be kept strictly apart. Punishment confirms his sovereignty; law eliminates anyone who oversteps his boundary, regardless of intention. Law "aims at abolishing the selfish element in man and the maintenance of public order", making the people responsible for their actions.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.2,4"/&gt;

Han Fei's rare appeal (among Legalists) to the use of scholars (law and method specialists) makes him comparable to the Confucians, in that sense. The ruler cannot inspect all officials himself, and must rely on the decentralized (but faithful) application of laws and methods (fa). Contrary to Shen Buhai and his own rhetoric, Han Fei insists that loyal ministers (like [[Guan Zhong]], [[Shang Yang]], and [[Wu Qi]]) exist, and upon their elevation with maximum authority. Though Fa-Jia sought to enhance the power of the ruler, this scheme effectively neutralizes him, reducing his role to the maintenance of the system of reward and punishments, determined according to impartial methods and enacted by specialists expected to protect him through their usage thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Pines 2003 pp.&amp;nbsp;77,83. Submerged by Absolute Power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Chen Qiyou 2000: 2.6.107)&lt;/ref&gt; Combining Shen Buhai's methods with Shang Yang's insurance mechanisms, Han Fei's ruler simply employs anyone offering their services.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gernet 1982 p.&amp;nbsp;91. A History of Chinese Civilization. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wu wei===
Devoting the entirety of Chapter 14, "How to Love the Ministers", to "persuading the ruler to be ruthless to his ministers", Han Fei's enlightened ruler strikes terror into his ministers by doing nothing (Wu wei). The qualities of a ruler, his "mental power, moral excellence and physical prowess" are irrelevant. He discards his private reason and morality, and shows no personal feelings. What is important is his method of government. Fa (administrative standards) require no perfection on the part of the ruler.&lt;ref name="Ellen Marie Chen p.2,4"&gt;Ellen Marie Chen, 1975 pp.&amp;nbsp;2,4, 6–9 Reason and Nature in the Han Fei-Tzu, Journal of Chinese Philosophy Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Han Fei's use of Wu-Wei may have been derivative of Taoism, but its Tao is qualitatively different from the Laozi's, emphasizing autocracy ("Tao does not identify with anything but itself, the ruler does not identify with the ministers") and Shu as a "practical principle of political control" more than any state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Lu 1998.

==Enlightened absolutism==
Even if the Fa-Jia were not ardent absolutists (and Han Fei believed that most rulers would be average), they would never dream of openly challenging absolutism, and its methods are presented as empowering the ruler. Han Fei's doctrine, however, challenges its absolutist premise out of its own mouth. In order for its administration to function, the ruler must act as a cog in its operation, and that alone. The operation of Fa implies non-interference not only in its application, but also in its development, determined through method.

[[Sinologist]] Xuezhi Guo contrasts the Confucian "Humane ruler" with the Legalists as "intending to create a truly 'enlightened ruler{{'"}}. He quotes [[Benjamin I. Schwartz]] as describing the features of a truly Legalist "enlightened ruler":&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Guo p.&amp;nbsp;141 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader. https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA141&lt;/ref&gt;

Guided by Legalist thought, the First Qin Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] conquered and unified the [[Seven Warring States|China's warring states]] into [[Commandery (China)|thirty-six administrative provinces]], under what is commonly thought of as the first Chinese [[Tianxia|Empire]], the [[Qin dynasty]]. The Qin document "On the Way of Being an Official" proclaims the ideal of the official as a responsive conduit, transmitting the facts of his locale to the court, and its orders, without interposing his own will or ideas. It charges the official to obey his superiors, limit his desires, and to build roads to smooth the transmitting of directives from the center without modification. It praises loyalty, absence of bias, deference, and the appraisal of facts.&lt;ref name="Mark Edward Lewis p.22"&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, 1999 p.&amp;nbsp;22, Writing and Authority in Early China&lt;/ref&gt;

The intrastate [[realpolitik]] would end up devouring the philosophers themselves. Holding that if punishments were heavy and the law equally applied, neither the powerful nor the weak would be able to escape consequences, [[Shang Yang]] advocated the state's right to punish even the ruler's tutor, and ran afoul of the future King [[Huiwen of Qin]] ({{circa|lk=no|338}}–311 BC). Whereas at one point, Shang Yang had the power to exile his opponents (and, thus, eviscerate individual criticism) to border regions of the state, he was captured by a law he had introduced and died being torn into pieces by [[chariot]]s. Similarly, [[Han Fei]] would end up being poisoned by his envious former classmate [[Li Si]], who in turn would be killed (under the law he had introduced) by the aggressive and violent Second Qin Emperor that he had helped to take the thrones.

As recorded in the [[Shiji]] and [[Book of Han]], the [[Han dynasty]] took over the governmental institutions of the [[Qin dynasty]] almost unchanged,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 105&lt;/ref&gt; but in its early decades it was not a centralized state, parcelling out the country to a number of relatives, who as vassal kings who ruled with full authority.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 107"/&gt; The reputation of Legalism suffered from its association with the former Qin dynasty. Sima Tan, though hailing the Fa "school" for "honouring rulers and derogating subjects, and clearly distinguishing offices so that no one can overstep [his responsibilities]", criticized the Legalist approach as "a one-time policy that could not be constantly applied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-legalism/ 1. Defining Legalism (Shiji 130: 3289–3291; for translations cf. Smith 2003: 141; Goldin 2011: 89).]&lt;/ref&gt; Though different philosophically, the pairing of figures like Shen Buhai and Shang Yang along with Han Fei became common in the early Han dynasty, Sima Tan glossing the three as Fa Jia and his son as adherents of "xing ming" ("performance and title").&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

The syncretic [[Han Dynasty]] text, the [[Huainanzi]] writes that "On behalf of the Ch'in, Lord Shang instituted the mutual guarantee laws, and the hundred surnames were resentful. On behalf of Ch'u, Wu Ch'i issued order to reduce the nobility and their emoluments, and the meritorious ministers revolted. Lord Shang, in establishing laws, and Wu Ch'i, in employing the army, were the best in the world. But Lord Shang's laws [eventually] caused the loss of Ch'in for he was perspicacious about the traces of the brush and knife, but did not know the foundation of order and disorder. Wu Ch'i, on account of the military, weakened Ch'u. He was well practiced in such military affairs as deploying formations, but did not know the balance of authority involved in court warfare."&lt;ref name="Ralph D Sawyer 1993. p.201"&gt;Ralph D Sawyer, 1993. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. Wu-Tzu p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt; Usually referring to Warring States period philosophers, during the Han Fa-jia would be used for others disliked by the Confucian orthodoxy, like the otherwise Confucianistic reformers [[Guan Zhong]] and [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]],&lt;ref&gt;Rickett, Guanzi. p3 " The political writings are usually described as Legalist, but 'Realist' might make a description. For the most part they tend to present a point of view much closer to that of the realistic Confucian, Xunzi than either the highly idealistic Confucianism of Mencius or the Draconian Legalism advocated by Shang Yang"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Huang-Lao]] Taoists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~g380/4.8-Huang-Lao-2010.pdf Huang-Lao Ideology. Indiana University, History G380  – class text readings  – Spring 20 10 – R. Eno. "When Sima Qian and other early historians discuss the intellectual trends of the early Han, they frequently refer to a school of thought known as "Huang-Lao"... As any quick survey of the texts will indicate, these documents are deeply syncretic, that is to say they draw together selected ideas from many different schools and attempt to present them in a harmonious arrangement. Among these schools, Laozi-style Daoism is clearly foremost. However, Legalism and certain militarist schools contribute a very significant portion of these ideas as well. Mohist and Confucian influences can also be detected, but their contributions are generally scattered and do not shape the overall structure of the texts."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influences (Xing-Ming)==
The [[Shiji]] records Li Si as repeatedly recommending "supervising and holding responsible", which he attributed to [[Shen Buhai]].&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 83"/&gt; A stele set up by [[Qin Shi Huang]] memorializes him as a sage that, taking charge of the government, established Xing-Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 105, 112, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Han dynasty, [[Sima Tan]]'s [[Huang–Lao|Taoist syncretism]] almost unmistakably uses the same sort of technique as Shen Buhai, saying:

{{block quote | When the congregation of ministers has assembled, the ruler lets each do as he will (zi ming). If result coincides with claim, this is known as 'upright'; if it does not, this is known as 'hollow'."&lt;ref&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;74. Name and Actuality in Early Chinese Thought. https://books.google.com/books?id=GId_ASbEI2YC&amp;pg=PA74&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Huang–Lao]] text [[Huangdi Sijing|Jing fa]] says
{{block quote | The right way to understand all these (things) is to remain in a state of [vacuity,] formlessness and non-being. Only if one remains in such a state, may he thereby know that (all things) necessarily possess their forms and names as soon as they come into existence, even though they are as small as autumn down. As soon as forms and names are established, the distinction between black and white becomes manifest... there will be no way to escape from them without a trace or to hide them from regulation... [all things] will correct themselves.&lt;ref&gt;L.K. Chen and H.C.W Sung 2015 p.&amp;nbsp;253 Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=L24aBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shiji states that [[Emperor Wen of Han]] was "basically fond of Xing-Ming." Jia Yi advised Wen to teach his heir to use Shen Buhai's method, so as to be able to "supervise the functions of the many officials and understand the usages of government." Pressure groups saw Jia Yi's dismissal, but was brought back to criticize the government. Two advisors to Wen's heir, [[Emperor Jing of Han]] were students of Xing-Ming, one passing the highest grade of examination, and admonished Jing for not using it on the feudal lords.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87, 103, 106–107, 115

By the time of the civil service examination was put into place, Confucian influence saw outright discussion of Shen Buhai banned. Xing-Ming is not discussed by Imperial University's promoter, the famous Confucian [[Dong Zhongshu]]. However, the Emperor under which it was founded, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], was both familiar with and favorable to Legalist ideas, and the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by [[Gongsun Hong]], who did write a book on Xing-Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 86–87, 115&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emperor Xuan of Han]] was still said by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87

The administration and political theory developed during the formative [[Warring States period]] would still influence every dynasty thereafter, as well as the Confucian philosophy that underlay Chinese political and juridical institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1288392 |first=Paolo D. |last=Farah |title=The Influence of Confucianism on the Construction of the Chinese Political and Juridical System}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the Fa-Jia on Han Confucianism is very apparent, adopting Han Fei's emphasis of a supreme ruler and authoritarian system rather than [[Mencius]]'s devaluation thereof, or [[Xun Kuang]]'s emphasis on the Tao.&lt;ref&gt;Lihsueh Lin, 1990 p.&amp;nbsp;444.

He uses the imagery of the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzhi]] of the knife and hatchet as examples of skillful technique in both virtue and force, saying "benevolence, righteousness, kindness and generosity are the ruler's sharp knife. Power, purchase, law and regulation are his axe and hatchet".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Czikszentmihalyi p.&amp;nbsp;49, 65.

[[Emperor Wu of Han]] (140–87 BC) barred Legalist scholars from official positions and established a university for the study of the Confucian classics,{{sfnp|Creel|1953|p=159}} but his policies and his most trusted advisers were Legalist.{{sfnp|Creel|1953|pp=166–171}} [[Michael Loewe]] called the reign of Emperor Wu the "high point" of Modernist (classically justified Legalist) policies, looking back to "adapt ideas from the pre-Han period."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Csikszentmihalyi 2006 pp.&amp;nbsp;xxiv, xix Readings in Han Chinese Thought&lt;/ref&gt; An official ideology cloaking Legalist practice with Confucian rhetoric would endure throughout the imperial period, a tradition commonly described as ''wàirú nèifǎ'' ({{zh|t=外儒内法|l=outside Confucian, inside Legalist}}).{{sfnp|Fu|1996|p=8}}

It became commonplace to adapt Legalist theories to the Han state by justifying them using the classics, or combining them with the notion of the "way" or "pattern of the cosmos" ("The Way gave birth to law" [[Huangdi Sijing]]).

In 1572 [[Zhang Juzheng]], a legalistic, prime-minister like figure of the Ming Dynasty, had the young emperor of the time issue a warning edict against China's bureaucracy with the reference that they had abandoned the public interest for their own private interests. It reads: "From now on, you will be pure in your hearts and scrupulous in your work. You will not harbor private designs and deceive your sovereign...  You will not complicate debates and disconcert the government." It suggests that good government will prevail as long as top ministers were resolute in administration of the empire and minor officials were selflessly devoted to the public good. It is said that the officials became "very guarded and circumspect" following its release. His "On Equalizing Taxes and Succoring the People" postulated that the partiality of local officials toward powerful local interests was responsible for abuses in tax collection, hurting both the common people and the Ming state.&lt;ref&gt;H. Miller 2009 p.&amp;nbsp;27. State versus Gentry in Late Ming Dynasty China, 1572–1644&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Juzheng wrote that "it is not difficult to erect laws, but it is difficult to see they are enforced." His Regulation for Evaluating Achievements (kao cheng fa) assigned time limits for following government directives and made officials responsible for any lapses, enabling Zhang to monitor bureaucratic efficiency and direct a more centralized administration. That the rules were not ignored are a testament to his basic success.&lt;ref&gt;H. Miller 2009 p.&amp;nbsp;32. State versus Gentry in Late Ming Dynasty China, 1572–1644&lt;/ref&gt;

Legalism was partly rehabilitated in the twentieth century by new generations of intellectuals. One, Mai Menghua (1874–1915), promulgated interest in Shang Yang's thought, comparing Shang Yang's view of history with the evolutionary ideas of western theorists.

Two decades of reform, Russia's collapse and a financial crisis in the 1990s only served to increase its importance, and the 1999 constitution was amended to "provide for the establishment of a socialist rule-of-law state", aimed at increasing professionalism in the justice system. Signs and flyers urged citizens to uphold the rule of law. In the following years figures like Pan Wei, a prominent Beijing political scientist, would advocate for a consultative rule of law with a redefined role for the party and limited freedoms for speech, press, assembly and association.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom 2002 pp.&amp;nbsp;ix,x,4.

Legalist discourse is seeing a resurgence during the [[Paramount leader|leadership]] of [[Xi Jinping]], who is the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], with journalists reporting on his fondness for the Chinese classics, alongside Confucianism including Legalist writers and in particular [[Han Fei]], both of which Xi sees as relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/world/leader-taps-into-chinese-classics-in-seeking-to-cement-power.html|title=Leader Taps into Chinese Classics in Seeking to Cement Power|date=12 October 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;19.

A key phrase of Xi's reforms is "govern the state according to law" (yi fa zhi guo), but focuses on enforcing discipline on party and government officials first.&lt;ref&gt;David K Schneider May/June 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;20. China's New Legalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Realists===
In the Western world some early modern scholars used the term Realist, believing that said Realists, rejecting all appeals to tradition and the supernatural, held that law should replace morality.&lt;ref name="Creel,What Is Taoism?, 94"&gt;Creel,What Is Taoism?, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark Edward Lewis p.18-19"&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, 1999 pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19, Writing and Authority in Early China&lt;/ref&gt; Waley contrasts what he terms the Realists with other the schools as largely ignoring the individual, holding that the object of any society is to dominate other societies,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Waley 1982. p.&amp;nbsp;194&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A.F.P. Hulsewé]] writes "(Shang Yang and Han Fei) were not so interested in the contents of the laws as in their use as a political tool... the predominantly penal laws and a system of rewards were the two 'handles{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Remnants of Han Law. by A. F. P. Hulsewe. Page 7 (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Angus Charles Graham sketched the fundamentals of an "amoral science" largely on the basis of the Han Feizi, consisting of "adapting institutions to changing situations and overruling precedent where necessary; concentrating power in the hands of the ruler; and, above all, maintaining control of the factious bureaucracy."&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Goldin, Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism. pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15 https://www.academia.edu/24999390/Persistent_Misconceptions_about_Chinese_Legalism_&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Liang Zhiping]] theorized that law emerged initially in China, namely, as an instrument by which a single clan exercised control over rival clans.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Winston. Singapore Journal of Legal Studies [2005] 313–347. The Internal Morality of Chinese Legalism. http://law.nus.edu.sg/sjls/articles/SJLS-2005-313.pdf5{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier [[Spring and Autumn period]], a Qin king is recorded as having memorialized penalty as a ritual function benefiting the people, saying "I am the little son: respectfully, respectfully I obey and adhere to the shining virtuous power, brightly spread the clear punishments, gravely and reverentially perform my sacrifices to receive manifold blessings. I regulate and harmonize myriad people, gravely from early morning to evening, valorous, valorous, awesome, awesome – the myriad clans are truly disciplined! I completely shield the hundred nobles and the hereditary officers. Staunch, staunch in my civilizing and martial [power], I calm and silence those who do not come to the court [audience]. I mollify and order the hundred states to have them strictly serve the Qin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oriens-extremus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OE45-03.pdf Biases and Their Sources: Qin History in the Shiji, Yuri Pines (Jerusalem), pg 11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Terrill]] writes that "Chinese Legalism is as Western as Thomas Hobbes, as modern as Hu Jintao. It speaks the universal and timeless language of law and order. The past does not matter, state power is to be maximized, politics has nothing to do with morality, intellectual endeavour is suspect, violence is indispensable, and little is to be expected from the rank and file except an appreciation of force." He calls Legalism the "iron scaffolding of the Chinese Empire", but emphasizes the marriage between Legalism and Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Terril 2003 pp.&amp;nbsp;68–69. The New Chinese Empire https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;pg=PA68&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese law expert Peerenboom compares Han Fei against the accepted standards of legal positivism and concluded that he is a legal positivist. Establishing the ruler as the ultimate authority over the law, he also "shares the belief that morality and the law need not coincide."&lt;ref&gt;Lim Xiao Wei, Grace 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;8. Law and Morality in the Han Fei Zi. http://www.scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10635/18874/Law%20and%20Morality%20in%20the%20Han%20Fei%20Zi.pdf?sequence=1{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legislation''' (or "[[statutory law]]") is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or "[[enactment of a bill|enacted]]") by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]] or the process of making it.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 289(3) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an [[Executive (government)|executive]] or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?  |author=Wim Voermans |journal=Legislacao Cadernos de Ciencia de Legislacao |volume=50 |pages=391–413 [402] |date=December 2009  |quote=Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to ''create'' legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to ''interpret'' legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

== Latest revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term ''legislation'' is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term ''[[primary legislation]]'' may be used to exclude these other forms.

==Dead letter==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dead-letter Dead Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1320">'''Maximum Medical Improvement''' (MMI) occurs when an injured [[employee]] reaches a state where his or her condition cannot be improved any further or when a treatment plateau in a person’s healing process is reached. It can mean that the patient has fully recovered from the injury or that the patient’s medical condition has stabilized to the point that no major medical or emotional change can be expected in the injured workers’ condition.  At that point, no further healing or improvement is deemed possible and this occurs despite continuing medical treatment or rehabilitative programs the injured worker partakes in. When a worker who is receiving [[Workers' Compensation]] benefits reaches maximum medical improvement, his or her condition is assessed and a degree of permanent or partial impairment is determined. This degree will impact the amount of benefits the worker is able to receive.

Maximum medical improvement means that treatment options have been exhausted. Temporary [[disability]] payments are terminated and a settlement is worked out regarding the condition of the worker at this point.

'''Home and Community-Based Services waivers''' (HCBS waivers) or '''Section 1915(c) waivers''', [[Title 42 of the United States Code|42 U.S.C.]] Ch. 7, § 1396n §§ 1915(c), are a type of [[Medicaid waiver]]. HCBS waivers are also sometimes referred to as the "settings rule" because they expand the types of settings in which people can receive comprehensive long-term care under Medicaid. Prior to the creation of HCBS waivers, comprehensive long-term care was available through Medicaid only in institutional settings. Under an HCBS waiver, states can use Medicaid funds to provide a broad array of non-medical services (excluding room and board) not otherwise covered by Medicaid, if those services allow recipients to receive care in community and residential settings as an alternative to institutionalization.{{sfn|Duckett|Guy|2000|p=123}}

==History==
Section 1915(c) was an amendment to the [[Social Security Act]] created as a part of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981]]. Adoption of HCBS waivers by states was initially slow, but Congress has enacted a series of reforms since 1981 to make the use of HCBS waivers less prohibitive. The Supreme Court case, ''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]]'' (1999), found unnecessary institutionalization to be a violation of the civil right established by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] that service be provided in the [[least restrictive environment]]. ''Olmstead'' allowed that states could be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act if they could demonstrate that they had a comprehensive, working plan to move people with disabilities into less restrictive settings.  This provision along with [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] guidance on ''Olmstead'' compliance led to rapid adoption by the states of the HCBS waiver.{{sfn|Shirk|2006|p=7}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2428">'''Metropolitan Educational Enterprises, Inc.''' is a company, founded in 1968 and based in [[Chicago, Illinois]], that reportedly sells educational materials through [[independent contractor]]s.  The company often targets [[Military of the United States|US military]] members as potential customers, sometimes even conducting door-to-door soliciting on [[military base]]s.

Military families have complained to the media that the company's representatives use deceptive selling techniques and hidden fees and charges. If military families fall behind on payments for expensive encyclopedias or educational materials, which customers report are often never or tardily delivered, the company used aggressive collection tactics, including calling the commanders of customer's [[military unit]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The '''Ministry of Justice of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics''' ('''USSR''') ({{lang-ru|Министерство юстиции СССР}}, ''Ministerstvo Yustitsii SSSR''), formed on 15 March 1946, was one of the most important government offices in the [[Soviet Union]]. It was formerly (until 1946) known as the '''People's Commissariat for Justice''' ({{lang-ru|'''Нар'''одный '''ком'''иссариат '''юст'''иции}}, ''Narodniy Komissariat Yustitsi'i'') abbreviated as Наркомюст (''Narkomiust''). The Ministry, at the All-Union (USSR-wide) level, was established on 6 July 1923, after the signing of the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]], and was in turn based upon the People's Commissariat for Justice of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) formed in 1917. The Ministry was led by the [[Minister of Justice]], prior to 1946 a Commissar, who was nominated by the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] and confirmed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet]], and was a member of the Council of Ministers.

The Ministry of Justice was responsible for courts, prisons, and probations. Further responsibilities included criminal justice policy, sentencing policy, and prevention of re-offending in the USSR. The Ministry was organised into All-Union and Union departments. The All-Union level ministries were divided into separate organisations in the Republican, Autonomous Oblast, and provincial level. The leadership of the Ministry of Justice came from notable Soviet law organisations from around the country.

==Duties and responsibilities==

The first page of a typical trial (''[[de facto]]'' execution) list from the time of the [[Great Purge]]]]
According to a decree from 1972, the Ministry of Justice prepared proposals for the [[Codification (law)|codification of law]]; it carried out [[methodological]] management of legal work in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|national economy]]. The Ministry directed and coordinated the work of state bodies and public organisations to promote legal knowledge and to clarify the law among the population about the judicial agencies, as well as general management of the civil registry, state, and legal profession. The Ministry was liable to [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Party]], [[Government of the Soviet Union|the state]], and [[Soviet people|the people]]. The Ministry's main goal was to strengthen [[socialist legality]] and the [[rule of law]] within Soviet judicial institutions.&lt;ref name="pravojustice"&gt;{{Cite web| author= [[Government of the USSR]]|script-title=ru:УКАЗ: ПОЛОЖЕНИЕ О МИНИСТЕРСТВЕ ЮСТИЦИИ СССР |trans-title=Decree: Position of the Ministry of Justice of the USSR | url = http://www.sssr.su/zopp.html | accessdate=14 October 2010|date=21 March 1972 |publisher=pravo.levonevsky.org|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry was organised into one All-Union (USSR-wide) ministry and 15 Union ministries. The leadership of the ministry consisted of notable figures of the judicial authority of the [[Soviet Republic (system of government)|Soviet Republics]], the military tribunals, [[Bar (law)|Bar]] members, [[Notary public|notaries]], and other judicial institutions. The leadership's task was to organise and prepare proposals for the codification of [[legislation]]. The organisational leadership, and the courts, had full control over the republican, autonomous, and provincial levels of government and the party.&lt;ref name="dumajustice"&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Government of the USSR]]|script-title=ru:УКАЗ: ПРЕЗИДИУМА ВЕРХОВНОГО СОВЕТА СССР|trans-title=Decree: Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR|url=http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/duma_na/asozd/asozd_text.php?code=106956|accessdate=13 October 2010|date=12 August 1971|publisher=[[State Duma]]|location=Moscow|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823112610/http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/duma_na/asozd/asozd_text.php?code=106956|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 1923 the All-Union People's Commissariat for Justice was dissolved, and its responsibilities, duties, and functions were given to the [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union|Procurator General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ferdinand, Maria Feldbrugge Joseph | title = The Emancipation of Soviet law  | location = | publisher = [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] | year = 1992 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8zAxiTgVBggC&amp;dq | isbn = 0-7923-1436-0 | pages = 144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of the Procuracy of the Ministry of Justice]], headed by a republican Procurator General, was responsible for limiting the powers of the Procurator General.&lt;ref name="articleone"&gt;{{cite book | author = Morgan, Glenn G. | title = Soviet administrative legality: the role of the attorney general's | location = | publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] | year = 1962 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Br6rAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq | isbn = 0-8047-0143-1 | pages = 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the grounds of stopping "unnecessary centralisation", the Ministry of Justice was dissolved both on the Union and the All-Union level. The functions of the Ministry was then handed to the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union|Supreme Court]] and the [[Legal Commission of the Council of Ministers]]. The Ministry was reestablished in 1970 by the [[Alexei Kosygin]] government. Extensive regulations on the Ministry were created by the Council of Ministers. The Ministry's main task was to direct and supervise judicially organs, both at the Union and All-Union level, according to a decree from 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Szirmai, Zsolt | title = Codification in the communist world | location = | publisher = Brill Archive | year = 1975 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8zAxiTgVBggC&amp;dq | isbn = 90-286-0125-2 | pages = 337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main task of the Ministry was to develop proposals on issues linked to the judicial system; the election of judges, elect the judiciary, organising the judiciary, studying and summarising of the [[jurisprudence]] in coordination with the Supreme Court, and to organise work for the maintenance of judicial statistics. According to [[Soviet law]], the Ministry could propose various measures to improve the Soviet court system.&lt;ref name="dumajustice"/&gt; According to Article 1 of the People's Commissariat for Justice, the commissariat's main task was to supervise the legal activities of the Soviet central agencies and the people's procurator.&lt;ref name="articleone"/&gt;

==Organisation==
The Ministry of Justice was headed by a Minister who was elected by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] between seasons, and authenticated by a [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] convocation. [[Deputies of the Ministry of Justice|Deputy Ministers]] were elected by the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]; allocation of the deputies was decided by the Ministry of Justice. Each deputy usually headed his or her own department. The minister, the deputies, and other senior officials formed the leadership circle, known as the [[Board of the Ministry of Justice of the USSR|Board of the Ministry of Justice]]. The members of this board were approved by the Council of Ministers. The Board of the Ministry held meetings regularly to discuss legal matters nationwide. Decisions made by the board were as a rule implemented nationwide. If the board disagreed they sought the assistance of the Council of Ministers to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="pravojustice"/&gt;

The structure and number of employees of the Ministry were approved by the Council of Ministers. Staffing of the central apparatus of the Ministry, as well as provisions of the departments and divisions, were approved by the Ministry of Justice. The seal of the Ministry of Justice was the [[Coat of arms of the Soviet Union|state emblem of the USSR]].&lt;ref name="pravojustice"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nikolai Krylenko.jpg|thumb|[[Nikolai Krylenko]] was the first People's Commissar for Justice of the USSR]]
In 1922 [[Vladimir Lenin]] chasitised the People's Commissariat for Justice for not dealing firmly enough with political opponents of the Bolsheviks and allowing [[capitalism]] to develop outside the framework of [[state capitalism]] outlined by the [[New Economic Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin, Vladimir]] | title = On the Tasks of the People's Commissariat for Justice under the New Economic Policy| url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/feb/20c.htm | accessdate=14 October 2010|date= |publisher=[[Marxist Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1936 the People's Commissariat for Justice existed only in the [[Union Republic]]an level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Solomon, Peter H. | title = Soviet criminal justice under Stalin | location = | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1996 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YHB3XhZlDiUC&amp;dq | isbn = 0-521-56451-4 | pages = xvi }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Krylenko]], the first People's Commissar of Justice, said in January 1933 that Soviet law waxed indignant about the leniency of some Soviet officials who objected to the infamous "five ears law":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Edvard Radzinsky|Radzinsky, Edvard]] | title = Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives | location = | publisher = Paw Prints | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cE2fPwAACAAJ&amp;dq | isbn = 1-4352-1196-0 | pages = 258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are sometimes up against a flat refusal to apply this law rigidly. One People's Judge told me flatly that he could never bring himself to throw someone in jail for stealing four ears. What we're up against here is a deep prejudice, imbibed with their mother's milk... a mistaken belief that people should be tried in accordance not with the Party's political guidelines but with considerations of "higher justice."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov]],  [[Nikita Khrushchev]] abolished the Ministry during the height of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] in an attempt to restore the [[Socialist law|"Leninist norms of socialist legality"]] which had disappeared under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule. Khrushchev tried to make the Soviet court more independent from central authority by enforcing the [[1936 Soviet Constitution|1936 constitution]] on the country's judicial branch. This would, according to Khrushchev, give the courts further independence from the central authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov|Avtorkhanov, Abdurakhman]] | script-title=ru:Технология власти |trans-title=Technology of power| url = http://bookz.ru/authors/abdurahman-avtorhanov/tehnologiq/page-39-tehnologiq.html | accessdate=14 October 2010|date= |publisher=bookz.ru|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions, duties, and responsibilities of the Ministry were reassigned to the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] and the [[Legal Commission of the Council of Ministers]] at all levels of Soviet society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Yatskov, Anna | script-title=ru:ИСТОРИЯ СОВЕТСКОГО СУДА |trans-title=History of the Soviet court| url = http://www.strana-oz.ru/?numid=11&amp;article=509 | accessdate=14 October 2010|date= |work=[[Notes of the Fatherland]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s it became clear that these reforms were not working as planned,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Government of the USSR]] | script-title=ru:Президиумы судов и некоторые вопросы судоустройства |trans-title=The Bureaux of the courts and some of the issues of the judicial system| url = http://law.edu.ru/article/article.asp?articleID=1179395 | accessdate=14 October 2010|date= |publisher=[[Business Law Institute]] of the [[State University of Management]] | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ministry was reestablished by the Alexei Kosygin government in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Government of the USSR]] | script-title=ru:Об утверждении Указов Президиума Верховного Совета СССР об образовании и преобразовании некоторых органов государственного управления и о внесении соответствующих дополнений в статьи 70 и 78 Конституции (Основного Закона) СССР |trans-title=On approval of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the formation and transformation of some government bodies and on making relevant amendments to Articles 70 and 78 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR| url = http://constitution.garant.ru/history/ussr-rsfsr/1936/zakony/3946556/ | accessdate=14 October 2010|date= |publisher=constitution.garant.ru | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry, along with the majority of other Soviet ministries, was supposed to be abolished in December 1991 on the orders of the [[State Council of the Soviet Union|State Soviet]], this did not happen, and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved itself before this date]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Government of the USSR]] | script-title=ru:ОБ УПРАЗДНЕНИИ МИНИСТЕРСТВ И ДРУГИХ ЦЕНТРАЛЬНЫХ ОРГАНОВ ГОСУДАРСТВЕННОГО УПРАВЛЕНИЯ СССР

'''The New Mobility Agenda''' is an international institution which, although a virtual and open collaborative project today, was originally set up by an international working group meeting at the [[Royaumont Abbey|Abbey de Royaumont]] near [[Paris]] in 1974 with the support of the Parisian [[OECD]] to challenge old ideas and practices in the field of urban transport through a long term collaborative program of information exchange, education and peer support. The Agenda today draws together the experience, expertise and support of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide in an open collaborative peer network. One of the original proponents of this approach, Professor [[Mikoto Usui]] then director of the OECD Development Centre, referred to it in the founding meeting at the "Abbé de Royaumont as an "invisible college".  Drawing together the experience and expertise of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide, who are networked via a combination of websites, discussion groups and fora, and collaborative projects, the Agenda takes an approach to transportation planning, policy and practice that has gained considerable force over the last two decades—provides a leading-edge alternative to earlier (20th century) methods of looking at and providing mobility for people and goods in cities.  The Agenda has received prestigious awards for its contributions, including the [[Stockholm Environment Challenge Prize]] (2000) and the [[World Technology Environment Award]] (2002).

Like the [[sustainable transportation]] movement,  to which it is closely related, it differs from previous methods (which in fact still dominate planning, policy, investment and operations in most parts of the world) in that it takes a global or broad [[systemic approach]] to the challenges of how to get around in cities, and is especially sensitive not only to pure transport efficiency (which traditionally is interpreted in pure engineering terms as speed and volume of vehicle throughput) but equally to matters of [[sustainable development]], [[pollution]] and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]]—including matters relating to [[climate change]], the reduction of [[Greenhouse gas]]es, [[resource efficiency]], [[energy conservation]], [[public health]], both personal and public economics, overall [[time saving]]s, [[public spaces]], and [[quality of life]] in communities, including relations between people in public spaces – with particular attention to [[social justice]] and the unmet needs of women, children, and others with mobility or economic or health disadvantages which are not being properly served in our present mainly [[car-based systems]] and thinking, in which other forms of transport, including  [[public transport]], play only residual roles.

== New Mobility vs. Sustainable Transportation ==
These two are closely related but not identical concepts. The term "[[Sustainable Transportation]]" had it origins in the mid-eighties and has developed over time and for the most part with particular emphasis on informing transport and environmental policy, with support from a number of university programs, NGOs and from some international and government organizations. By contrast the term New Mobility Agenda takes the issues of sustainable transportation the other way around: by emphasizing the supply side—and specifically targets projects and programs which demonstrate and achieve the basic principles behind sustainable transportation.

== Targeted near-term improvements ==
A distinguishing aspect of the new mobility approach is its emphasis on the importance of targeted near-term improvements. It does not give up at all on long term thinking, but in response to what are increasingly understood to be unacceptable levels of pressure coming from current transportation arrangements, and the speed with which this degradation is taking place, there is a growing consensus that projects and measures should be targeting substantial improvements within a period of two or four years.  In most places this also coincides with the electoral terms of those in office, thus giving those elected an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to more sustainable transportation arrangements.

== New Mobility and New Urbanism ==
These two movements share a common base of concern about the importance of bringing new approaches to the manner in which we structure our cities.   Both key on facilitating the move to more economically and environmentally efficient higher density communities.  Collaboration between the two independent programs is just getting underway

== In Brief ==
The New Mobility Agenda looks for and coordinates a complex ''bouquet'' of overlapping mobility services in an attempt to offer a high quality multi-level alternative – or complement – to the mostly car-based transport system of the city. Services most often incorporated into this multi-level alternative transport system include: [[Travel avoidance]], [[land use planning]], [[mixed use]], [[Transportation Demand Management]], [[Telecommuting]], [[Telework]], [[e-work]], [[Public space]] management, [[Shared space]], [[Human-powered transport]], [[Walking]] and [[Walkability]] , [[Pedestrianization]], [[Promenadology]], [[Traffic Calming]], [[Cycling]], [[public bicycle systems]], [[utility cycling]], [[public transit priority systems]], [[Bus rapid transit]], [[Car diets/reduction plans]],  [[HOV]], [[Intelligent transportation system]], LOV ([[Low-Occupancy Vehicle]]), [[Park and ride]], [[Parking]], [[Road diets]], [[Single-occupancy vehicle|SOV]], [[Single Occupancy Vehicle]], [[Toll roads]],   [[Car rental]] , [[Car Free Days]], [[Carpooling]], [[Carsharing]],  [[flexible working]], [[flextime]], [[Hitch-hiking]],   [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]], [[Midibus]], [[Mini-bus]], [[xTransit]],   [[Public transport]], [[Ride sharing]], [[economic instruments]], [[Congestion charging]], [[road pricing]], [[Full cost pricing]],  [[Roller skating]], [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks]], [[Share taxi]]s, [[Taxicab]],  [[Vanpooling]].

The individual components of ‘new mobility’, transportation modes and policies including those listed just above, are in generally broadly well understood and defined, at least at the leading edge. But what makes the whole an "agenda" stems from the fact that new mobility policies are based on the development and orchestration of extensive packages of measures which need to be brought on line over time and as experience and demonstrated competence with these new approaches develops. Hence the totality is referred to as an "agenda"

Continental Europe is leading the way in understanding and implementing the New Mobility Agenda, and the increasingly higher quality of their transportation systems performance and their life quality and environmental impacts are immediately visible to both visitors and those who live there.  German, Swiss, Dutch, Austrian, Danish, and increasingly the cities of France, Belgium, Northern Italy, and the rest of Scandinavia are joining in the new mobility/quality of life sweepstakes, driven as much by pride and strong local leadership as by purely negative factors (those these are many and important movers as well). A process has been engaged in Europe which other parts of the world are looking at and starting to emulate: cities increasingly looking at themselves and each other scanning for good ideas that they can take home and adapt for their communities.  This is thus an example of a virtuous spiral.  The [[European Commission]] has played an important supporting role in this process.

== Terminology ==
To appreciate fully what "[[new mobility]]" means, it is useful to see how it differs from "Old Mobility" (often defined as being stuck in traffic, waiting in the rain for a bus that may never come, or paying large amounts of taxpayer dollars for "improvements" that ultimately find us still late for work or waiting for that bus. (See the multi-media presentation of  A Day In The Life of New Mobility for one characterization of how it might look in day-to-day life in one city.)

What we now call  "old mobility’ thinking and practice is in effect the dominant paradigm of 20th century visions and practices. It is/was essentially oriented to the search for engineering, technological and infrastructural solutions for increasing speed and throughput capacity in specific links and at key points (including bottlenecks). The old mobility paradigm was one that has been characterized as "forecast (growth) and build".  Old mobility solutions more often than not cost a lot of money, and created a broadly shared mind-set in which the main limit to providing for yet further capacity increases within the system was constrained only by funding limitations from public sources. The old system was and is essentially hierarchical and "expert oriented and controlled". It is still dominant in many cities and parts of the world today.

(Since this entry is still in progress, here is an attempt to characterize the present arrangements and constraints that form it very broadly. By understanding these – if (a) true and (b) really a problem – we have a base for fine-tuning our proposed new solutions.  So, here is how old mobility looks from the specific vantage of the proponents of the New Mobility Agenda:

# Based on an essentially closed system (looking at "transport" in isolation from the rest)
# Hierarchical
# Top-down
# Centralized
# Statistics based (historical)
# Bounded
# Reductive
# End-state solution oriented
# Authoritarian
# Supply oriented
# Oriented to maximizing vehicle throughput and speeds
# Expert based
# Engineering-based (i.e., working "within the box", but with high technical competence)
# Binary: i.e., either "private" (i.e., car-based) or "public" transport (and nothing of importance in between)
# De facto car-based
# Costly to the community (unnecessarily)
# Costly to individuals (unnecessarily)
# Resource intensive (unnecessarily)
# Total dependence on costly imported fossil fuels (unnecessarily)
# Highly polluting
# Massive public health menace
# Destroys urban fabric
# Hardware and build solutions, technology oriented
# Treats ex-car solutions as (very!) poor cousins
# Offers poor service/economic package to elderly, handicapped, poor and young
# Sharp divide between planning, policy and operations
# Obscure (to the public) decision making processes
# Focuses on bottlenecks impeding traffic flows (i.e., builds for &gt; traffic)
# Attempts to anticipate them and build to forestall
# Searches for large projects to "solve" the problems
# These large projects and the substantial amounts involved often lead to corruption and waste of public moneys
# Still too much separation from underlying land use realities.
# Inadequate attention to transportation substitutes or complements
# Increasingly technical and tool oriented (this to the good)
# Anachronistic,
# Not doing the job that we need in 2005 and beyond!, and finally and worst of all. . .
# Creates a climate of passive citizenry and thus undermines participatory democracy and collective involvement and problem solving

The heart of new mobility policy by contrast is [[systemic complexity]], diversity, participation, wide outreach and a wide array of [[partnerships]] and other forms of synergistic interaction and collaboration.  It more often involves the orchestration of a large number of measures and policies, many of which often very small in themselves, in order to provide a dispersed modern city encompassing many different types of people and mobility needs – as opposed to the "big solution" approaches often favored in the past (whether major highway or [[road building]] or extensions, new [[Rapid transit]] ([[metros]], [[Subway (rail)|subways]] or other expensive [[rail systems]], massive central parking structures, and the like).  The goal of the planners and authorities changes radically with this new paradigm, such that rather than "solving problems" with centrally planned and executed engineering and measurement; they start to get more involved in multi-level complex problem-solving, which brings them to such quite different kinds of approaches such as community outreach and orchestration of services and the participation of a much larger number of actors and players.

The New Mobility Agenda addresses the issues on both the supply and demand sides. It thus combines Transportation Demand Management [[Transportation Demand Management|TDM]] strategies and measures for containing, channeling and limiting wasteful and encumbering private car traffic in cities, with coordinated support of a wide "bouquet" of alternative transportation arrangements.  These include various forms of [[Human-powered transport]], [[utility cycling]], [[walking]], [[public space]] improvement, electronic substitutes for travel (such as [[telework]], [[telecommuting]] or [[e-work]]) and a variety of shared and [[public transport]] strategies, new and old, including [[HOV]] (High Occupancy Vehicles), [[carpooling]], [[ride sharing]], [[car rentals]], [[taxicab]], [[Share taxi]], [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]]s, and the list goes on (see long list of modes and component parts in '''Internal Links''' below).

== History ==
What is today known as the New Mobility Agenda has had many antecedents and both before and since has proceeded in many places and on many fronts as [[traffic congestion]] and more generally the weight and poor performance—environmental, economic, social, and destruction of urban fabric—of the old, mainly car-based mobility system has increasingly made itself felt in city after city around the world.  Unsurprisingly the worst problems we are seeing today are in the cities of the developing countries, and most of all in their megacities – in most of which the old mobility thinking continues to carry the day in policy and investment circles who are proving slow to adjust. Over the last two decades this movement has steadily gained force to the point where  a growing array of programs and authorities are coming together in an attempt to create more balanced transportation systems, better equipped for dealing with the highly diverse mobility needs of people of all social and economic classes in the 21st century. (See references below for some of these.)

The '''New Mobility Agenda''' provides an example of a focused, international [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Network]] applied to the challenges of transport in cities. And while its antecedents are as old as the first time anyone got stuck in traffic and wondered about how things might be better organized, the actual "New Mobility Agenda" by that name was formally kicked off in 1996 during the [[OECD]] International Conference in [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]] (24–27 March 1996) under the title ''Towards Sustainable Transportation''.

In the wake of the 1996 ''Towards Sustainable Transportation'' conference, two things happened immediately which started to give concrete expression to this new movement.

* Working in cooperation with the [[OECD]]'s program [[EST – Environmentally Sustainable Transportation]] program a long-standing open expert forum organized on the topic area under [[The Commons: Open Society Sustainability Initiative]] in 1974 decided to relaunch their existing STEP program (Sustainable Transportation Emergency Program) with the name ''New Mobility Agenda''.  This program and its extensions today  bring together more than four thousand international experts and activists working in this area, and is guided by an  International Advisory Council. These individuals and groups are at work to develop a common frame of information and understanding mediated by a collection of exchange mechanisms, including a whole series of web sites, blogs, newsgroups, and periodic conferences, both physical and using the latest low cost video and voice conferencing techniques.
* In parallel the City of [[Toronto]] launched a program, Moving the Economy with an explicit  "New Mobility" Strategy, which continues to be active.  The City has also created its own New Mobility HUB Network, which is supported by a New Mobility HUB Survey which can be usefully applied with only minor adaptations to any other community.

== Collaborative New Mobility city projects, 1 Sept. 2007 update ==

Recent collaborative projects that are presently (early 2007) getting considerable attention in specialist and policy circles around the world, include the relaunching of the Journal of World Transport Policy and Practice include the continuation of the [[Toronto]] (Canada) New Mobility Hub regional network and their latest Seamless Link program. In parallel the open group has launched the New Mobility Advisory/Briefs program which is aimed specifically to engage mayors and city leaders to give more attention to low cost remedial measures and projects offering near term relief. The Agenda has also recently created a handful of open video libraries which can be accessed via ''New Mobility Video Library.''

The New Mobility program is in its work supporting the 1 August 2006 call of  the Clinton Climate Initiative for 80% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductions in cities over the next ten – fifteen years.  While not affiliated with the Clinton project, that is primarily looking at technology-based reforms in the largest world cities, the New Mobility program is concentrating on strategies to bring about major institutional  reforms and a massive repartitioning of the transportation arrangements of cities of all sizes, including in the high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sprawl areas that surround center cites.

The following cities are currently looking at eventual New Mobility projects and strategies: Paris, Stuttgart, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, Vancouver, Santa Barbara (CA).

=== Supply (New Mobility Building Blocks) ===
One point that needs to be made concerning these building blocks, is that in any given city these will involve at least ''hundreds'' of coordinated actions, many of which carried out by or requiring the active support of groups outside of the traditional public and transport sector.

The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of [[Lund University]], [[Sweden]], and Wolfgang Feist of the ''Institut für Wohnen und Umwelt'' (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, [[Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwu.de/1/home/ |title=Home |website=Institute for Housing and the Environment |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, their concept was further developed through a number of [[research project]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivhaustagung.de/Kran/First_Passive_House_Kranichstein_en.html |title=15th Anniversary of the Darmstadt - Kranichstein Passive House |first=Wolfgang |last=Feist |date=September 2006 |website=PassivHaustagung.de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714052350/http://www.passivhaustagung.de/Kran/First_Passive_House_Kranichstein_en.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; aided by financial assistance from the German state of [[Hessen]].

Much of the early 'Passive Houses' were based on research and the experience of North American builders during the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/forgotten-pioneers-energy-efficiency |title=Forgotten Pioneers of Energy Efficiency |website=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com |language=en |access-date=October 25, 2017|date=2009-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who—in response to the oil embargo—sought to build homes that used very little or no energy. These designs often utilized the sun as a heat source and the term 'passive house' was possibly derived from the passive solar features of these houses, such as the Saskatchewan Conservation House and the Leger House in Pepperell, Massachusetts.

=== First examples ===
The eventual construction of four [[row house]]s (terraced houses or town homes) was designed for four private clients by the [[architectural firm]] Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus [[House|residences]] were built in [[Darmstadt]] in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year.

=== Further implementation and councils ===
In September 1996, the [[Passivhaus-Institut]] was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivhaustagung.de/elfte/english/01_start_home.html |title=11th International Conference on Passive Houses, 2007 |website=PassivHaustagung.de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231014027/http://www.passivhaustagung.de/elfte/english/01_start_home.html |archivedate=December 31, 2008 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are located in Germany and [[Austria]], with others in various countries worldwide.

In 1996, after the concept had been validated at the Institute in Darmstadt, with space heating at 90% less than that required for a standard new building at the time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in [[Stuttgart]] (1993), [[Naumburg, Hesse]], [[Wiesbaden]], and [[Cologne]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/winter05/1-29.pdf |title=Passivhaus |first=Peter |last=Cox |magazine=Building for a Future |volume=15 |number=3 |year=2005 |pages=16–22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926152247/http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/winter05/1-29.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2006 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the [[European Union]] sponsored [[CEPHEUS]] project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000–2001. The first to be [[Product certification|certified]] was built in 2006 near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]] in [[Waldsee (camp)|Camp Waldsee]] of the German [[Concordia Language Villages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waldseebiohaus.typepad.com/ |title=Willkommen to Das BioHaus! |website=Waldsee BioHaus Environmental Living Center |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in [[Sonoma, California]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://passivworks.com/the-oneil-retrofit/ |title=The O'Neil Retrofit Remodel |website=Passivworks.com |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was certified in July 2010.

In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named "The Smith House" in [[Urbana, Illinois]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-colab.org/ecolab/SmithHouse.html |title=The Smith House 2002–2003 |website=E-colab.org |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/about-passive-house-institute-us/phius-milestones |title= PHIUS Milestones |website= Passive House Institute United States |accessdate= November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/about/mission-history |title= Mission &amp; History |website= Passive House Institute United States |accessdate= November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the PHIUS has released their PHIUS + 2015 Building Standard and has certified over 1,200 projects and 1.1 million square feet across the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/about/mission-history |title= Mission &amp; History |website= Passive House Institute United States |accessdate= November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards ==
[[File:Passivhaus thermogram gedaemmt ungedaemmt.png|thumb|300px|The dark colours on this [[thermogram]] of a Passive house, at right, shows how little heat is escaping compared to a traditional building to the left.]]

While some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the Passive House standard, others, such as [[superinsulation]], already existed, and the concept of [[passive solar building design]] dates back to antiquity. There was other previous experience with [[low-energy building]] standards, notably the German ''Niedrigenergiehaus'' (low-energy house) standard, as well as from buildings constructed to the demanding energy codes of Sweden and [[Denmark]].

=== The German Passivhaus Standard ===
The Passivhaus standard requires that the building fulfills the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://passivehouse.com/02_informations/02_passive-house-requirements/02_passive-house-requirements.htm |title=Passive House requirements |website=Passivhaus Institut |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivhusnorden.no/foredrag/Session%209%20-%20Haraldsalen%20-%203%20april%20-%201030/VTT%20Passivehouse%20Presentation%20Final.pdf |title=Concepts and market acceptance of a cold climate Passive House |website=passivhusnorden.no |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The building must be designed to have an annual heating and cooling demand as calculated with the Passivhaus Planning Package of not more than {{convert|15|kWh/m2|btu/ft2 MJ/ft2|sigfig=4|lk=out|abbr=on}} per year in heating or cooling energy OR be designed with a peak heat load of {{convert|10|W/m2|hp/1000sqft|abbr=on}}.
* Total [[primary energy]] (source energy for electricity, etc.) consumption (primary energy for [[Central heating|heating]], [[Water heating|hot water]] and [[electricity]]) must not be more than {{convert|60|kWh/m²|btu/ft2 MJ/ft2|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} per year. 
* The building must not leak more air than 0.6 times the house volume per hour (n&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0.6 / hour) at {{convert|50|Pa|abbr=on}} as tested by a [[blower door]], or alternatively when looked at the surface area of the enclosure, the leakage rate must be less than 0.05 cubic feet per minute.

=== Recommendations ===
* Further, the specific heat load for the heating source at design temperature is recommended, but not required, to be less than 10 [[Watt|W]]/m² (3.17 [[btu]]/h·ft²).

These standards are much higher than houses built to most normal building codes. For comparisons, see [[Passive house#International comparisons|the international comparisons section]] below.

National partners within the 'consortium for the Promotion of European Passive Houses' are thought to have some flexibility to adapt these limits locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanpassivehouses.org/ |title=Promotion of European Passive Houses |website=EuropeanPassiveHouses.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628051302/http://www.europeanpassivehouses.org/ |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space heating requirement ===
By achieving the Passivhaus standards, qualified buildings are able to dispense with conventional heating systems. While this is an underlying objective of the Passivhaus standard, some type of heating will still be required and most Passivhaus buildings do include a system to provide supplemental space heating. This is normally distributed through the low-volume [[heat recovery ventilation]] system that is required to maintain air quality, rather than by a conventional hydronic or high-volume [[forced-air]] heating system, as described in the [[Passive house#Space heating|space heating]] section below.

=== The American PHIUS Standard ===
The PHIUS + 2015 Standard primarily focuses on the reduction of the negative effects given by building operations, and it can be applied to all building types. Different from its German counterpart, this standard uses climate data sets to determine specific [[building performance]] criteria for different regions. Such information is determined using metrics that represent a space where significant [[carbon]] and energy reduction overlap with cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/phius-2015-new-passive-building-standard-summary |title= PHIUS + 2015: Passive Building Standard - North America |website=www.phius.org |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the PHIUS database includes over 1000+ [[climate]] data sets for North America. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/phius-2015-new-passive-building-standard-summary |title= PHIUS + 2015: Passive Building Standard - North America |website=www.phius.org |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PHIUS believes this approach to the Standard is essential, as North America has variety of different climates and different passive measures may be more effective than others. 

Five principles are addressed when a building tries to achieve passive house status under the PHIUS Standard: this includes [[airtightness]], [[ventilation]], [[waterproofing]], heating and cooling, and electrical loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/PHIUSPlus2015docs/PHIUS+%20Certification%20Guidebook%20v1.1.pdf |title= PHIUS + 2015: Passive Building Standard North America Guidebook |website=www.phius.org |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these principles, projects must pass building specified blower door, ventilation airflow, overall airflow, and [[electrical load]] tests; buildings must also achieve other measures such as low-emission materials, renewable energy systems, moisture control, outdoor ventilation, and energy efficient ventilation and space conditioning equipment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/PHIUSPlus2015docs/PHIUS+%20Certification%20Guidebook%20v1.1.pdf |title= PHIUS + 2015: Passive Building Standard North America Guidebook |website=www.phius.org |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All buildings must also pass a [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] test - this is implemented to ensure that the building continues to adhere to the regional criteria set forth by the PHIUS’ climate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phius.org/PHIUSPlus2015docs/PHIUS+%20Certification%20Guidebook%20v1.1.pdf |title= PHIUS + 2015: Passive Building Standard North America Guidebook |website=www.phius.org |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests and analyses of operative conditions are performed by PHIUS raters or verifiers. These are accredited professionals from the PHIUS that are able to perform on-site testing and inspections to ensure that the newly constructed building is adhering to the construction plans, created energy models, and desired operating conditions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=www.phius.org/become-a-professional/phius-quality-assurance-quality-control-professional-training/qa-qc-training-programs |title= QA/QC Training Programs |website=www.phius.org |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Construction costs ==
In Passivhaus buildings, the cost savings from dispensing with the conventional heating system can be used to fund the upgrade of the building envelope and the heat recovery ventilation system. With careful design and increasing competition in the supply of the specifically designed Passivhaus building products, in Germany it is now possible to construct buildings for the same cost as those built to normal German [[building code|building standards]], as was done with the Passivhaus apartments at [[Vauban, Freiburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivhaus-vauban.de/passivhaus.en.html |title=What is a Passive house? |first=Andreas |last=Delleske |website=Passivhaus-vauban.de |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average passive houses are reported to be more expensive upfront than conventional buildings &amp;ndash; 5% to 8% in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivehouse-international.org/index.php?page_id=79 |title=The Passive House – sustainable, affordable, comfortable, versatile |website=International Passive House Association |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Europe's Promise: Why the European Way Is the Best Hope in an Insecure Age |first=Steven |last=Hill |year=2010 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |page=172 |isbn=978-0-52024-857-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8% to 10% in UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/08/live-in-passive-house-passivhaus |title=How can I live in a passive house? |first=Lucy |last=Siegle |date=December 8, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5% to 10% in USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/highly-efficient-passive-homes-gain-ground-us-174019914.html |title=Highly efficient 'passive homes' gain ground in US |first=Joann |last=Loviglio |agency=Associated Press |date=June 12, 2013 |website=Yahoo!

Evaluations have indicated that while it is technically possible, the costs of meeting the Passivhaus standard increase significantly when building in [[Northern Europe]] above 60° [[latitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erg.ucd.ie/pep/pdf/Henk_Kaan.pdf |title=Passive Houses in High Latitudes |website=UCD Energy Research Group, University College Dublin |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erg.ucd.ie/pep/pdf/Tor_Helge_Dokka.pdf |title=Passive Houses in cold Norwegian climate |website=UCD Energy Research Group, University College Dublin |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; European cities at approximately 60° include [[Helsinki]] in Finland and [[Bergen]] in Norway. [[London]] is at 51°; [[Moscow]] is at 55°.

== Design and construction ==
[[File:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The Passivhaus uses a combination of [[:Category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies.]]

Achieving the major decrease in heating energy consumption required by the standard involves a shift in approach to building design and construction. Design may be assisted by use of the 'Passivhaus Planning Package' (PHPP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://passivehouse.com/04_phpp/04_phpp.htm |title=Passivhaus Planning Package |website=passivehouse.com |accessdate=January 21, 2018 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210014534/http://passivehouse.com/04_phpp/04_phpp.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses specifically designed [[computer simulation]]s.

To achieve the standards, a number of techniques and technologies are used in combination:&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25b" /&gt;

=== Passive solar design and landscape ===
[[Passive solar building design]] and [[energy-efficient landscaping]] support the Passive house energy conservation and can integrate them into a [[neighborhood]] and environment. Following [[List of low-energy building techniques|passive solar building techniques]], where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area, with principal windows oriented towards the equator - south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere - to maximize passive [[solar gain]]. However, the use of solar gain, especially in [[temperate]] [[climate]] regions, is secondary to minimizing the overall house energy requirements. In climates and regions needing to reduce excessive summer passive solar heat gain, whether from direct or reflected sources, ''[[Brise soleil]]'', [[tree]]s, attached ''[[pergola]]s'' with [[vine]]s, [[vertical garden]]s, [[green roof]]s, and other techniques are implemented.

Passive houses can be constructed from dense or lightweight materials, but some internal [[thermal mass]] is normally incorporated to reduce summer peak temperatures, maintain stable winter temperatures, and prevent possible overheating in spring or autumn before the higher [[effect of sun angle on climate|sun angle]] "shades" mid-day wall exposure and window penetration. Exterior wall color, when the surface allows choice, for reflection or absorption [[insolation]] qualities depends on the predominant year-round ambient outdoor temperature. The use of [[deciduous]] trees and wall [[trellis (architecture)|trellised]] or self attaching vines can assist in climates not at the temperature extremes.

=== Superinsulation ===
Passivhaus buildings employ [[superinsulation]] to significantly reduce the heat transfer through the walls, roof and floor compared to conventional buildings.&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/09/26/business/energy-environment/Passive.html |last=Swanson |first=Herb |title=Energy Efficiency, a Step Further |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of [[Building insulation|thermal insulation]] materials can be used to provide the required high [[R-value (insulation)|R-values]] (low [[U-value]]s, typically in the 0.10 to 0.15 W/(m²·K) range). Special attention is given to eliminating [[thermal bridge]]s.

A disadvantage resulting from the thickness of wall insulation required is that, unless the external dimensions of the building can be enlarged to compensate, the internal floor area of the building may be less compared to traditional construction.

In Sweden, to achieve passive house standards, the insulation thickness would be 335&amp;nbsp;mm (about 13 in) (0.10 W/(m²·K)) and the roof 500&amp;nbsp;mm (about 20 in) (U-value 0.066 W/(m²·K)).

=== Advanced window technology ===
[[File:Passivhaus Fenster Beispiele (blank).svg|thumb|300px|Typical Passive House windows.]]

To meet the requirements of the Passivhaus standard, windows are manufactured with exceptionally high [[R-value (insulation)|R-values]] (low U-values, typically 0.85 to 0.70 W/(m²·K) for the entire window including the frame). These normally combine triple-pane [[insulated glazing]] (with a good solar heat-gain coefficient,&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt; [[low-emissivity]] coatings, [[Hermetic seal|sealed]] [[argon]] or [[krypton]] gas filled inter-pane voids, and 'warm edge' insulating glass spacers) with air-seals and specially developed thermal break window frames.

In [[Central Europe]] and most of the [[United States]], for unobstructed south-facing Passivhaus windows, the heat gains from the sun are, on average, greater than the heat losses, even in mid-winter.

=== Airtightness ===
Building envelopes under the Passivhaus standard are required to be extremely [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] compared to conventional construction. They are required to meet either 0.60 ACH50 (air changes per hour at 50 pascals) based on the building's volume, or 0.05 CFM50/sf (cubic feet per minute at 50 pascals, per square foot of building enclosure surface area). In order to achieve these metrics, recommended best practice is to test the building air barrier enclosure with a [[blower door]] at [http://www.ecoachievers.com/notable-projects/pleasantly-tight-times-mf-passive-house/ mid-construction] if possible.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25b" /&gt;

Passive house is designed so that most of the air exchange with exterior is done by controlled ventilation through a [[heat-exchanger]] in order to minimize heat loss (or gain, depending on climate), so uncontrolled air leaks are best avoided.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25b" /&gt; Another reason is the passive house standard makes extensive use of insulation which usually requires a careful management of [[moisture]] and [[dew point]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_01.html |title=Insulation fact sheet |website=Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through air barriers, careful sealing of every construction joint in the building envelope, and sealing of all service penetrations.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt;

=== Ventilation ===
Use of passive [[natural ventilation]] is an integral component of passive house design where ambient temperature is conducive — either by singular or cross ventilation, by a simple opening or enhanced by the [[stack effect]] from smaller ingress with larger egress windows and/or [[clerestory]]-operable [[skylight (window)|skylight]].

When ambient climate is not conducive, mechanical [[heat recovery ventilation]] systems, with a heat recovery rate of over 80% and high-efficiency [[electronically commutated motor]]s (ECM), are employed to maintain air quality, and to recover sufficient heat to dispense with a conventional central heating system.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25b" /&gt; Since passively designed buildings are essentially [[Hermetic seal|air-tight]], the rate of air change can be optimized and carefully controlled at about 0.4 [[air changes per hour]]. All ventilation ducts are insulated and sealed against leakage.

Some Passivhaus builders promote the use of [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|earth warming tubes]] (typically ≈200&amp;nbsp;mm (~7,9 in) diameter, ≈40 m (~130&amp;nbsp;ft) long at a depth of ≈1.5 m (~5&amp;nbsp;ft)). These are buried in the soil to act as earth-to-air heat exchangers and pre-heat (or pre-cool) the intake air for the ventilation system. In cold weather the warmed air also prevents [[ice]] formation in the heat recovery system's [[heat exchanger]]. Concerns about this technique have arisen in some climates due to problems with condensation and mold.&lt;ref name="Uninhabitable"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Holladay |first=Martin |title=Belgian Passivhaus is Rendered Uninhabitable by Bad Indoor Air |journal=Green Building Advisor |date=June 1, 2012 |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/belgian-passivhaus-rendered-uninhabitable-bad-indoor-air |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, an earth to air heat exchanger can use a liquid circuit instead of an air circuit, with a heat exchanger (battery) on the supply air.

=== Space heating ===
[[File:Passivhaus heating de Kompakt.png|thumb|300px|In addition to the heat exchanger (centre), a micro-heat pump extracts heat from the exhaust air (left) and hot water heats the ventilation air (right). The ability to control building temperature using only the normal volume of ventilation air is fundamental.]]

In addition to using passive [[solar gain]], Passivhaus buildings make extensive use of their intrinsic heat from internal sources—such as waste heat from lighting, [[white goods]] (major appliances) and other electrical devices (but not dedicated heaters)—as well as body heat from the people and other animals inside the building. This is due to the fact that people, on average, emit heat equivalent to 100 [[watt]]s each of [[Black Body#Radiation emitted by a human body|radiated thermal energy]].

Together with the comprehensive [[energy conservation]] measures taken, this means that a conventional [[central heating]] system is not necessary, although they are sometimes installed due to client skepticism.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.09.25.d"&gt;Zeller, 2010. p.BU1. Example: in the case of the Landau home described in the NYT's article, several insurance companies refused to insure their home when they were told there was no home furnace in the structure, fearing that they would be held financially liable for frozen water pipe damage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Passive houses sometimes have a dual purpose 800 to 1,500 [[watt]] heating and/or cooling element integrated with the supply air duct of the ventilation system, for use during the coldest days. It is fundamental to the design that all the heat required can be transported by the normal low air volume required for ventilation. A maximum air temperature of 50&amp;nbsp;°C (122&amp;nbsp;°F) is applied, to prevent any possible smell of scorching from dust that escapes the filters in the system.

The air-heating element can be heated by a small [[heat pump]], by direct [[solar thermal energy]], [[annualized geothermal solar]], or simply by a [[natural gas]] or [[oil burner]]. In some cases a micro-heat pump is used to extract additional heat from the exhaust ventilation air, using it to heat either the incoming air or the [[hot water storage tank]]. Small wood-burning stoves can also be used to heat the water tank, although care is required to ensure that the room in which stove is located does not overheat.

Beyond the recovery of heat by the heat recovery ventilation unit, a well designed Passive house in the European climate should not need any supplemental heat source if the heating load is kept under 10 W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivhaustagung.de/zehnte/englisch/texte/PEP-Info1_Passive_Houses_Kronsberg.pdf |title=Passive House Estate in Hannover-Kronsberg |page=72 |website=Passivhaustagung.de |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the heating capacity and the heating energy required by a passive house both are very low, the particular [[List of energy resources|energy source]] selected has fewer financial implications than in a traditional building, although [[renewable energy]] sources are well suited to such low loads.

The Passive house standards in Europe determine a space heating and cooling energy demand of 15 [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]/year/m² of treated floor area and 10 W/m² peak demand. (Or, in imperial units, 4.75 kBTU/sf/yr and 3.2 BTU/sf/hr respectively.) In addition, the total energy to be used in the building operations including heating, cooling, lighting, equipment, hot water, plug loads, etc. is limited to 120 kWh/year/m² of treated floor area. (Or, in imperial units, 38.0 BTU/sf/yr.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passivehouseacademy.com/index.php/news-blogs/what-is-passive-house |title=What is Passive House? |website=www.passivehouseacademy.com |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lighting and electrical appliances ===
{{See also|Daylighting|Passive daylighting|Active daylighting|Ecological footprint}}

To minimize the total primary energy consumption, the many [[Passive daylighting|passive]] and [[Active daylighting|active]] [[daylighting]] techniques are the first daytime solution to employ. For low-light days, non-daylighted spaces, and nighttime, the use of creative-sustainable [[lighting design]] using low-energy sources can be used. Low-energy sources include 'standard voltage' [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s, [[solid-state lighting]] with [[LED lamp]]s, [[organic light-emitting diode]]s, [[Solid-state lighting#Polymer light-emitting diodes|PLED - polymer light-emitting diodes]], 'low voltage' [[electrical filament]]-[[Incandescent light bulb]]s, [[Ceramic discharge metal halide lamp|compact Metal halide]], [[Xenon arc lamps|Xenon]], and [[Halogen lamps]].

Solar powered exterior circulation, security, and [[landscape lighting]] - with [[photovoltaic cell]]s on each fixture or connecting to a central [[Solar panel]] system, are available for [[garden]]s and outdoor needs. Low voltage systems can be used for more controlled or independent illumination, while still using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps. Timers, [[motion detection]] and [[Sunlight|natural light]] operation sensors reduce energy consumption, and [[light pollution]] even further for a Passivhaus setting.

[[Home appliance|Appliance]] [[consumer product]]s meeting independent energy efficiency testing and receiving [[Ecolabel]] [[certification mark]]s for reduced electrical-'natural-gas' consumption and product manufacturing [[carbon emission label]]s are preferred for use in Passive houses. The ecolabel certification marks of [[Energy Star]] and [[EKOenergy]] are examples.

== Traits of passive houses ==
Typically, passive houses feature:
* Fresh, clean air: Note that for the parameters tested, and provided the filters (minimum F6) are maintained, [[HEPA]] quality air is provided. 0.3 air changes per hour (ACH) are recommended, otherwise the air can become "stale" (excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, flushing of indoor air pollutants) and any greater, excessively dry (less than 40% humidity). This implies careful selection of interior finishes and furnishings, to minimize indoor air pollution from [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]]'s (e.g., [[formaldehyde]]). This can be counteracted somewhat by opening a window for a very brief time, by plants, and by indoor fountains.
* Because of the high resistance to heat flow (high R-value insulation), there are no "outside walls" which are colder than other walls.
* Homogeneous interior temperature: it is impossible to have single rooms (e.g. the sleeping rooms) at a different temperature from the rest of the house. Note that the relatively high temperature of the sleeping areas is physiologically not considered desirable by some building scientists. Bedroom windows can be cracked open slightly to alleviate this when necessary.
* Slow temperature changes: with ventilation and heating systems switched off, a passive house typically loses less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C (1&amp;nbsp;°F) per day (in winter), stabilizing at around 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F) in the central European climate.
* Quick return to normal temperature: opening windows or doors for a short time has only a limited effect; after apertures are closed, the air very quickly returns to the "normal" temperature.
* Some have voiced concerns that Passivhaus is not a general approach as the occupant has to behave in a prescribed way, for example not opening windows too often. However modelling shows that such concerns are not valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Blight |first1=T. S. |last2=Coley |first2=D. A. |year=2013 |title=Sensitivity analysis of the effect of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of passive house dwellings |journal=Energy and Buildings |number=66 |pages=183–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International comparisons ==
* In the [[United States]], a house built to the Passive House standard results in a building that requires space heating energy of 1 [[BTU]] per square foot (11 kJ/m²) per [[heating degree day]], compared with about 5 to 15 BTUs per square foot (56-170 kJ/m²) per heating degree day for a similar building built to meet the 2003 Model Energy Efficiency Code. This is between 75 and 95% less energy for space heating and cooling than current new buildings that meet today's US energy efficiency codes. The Passivhaus in the German-language camp of [[Waldsee (camp)|Waldsee]], Minnesota was designed under the guidance of architect Stephan Tanner of INTEP, LLC, a Minneapolis- and Munich-based consulting company for high performance and sustainable construction. Waldsee BioHaus is modeled on Germany's Passivhaus standard: beyond that of the U.S. LEED standard which improves quality of life inside the building while using 85% less energy than a house built to Minnesota building codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waldseebiohaus.typepad.com/biohaus/design.html |title=Design &amp; Architecture  |website=Waldsee BioHaus Environmental Living Center |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; VOLKsHouse 1.0 was the first certified Passive House offered and sold in Santa Fe New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/award-winners/volkshouse-santa-fe-nm.aspx |first=Cheryl |last=Weber |date=July 19, 2012 |title=EHDA Grand Award: VOLKsHouse |website=EcoBuilding Pulse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[United Kingdom]], an average new house built to the Passive House standard would use 77% less energy for space heating, compared to the circa-2006 [[Energy efficiency in British housing|Building Regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erg.ucd.ie/pep/pdf/Energy_Saving_Potential_2.pdf |title=Energy Saving Potential of Passive Houses in the UK |website=UCD Energy Research Group, University College Dublin |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ireland]], it is calculated that a typical house built to the Passive House standard instead of the 2002 Building Regulations would consume 85% less energy for space heating and cut space-heating related [[carbon emissions]] by 94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erg.ucd.ie/pep/pdf/Irena_Kondratenko.pdf |title=Passive Houses in Ireland |website=UCD Energy Research Group, University College Dublin |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with zero energy buildings ==
{{Main|Zero-energy building}}

A net zero-energy building (ZEB) is a building that over a year does not use more energy than it generates. The first 1979 Zero Energy Design building used passive solar heating and cooling techniques with air-tight construction and super insulation. A few ZEB's fail to fully exploit more affordable conservation technology and all use onsite active [[renewable energy]] technologies like [[Building-integrated photovoltaic|photovoltaic]] to offset the building's primary energy consumption. Passive House and ZEB are complementary synergistic technology approaches, based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage: ZEBs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kWh/m² with help from on-site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the Passive House demand constraint of 120 kWh/m² which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources. [[Energy-plus-house|Energy Plus houses]] are similar to both PassivHaus and ZEB but emphasize the production of more energy per year than they consume, e.g., annual energy performance of -25 kWh/m² is an Energy Plus house.

== Tropical climate needs ==
In a tropical climate, it could be helpful for ideal internal conditions to use [[energy recovery ventilation]] instead of [[heat recovery ventilation]] to reduce the humidity load of ventilation on the mechanical dehumidification system. Although dehumidifiers might be used, heat pump hot water heaters also will act to cool and condense interior humidity (where it can be dumped into [[drain (plumbing)|drains]]) and dump the heat into the [[hot water tank]]. [[Passive cooling]], [[solar air conditioning]], and other solutions in [[passive solar building design]] need to be studied to adapt the Passive house concept for use in more regions of the world.

There is a certified Passive House in the hot and humid climate of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]], USA, which uses [[energy recovery ventilation]] and an efficient one ton air-conditioner to provide cooling and dehumidification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/green-building-news/following-passive-house-deep-south |last=Defendorf |first=Richard |title=Following Up on a Passive House in the Deep South |website=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clearfield |first=Lynne |title=Passive House, Aggressive Conservation |journal=Solar Today |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=22–25 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar access is a very important factor in any design of a passive house as it allows the structure to use the solar energy to heat and light the space naturally, replace electrical water heaters with solar-energy-based water heaters.

'''Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach''' (14 November 1775{{snd}}29 May 1833) was a [[Germany|German]] legal scholar.  His major work was a reform of the [[Bavaria]]n penal code which became a model for several other countries.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Hainichen, Thuringia|Hainichen]], near [[Jena]]. He received his early education at [[Frankfurt on Main]], where his family had moved soon after his birth. At the age of sixteen, however, he ran away from home, and, going to Jena, was helped by relations there to study at the university. In spite of poor health and the most desperate poverty, he made rapid progress. He attended the lectures of [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] and [[Gottlieb Hufeland]], and soon published some literary essays of more than ordinary merit.

In 1795 he took the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctor of philosophy]], and in the same year, though possessing little money, he married. It was this step which led him to success and fame, by forcing him to turn from his favourite studies of [[philosophy]] and history to that of [[Jurisprudence|law]], which was repugnant to him, but which offered a prospect of more rapid advancement.

At 23 he came into prominence by a vigorous criticism of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' theory on civil power. Soon afterwards, in lectures on criminal jurisprudence he set forth his famous theory, that in administering justice judges should be strictly limited in their decisions by the [[Criminal code|penal code]]. This new doctrine gave rise to a party called [[Rigorist]]s, who supported his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nuttall|inline=1|title=Feuerbach, Paul Johann Anselm von}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Von Feuerbach was the originator of the famous maxim ''[[nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]'': "There is no crime and hence there shall not be punishment if at the time no penal law existed".

In 1801 Feuerbach was appointed [[extraordinary professor]] of law without salary, at the [[University of Jena]], and in the following year accepted a chair at [[Kiel]], where he remained two years.

His chief work was the framing of a penal code for [[Bavaria]]. In 1804, he had moved from the [[University of Kiel]] to the [[University of Landshut]], but, on being commanded by King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian Joseph]] to draft a penal code for Bavaria (''Strafgesetzbuch für das Königreich Bayern''), in 1805 he moved to Munich where he was given a high appointment in the Ministry of Justice and was ennobled in 1808. The practical reform of penal legislation in Bavaria was begun under his influence in 1806 by the abolition of [[torture]].

Out of his practical experience in the Ministry of Justice with evaluating death penalties by Bavarian courts for royal pardon he published the most notable cases 1808/11 in ''Merkwürdige Criminalfälle'' and 1828/29 a much enlarged collection ''Aktenmäßige Darstellung merkwürdiger Verbrechen'' (Notable crimes presented according to the court records). With this legal handbook of criminal cases in the tradition of the famous "Causes Célèbres" of the French lawyer Gayot de Pitaval (1673–1743) Feuerbach intend to establish a modern criminal psychology ("Seelenkunde") for crime investigation, criminal judges,&amp;nbsp;etc.

In the course of time, his work has been misinterpreted merely as a literary collection of fictional sensational crimes and many of his court cases have been edited and published as trivial popular crime stories. However, Gerold Schmidt has newly researched that Feuerbach has recorded true historical events at true localities and persons with their real names etc. and that, therefore, his work is a rich historical source for Bavarian local and social history, mentality, biography etc.

In his ''Betrachtungen über das Geschworenengericht'' of 1811, Feuerbach declared against trial by jury, maintaining that the verdict of a jury was not adequate legal proof of a crime. Much controversy was aroused on the subject, and the author's view was subsequently to some extent modified.

The result of his labours on the Bavarian penal code was promulgated in 1813. The influence of this code, the embodiment of Feuerbach's enlightened views, was immense. It was at once made the basis for new codes in [[Württemberg]] and [[Saxe-Weimar]]; it was adopted in its entirety in the grand-duchy of [[Oldenburg]]; and it was translated into Swedish by order of the king. Several of the Swiss cantons reformed their codes in conformity with it.

Feuerbach had also undertaken to prepare a civil code for Bavaria, to be founded on the [[Code Napoléon]]. This was afterwards set aside, and the Codex Maximilianus adopted as a basis. But the project did not become law.

During the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war of liberation]] (1813–1814), Feuerbach showed himself an ardent patriot, and published several political brochures. In 1814 Feuerbach was appointed second president of the [[Court of Appeal|court of appeal]] at [[Bamberg]], and three years later he became first president of the court of appeal at [[Ansbach]]. In 1821 he was deputed by the government to visit France, Belgium, and the Rhine provinces for the purpose of investigating their juridical institutions. As the fruit of this visit, he published his treatises ''Betrachtungen über Öffentlichkeit und Mündigkeit der Gerechtigkeitspflege'' (1821) and ''Über die Gerichtsverfassung und das gerichtliche Verfahren Frankreichs'' (1825). In these he pleaded unconditionally for publicity in all legal proceedings.

In his later years, he took a deep interest in the fate of the strange foundling [[Kaspar Hauser]] who had excited so much attention in Europe. He was the first to publish a critical summary of the ascertained facts, under the title of ''Kaspar Hauser, ein Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben'' (1832).

Feuerbach died in [[Frankfurt]].

==Family==
Feuerbach had five sons, and three daughters: [[Joseph Anselm Feuerbach]] (1798-1851), [[Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach]] (1800-1834), Eduard August Feuerbach (1803-1843), [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]] (1804-1872), Heinrich Friedrich Feuerbach (1806-1880), Rebecca Magdalena (1808-1891), Leonore Feuerbach (1809-1885), and Elise Feuerbach (1813-1883).

The '''Policy and Resources Committee''' is the Senior Committee of the system of government in [[Guernsey]], it was created on 1 May 2016 to replace the [[Policy Council of Guernsey]].

Guernsey operates a system of government by committees and consensus.  There are no [[political parties]]. The members of the parliament, which is known as the [[States of Guernsey|States of Deliberation]], are elected as independents. The States of Deliberation is both parliament and executive, but it delegates most of its executive functions to policy-specific committees, which are known as the six principal committees, each of which is run by five political members, all of whom have equal voting power.

==Objectives==
To provide advice for the [[States of Guernsey]], to develop policies and programmes and to implement such policies when approved relating to:&lt;ref name=P&amp;R/&gt;
* Leadership and co-ordination of the work of the States
* Fiscal policy, economic affairs and the financial and other resources of the States
* External relations and international and constitutional affairs
* Other matters which have been delegated to the Committee

==Committee==

The Committee is elected by States Deputies for a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandfm.com/policy-resources-elections-today/ |title=Policy and Resources Elections today |publisher=Island FM |date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Committee comprises a president and four members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-36225833  |title= Guernsey Policy and Resources Committee chosen  |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President is the ''de facto'' head of government of Guernsey and may be given the title, ''Chief Minister''. The Vice President may also use the title ''Deputy Chief Minister''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandfm.com/53486-2/ |title=P&amp;R to use old titles |publisher=Island FM |date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One person in the Committee is nominated as ''Lead Person for External Affairs'',&lt;ref name=P&amp;R/&gt; the title ''Minister for External Affairs'' is sometimes used.

===Election===
The 40 States Deputies hold an election to determine the ''President'', with successive rounds of voting continuing until an outright winner is elected. All candidates having to be proposed and seconded.

Shortly afterwards, the newly elected President may name his preferred committee members, however it is the votes of the States Deputies that elect the remaining four committee members. All candidates having to be proposed and seconded.

===Avoidance of conflict of interest===
No person on the Committee may be a president or member of the six principal committees, or of the Scrutiny Management Committee, the Development &amp; Planning Authority, or the Transport Licensing Authority.&lt;ref name= "P&amp;R"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.gg/article/152833/Policy--Resources  |title= Policy &amp; Resources  |publisher=States of Guernsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the use of Incendiary Weapons''' is a [[United Nations]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] that restricts the use of [[incendiary weapon]]s. It is Protocol III to the 1980 [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]]. Concluded in 1981, it entered into force on 2 December 1983. {{as of|April 2018}}, it has been adopted by 115 state parties.&lt;ref name=status /&gt;

==Content==
The protocol prohibits, in all circumstances, making the civilian population as such, individual civilians or civilian objects, the object of attack by any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of [[flame]], [[heat]] or a combination thereof, produced by a [[chemical reaction]] of a substance delivered on the target. The protocol also prohibits the use of air-delivered [[incendiary weapons]] against military targets within a concentration of civilians, and limits the use of incendiary weapons delivered by other means. Forest and other plants may not be a target unless they are used to conceal combatants or other military objectives.&lt;ref name="ICRC1980Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/1980-convention-certain-conventional-weapons#.VKkpP2SG-rY | title=1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – Factsheet | publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross | date=March 2014 | accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICRC P3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule84 | title=Rule 84.

Protocol III lists certain munition types like [[smoke shell]]s which only have a secondary or additional incendiary effect; these munition types are not considered to be incendiary weapons.&lt;ref name=text&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol III to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects: Text of the Protocol |publisher=UNODA |url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/ccwc_p3/text |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland v. Liam Adams''''' was a criminal case relating to allegations of child abuse made in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0213/nipolitics.html|title=... in favour of Gerry Adams resigning as Sinn Féin president ..." - survey |work=[[RTÉ]]|date=13 February 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Liam Adams, brother of Irish politician [[Gerry Adams]]. Liam Adams was found guilty in October 2013 of 10 offences, and was sentenced in November 2013 to 16 years in prison.

==UTV ''Insight'' Special==
In December 2009, a [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] ''Insight'' Special programme alleged that Liam Adams had sexually abused his daughter, Áine Tyrell, for a decade. In response, his brother Gerry Adams urged Liam to turn himself in to the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1218/adamsg.html|title=Adams' brother sought over alleged abuse|work=[[RTÉ News]]|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/dec/18/gerry-adams-brother-child-sex-charges|title=Gerry Adams urges brother to face child sex charges|work= [[The Guardian]]|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=4 March 2010|location=London |first=Henry|last= McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry also alleged that his deceased father, [[Gerry Adams, Sr.]], had subjected family members to [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8423357.stm|title=Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams reveals family abuse history |work=[[BBC News]]|date=20 December 2009|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1220/adams.html | title=Adams reveals family history of abuse | work=[[RTÉ News]] | date=21 December 2009 | accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] issued a [[European Arrest Warrant]] for Liam Adams’ arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0205/1224263814128.html|title=European arrest warrant sent for Liam Adams|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition request==
In December 2009, Liam Adams presented himself at a [[Garda Síochána]] police station in [[Sligo]]. They were not able to arrest him as they did not have the necessary European Arrest Warrant. Adams did not wish to hand himself into police in [[Northern Ireland]], citing unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1224/breaking2.html |title=Liam Adams 'will not return to NI' |work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=24 December 2009|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2010, the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] in Dublin endorsed the European Arrest Warrant, which was issued in Liam Adams' name by the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]].&lt;ref name="handedin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=133072|title=Adams To Appeal Extradition |work=4ni.co.uk|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Adams handed himself over to the authorities in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]].&lt;ref name="handedin"/&gt;

Adams opposed his [[extradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8549939.stm|title=Gerry Adams' brother Liam hands himself in to police |work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=4 March 2010|date=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a brief hearing on 21 July, Adams applied for [[legal aid]] to help fight the extradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-10718391|title=Liam Adams bids for legal aid to fund media transcripts|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 July 2010| accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2011, an [[Irish High Court]] judge in Dublin declined Liam Adams' objections to the extradition request and said he would issue an order for Adams to surrender to the authorities in [[Northern Ireland]]. On 18 October 2011, after losing his appeal against extradition, Adams was remanded in custody for 15 days to a Dublin prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1019/1224306074669.html|title=Liam Adams loses extradition appeal|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was handed over to officers from the PSNI at the border on the night of 2 November, and brought to Laganside Magistrates Court on the morning of 3 November, where he was [[remanded in custody]] for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1103/adams.html|title=Liam Adams refused bail in Belfast|work=[[RTÉ News]]|date=3 November 2011|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
There were two trials; the first collapsed in April 2013 for legal reasons.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-verdict/&gt;

===Verdict===
In October 2013 Liam Adams was found guilty of ten offences, including rape and gross indecency committed against his daughter between 1977 and 1983 when she was four to nine.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-verdict&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24348798|title=Liam Adams convicted of raping and abusing daughter|work=[[BBC News]]|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/01/liam-adams-guilty-raping-oldest-daughter|title=Liam Adams found guilty of raping his eldest daughter|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=McDonald|first=Henry|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxic"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/liam-adams-sordid-episode-has-left-sinn-fein-president-gerry-adams-politically-toxic-29626240.html | title=Liam Adams: Sordid episode has left Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams politically toxic | work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] | date=27 November 2013 | accessdate=27 November 2013 | author=Breen, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reform''' ({{lang-lat|reformo}}) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc.&lt;ref&gt;dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reform?s=t&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from [[Christopher Wyvill#The Yorkshire Association|Christopher Wyvill’s Association movement]] which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim.&lt;ref&gt;Reform in English Public Life: the fortunes of a word. Joanna Innes 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform is generally distinguished from [[revolution]]. The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system.  Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale. Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.

[[Rotation in office]] or [[term limits]] would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.&lt;ref&gt;On term limits reform see, [http://www.ustl.org/index.html U.S. Term Limits].  On more radical/revolutionary changes, including term limits, see, for example, Robert Struble, Jr., [http://www.tell-usa.org  ''Treatise on Twelve Lights: To Restore America the Beautiful under God and the Written Constitution''], 2007-08 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Developing countries]] may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from [[international financial institutions]] and [[aid agencies]]. This can include reforms to [[macroeconomic policy]], the [[civil service reform in developing countries|civil service]], and [[Public finance|public financial management]].

[[Reform (Religion)|Religious Reforms]] are performed in religions and churches.

==Re-form==
A note about [[spelling]]: when used to describe something which is ''physically'' formed again, such as re-[[casting]] it in a [[molding (process)|mold/mould]], or a [[band (music)|band]] that gets back together, the proper term is ''re-form'' (with a [[hyphen]]), not "reform".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5387">{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
A '''request for admissions''' (sometimes also called a '''request to admit''') are a set of statements sent from one litigant to an adversary, for the purpose of having the adversary [[Admission (law)|admit]] or deny the statements or allegations therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Conducting Discovery in a Civil Lawsuit|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/civil-litigation/conducting-discovery-civil-lawsuit|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=29 September 2017|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Requests for admissions are part of the [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] process in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil case]].  In the [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court system]], they are governed by Rule 36 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

==Basic structure==
A request for admissions is a list of questions which are similar in some respects to [[interrogatories]], but different in form and purpose.  Each "question" is in the form of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|declarative statement]] which the answering party must then either admit, deny, or state in detail why he or she can neither admit nor deny the truthfulness of the statement (e.g. for lack of knowledge, etc.).  This effectively puts the admissions in the form of [[multiple choice|true-false]] questions.  For example, in a case involving an [[automobile accident]], the [[plaintiff]] might include in his or her request a statement such as "[[Defendant]] Smith was driving a blue [[Dodge Caravan]] on the morning of the accident".  

Under Rule 36(a)(5) of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]],&lt;ref name="rule36"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 36. Requests for Admission|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_36|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the answering party may also [[Objection (law)|object]] to the request, and state the reason for his or her objection, so long as the objection is not solely because the request would present a genuine [[issue of fact]] for [[Trial (law)|trial]].

Rule 36(a)(1)&lt;ref name="rule36"/&gt; limits the types of requests to be limited to (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and (B) the genuineness of any described [[Documentary evidence|documents]].  However, the rule places no limits on the amount of requests which may be made of either litigant.  [[State court (United States)|State court]] rules, however, may be stricter than this.

Notably, under Rule 36(a)(3),&lt;ref name="rule36"/&gt; requests for admissions are automatically deemed admitted in U.S. federal courts if the opponent fails to timely respond or object.  The opponent bears the burden of moving for relief from its failure to respond and providing a legitimate excuse for why it did not respond earlier.

Some U.S. states have reversed the burden as set forth in the federal rules, such that the party propounding the RFAs must follow up with a motion to have RFAs deemed admitted.

==Purpose==
Requests for admissions help narrow the scope of the [[Controversy (law)|controversy]] by getting certain admissions or denials of issues [[Relevance (law)|relevant]] to the lawsuit on record before a trial takes place.  While [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] introduced at trial can be [[Rebuttal|rebutted]], admissions which are on record must be taken as true unless the [[judge]] permits them to be withdrawn or amended.  Thus, requests for admission can obviate presentation of some evidence and make the actual trial shorter and more efficient. Admissions are also useful at [[summary judgment]], as an admission will generally mean that there is no issue of material fact about the question the admission relates to. 

Also, [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] have placed twenty-five questions per party limitations on the use of [[interrogatories]], but there is no numerical limit in [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] on the request for admissions (unless specified differently in Local Rules of the state, which most states do have). In California, requests for admissions are generally limited to the numerical limit of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.030|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&amp;sectionNum=2033.030.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a party in California who wishes for additional requests for admissions may make a declaration for additional discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.050|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&amp;sectionNum=2033.050.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''road toll''' was a historical [[fee]] charged to the [[territorial lord]]s of travellers and [[merchant]]s in return for permission to use the [[road]]s and [[waterways]] of the country or state concerned. It was reinforced in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by the law of ''Straßenzwang'' which meant that traders in certain goods had to use specified roads. In return, they were usually guaranteed safe passage under the right of escort or ''[[Geleitrecht]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kühtreiber: [https://www.academia.edu/1496344/Strasse_und_Burg._Anmerkungen_zu_einem_vielschichtigen_Verhaltnis._In_Kornelia_Holzner-Tobisch_Thomas_Kuhtreiber_Gertrud_Blaschitz_Hg._Die_Vielschichtigkeit_der_Strasse._Kontinuitat_und_Wandel_in_Mittelalter_und_fruher_Neuzeit_Veroffentlichungen_des_Instituts_fur_Realienkunde_des_Mittelalters_und_der_fruhen_Neuzeit_22_Wien_2012_263-301 '' Straße und Burg. Anmerkungen zu einem vielschichtigen Verhältnis''], pp. 286ff. In: Kornelia Holzner-Tobisch, Thomas Kühtreiber, Gertrud Blaschitz (eds.), ''Die Vielschichtigkeit der Straße. Kontinuität und Wandel in Mittelalter und früher Neuzeit'', Veröffentlichungen des Instituts für Realienkunde des Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit 22, Vienna, 2012, 263-301&lt;/ref&gt; The road toll was widespread especially in [[medieval]] times, and, in addition to the payments from the [[staple rights]], was an important source of income.

== History ==
Road tolls usually had to be paid at strategic locations such as [[bridge]]s (sometimes called a bridge toll) or [[gate]]s. In [[Europe]], the road toll goes back to the practice of the [[Germanic tribes]], who charged fees to travellers if they wanted to cross over mountain passages. From that time, road tolls became commonplace in [[medieval]] times, especially in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Empire had a "passage system" whereby a number of toll stations would be established on a route where small tolls were collected. Examples were the [[Ochsenweg]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] which had toll stations at [[Kongeå|Königsau]] and [[Rendsburg]], [[Neumünster]], [[Bramstedt (Hagen in Bremen)|Bramstedt]] and [[Ulzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Klaus-Joachim Lorenzen-Schmidt, Ortwin Pelc (ed.): ''Das neue Schleswig-Holstein Lexikon.'' Wachholtz, Neumünster, 2006, Lemma Zoll.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Gabler Road]] with the [[Karlsfried]] Castle as its toll station. Another form of road tax was ''[[Liniengeld]]'', which had to be paid when entering the city of [[Vienna]] from the beginning of the 18th century.

A special form of road toll was the ''[[Pflasterzoll]]'', which had to be paid to fund the initial cobbling of a road and its subsequent upkeep.

== River toll ==
[[File:Pfalzgrafenstein001.JPG|thumb|[[Pfalzgrafenstein Castle]] in the [[Rhine]] near Kaub]]
Another form of toll on medieval travel, was the river toll that was raised for the use of a [[waterway]]. Outside the towns themselves, toll stations were established in some cases at special locations: [[Loevestein Castle]] in the [[Netherlands]] was built at a strategic point on the confluence of two rivers. Ships and boats had to pay a river toll here in order to proceed down the river.

The Kingdom of [[Denmark]] had [[Kronborg Castle]] built from the receipts of the [[Sound Toll]], a toll on ships for using [[Øresund|the Sound]] of Denmark.

In a document at the [[Cochem Castle|imperial castle of Cochem]] dated 17&amp;nbsp;March 1130, which Count Palatine [[William of Weimar-Orlamünde|William of Ballenstedt]] had made out, mention was made of the usual river toll charged on the [[Moselle]] at one of its toll stations. The building also had the status of a [[toll castle]]. By contrast, the castle of [[Pfalzgrafenstein Castle]] in the [[Rhine]] near [[Kaub]] was exclusively used to collect river tolls. Another well known toll site on the Rhine was the imperial palace of [[Kaiserpfalz Kaiserswerth|Kaiserswerth]] built in 1174.

=== In mythology ===
In [[Greek mythology]] the ferryman, [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], charged the dead a river toll of one [[Obol (coin)|obolus]] for transporting them over the [[Acheron]] (also called the Lethe or [[Styx]]) so that they were able to enter the Underworld or [[Hades]].

== Extortion ==
In the Middle Ages, road tolls were occasionally demanded from towns, monasteries, castles and villages by roaming armed bands; in return for which they would waive their use of force. This was especially true of the [[Normans]] and [[Viking]]s, but also of large bands of [[robber]]s. This type of payment was also referred to as ''[[Danegeld]]'' (payment to Danish warriors). In England, it is estimated that 30,000 pounds of silver were paid in the 9th century as Danegeld.

'''''S.L. v. Austria''''' was a case in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concerning the [[age of consent]]. Austrian law, under Article 209 of the [[Austrian Criminal Code]], provided for higher age of consent for male homosexual relations than for other (heterosexual or female homosexual) relations. The judgment of the court was delivered on 9 January 2003.
&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

S.L. was born in 1981 and reported himself to have been sure of his homosexuality at the age of 15. He lived in a rural area where homosexuality is still taboo, and suffered from the fact that he could not live his homosexuality openly and – until he reached the age of 18 – could not enter into any fulfilling sexual relationship with an adult partner without having a fear of exposing that person to criminal prosecution.

Article 209 of the Criminal Code (in the version in force at the material time): "A male person who after attaining the age of nineteen fornicates with a person of the same sex who has attained the age of fourteen years but not the age of eighteen years shall be sentenced to imprisonment for between six months and five years."

On 10 July 2002 – following the judgment of the Constitutional Court – the Parliament decided to repeal Article 209 and introduced a new Article 207b, which penalizes sexual acts with a person under sixteen years of age if that person is for certain reasons not mature enough to understand the meaning of the act and the offender takes advantage of this immaturity or if the person under sixteen years of age is in a predicament and the offender takes advantage of that situation. This article applies to every sexual acts irrespective whether the sexual acts at issue are heterosexual, homosexual, or lesbian.

The Court ruled unanimously that the inequality of age of consent constituted a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and also unanimously ruled that there was no need to examine the complaints lodged under Article 8 alone.

It was not disputed before the Court that the case falls within the ambit of Article 8. The development following the judgment of the Constitutional Court did not affect the applicant’s status as a victim. As regards the violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, the Court found no decisive difference between the present case and ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]''.

The Court examined whether there was an objective and reasonable justification why young men in the fourteen-to-eighteen-age bracket needed protection against any sexual relationship with adult men, while young women in the same age bracket did not need such protection against relations with either adult men or women. It came to the conclusion that to the extent that Article 209 of the Criminal Code embodied predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against the homosexual minority, these negative attitudes could not themselves provide sufficient justification for the differential treatment anymore.

'''''Sierra Club v. Morton''''', 405 U.S. 727 (1972), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case on the issue of [[standing (law)|standing]] under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]].  The Court rejected a lawsuit by the [[Sierra Club]] seeking to block the development of a ski resort at [[Mineral King]] valley in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]] because the club had not alleged any injury.

The case prompted a famous dissent by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] arguing that trees should be granted legal [[personhood]].

==Background==
Mineral King is a seven mile by one mile subalpine glacial valley in [[Sequoia National Forest]] then abutting [[Sequoia National Park]] in [[Tulare County, California]] and only accessible by a dirt county road.  In 1965 the [[United States Forest Service]] began circulating a prospectus calling for bids for recreational developments at Mineral King.&lt;ref name=ELQ72&gt;[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=elq Arthur B. Ferguson Jr. and William P. Bryson, ''Mineral King: A Case Study in Forest Service Decision Making,]'' 2 Ecology L.Q. 493 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 the Forest Service accepted a bid by [[The Walt Disney Company]] proposing a $35 million ski resort accommodating 1.7 million annual visitors and at any one time 20,000 skiers.&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;  By comparison, [[Disneyland]] had cost $17 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masters|first1=Nathan|title=In the '60s, Disney Almost Built a Ski Resort in Sequoia National Park|url=http://southland.gizmodo.com/a-mountain-disneyland-how-disney-almost-built-a-ski-re-1525286740|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=Gizmondo Southland|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resort would require construction of a new twenty mile highway and 66,000 volt power line through Sequoia National Park, then a nine story parking structure and a [[rack railway|cog-assisted railroad]] to ultimately take visitors into the valley.&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. 727, 92 S. Ct. 1361, 31 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] began personally buying private property around Mineral King through [[Retlaw Enterprises]] and, after contributing heavily in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1966]], received a personal promise from [[Ronald Reagan]] that the state would fund the highway.&lt;ref name=Vicknair&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vicknair|first1=Alexandra K.|title=Mindsets, Motivations, Mickey Mouse, and the Mountains: The Social, Political, and Intellectual Foundations of the Mineral King Controversy, 1965–1978|date=June 2013|publisher=A Thesis Presented to the Faculty of California State University, Stanislaus|url=http://stanislaus-scholarworks.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/142984/VicknairA.spring2013thesis.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical economists doubted the project would yield a positive net present value.&lt;ref&gt;Cicchetti, Charles J., Anthony C. Fisher, and V. Kerry Smith. 1976. “An Econometric Evaluation of a Generalized Consumer Surplus Measure: The Mineral King Controversy”. Econometrica 44 (6). [Wiley, Econometric Society]: 1259–76. doi:10.2307/1914259.&lt;/ref&gt;  Disney’s master plan attracted national media attention from [[Harper's Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 744 (Douglas, J., dissenting) citing [http://harpers.org/archive/1972/03/mickey-mouse-in-the-mountains/ Peter Browning, ''Mickey Mouse in the Mountains''], Harper's, March 1972, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as consistent, critical coverage by [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 743 (Douglas, J., dissenting) citing [[Arnold Hano]], ''Protectionists vs. recreationists —The Battle of Mineral King'', N. Y. Times Mag., Aug. 17, 1969, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vicknair/&gt;

Michael McCloskey had just ousted [[David Brower]] as executive director of the Sierra Club and, emboldened by the Second Circuit’s decision in ''[[Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission]]'', he sought a more direct, and litigious, approach to [[environmentalism]] by setting up the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, later renamed [[Earthjustice]].&lt;ref name=Vicknair/&gt;  The Sierra Club then sued the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|San Francisco federal court]] to block development of Disney’s famous ski resort.&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;  Asserting itself as [[private attorney general]], the Sierra Club argued that Disney’s resort would cause “irreparable harm to the [[public interest]]”.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club v. Hickel"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1752108983372651064&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Sierra Club v. Hickel''], 433 F.2d 24 (9th Cir. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sierra Club did not allege it suffered a unique, private injury from Disney’s ski resort because it believed the court would then weigh the balance of hardships in Disney’s favor.  After two days of hearings, on July 23, 1969, District Judge [[William Thomas Sweigert]] issued a [[preliminary injunction]] blocking Disney’s ski resort.&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 495 U.S. at 740 n.15 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;  On September 16, 1970, Judge [[Ozell Miller Trask]], joined by Judge [[John Kilkenny]], [[vacated judgment]] and [[remanded]], finding that the Club did not have standing to sue because it had made no allegation that it would be affected by Disney’s ski resort.  Discussing the merits, Judge Trask felt it was within the Secretary’s discretion “to make available a vast area of incomparable beauty to more people rather than to have it remain inaccessible except to a rugged few.”&lt;ref name="Sierra Club v. Hickel"/&gt;  Judge [[Frederick George Hamley]] concurred, noting that although he thought the Sierra Club had standing to sue, he agreed on the merits that Judge Sweigert’s injunction had been an abuse of discretion.&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;

The Sierra Club’s petition for [[certiorari]] was granted and the case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on November 17, 1971, with U.S. Solicitor General [[Erwin Griswold]] personally appearing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-34&lt;/ref&gt;  Tulare County filed amici briefs in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court supporting the Secretary. [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] and Associate Attorney General [[William Rehnquist]], whom both joined the Court on January 7, 1972, did not participate in the case.

==Opinion of the Court==
On April 19, 1972 the Supreme Court affirmed 4-3.&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;  Writing for the Court, Justice [[Potter Stewart]], joined by Justices [[Byron White]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]], agreed with the Ninth Circuit that the Sierra Club had not alleged any legal interest in the case.&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;  Because the Constitution's [[Case or Controversy Clause]] prohibits [[advisory opinion]]s, the Court reasons that the legal wrongs protected by the Administrative Procedure Act must at minimum meet the prevailing constitutional requirements of standing.&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 732 n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sierra Club’s legal interest in the case, according to the Court, seemed to be relying on a “zone of interests” test that Justice Douglas had announced in two cases decided on March 3, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 733.&lt;/ref&gt;  Declining to clarify the meaning of “zone of interests”, the Court reasoned that broadening the categories of injury is different “from abandoning the requirement” that plaintiffs themselves actually be injured.&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 738.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sierra Club had no standing to sue because it did not allege it was itself in any way injured by Disney’s ski resort.&lt;ref name=ELQ72/&gt;

In a footnote, the Court helpfully notes that the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]]’s amici brief included assertions that the Sierra Club makes regular camping trips to Mineral King and that Rule 15 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], “of course”, allows the Sierra Club to amend its [[complaint]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 735 n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Stewart closes by noting that although [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] had observed “Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved sooner or later, into a judicial question”, that Tocqueville further commented that “by intimately uniting the trial of the law with the trial of an individual, legislation is protected from wanton assaults and from the daily aggressions of party spirit.”&lt;ref&gt;''Sierra Club v. Morton'', 405 U.S. at 740 n. 16 citing Alexis de Tocqueville, 1 ''[[Democracy in America]]'' 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justice Douglas' dissent ==
''Sierra Club v. Morton'' is, perhaps, best known for the dissenting opinion by [[William O. Douglas]] who asserted that natural resources ought to have standing to sue for their own protection.  An excerpt from his dissent:
[[File:Williamodouglas.jpg|thumb|left|Justice "Wild Bill" Douglas]]
{{Quote|The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton.

Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes. The [[corporation sole]] − a creature of [[ecclesiastical law]] – is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases. The ordinary corporation is a "person" for purposes of the adjudicatory processes, whether it represents proprietary, spiritual, aesthetic, or charitable causes.

So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes - fish, aquatic insects, [[water ouzel]]s, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it. Those people who have a meaningful relation to that body of water – whether it be a fisherman, a canoeist, a zoologist, or a logger – must be able to speak for the values which the river represents and which are threatened with destruction.....

The voice of the inanimate object, therefore, should not be stilled. That does not mean that the judiciary takes over the managerial functions from the federal agency. It merely means that before these priceless bits of Americana (such as a valley, an alpine meadow, a river, or a lake) are forever lost or are so transformed as to be reduced to the eventual rubble of our urban environment, the voice of the existing beneficiaries of these environmental wonders should be heard.

Perhaps they will not win. Perhaps the bulldozers of "progress" will plow under all the aesthetic wonders of this beautiful land. That is not the present question. The sole question is, who has standing to be heard?

Those who hike the [[Appalachian Trail]] into [[Sunfish Pond]], [[New Jersey]], and camp or sleep there, or run the [[Allagash River|Allagash]] in [[Maine]], or climb the [[Guadalupe Mountains|Guadalupes]] in [[West Texas]], or who canoe and portage the [[Superior National Forest|Quetico Superior]] in [[Minnesota]], certainly should have standing to defend those natural wonders before courts or agencies, though they live 3,000 miles away. Those who merely are caught up in environmental news or propaganda and flock to defend these waters or areas may be treated differently. That is why these environmental issues should be tendered by the inanimate object itself. Then there will be assurances that all of the forms of life which it represents will stand before the court - the [[pileated woodpecker]] as well as the coyote and bear, the lemmings as well as the trout in the streams. Those inarticulate members of the ecological group cannot speak. But those people who have so frequented the place as to know its values and wonders will be able to speak for the entire ecological community.....

That, as I see it, is the issue of "standing" in the present case and controversy.}}

Justice Douglas’ dissent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sierra Club v. Morton |vol=405 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=727 |pinpoint=745-747 |court=S. Ct. |date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; included his concern that regulatory agencies become too favorable with their regulated industries ([[Regulatory_capture#Development|regulatory capture]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet the pressures on agencies for favorable action one way or the other are enormous. The suggestion that Congress can stop action which is undesirable is true in theory; yet even Congress is too remote to give meaningful direction and its machinery is too ponderous to use very often. The federal agencies of which I speak are not venal or corrupt. But they are notoriously under the control of powerful interests who manipulate them through advisory committees, or friendly working relations, or who have that natural affinity with the agency which in time develops between the regulator and the regulated. As early as 1894, Attorney General Olney predicted that regulatory agencies might become "industry-minded", as illustrated by his forecast concerning the Interstate Commerce Commission:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Commission . . . is, or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. Further, the older such a commission gets to be, the more inclined it will be found to take the business and railroad view of things." M. Josephson, The Politicos 526 (1938).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Years later a court of appeals observed, "the recurring question which has plagued public regulation of industry [is] whether the regulatory agency is unduly oriented toward the interests of the industry it is designed to regulate, rather than the public interest it is designed to protect." Moss v. CAB, 139 U. S. App. D. C. 150, 152, 430 F. 2d 891, 893.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
[[File:Mineral King Valley (9103965415).jpg|400px|thumb|Mineral King in 2004]]
On June 23, 1972 the Sierra Club amended its complaint to allege that club outings in the valley would be harmed by a massive ski resort, added several [[natural person]]s as plaintiffs, and added a new claim for relief under the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].&lt;ref name=ELQ76&gt;[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&amp;context=elq Thomas Lundmark, Anne Mester, R. A. Cordes, and Barry S. Sandals,] ''Mineral King Goes Downhill'', 5 Ecology L.Q. 555(1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 12, Judge Sweigert then allowed the case to proceed to [[discovery (law)|discovery]].&lt;ref name=ELQ76/&gt;  In August 1972 Governor Reagan withdrew his support of the project, now arguing the new highway would be too expensive.&lt;ref name=Vicknair/&gt;

The Forest Service received 2,150 comments in response to its June 1974 preliminary draft [[Environmental Impact Statement]].&lt;ref name=ELQ76/&gt;  On February 26, 1976, the Forest Service released its final EIS for a resort accommodating 8,000 skiers.&lt;ref name=ELQ76/&gt;  The Sierra Club stopped pursuing its lawsuit and in 1977 Judge Sweigert threw out the case for lack of prosecution.&lt;ref name=Vicknair/&gt;

Although the Sierra Club lost the case, as a practical matter they won the war.  To assert standing in a natural resource manner, environmental groups simply need to find among their membership a single person with a particularized interest (e.g., one who hikes, hunts, fishes, or camps in or near the affected area).  Mineral King was ultimately never developed and was absorbed into Sequoia National Park.

During the [[95th United States Congress]], Congressman [[John Hans Krebs]] attached a measure adding Mineral King to Sequoia National Park to a large omnibus “Park Barrel Bill”, which President [[Jimmy Carter]] then signed into law in 1978.&lt;ref name=Vicknair/&gt;  Thirty years later during the [[111th United States Congress]], Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] developed a bill designating Mineral King as the John Krebs Wilderness, which President [[Barack Obama]] then signed into law in the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Krebs Wilderness Dedication|url=https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/news/john-krebs-wilderness-dedication.htm|publisher=Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Political Constitution of the Spanish Monarchy''' ({{lang-es|Constitución Política de la Monarquía Española}}), also known as the '''Constitution of [[Cádiz]]''' ({{lang-es|Constitución de Cádiz}}) and as '''''La Pepa''''',&lt;ref&gt;Because it was passed by the Cortes on the day of [[Saint Joseph]] (in Spanish, ''Pepe'' is an informal nickname for "José").&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[List of Constitutions of Spain|first Constitution of Spain]] and one of the earliest constitutions in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/historia/grandes-reportajes/viva-la-pepa-1812-las-cortes-de-cadiz-y-la-primera-constitucion-espanola_10223|publisher=[[National Geographic|National Geographic España]]|date=17 March 2016|language=Spanish|title=¡Viva la Pepa! 1812, las Cortes de Cádiz y la primera Constitución Española}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on 19 March 1812 by the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], the first Spanish [[legislature]]. With the notable exception of proclaiming [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] as the official and sole legal religion in Spain, the constitution was one of the most [[classical liberalism|liberal]] of its time: it affirmed [[national sovereignty]], [[separation of powers]], [[freedom of the press]], [[free enterprise]], abolished [[feudalism]], and established a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]]. It was one of the first constitutions that allowed [[universal male suffrage]], through a complex [[Indirect election|indirect electoral system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Hist_Normas/ConstEsp1812_1978/Const1812|title=Constitución de 1812|publisher=Congress of Deputies|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was repealed by [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] in 1814 in [[Valencia]], who re-established [[absolute monarchy]].

However, the Constitution had many difficulties becoming fully effective: much of Spain was ruled by the French, while the rest of the country was in the hands of interim [[Junta (Peninsular War)|''Junta'']] governments focused on resistance to the Bonapartes rather than on the immediate establishment of a constitutional regime. Many of the [[Spanish Empire|overseas territories]] did not recognize the legitimacy of these interim metropolitan governments, leading to a power vacuum and the establishment of [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|separate juntas on the American continent]]. On 24 March 1814, six weeks after returning to Spain, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] abolished the constitution and had all monuments to it torn down. Only the Constitution Obelisk in [[Saint Augustine, Florida]] survived. The constitution was reinstated during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'' (1820–1823), and again briefly 1836{{mdash}}1837 while the [[Progressive Party (Spain)|Progressives]] prepared the [[Spanish Constitution of 1837|Constitution of 1837]].

==Background==
[[File:Constitucion Cadiz 1812.png|thumb|upright|An original edition of the Constitution of 1812.]]
The Cortes drafted and adopted the Constitution while [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged]] by French troops, first on [[Isla de León]] (now [[San Fernando, Cádiz|San Fernando]]), then an island separated from the mainland by a shallow waterway on the Atlantic side of the [[Bay of Cádiz]], and within the small, strategically located city of Cádiz itself.

From a Spanish point of view, the Peninsular War was a war of independence against the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and the king installed by Napoleon, his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. In 1808, both King Ferdinand VII and his predecessor and father, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], had resigned their claims to the throne in favor of Napoleon Bonaparte, who in turn passed the crown to his brother Joseph. While many in elite circles in Madrid were willing to accept Joseph's rule, the Spanish people were not. The war began on the night of 2 May 1808, and was immortalized by [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'', also known as ''The Charge of the Mamelukes''.

From the outbreak of the Spanish revolt against the [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Bonapartist]] regime in 1808, Napoleon's forces faced both Spanish armies and partisans, joined later by British and Portuguese armies under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]. The Spanish  organized an interim Spanish government, the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central Junta]] and called for a Cortes to convene with representatives from all the Spanish provinces throughout the worldwide empire, in order to establish a government with a firm claim to legitimacy. The Junta first met on 25 September 1808 in [[Aranjuez]] and later in [[Seville]], before retreating to Cádiz.

The Supreme Central Junta, originally under the leadership of the elderly [[José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca|Count of Floridablanca]], initially tried to consolidate southern and eastern Spain to maintain continuity for a restoration of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. However, almost from the outset they were in physical retreat from Napoleon's forces, and the comparative liberalism offered by the Napoleonic regime made Floridablanca's [[enlightened absolutism]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Esdaile, ''Spain in the Liberal Age'', Blackwell, 2000. {{ISBN|0-631-14988-0}}. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; an unlikely basis to rally the country. In any event, Floridablanca's strength failed him and he died on 30 December 1808.

When the Cortes convened in Cádiz in 1810, there appeared to be two possibilities for Spain's political future if the French could be driven out. The first, represented especially by [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], was the restoration of the absolutist ''[[Ancien Régime|Antiguo Régimen]]'' ("Old Regime"); the second was to adopt some sort of written constitution.

==Deliberations and reforms==
[[File:El juramento de las Cortes de Cádiz en 1810.jpg|thumb|left|''Cortes of Cadiz Oath in 1810''. Oil painting by [[José Casado del Alisal]], 1863.]]
Retreating before the advancing French and an outbreak of [[yellow fever]], the Supreme Central Junta moved to Isla de León, where it could be supplied and defended with the help of  the Spanish and British navies, and abolished itself, leaving a regency to rule until the Cortes could convene.

The origins of the Cortes did not harbor any revolutionary intentions, since the Junta saw itself simply as a continuation of the legitimate government of Spain. The opening session of the new Cortes was held on 24 September 1810 in the building now known as the [[Real Teatro de las Cortes]]. The opening ceremonies included a civic procession, a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]], and a call by the president of the Regency, Pedro Quevedo y Quintana, the bishop of [[Ourense]], for those present to fulfill their task loyally and efficiently. Still, the very act of resistance to the French involved a certain degree of deviation from the doctrine of royal sovereignty: if sovereignty resided entirely in the monarch, then Charles and Ferdinand's abdications in favor of Napoleon would have made Joseph Bonaparte the legitimate ruler of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Esdaile, ''Spain in the Liberal Age'', Blackwell, 2000. {{ISBN|0-631-14988-0}}. p. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alegoria constitucion 1812-1-.jpg|thumb|right|''Allegory of the Constitution of 1812'', [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Nationalmuseum|Swedish National Museum]].]]
The representatives who gathered at Cádiz were far more liberal than the elite of Spain taken as a whole, and they produced a document far more liberal than might have been produced in Spain were it not for the war. Few of the most conservative voices were at Cádiz, and there was no effective communication with King Ferdinand, who was a virtual prisoner in France. In the Cortes of 1810–1812, liberal deputies, who had the implicit support of the British who were protecting the city, were in the majority and representatives of the Church and nobility constituted a minority. Liberals wanted equality before the law, a centralized government, an efficient modern civil service, a reform of the tax system, the replacement of [[feudal]] privileges by [[freedom of contract]], and the recognition of the property owner's right to use his property as he saw fit. Three basic principles were soon ratified by the Cortes: that [[national sovereignty|sovereignty resides in the nation]], the legitimacy of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as king of Spain, and the [[parliamentary immunity|inviolability]] of the deputies. With this, the first steps towards a political revolution were taken, since prior to the Napoleonic intervention, Spain had been ruled as an absolute monarchy by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]s and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] predecessors. Although the Cortes was not unanimous in its liberalism, the new Constitution reduced the power of the crown, the [[Catholic Church]] (although Catholicism remained the [[state religion]]), and the [[nobility]].

[[File:Cortes de cadiz.jpg|thumb|left|348px|''The promulgation of the Constitution of 1812'', oil painting by [[Salvador Viniegra]] ([[Museo de las Cortes de Cádiz]]).]]
The Cortes of Cádiz worked feverishly and the first written Spanish constitution was promulgated in Cádiz on 19 March 1812. The Constitution of 1812 is regarded as the founding document of liberalism in Spain and one of the first examples of [[classical liberalism]] or [[conservative liberalism]] worldwide. It came to be called the "sacred code" of the branch of liberalism that rejected the [[French Revolution]], and during the early nineteenth century it served as a model for liberal constitutions of several Mediterranean and Latin American nations. It served as the model for the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian Constitution]] of 1814, the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Portuguese Constitution of 1822]] and the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican one of 1824]], and was implemented with minor modifications in various Italian states by the [[Carbonari]] during their revolt of 1820 and 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Payne |first= Stanley G. |authorlink=Stanley G. Payne |title=A History of Spain and Portugal: Eighteenth Century to Franco |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/spainport2.htm |volume= 2 |year= 1973|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press |location= Madison |isbn= 978-0-299-06270-5 |pages= 432–433 |quote= The Spanish pattern of conspiracy and revolt by liberal army officers ... was emulated in both Portugal and Italy. In the wake of Riego's successful rebellion, the first and only pronunciamiento in Italian history was carried out by liberal officers in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. The Spanish-style military conspiracy also helped to inspire the beginning of the Russian revolutionary movement with the revolt of the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist army officers]] in 1825. Italian liberalism in 1820–1821 relied on junior officers and the provincial middle classes, essentially the same social base as in Spain. It even used a Hispanized political vocabulary, for it was led by ''giunte'' (juntas), appointed local ''capi politici'' (''jefes políticos''), used the terms of ''liberali'' and ''servili'' (emulating the Spanish word serviles applied to supporters of absolutism), and in the end talked of resisting by means of a ''guerrilla''. For both Portuguese and Italian liberals of these years, the Spanish constitution of 1812 remained the standard document of reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the principal aim of the new constitution was the prevention of arbitrary and corrupt royal rule, it provided for a limited monarchy which governed through ministers subject to parliamentary control. [[Suffrage]], which was not determined by property qualifications, favored the position of the [[Bourgeoisie|commercial class]] in the new parliament, since there was no special provision for the Church or the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/c1812/12159396448091522976624/index.htm Articles 18–26 of the Constitution.] Spain, ''The Political Constitution of the Spanish Monarchy''. Alicante: [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/ Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution set up a rational and efficient centralized administrative system for the whole monarchy based on newly reformed and uniform provincial governments and municipalities, rather than maintaining some form of the varied, historical local governmental structures. Repeal of traditional property restrictions gave liberals the freer economy they wanted.

[[File:Barrio Hoz.JPG|thumb|right|Anguita, where the act was signed to establish the first ''diputación provincial'' under the 1812 Constitution.]]
The first provincial government created under the Constitution was in the province of Guadalajara con Molina. Its deputation first met in the village of [[Anguita]] in April 1813, since the capital [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]] was the site of ongoing fighting.

[[File:St Aug Plaza DLC const mem03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Constitution Obelisk|Constitution of 1812 monument]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. This [[obelisk]] was erected when the city was the capital of the [[Spanish Florida]].]]Among the most debated questions during the drafting of the constitution was the status of the [[Indigenous peoples|native]] and [[Casta|mixed-race]] populations in Spain's possessions around the world. Most of the overseas provinces were represented, especially the most populous regions. Both the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] had [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]] present, as did [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Central America]], the islands of the [[Spanish Caribbean]], [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], [[Captaincy General of Chile|Chile]], [[Upper Peru]] and the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''The Independence of Spanish America'', 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of representatives was 303, of which thirty-seven were born in overseas territories, although several of these were temporary, substitute deputies [''suplentes''] elected by American refugees in the city of Cadiz: seven from New Spain, two from Central America, five from Peru, two from Chile, three from the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]], three from [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and two from [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]], one from [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], two from [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], one from [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] and two from the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=La cuestión nacional americana en las Cortes de Cádiz | publisher=Fundación Instituto de Historia Social UNED | author=Chust, Manuel | year=1999 | location=Valencia | pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the overseas representatives were [[Criollo people|Criollos]], the majority wanted to extend suffrage to all indigenous, mixed-race and free black people of the Spanish Empire, which would have granted the overseas territories a majority in the future Cortes. The majority of representatives from [[peninsular Spain]] opposed those proposals as they wished to limit the weight of non-''peninsulares''. According to the best estimates of the time, continental Spain had an estimated population of between 10 and 11 million, while the overseas provinces had a combined population of around 15 to 16&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=La cuestión nacional americana en las Cortes de Cádiz | publisher=Fundación Instituto de Historia Social UNED | author=Chust, Manuel | year=1999 | location=Valencia | page=55}} Rodríguez, 82–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cortes ultimately approved a distinction between nationality and citizenship (that is, those with the right to vote).

The Constitution gave Spanish citizenship to natives of the territories that had belonged to the Spanish monarchy in both hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of 1812 included [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to Spanish citizenship, but the acquisition of citizenship for any [[casta]] of [[Afro-American peoples of the Americas]] was through [[naturalization]] excluding [[slaves]]. Spanish nationals were defined as all people born, naturalized or permanently residing for more than ten years in Spanish territories.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 1, 5 and 10 established the Empire as the territory of Spain and Spaniards as all "freemen born and bred in the Spanish dominions," "foreigners who may have obtained letters of naturalization from the Cortes" or "those [people] who, without [these letters] have resided ten years in any village of Spain, and acquired thereby a right of vicinity" and "slaves who receive their freedom in the Spanish dominions."&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the Constitution read: "The Spanish nation is the collectivity of the Spaniards of both hemispheres."&lt;ref&gt;''"La nación española es la reunión de los españoles de ambos hemisferios."''&lt;/ref&gt; Voting rights were granted to Spanish nationals whose ancestry originated from Spain or the territories of the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 18 through 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of changing the legal status of the people not only in peninsular Spain but in Spanish possessions overseas. In the latter case, not only people of Spanish ancestry but also indigenous peoples as well were transformed from the subjects of an absolute monarch to the citizens of a nation rooted in the doctrine of national, rather than royal, sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQj2cpZsm9gC ''Los orígenes del gobierno representativo en el Perú: las elecciones (1809–1826)''], Fondo Editorial PUCP, 2003, 116. {{ISBN|9972-42-607-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Constitution recognized the [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] of free blacks and ''mulatos'' but explicitly denied them automatic citizenship. Furthermore, they were not to be counted for the purposes of establishing the number of representatives a given province was to send to the Cortes.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 22 and 29.&lt;/ref&gt; That had the effect of removing an estimated six million people from the rolls in the overseas territories. In part, this arrangement was a strategy by the peninsular deputies to achieve equality in the number of American and peninsular deputies in the future Cortes, but it also served the interests of conservative Criollo representatives, who wished to keep political power within a limited group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Chust, 70–74, 149–157. Rodríguez, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The peninsular deputies, for the most part, were also not inclined towards ideas of [[federalism]] promoted by many of the overseas deputies, which would have granted greater self-rule to the American and Asian territories. Most of the ''peninsulares'', therefore, shared the absolutists' inclination towards [[centralized government]].&lt;ref&gt;Chust, 53–68, 127–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of the treatment of the overseas territories in the constitution —one of the many that would prove not to be to the taste of Ferdinand VII— that by converting these territories to provinces, the king was deprived of a great economic resource. Under the ''Antiguo Régimen'', the taxes from Spain's overseas possessions went directly to the royal treasury; under the Constitution of 1812, it would go to the state administrative apparatus.

[[File:1812SpanishConstitutionMap.svg|thumb|500px|Spanish Nation map according to the Constitution of 1812.]]

The influence of the 1812 Constitution on the emerging states of Latin America was quite direct. [[Miguel Ramos Arizpe]] of [[Mexico]], [[Joaquín Fernández de Leiva]] of [[Chile]], [[Vicente Morales Duárez]] of [[Peru]] and [[José Mejía Lequerica]] of [[Ecuador]], among other significant figures in founding American republics, were active participants at Cádiz. One provision of the Constitution, which provided for the creation of a local government (an ''[[Cabildo (council)|ayuntamiento]]'') for every settlement of over 1,000 people, using a form of indirect election that favored the wealthy and socially prominent, came from a proposal by Ramos Arizpe. This benefited the [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the hereditary aristocracy both on the Peninsula and in the Americas, where it was particularly to the advantage of the Criollos, since they came to dominate the ''ayuntamientos''. It also brought in a certain measure of federalism through the back door, both on the peninsula and overseas: elected bodies at the local and provincial level might not always be in lockstep with the central government.

==Repeal and restoration==
[[File:Derogación de la Constitución de 1812 por Fernando VII en el palacio de Cervelló.jpg|thumb|Repeal of the Constitution of 1812 by Fernando VII in the [[palace of Cervellón]], [[Valencia]], Spain.]]
When Ferdinand VII was restored in March 1814 by the Allied Powers, it is not clear whether he immediately made up his mind as to whether to accept or reject this new charter of Spanish government. He first promised to uphold the constitution, but was repeatedly met in numerous towns by crowds who welcomed him as an absolute monarch, often smashing the markers that had renamed their central plazas as Plaza of the Constitution. Sixty-nine deputies of the Cortes signed the so-called ''Manifiesto de los Persas'' ("Manifesto of the Persians") encouraging him to restore absolutism. Within a matter of weeks, encouraged by [[conservatism|conservatives]] and backed by the [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Church]] hierarchy, he abolished the constitution on 4 May and arrested many [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberal]] leaders on 10 May, justifying his actions as the repudiation of an unlawful constitution made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. Thus he came back to assert the Bourbon doctrine that the sovereign authority resided in his person only.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Bullon de Mendoza y Gomez de Valugera, "Revolución y contrarrevolución en España y América (1808–1840)" in Javier Parades Alonso (ed.), ''España Siglo XIX'', ACTAS, 1991. {{ISBN|84-87863-03-5}}, p. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand's absolutist rule rewarded the traditional holders of power—[[prelate]]s, nobles and those who held office before 1808—but not liberals, who wished to see a [[constitutional monarchy]] in Spain, or many who led the war effort against the French but had not been part of the pre-war government. This discontent resulted in several unsuccessful attempts to restore the Constitution in the five years after Ferdinand's restoration. Finally on 1 January 1820 [[Rafael del Riego]], Antonio Quiroga and other officers initiated a mutiny of army officers in Andalusia demanding the implementation of the Constitution. The movement found support among the northern cities and provinces of Spain, and by 7 March the king had restored the Constitution. Over the next two years, the other European monarchies became alarmed at the liberals' success and at the [[Congress of Verona]] in 1822 approved the [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|intervention of royalist French forces]] in Spain to support Ferdinand VII. After the [[Battle of Trocadero]] liberated Ferdinand from control by the Cortes in August 1823, he turned on the liberals and constitutionalists with fury. After Ferdinand's death in 1833, the Constitution was in force again briefly in 1836 and 1837, while the Constitution of 1837 was being drafted.  Since 1812, Spain has had a total of seven constitutions; the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|current one]] has been in force since 1978.

'''Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia of the Pacific Northwest''' is a clearinghouse of information on the labor history of the region developed by the [[University of Washington]] and Professor James N. Gregory as part of the [[Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects]]. The Encyclopedia covers the major industries of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], major unions and worker struggles, civil rights activism among many ethnic communities, radical organizations, the [[Great Depression]] and the [[New Deal]] and the region's rich history of labor and radical newspapers.

==Content==
The site is organized into thematic categories, focusing on the core industries and movements that have shaped the social history of the region. These include the timber, waterfront, aerospace, construction, farm  industries. Outside of unions and strikes, other aspects of workers and their struggles are examined, from everyday life in the Great Depression to labor culture and art. A particular focus is also given to the intertwined history of radical organizations with labor struggles, including the Industrial Workers of the World, the Communist Party and the United Construction Workers Association. Civil rights organizations and the struggles of black, Asian-American, women, and Latino workers for jobs, housing and equal rights is also cataloged. Much of the content is housed by the individual projects of the [[Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects|Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History]] initiative, which has gathered thousands of oral histories, rare photos, vintage newspapers and original academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dublin|first=Thomas|title=The New Labor History, the New Media, and New Challenges|journal=Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas|date=Summer 2010|volume=7|issue=2|pages=83–96 |url=http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/labor_review.pdf|doi=10.1215/15476715-2009-078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Shia Islam}}
Ja'fari principles ({{lang-fa|علم اصول در مکتب جعفری}}) refers to regulations, history and eminent persons and scholars during the development of shia's [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence]].

==History and development==
===Imami jurists and early works===
Considering different stances in relation to Juridical rules and principles, there are some parties in the schools of Principles. These schools try to apply analytical approaches in their methodology. There are somebodies such as Zorarah Ibn Aayon, Muhammad Ibn Moslem, Abu Basir and also Hisham Ibn Salem.Among these individuals, Hisham Ibn Salem and His Pupils had eminent roles in development of principles among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/9844&lt;/ref&gt; In this period two problems are so important such as difference of hadith in one hand and the distinctions of Ijtihad or authority in other hand.There are two early scholars in principles of jurisprudence who were eminent including [[Hisham ibn Hakam]] and Yunes Ibn Abd Al Rahman.some scholars know Hisham ibn hakam and hisham ibn salem among the outstanding pupils of Imam Sadiq and Imam Kazim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Mansour Hashemi|Tashbih and tanzih|Daneshnameh Jahan Islami in Pesian|vol=1|p=3554|cite book=http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/3554/%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%85}}&lt;/ref&gt; they wrote important books in the field of principles of jurisprudence such as "Kitab Al Akhbar" and " Kayfa Taseh" or "How it is correct?"

===Period of establishment===
It seems that the dominant current was the Adherents of Hadith during the fourth century of Lunar hijrah. They didn't any need to knowledge of principles and put it away.In other hand the relatives of Nobakhti begun a new movement in the sphere of theology and [[kalam]] among shia and Imamiyyah.Abu Sahl Nobakhti, the popular theologian of Shia schools, could presented a new and complete theological system along with Shia characters.In Fact Abu Sahl Nobakhti concerned with the principles through the theological works such a way that He referred to some questions in the field of the principles.According to Madlung this approach of Abu Sahl Nobakhti and his theological system was along with defending of Imami creeds and theological beliefs.Maybe the most important Abu Sahl's essay in the principles is the essay of "Naqz Al Shafe'ei or the refusing the shafe'ei which is written against Shafe'ei and also counted as the first completed work in the principles among imamiyyah.besided he written some books on the subjects of refusing Qyias in jurisprudence and ijtihad Al R'ay.Of course there is no track from these works and they are lost.During the fourth century of Hijrah, already one trend is very dominant which is indeed on the basis of refusing of Qiyas and R'ay in jurisprudence. Also there were many books concerned with these subjects among imami Theologians. for example Hasan ibn Mousa Nobakhti wrote a book by the name of "A book on the khabar Vahed and Amal".according to this works there is no appication for Qiyas and R'ay.Among The first Mutakalim Jurist in fourth century is Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani as some one who possessed a school which his method was similar to Twelve Imams of Shia and somehow like the Mutazilite schools of thought.

====Ibn Abi Aqil And his thought====
His complete name was Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani and he came from the [[Yemen]]. He was contemporary with Shaykh Koleini.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jafar sobhani|Al Vasit fi Feqh|vol=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Aqil counted as pioneer jurist in the principles. He could establishing an approach on which His juridical methodology was dependent on Quranic rules and known traditions.He is the author of a legal work entitled Mutamassak bi Habl Al Rasul, which was one of the most renowned legal sources during the 4th and 5thllOth and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Modarrsei TabaTabaei|1984|p=35|introduction to shi'i law}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first one who arrange the knowledge of [[fiqh]] and give consistency ti it.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/15/6/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%82%DB%8C%D9%84_%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibn Jonayd Eskafi====
[[Ibn Jonayd Eskafi]]  was one of the first and eminent Shia jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1513&lt;/ref&gt; He had different approach in understanding of Shia's traditions. He believed that there is a theological basis for interpretation of Hadith on which the Juridical tradition of Imams is not according to Saying but to Ray or opinion.He was an eminent religious scholars among elites.Also Ibn Nadim knows him as great scholars among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/200&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important book in Fiqh is Tahzib Al Shia le Ahkam Al Shariah.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of development===
Needness to Usul becomes indispensable when Shia community far away from twelve periods. Also appearance of new subjects intensify this necessity.in development epoch we confronted with three eminent masters in the field of Usul and extending it namely [[Shaykh Mufid]], [[Sharif Murtaza]], [[Sallar Deylami]] and [[Shaykh Tusi]].

====Shaykh Mufid====
{{main article|Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid}}
He was also called Ibn Muallim, meaning "son of the teacher";&lt;ref name="Glassé1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlPuAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-063126-0|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muallim was his father.

According to [[Ibn al-Nadim]], who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia ''Mutekallimun'' in the field of kalam, and [[Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī|al-Tawhidi]], who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as "eloquent and skillful at dialectic (''jadal'')". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents "that a wooden column was actually gold".&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt; He was taught the Islamic science of [[hadith]] by [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]].&lt;ref name="Christoph" /&gt;

When Muhammad ibn Hosein ask on the person with such a nickname he told : he is ali ibn Hosein or sharif Murtaza.&lt;ref&gt;magazine Baqyyah Allah,number 6,1412 lunar Hijrah,p:39&lt;/ref&gt; According to Murtaza, the first of religious duty is the obligation to reason to knowledge of God. The other duties are dependent to this first duty.Al-Murtaza is along with the Mu'tazilite starting-point that man's first duty is to use his reason to arrive at knowledge of God. Also in Kalam proof of the existence of God, he defend from the atomist' stance in versus of Aristortelian notion of substantial change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mc Dermott|1978|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was forty two he participated in the class of his master namely Shaykh Murtaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imam Khomeini| 2003|the greatest Jihad|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time many Muslim scholars in Baghdad, both Sunni and Shiʿite were killed. The house of al-Shaikh al-Tusi was burnt down, as were his books and the works he had written in Baghdad, together with important libraries of Shi'ite books. Al-Tusi went to al-Najaf after the fall of Baghdad. He died at Najaf on the 22nd of Muharram in the year 460 A.H/2 December 1067.in confliction between two schools of Ahbaris and usuli, Shaykh Tusi defended of Usuli school and calls akhbari as followers of literate or literalists.&lt;ref name=Clifford1989&gt;{{harvnb| Clifford Edmund Bosworth|Brill Archive, 1989|The Encyclopedia of Islam, Volume 6|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaykh Tusi believed in principles of jurisprudence as a fundamental knowledge in acquiring the judgments of Islam religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition: Supplement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95Q3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-06167-3|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote in introduction of 'Al-Iddah' book as follow:

===Period of flourishing===
this period begans from the end of Sixth into middle of eighth lunar hijrah.Scholars written many detailed books in the fielf of principles.They concerned with principles in detail and accuracy.Scholars such as Ibn Zohreh halabi,Sadid Al Din Hemsi,Najm Al Din Helli,Allameh Helli,Amid Al Din A'araji,Zia Al Din A'araji,Fakhr Al Mohaqeqin, Muhammad Ibn Makki known as first martyr,Shaykh Abdullah Soyouri,Zain Al DIn Ibn Nour Al Din Ali Ibn Ahmad known A Second Martyr, all of them lived in this period.

====Ibn Zohreh Halabi====
His whole name is Ezz Al Din A l Makarem Sayyed Hamzeh Ibn Ali Ibn Zohreh. According To Moreza Mutahhari he learened Tusi's Nihayah under Ibn Hajib.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.motahari.ir/Content/933/321&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 20th book attributed to him. diversity of them shows his all arounded.His eminent book in principle is Qanyat Al Nozu fi Elmi Al Usul Va foru.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/947&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allameh Helli====
{{main article|Al-Hilli}}
Al-Hilli also known as the sage of Hilla,&lt;ref name="jafri"&gt;Jafri, S.H.M. "al- Ḥillī , (1) Ḏj̲amāl al-Dīn Ḥasan b. Yūsuf b. ʿAlī b. Muṭahhar." [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-2867 Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.] Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the still existent town of [[Al Hillah]] (in what is now [[Iraq]]), commonly viewed as the [[Shi'a Islam in Iraq|centre of Shia Islam]] when [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] leaders were in control over [[Baghdad]] during his life.&lt;ref name="jafri"/&gt; He entered into a prominent family of [[Ulama|Shia jurists]] and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected ''mujtahid'' and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle [[Muhaqqiq al-Hilli]] was also a renowned scholar.He studied [[Islamic theology|theology]] and [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus.&lt;ref name="tehrani"&gt;Tehrani, Aga Buzurg, Tabaqat 'Alam il-Shi'ah, v.5 p.52 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent some time at the newly established [[Maragheh observatory]], where he studied [[Avicennism|Avicennan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] under [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and was also introduced to the works of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]]. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"&gt;Schmidkte, S. ḤELLI, ḤASAN B. YUSOF B. MOṬAHHAR. Encyclopaedia Iranica (www.iranicaonline.org, accessed: 28.09.09)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver [[jurisprudence]] is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on [[usul al-fiqh]], he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are ''al-Mukhtalaf'' (''The Disagreement'') and ''al-Muntaha'' (''The End''). ''Mukhtalaf'' is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the ''Muntaha'' is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, ''Qawa'id ul-Ahkam'', which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is ''Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha'', which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, ''[[Hajj]]'' or ''[[Salat]]'').&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"/&gt;

====Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin====
Muhaqqiq was born in the city of [[al-Hilla]], [[Iraq]], where he would spend most of his life, to a family of prominent Shi'i jurists. He studied [[theology]], [[fiqh]] and [[usul al-fiqh]] under his father. Muhaqqiq later became the leader of the Shi'i seminary there.He has many credible books in principles like Mabadi Al Osul,Fakhryyah and others.

====First martyr====
{{main article|Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili}}
Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili al-[[Jezzine|Jizzini]]&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis G. Jestice|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576073551|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1334–1385) also known as '''Shahid Awwal''' (Arabic: الشهيد الأول''ash-Shahid al-Awwal''  "The First Martyr"), is the author of Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (Arabic: الدمشقية اللمعة, The Damascene Glitter") and was a [[Shi'a]] scholar. Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as "Shahid Awwal" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner.When Mohammad bin Makki was 16 years old he went to study at al-[[Hilla]] in Iraq. He returned home when he was 21. He used [[taqiyya]] to establish himself as one of the religious scholars of Damascus, using Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging the Shia using Shia law.&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"/&gt;

====Second martyr====
{{main article|Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili}}
Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili (1506-1558) was a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] scholar. He was born in 911 AH. in Jabal Amel.His Magnum opus is the first commentary of ''The Damascene Glitter'' by [[Shahid Awwal]] called ''The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter'' (Arabic: ''ar-Rawda-l-Bahiyah fi Sharh allam'a-d-Dimashqiya''   الروضة البهيّة في شرح اللمعة الدمشقيّة ).

===Period of Decline===
The appearance of Akhbari lies in this period.This school  "crystalized" as a distinct movement with the writings of [[Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi]] (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and early post-Safavid era.  However, shortly thereafter [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (d. 1792), along with other Usuli [[mujtahid]]s, crushed the Akhbari movement.&lt;ref name="momen222"&gt;{{Citation| last =Momen| first =Moojan| author-link =

Akhbārīs also differ from Usūlīs in their rejection of the ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]]'', arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics,  clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam.

====Against akhbarism====
*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

==Contemporary periods==
[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the infallibles (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.&lt;ref&gt;This has been translated into English twice: by [[Roy Mottahedeh]] as "Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence" (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-85168-393-2}} and anonymously as "The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence according to Shi'i Law" (2003) {{ISBN|978-1-904063-12-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English version==
Uşūl al-Fiqh, the [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|methodology of jurisprudence]], which is usually – and inaccurately, if not incorrectly – translated “principles of jurisprudence,” is an Islamic science which is developed by Shiite scholars in two recent centuries into an unparalleled intellectual, logical system of thought and a comprehensive branch of knowledge which not only serves as the logic of jurisprudence but as an independent science dealing with some hermeneutical problems.

Lack of precise English equivalents to expressions and terms of this complicated science indicates the least difficulties of preparing the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.

"[http://bayanbox.ir/download/6126480921220660060/USUL-AL-FIQH.pdf An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence (Uşūl al-Fiqh)-A Shiite Approach]" is the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.[http://www.lib.ir/book/60869565/An-introduction-to-methodology-of-Islamic-Jurispru/]

This book is written by Alireza Hodaee, Professor of [[Fiqh|Jurisprudence]] and the Essentials of Islamic Law, University of Tehran.[http://usuli.ir/2016/07/04/usul-al-fiqh/]

It should be noted that most of complicated arguments of such profound science cannot be presented in an introductory work; they should be pursued in detailed books written by great Shiite Uşūlīs.
