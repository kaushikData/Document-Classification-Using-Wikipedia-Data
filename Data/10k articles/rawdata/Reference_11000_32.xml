'''''A Historical Atlas of South Asia''''' is a definitive historical chronology of the region of [[South Asia]] from prehistoric times through the present. It was edited and largely authored by [[Joseph E. Schwartzberg]], professor emeritus of South Asian Studies at the [[University of Minnesota]].  Although much of the coverage in the atlas is principally focused on [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]] are included and to some extent [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It is highly regarded by scholars of South Asian history for its vast amount of detail and coverage of the region's lengthy and complex history. The atlas is divided into two main sections: Maps and photographs and historical text which corresponds to and explains the maps. 

The initial assembly of the Atlas began in 1964 with many authors, historians, cartographers and researchers contributing over a fourteen-year period. Although many consider the atlas to be the ultimate resource for students and scholars alike, the authors stress that "it is intended to supplement existing histories of South Asia...not to be used in place of them." 

The atlas was first published in 1978 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. About 3,300 total copies were produced and all of them sold, which caused the atlas to become out of print. In 1992, Schwartzberg and a new team of historians released a slightly updated second edition titled '''''Second Impression, with Additional Material''''' and published by [[Oxford University Press]]. This edition is now also out of print.

In 1980 the [[American Historical Association]] bestowed the [[Watumull Prize]] on the ''Atlas''.

'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The website contains a database of meanings and expansions for [[abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s mainly in English but includes some entries in other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbis.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=ubos&amp;colors=&amp;ocolors=&amp;lett=fs&amp;tid=0&amp;titel_id=2223|title=Acronym Finder|date=|website=dbis.uni-regensburg.de|publisher=[[Universität Regensburg]]|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is freely accessible. The entries are further classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes which are shown on a Map along with location information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/blog/2017/04/03/e-tipp-der-woche-acronym-finder/|title=e-Tipp der Woche: Acronym Finder {{!}} [UB]log|website=blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations with multiple expansions are listed by popularity with the most common one being presented first, these can be sorted alphabetically as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/57676-acronym-finder|title=Acronym Finder - ExtremeTech|date=2001-09-05|work=ExtremeTech|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;GIRALDO ORTIZ, John Jairo.

Jul.-Dec. 2008, vol. 31, no. 2, p. 101-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can contribute to the database by submitting abbreviations and their meanings, these are reviewed by an by [[editing|editor]] and categorized before being added to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; While the database has been described as fairly accurate errors have been found in the meanings and expansions of abbreviations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The website does not list sources for the abbreviations and their meanings but it does identify people who have contributed more than 50 abbreviations to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The database only contains abbreviations and their expansions and does not list other data such as grammatical category, context, source, field of the abbreviation etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Farlex, Inc. the current owner of the website also publishes mobile apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acronym-finder-acronyms-abbreviations-initialisms-more/id1032748692?mt=8|title=Acronym Finder - Acronyms, Abbreviations, Initialisms, and more on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym Finder also includes a ''Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector'', a light-hearted tool that [[random]]ly generates jargon-like phrases and abbreviations — usually [[initialisms]] that would be unpronounceable as [[acronyms]] — and meanings from 30 cleverly chosen buzz words.

The website is supported through advertisements.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

==Reputation==
The website is listed as a quick reference tool in directories like Stanford Library, Library of Congress, USC Library.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556 &lt;nowiki&gt;Acronym finder [digital] : AF&lt;/nowiki&gt;]". ''searchworks.stanford.edu''. Stanford Libraries SearchWorks

"[https://www.loc.gov/rr/askalib/virtualref.html Virtual Reference Shelf] - Ask a Librarian". ''loc.gov''. Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited as the largest database of acronyms&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, D. &amp; Isern, D. Appl Intell (2011) 34: 312. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-009-0197-4&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in computational studies for its database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pto/papers/ciir/ir-186.pdf|title=Acrophile: An Automated Acronym Extractor and Server|last=Leah S. Larkey, Paul Ogilvie, M. Andrew Price, Brenden Tamilio|first=|date=2000|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listings of abbreviations on the website have also been used as a defense that an abbreviation is in public use and cannot be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Patents Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrdCAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Bureau of National Affairs|page=1283}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in some trademark cases citations for AF have been accepted it has been described as an unreliable reference in others.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|title=CTM upheld after medical trade mark declared not to be descriptive|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2011|website=oami.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134443/http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|archive-date=November 23, 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has garnered criticism for the fact that anyone can submit abbreviations to the site and the content is user generated. Mike Molloy the site's original owner had defended that each submission is verified before being added to the database.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3728">'''Bosh v. Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority''' is a 2013 [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]] case that held for the first time that the Oklahoma state constitution provided a civil remedy for violations of state constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=468646|title=BOSH v. CHEROKEE COUNTY GOVERNMENTAL BUILDING AUTHORITY
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of civil remedies directly under the state constitution was viewed as a watershed moment in the development of civil rights in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.ou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=olr|title=Bosh and the Constitutional Cause of Action: The Corridor to Civil Liberties|last1=Coffrey|first1=Nick|year=2016|volume=68|edition=3|publisher=Oklahoma Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the decision issued, claims asserting violations of state constitutional rights in Oklahoma are now colloquially referred to as "Bosh claims."

The Bosh decision resulted from an incident at a local jail. Video from the facility showed a handcuffed man, later identified as Daniel Bosh, exchanging words with a jailer.&lt;ref name=tw1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/newshomepage2/video-evidence-in-police-beating-of-handcuffed-man-destroyed/article_bab96d69-1a2a-59db-9461-238c90641e26.html|title=Video evidence in 2011 police beating of handcuffed man destroyed|publisher=Tulsa World|date=May 25, 2014|last1=Aspinwall|first1=Cary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video shows the jailer leave his chair to confront Mr. Bosh. As the two men continued exchanging words, the jailer grabbed Mr. Bosh by the back of the neck and drove his head into the front of the booking desk. The jailer then placed Mr. Bosh's head underneath his arm and fell backwards causing Mr. Bosh's head to strike the floor causing injuries.&lt;ref name=tw1 /&gt;

At the time of the incident, Oklahoma law provided [[absolute immunity]] for conduct occurring within a jail facility. In Bosh, the Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized that immunity conflicted with the state constitution which prohibited the use of [[excessive force]]. For this reason, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that recognizing immunity in this circumstance would nullify rights granted by the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/bosh-case-resulted-in-an-important-oklahoma-supreme-court-decision/article_c2dc9aa2-0496-58a2-beb6-5fde650b3c0b.html|title=Bosh case resulted in an important Oklahoma Supreme Court decision|last1=Aspinwall|first1=Cary|publisher=Tulsa World|date=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the decision issued, both state and federal courts have wrestled with the scope of the opinion and how it might apply in contexts outside excessive force within a jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10429661113527963109&amp;q=frizzell&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,358,359,360&amp;sciodt=4,358,359,360&amp;as_ylo=2016|title=KERISSA PETTY, Plaintiff, v.

The case was argued to the Court by lawyers from the Bryan &amp; Terrill law firm.

'''Chauvinism''' is a form of extreme [[patriotism]] and a  belief in national superiority and glory. Whereas patriotism and [[nationalism]] may represent temperate [[pride]], chauvinism is 
[[wikt:intemperate#Adjective|intemperate]]. It can be also defined as "an irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979008143|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the chauvinist's own people are seen as unique and special while the rest of the people are considered weak or inferior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to legend, French soldier [[Nicolas Chauvin]] was badly wounded in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin was a fanatical [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] despite the unpopularity of this view in [[Bourbon Restoration]] France. His single-minded blind devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.&lt;ref name="Chauvinism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chauvinism|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/chauvinism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chauvinism'' has extended from its original use to include fanatical devotion and undue partiality to any group or cause to which one belongs,  especially when such [[Partisan (political)|partisanship]] includes prejudice against or hostility toward outsiders or rival groups and persists even in the face of overwhelming opposition.&lt;ref name="Chauvinism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quickanddirtytips.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Words You Didn't Realize Were Named After People|url=http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/15-words-you-didnt-realize-were-named-after-people|website=Grammar Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chauvinism|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/31017?redirectedFrom=chauvinism#eid|website=The Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This French quality finds its parallel in the British term ''[[jingoism]]'', which has retained the meaning of ''chauvinism'' strictly in its original sense; that is, an attitude of belligerent nationalism.&lt;ref name="oed.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jingoism|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/jingoism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jingoism &amp; Chauvinism|url=http://wordhistories.com/2013/06/15/jingoism-chauvinism/|website=Word Histories|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English, the word has come to be used in some quarters as shorthand for [[#Male chauvinism|''male chauvinism'']], a trend reflected in [[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]], which, as of 2018, begins its first example of use of the term ''chauvinism'' with "an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex".&lt;ref name="quickanddirtytips.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chauvinism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chauvinism|website=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English |url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/24/1224.html |accessdate=4 December 2008 |quote=''Chauvinism'' is "fanatical, boastful, unreasoning patriotism" and by extension "prejudiced belief or unreasoning pride in any group to which you belong." Lately, though, the compounds "male chauvinism" and "male chauvinist" have gained so much popularity that some users may no longer recall the patriotic and other more generalized meanings of the words.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As nationalism==
In 1945, political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] described the concept thus:
{{quote|Chauvinism is an almost natural product of the national concept in so far as it springs directly from the old idea of the "national mission." ... [A] nation's mission might be interpreted precisely as bringing its light to other, less fortunate peoples that, for whatever reason, have miraculously been left by history without a national mission. As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arendt |first=Hannah |date=October 1945 |title=Imperialism, Nationalism, Chauvinism |journal= The Review of Politics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=457 |doi=10.1017/s0034670500001649}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Male chauvinism==
{{see also|Sexism|Androcentrism|Machismo|Patriarchy|Masculism}}
Male chauvinism is the belief that [[men]] are superior to [[women]]. The first documented use of the phrase "male chauvinism" is in the 1935 [[Clifford Odets]] play ''[[Till the Day I Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mansbridge|first=Jane|author2=Katherine Flaster|title=Male Chauvinist, Feminist, Sexist, and Sexual Harassment: Different Trajectories in Feminist Linguistic Innovation|journal=American Speech|year=2005|volume=80|issue=3|page=261|publisher=Harvard University|doi=10.1215/00031283-80-3-256|url=http://americanspeech.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/80/3/256.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the workplace===
The balance of the [[workforce]] changed during [[World War II]]. As men left their positions to enlist in the military and fight in the war, women started replacing them. After the war ended, men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise, according to Cynthia B. Lloyd. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employments, but they soon realized women had taken over many of their positions to fill the void, says Lloyd.&lt;ref name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975"&gt;Lloyd, Cynthia B., ed. ''Sex, Discrimination, and the Division of Labor''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd and Michael Korda have argued that as they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominate, holding positions of power while women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls, this phenomena could be a result of men being more skilled in their respective areas as well as it could be because their inherent manly nature was preferable for the purposes of productivity. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors, argue Korda and Lloyd.&lt;ref name="Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korda, Michael 1973"&gt;[[Michael Korda]], ''Male Chauvinism! How It Works''. New York: Random House, 1973. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
Chauvinism is seen by some as an influential factor in the [[Thematic Apperception Test|TAT]], a psychological personality test. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the "potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation" for women.&lt;ref&gt;Potkay, Charles R., Matthew R. Merrens. Sources of Male Chauvinism in the TAT. Journal of Personality Assessment, 39.5 (1975): 471-479. Web. 31 Jan 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism, attempts to find the underlying causes of male chauvinism.
{{quote|Male chauvinism was studied in the [[psychoanalytic]] therapy of 11 men. It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results In anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine [[self-esteem]]. [[Mother]]s were more important than fathers in the development of male chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with [[decompensation#Psychology|decompensation]] in wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woods|first=Sherwyn M.|title=Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=January 1976|volume=33|issue=1|pages=63|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1976.01770010037007 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/63}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Female chauvinism==
{{see also|sexism|gynocentrism|misogyny|misandry|matriarchy|feminism}}
The term ''female chauvinism'' has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of [[feminism]]; second-wave feminist [[Betty Friedan]] is a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;"If I were a man, I would strenuously object to the assumption that women have any moral or spiritual superiority as a class. This is [...] female chauvinism." Friedan, Betty. 1998. ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement''. Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]] used the term in similar, but opposite sense in her book, ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]]'', in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older [[Misogyny|misogynist]] [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture'', [[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7432-8428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge''' is a [[body of knowledge]], set forth in a proposal by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) entitled ''Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge for the 21st century''. This proposal seeks to identify and implement improvements to the education and licensure process for [[civil engineer]]s in the United States of America. The proposal is intended to increase [[occupational closure]] by increasing the requirements to become a licensed engineer. Some have identified this joint effort with the ''Raising the Bar'' as not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cover Story: Licensure and Education |url=http://www.prism-magazine.org/summer12/feature_01.cfm |website=PRSIM Magazine |publisher=American Society of Engineering Education |accessdate=20 June 2018 |date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Civil engineering as a profession has long studied and evaluated issues associated with educational preparation for the practice of its profession  &lt;ref name="Lipinski2005"&gt;Lipinski, Martin E. "ASCE Policy 465: The Impact on Transportation Engineering Workforce Development." Institute of Transportation Engineers.ITE Journal, vol. 75, no. 12, 2005, pp. 24-27, ABI/INFORM Collection; ProQuest Central,&lt;/ref&gt; and to that end, engineering societies have held conferences and prepared reports on the subject since 1918.&lt;ref name="Lipinski2005"/&gt;

===Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (1918)===
The first systematic efforts to evaluate and improve engineering curricula began in 1907 when the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education or SPEE, presently the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE). The Society invited several engineering societies, including the American Society of Civil Engineers to participate in a "Joint Committee on Engineering Education of the National Engineering Societies''.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"&gt;Russell, Jeffrey S., Brewer Stouffer, and Stuart G. Walesh. "The first professional degree: A historic opportunity." Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice 126.2 (2000): 54-63. Accessed on November 12, 2017 at [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey_Russell2/publication/228559749_The_First_Professional_Degree_A_Historic_Opportunity/links/5603fb4e08ae611dfff81939.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
The committee's objective was to determine the appropriate scope of engineering education and the degree of cooperation required from the various engineering schools.

In 1908, the committee initially invited the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] and the [[General Education Board]] to appoint delegates. Notwithstanding financial assistance from ASCE, the committee approached the Foundation to assume the project and fully fund a comprehensive report. Carnegie agreed and selected Charles R. Mann (1869-1942) &lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles Riborg. (2009). In Marquis Who's Who (Ed.), Marquis who was who in America 1607-1984. New Providence, NJ: Marquis Who's Who LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; professor of physics at the University of Chicago. to lead the effort to prepare the 1918 formal report.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; 
Mann recommended that knowledge and practice be equal parts of the engineering curriculum with principles of engineering distilled from practice and science and mechanics taught simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;  These concepts, first advanced in the early part of the 20th century, remain the "...general organization of most engineering education today." &lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Foreshadowing the emergence of the [[total quality management]] initiative, Mann argued that "the ultimate success of any organization depends on ... the manner in which those in control coordinate and interrelate the intelligences and imaginations of men.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Further, Mann claimed that engineering education was in need of "...a healthy dose of managerial and ''humanistic" courses..." &lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;

===Board of Investigation and Coordination (BIC) (1923-1929) === 
Starting with Mann report recommendations, the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education or SPEE again organized a study on examining the results of efforts to standardize and otherwise increase the efficacy of engineering education conducted by a newly formed but temporary Board of Investigation and Coordination (BIC) supported by formal arrangements with over 150 colleges and universities, nearly every engineering institution of that time.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Again, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching provided assistance along with support from the American Society of Civil Engineers and other engineering societies, the effort resulted in a seven year effort and final report- ''"Report of the investigation of Engineering Education (1923-1929)"'' &lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"&gt;Wickenden, William E. "Report of the investigation of engineering education, 1923–1929." vols. I and II, Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, Pittsburgh 1934 (1930). Accessed at Hathitrust on November 2017 [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b3831642].&lt;/ref&gt;

The report dealt with two separate but very much related issues in engineering education; separate versus unified undergraduate/graduate education and the length of this engineering education.&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; 
The report noted that a unified process implies in a 21st-century context is that the undergraduate and graduate engineering curriculums are complete and self-contained under the direction of a single engineering department.&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; A divided education process implies that there is a distinct, pre-professional education stage such as that practiced by the medical, legal and dental professions &lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; The Board in 1930 found that the needs of the engineering profession was best served by allowing secondary school graduates to directly enter the engineering curriculum and this should be the norm of engineering education.&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; This meant that unlike the unified approach to engineering education, medical, legal and dental education programs were divided and could only be entered after a distinct and separate, undergraduate education process not managed by the profession. As to the question of the appropriate length of the engineering curriculum, the Board recommended staying with the "usual distinction between undergraduate and graduate programs where the undergraduate degree was an accredited engineering degree of fours years as the normal length (unified process).&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; This 1930 recommendation by the BIC became the standard discipline organization for civil engineering education in [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|specially accredited]] institutions: the four-year bachelor's of science degree in civil engineering or BSCE with optional graduate school coursework for advanced skills and methods, the masters of science in civil engineering, or MSCE degree.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;  The objective of the engineering curriculum was to integrate humanistic, scientific and technological studies into a coherent program of study which is different than a degree in science by virtue of "... a well-marked professional orientation".&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt;

The 1930 Board report also discussed the "normal path to progress" taken by engineering graduates.&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; The Board observed that industry was less inclined to emphasize differences between engineering disciplines and more inclined to focus on the distinction between discipline activities such as design from management activities.&lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; The Board noted even in the 1920s, a clear trend where graduates would work on technical activities in the early part of their career and then work on increasing percentage of what was then termed administrative activity &lt;ref name="SPEE_1930"/&gt; and implicitly by today's standards, management activity.

=== Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Accreditation and National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) Licensing ===

While reforms were being made in civil engineering education, concerns were being expressed over [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|licensing engineering practice]] over self-regulation by the Societies themselves.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; By 1910, the civil engineering society accepted and supported the concept of State licensure of engineering practice.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; In 1920, the National Council of State Boards of Engineering Examiner, currently known as the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES) was organized to promote fair licensure for engineers in the United States, help enforce such licensure regulations. and determine and administer appropriate levels of experience and education for professional practice and still does in the current period.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; In 1932, working with other engineering societies and educators such as [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] and [[American Society for Engineering Education|ASEE]], the Council organized the [[American Engineers' Council for Professional Development|Engineers' Council for Professional Development]] or ECPD. 
&lt;ref name="ECPD establishment"&gt;[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/20011758&amp;referer=brief_results As an audit of accomplishments, 1932-1947, and a rededication of plans for future action, this booklet is issued by the Engineers' council for professional development in commemoration of its fifteenth anniversary, June 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal accreditation by the ECPD of engineering curricula began in 1936.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; ECPD grew and in 1980, changed its name to Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and focus solely to [[accreditation]] of engineering education programs.&lt;ref name="ABET History"/&gt;

=== ASCE Education Conferences (1960-1995) ===
ASCE conducted its first engineering education conference in 1960 at Ann Arbor, Michigan. The first of six conferences on this topic over the next 35 years.&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"&gt;Smerdon, Ernest T., and Jeffrey S. Russell. "Two comprehensive US studies of engineering education reform." Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering Education–ICEE 2007. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference attendees resolved the earlier BIC recommendation of four years as the curriculum norm be changed to a five-year undergraduate degree in civil engineering.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; A 9168 joint study between ASCE and ASEE resulted in a report entitled "Goals of Engineering Education" advocated for one more year of engineering education in the form of one year of graduate level coursework.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Accreditation partner, ABET experimented with dual-level accreditation where basic programs were four years in length and advanced criteria for additional undergraduate coursework.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Twenty-percent of ABET's civil engineering programs requested such dual-level accreditation.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Despite the initial interest, the five year undergraduate programs had a difficult time competing against the four year programs for the same bachelor's degree of science in civil engineering and ABET dropped dual-accreditation by the mid 1980s.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;

==== Civil Engineering Education Conference (CEEC 95) ====
By 1995, the effort was again made to address the question of curriculum length as a norm. Questions at this point were again on curriculum integration but also that of the [[Professional degree|first professional degree]].&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; A professional degree, formerly known in the US as a "first professional degree", is a degree that prepares someone to work in a particular profession such as civil engineering and meets the minimum academic requirements for [[licensure]] or [[accreditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/choosingyourdegree/professional/ |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |quote= These degrees follow a set curriculum to meet the requirements of the relevant professional organisation so that you're fully prepared to enter your chosen profession after you graduate. |title= Professional Degree Programmes |accessdate= 3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation for the 1995 conference focused on four topics: technical competence, communication skills, management concepts and teamwork.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"&gt;Russell, Jeffrey, et al. "Consensus! Engineering students need more management education." Journal of Management in Engineering 12.6 (1996): 17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a clear recognition of weaknesses in curriculum content as one observer remarked -"an engineer is hired for his or her technical skills, fired for poor people skills and promoted for leadership and management skills." &lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; The question was raised why recreate elementary coursework in fields such as economics or management. Attendees noted that educators must balance depth versus breadth in developing engineering curricula. With management as an example, it was noted that students can take management instruction in any number of non-engineering environments but it was important for an engineering education program to possess a design that ensured all graduates acquired a "particular base of knowledge." &lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; One of the authors (Walesh) noted that one of the biggest problems faced by consulting engineers was poor project management and how few in academia recognized the importance of "effective project management on the survival of an engineering firm...".&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; Noting the increased importance of management in civil engineering practice in the 21st century, the Conference stated that civil engineers must have a larger skillset than their counterparts in the 1920s with respect to knowledge in communication, teamwork and project management.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; This Conference then, laid the conceptual framework for looking at specialized applications of management within civil engineering curricula such as [[engineering management]], [[design management]] [[construction management]] and [[project management]].

Conferees reported out from the conference on proposed initiatives, barriers and recommended actions in eight areas, namely: faculty development, communication skills, project management, teamwork and leadership, project based learning, practitioner participation, pre-professional and professional degrees and implementation of [[National Science Foundation]] recommendation for engineering education.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; 
* In the area of faculty development, the Conference recommended requiring technical competence, project management, practical experience, communication skills and leadership ability for program faculty.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt;
* For Communication skills, the recommendations were to invite industry speakers to emphasize the importance of communication skills, students engineering communications portfolio to display their skills.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt;
* For Project Management which the Conference defined as a function performed on a specific project in which an organization has defined responsibilities and can be composed of a variety of tasks in the "... planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance phases of a constructed facility...",&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; work with interested faculty to get appropriate training as well as for the civil engineering profession to develop additional educational materials as one of the barriers to success on this item was a lack of suitable instruction materials. Specifically, participants suggested tasking ASCE's Engineering Management Division to develop instructional materials for separate engineering management coursework or individual instructional modules for technical competencies.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; 
* In the area of integrated and interdisciplinary curriculum systems or [[Project-based learning|Project-Based Learning]], recommendations in part were to "develop and disseminate a database of [[Case study|case ...(studies)]]...";&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt; encourage ASCE's practitioner members to become more engaged in the educational process; ASCE and NSF should develop and promote teaching models and workshops to foster educator-practitioner partnerships.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt;
* As to Practitioner Participation in Education, the conference recommended that practitioners serving on department advisory committees and assist in the development of learning outcomes for instruction programs, practitioners to serve as sources of case study data materials and analysis, promote educator and practitioner-in-residence programs with possible CEU credits, support co-op and internship opportunities.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt;
* With respect to Pre-professional and Professional Degrees, the Conference recommended delineating engineering education from the [[Engineering technologist|engineering technology]] education curricula.&lt;ref name="Russell_1996"/&gt;

=== Task Committee on Civil Engineering Education Initiatives (TCCEEJ) 1995-1998 ===
Formed out of recommendations from the CEEC 95 conference, the committee was chartered to investigate four areas: faculty development; integrated curriculums; practitioner involvement in the education process and the adoption of the master's degree as the [[first professional degree]] necessary to enable practice of civil engineering.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;  The basis for the 1995 recommended change was the existence of a well developed and diverse group of graduate civil engineering programs that did not exist in the 1920s and 1930s when the earlier BIC had worked.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; Whereas, the 1930 BIC recommended no changes to the typical undergraduate and graduate engineering programs, the 1995 Task Committee recommended that the master's degree of science in civil engineering be recognized as the "first professional degree" to be recognized for professional practice.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt;  The committee also noted that this also required instruction in the principles of [[project management]]. Ultimately, the Committee recommendation to ASCE in 1998 was that the "first professional degree" become the new paradigm of engineering education, replacing the earlier BIC model from 1930.&lt;ref name="Russell_2000"/&gt; That same year, ASCE formalized the recommendations in a policy statement saying that ASCE supported the concept of "...the master's degree as the First Professional Degree (FPD) for the practice of civil engineering (CE) at the professional level." &lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; 
Thus, the impetus for the development and adoption of ASCE's Policy 465 in 1998 can be traced directly to the 1995 ASCE Education Conference held in Denver, CO, USA.&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLICY STATEMENT 465 - ACADEMIC PREREQUISITES FOR LICENSURE AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE|url=http://www.asce.org/issues-and-advocacy/public-policy/policy-statement-465---academic-prerequisites-for-licensure-and-professional-practice/|website=American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposed change was not widely accepted within the civil engineering profession &lt;ref name="TCFPD"&gt;{{Citation|last=American Society of Civil Engineers |author-link=American Society of Civil Engineers |date=2001-10-09 |title=Engineering the Future of Civil Engineering: Report of the Task Committee on the First Professional Degree |pages=A–22–A–23 |url=http://www.asce.org/pdf/tcfpd-complete.pdf |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721032732/http://www.asce.org/pdf/tcfpd-complete.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Task Committee for the First Professional Degree (1999-2001)=== 
In 1999, ASCE then organized the Task Committee for the First Professional Degree and instructed it to develop an implementation strategy for ASCE's new vision and policy.&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; The new task committee reported back in 2001 &lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; that although the earlier recommendations and adopted policy had been focused on graduate education, the committee recommended developing a holistic picture of prerequisite requirements for formal education.&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; In this manner, it had identified the fundamental issue as the increasing inadequacy of the four year bachelor's degree as "... formal academic preparation for the practice of civil engineering at the professional level in the 21st century." &lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; The report cited examples of this were inadequate communication skills, inability to manage projects profitably and failure to meet stakeholder expectations among others.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt;  It also noted that a lack of education in leadership to support the current prevalent career path of "...starting from primarily technical work through project management and into management and leadership." &lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; There was an intense competition for desired leadership positions that was shared in common with other engineering disciplines, as well as from non-engineers.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt;  The best example of this is in project management which requires better educated civil engineers.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; In the case of the latter, more and more non-engineers are managing "...civil engineers with the principal reason being that the non-engineers possess stronger leadership, communication and business skills...." &lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; and leadership positions with titles such as Director of Public Works, Chief Engineer, City Engineer, Secretary of Transportation, etc. are now being filled by non-engineers "...possessing skills which are perceived to be of greater value than those of a typical engineer." &lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Davis, R. (2000). "Supervision Debate Roils PE's in Government," Engineering Times, Vol. 22, No. 10. &lt;BR&gt; ASCE cites author's statement that; "troubling to engineers across the country are the reported cases of non-engineers replacing PE's in government positions and, in the worst cases, influencing or making engineering decisions that they may not be qualified to deliver." The argument for non-engineers increasingly managing engineers is that "individuals who may not be PE's— but possess exceptional leadership, communication, and business skills— can lead a department of engineers more effectively than PE's if they are not performing engineering and are stronger in these other key areas." An editorial in the same issue of Engineering Times suggests possible solutions including more widespread licensure, promoting the engineer's image and developing business and communication skills."&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fully implement its vision of civil engineering, the committee recommended that the policy focus on the core principle that

&lt;blockquote&gt;(A)dmission to the practice of civil engineering at the professional level occurs at licensure and requires a body of specialized knowledge as reflected by a combination of a baccalaureate degree and a master's degree or equivalent, appropriate experience, and a commitment to lifelong learning.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; (The reference to "specialized body of knowledge" later become the Civil Engineering body of knowledge.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Committee's report in addition to strategies also included recommendations for an implementation plan consisting of four major action items to implement the ASCE policy over the next twenty years:&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt;
* Continuous interaction with other stakeholders such as NCEES and ABET.
* Work with licensing jurisdictions to adopt the ASCE policy for a combination of a baccalaureate degree and a master's degree or equivalent, appropriate experience as a prerequisite for licensure. Part of that action item also encouraged the use of licensed civil engineers to manage civil engineering projects,&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; implicitly [[civil infrastructure]]. (Task 8)
* Encourage ASCE [[American Society of Civil Engineers#Institutes|practice institutes]] to promote the development of speciality certifications and encourage civil engineering's stakeholders to require participation of such certified engineers on projects.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt;

=== Committee on Academic Prerequisites for Professional Practice (2001-2004)  === 
In 2001, ASCE accepted the 1999 task committee recommendations on policy. ASCE also organized the Committee on Academic Prerequisites for Professional Practice on a temporary or task basis and charged it to "...develop, organize, and execute a detailed plan for the full implementation of the policy statement." &lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; In 2003, ASCE changed the committee from a task basis to a standing committee; acknowledging the effort will take many years.&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; The 1999 committee had in fact recommended a 20-year timeframe.&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; This is committee was also charged in 2003 with implementing another ASCE initiative, "Raise the bar".&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt; In 2004, the committee recommended changing the policy to reflect the society's belief that the body of knowledge necessary to practice of civil engineering at the professional level includes the "...knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be a licensed professional civil engineer." &lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt;  ASCE accepted those recommendations and in 2004 and modified its policy to state that "the attainment of a body of knowledge for entry into the practice of civil engineering at the professional level" .&lt;ref name="Smerdon_2007"/&gt;

=== ASCE Vision of Civil Engineering in 2025 (2007) ===
In 2006, the American Society of Civil Engineers convened a "Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering" in response to concerns for the future of the civil engineering profession.&lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"&gt;[http://ascelibrary.org/doi/book/10.1061/9780784478868 The Vision for Civil Engineering] in 2025 (2006), pg. 19, ISBN (PDF): 978-0-7844-7886-8, Publisher:American Society of Civil Engineers&lt;/ref&gt; This "...highly-varied group of civil engineers, engineers from other disciplines, architects, educators, association and society executives, and other leaders, including participants from eight countries outside the United States..." conceived of and developed its vision for civil engineers practicing in the global economy, in the year 2025 and then produced a report documenting that vision.&lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt; Their purpose was to produce an aspirational vision that addressed "... all levels and facets of the civil engineering community, that is, professional (licensed) civil engineers, non-licensed civil engineers, technologists, and technicians." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;  The aspirational vision produced was a civil engineering profession that was "(e)ntrusted by society to create a sustainable world and enhance the global quality of life, civil engineers serve competently, collaboratively, and ethically ..." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt; These civil engineers would practice using "...widely recognized and valued knowledge ... (and) ... skills" and attitudes.&lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;   Accomplishing this aspirational vision required these future professionals to possess attributes such as formal education, work experience, and professional achievement and attitudes supportive of orchestrating "... solutions to society's most pressing current needs while helping to create a more viable future." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;  In this vision, civil engineers function as "... planners, designers, constructors, and operators of society's economic and social engine—the built environment..." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt; The only way to accomplish that was for the  engineering profession to agree on  "...a  vision,  transform engineering education, present engineers as broad-based  technology  leaders,  accommodate  innovations  from non-engineering fields, and become more interdisciplinary." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAE2020"&gt;National  Academy  of  Engineering,  2004.  The  Engineer  of  2020: Visions  of  Engineering  in  the  New  Century,  National  Academies of  Sciences,  Washington,  D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; This vision also recognized an increasing requirement for the application of project management in civil engineering project due to increasing complexity and stakeholder expectations with respect to project delivery.&lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;

In discussing these future aspirations, the report also acknowledged the past efforts to reform engineering education noting that there had been "...broad changes to the academic prerequisites to professional practice..." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt; where future civil engineers must provide evidence of competency with "...the appropriate body of knowledge through education and experience." &lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;  The Summit report in conclusion observed that ASCE's civil engineering body of knowledge was now widely accepted and more importantly, would form the basis for establishing the requirements for formal education and pre-licensure experience for civil engineers.&lt;ref name="ASCEVision_2006"/&gt;

The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE) issued its Engineering Body of Knowledge (EBOK) in 2013.&lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"&gt;"Possible influences of the NSPE EBOK and the AAES/DOL engineering competency model (ECM) on the CEBOK3",  Walesh, S G, 2016 Jun 26, Published in Journal ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings.

=== Engineering Competency Model (2015) ===
The [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (DOL) in cooperation with the  [[American Association of Engineering Societies]] (AAES), issued its first edition of its Engineering Competency Model (ECM) in 2015.&lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt; These reports were five or more years after the Second Edition or (CEBOK2).&lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt; The Engineering Competency Model outlined  "...engineering knowledge, skills, and abilities (not attitudes) collectively referred to as competencies." &lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt; The model is depicted in the form of a pyramid with tiers of knowledge. Although the arrangement of the tiers was not intended to be hierarchical, nor to necessarily imply some skill sets were higher than others. "Instead, the model's tapered shape represents the increasing specialization and specificity of proficiencies covered. Its tiers are further divided into blocks that represent competency areas (i.e., groups of knowledge, skills, and abilities), which are defined using critical work functions and technical content." &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in cooperation with the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES) Engineering Competency Model (ECM) , 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These DOL engineering competencies were not meant to be discipline specific, nor linked to specific stages of professionals development or education and importantly, do not recognize licensure as a step to professional  practice.&lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt;  Competency models such as the ECM produced by the Department of Labor communicate a vision of business and industry requirements essential for the "...development of curriculum, skill assessment instruments, and certifications. " &lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt; The Engineering Competency Model as developed by the DOL "...identifies the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for workers to perform successfully in the field of engineering." &lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt; One commentator noted that the CEBOK2 lacked coverage in seven areas; namely, "...Client/Stakeholder Focus, Creative Thinking, Engineering Economics, Manufacturing and Construction, Operations and Maintenance, Quality Control and Quality Assurance, and Safety." &lt;ref name="Walesh_2016"/&gt;

==Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (CEBoK) ==
ASCE recognized in the 1999 Committee's work that a body of specialized knowledge was required for the practice of civil engineering.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt; This body of professional knowledge had four components: a technical and non-technical core knowledge elements, technical knowledge electives, and technical and non-technical learning to support an individual's career objectives.&lt;ref name="TCFPD"/&gt;
Creating a body of knowledge for the [[civil engineering]] profession was as complicated as any mega-project a civil engineer might attempt.&lt;ref name="ENR_260_9"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Debra K.|title=Civil Engineers Unveil Updated Road Map For Profession's Future Knowledge Journey|url=https://www.enr.com/articles/31482-civil-engineers-unveil-updated-road-map-for-profession-rsquo-s-future-knowledge-journey?v=preview|accessdate=12 November 2017|issue=Workforce Solutions; Pg. 40 Vol. 260 No. 9|publisher=Engineering News-Record|date=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipinski2005"/&gt;

== Current status ==
In the United States, the body of knowledge necessary to obtain a [[Professional Engineer|license]] to practice engineering is defined by the laws or regulations of each state or territory. Most states have a standard that is a four-step process. First, an individual must obtain a [[Bachelor's degree]] from a university program that is accredited by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]]. A two-step examination process administered by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] must be completed. The first eight-hour test is the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]; the second, also eight hours long, is the [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|Principles and Practice of Engineering exam]]. The other step is to work an [[apprenticeship]], usually of four years in length, under an already-licensed engineer. The second exam is generally the fourth and final step; the fundamentals exam can be taken before or after the apprenticeship in most states.

The first state to regulate the practice of engineering was Wyoming in 1907. After that, ASCE established a model law for licensure. The last state to pass licensure laws for engineers was Montana.&lt;ref name="AAWRE"&gt;[http://www.aawre.org/files/pdf/HistoryLicensureCPC.pdf Change Takes Time: The History of Licensure and Continuing Professional Competency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719175917/http://www.aawre.org/files/pdf/HistoryLicensureCPC.pdf |date=July 19, 2008 }}, American Academy of Water Resource Engineers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states now require [[Continuing education#Continuing education for professionals|continuing education]] to maintain a license to practice engineering. In 1979, Iowa became the first. Since then about half of the states have added continuing education to their engineering laws.&lt;ref name="AAWRE"/&gt;

{{further|Professional Engineer#United States|l1=Professional Engineer title in the United States}}

== Content the BOK ==
The body of knowledge defines twenty-four outcomes that make up the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to practice civil engineering. The outcomes are divided into three categories: foundational, technical, and professional, foundation, technical and professional. The body of knowledge uses [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives|Bloom's Taxonomy]] to outline the necessary level of achievement for each of the twenty-four outcomes.

== Implementation status ==
ASCE has formed the BOK Educational Fulfillment Committee (BOKEdFC) to focus on self-proposed changes that the professional organization believes needs to be made to engineering education. This committee is composed of representatives from universities with four-year civil engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/professional/rtbvol4no4_12_30_07.pdf ASCE Raise the Bar newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCEES considered the implementation of the BOK at their 2008 annual meeting and decided to establish a task force. The task force is provide an analysis of "(1) the potential educational, professional, regulatory, and economic impact of the master's or equivalent; and (2) any alternative solutions besides the master's or equivalent that could potentially address the challenge of better preparing engineering licensure candidates to enter the profession."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100505024407/http://www.ncees.org/About_NCEES/News/News_Pages/Message_from_ED_regarding_engineering_education_requirements.php NCEES press release], August 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Nebraska]] became the first to consider legislation requiring college-level education beyond the bachelor's degree as a requirement for a professional engineering license.&lt;ref name="enr road map"&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/news/work/archives/080312.asp ENR Magazine], Civil Engineers Unveil Updated Road Map For Profession's Future Knowledge Journey, March 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was not enacted, in part to testimony from engineering associations. The Nebraska section of the [[American Council of Engineering Companies]] stated that the new requirement might have made it more difficult for companies located in their state to hire and keep entry-level engineers.&lt;ref name="Nebraska Struggles"&gt;[http://www.nspe.org/PEmagazine/pe_0408_On_First_Attempt.html On First Attempt, Nebraska Struggles to Raise the Bar]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, PE magazine, April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[operating system]]s the office suites were designed to run on without [[emulator|emulation]]; for the given office suite/OS combination, there are five possibilities:
* ''No'' indicates that it does not exist or was never released.
* ''Partial'' indicates that while the office suite works, it lacks important functionality compared to versions for other OSs; it is still being developed however.
* ''Beta'' indicates that while a version of the office suite is fully functional and has been released, it is still in development (e.g. for stability).
* ''Yes'' indicates that the office suite has been officially released in a fully functional, stable version.
* ''Dropped'' indicates that while the office suite works, new versions are no longer being released for the indicated OS; the number in parentheses is the last known stable version which was officially released for that OS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17364">'''Contractual terms in English law''' is a topic which deals with four main issues. 

*which terms are incorporated into the contract
*how are the terms of the contract to be interpreted
*whether terms are implied into the contract
*what controls are placed on unfair terms

The terms of a contract are the essence of a contract, and tell you what the contract will do. For instance, the price of a good, the time of its promised delivery and the description of the good will all be terms of the contract.

==What are terms==
{{Contract law}}
A contractual "[a]ny provision forming part of a contract"&lt;ref&gt;Martin, E [ed] &amp; Law, J [ed], ''Oxford Dictionary of Law'', ed6 (2006, London:OUP).&lt;/ref&gt; Each term gives rise to a [[contract]]ual obligation, [[breach of contract|breach]] of which can give rise to [[lawsuit|litigation]]. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the [[contract]].

*'''Condition or Warranty'''.&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with a product warranty, which is always referred to as a 'guarantee' in [[law]].&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions are terms which go to the very root of a [[contract]]. [[Breach of Contract|Breach]] of these terms repudiate the [[contract]],allowing the other party to discharge the [[contract]]. A warranty is not so imperative so the [[contract]] will subsist after a [[Breach of Contract|breach]]. [[Breach of Contract|Breach]] of either will give rise to [[damages]].

It is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a [[contract]]. By way of illustration, an actress' obligation to perform the opening night of a [[theatre|theatrical]] production is a condition,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Poussard v Spiers and Pond]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 410&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a singers obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bettini v Gye]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statute]] may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty; for example the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] s15A&lt;ref&gt;As added by the Sale of Goods Act 1994 s4(1).&lt;/ref&gt; provides that terms as to title, description, quality and sample (as described in the [[Act of Parliament|Act]]) are conditions save in certain defined circumstances.

*'''Innominate term'''. [[Lord Diplock]], in ''[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1962] 1 All ER 474&lt;/ref&gt; created the concept of an innominate term, [[Breach of Contract|breach]] of which may or not go to the root of the [[contract]] depending upon the nature of the breach. [[Breach of Contract|breach]] of these terms, as with all terms, will give rise to damages. Whether or not it repudiates the [[contract]] depends upon whether [[legal benefit]] of the [[contract]] has been removed from the innocent party. Megaw LJ, in 1970, preferred the use of the classic categorising into condition or warranty due to [[legal certainty]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH]]'', ''[[The Mihalis Angelos]]'' [1970] 3 All ER 125.&lt;/ref&gt; This was interpreted by the House of Lords as merely restricting its application in ''[[Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 3 All ER 570&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status as a term===
Status as a term is important as a party can only take [[lawsuit|legal action]] for the non fulfillment of a term as opposed to representations or mere puffs. Legally speaking, only statements that amount to a term create contractual obligations. Statements can be split into the following types:
* '''Puff (sales talk):''' If no reasonable person hearing this statement would take it seriously, it is a puff, and no action in [[contract]] is available if the statement proves to be wrong. It may also be referred to as "puffery". This is common in [[television]] commercials.
* '''Representation:''' A representation is a statement of fact which does not amount to a term of the [[contract]] but it is one that the maker of the statement does not guarantee its truth. This gives rise to no contractual obligation but may amount to a [[tort]], for example [[misrepresentation]].
* '''Term:''' A term is similar to a representation, but the truth of the statement is guaranteed by the person who made the statement therefore giving rise to a contractual obligation. For the purposes of [[Breach of Contract]] a term may further be categories as a condition, warranty or innominate term.

There are various factors that a [[court]] may take into account in determining the nature of a statement. These include:
* '''Timing:''' If the [[contract]] was concluded soon after the statement was made, this is a strong indication that the statement induced the person to enter into the [[contract]]. Lapse of a week within the negotiations of a [[car]] sale was held to amount only to a representation in ''[[Routledge v McKay]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1954] 1 All ER 855&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Content of statement:''' It is necessary to consider what was said in the given context, which has nothing to do with the importance of a statement.
* '''Knowledge and expertise:''' In ''[[Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1957] 1 WLR 370&lt;/ref&gt; a person selling a [[car]] to a [[second-hand]] [[car]] dealer stated that it was a 1948 [[Morris Motors|Morris]], when in fact it was a 1939 model car. It was held that the statement did not become a term because a reasonable person in the position of the car dealer would not have thought that an inexperienced person would have guaranteed the truth of the statement.
* '''Reduction into Writing:''' Where the [[contract]] is consolidated into writing, previous spoken terms, omitted from the consolidation, will probably be relegated to representations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge v McKay]]'' [1954] 1 All ER 855&lt;/ref&gt; The old case of ''[[Birch v Paramount Estates Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1856) 16 EG 396&lt;/ref&gt; provided that a very important spoken term may persist even if omitted from the written consolidation; this case concerned the quality of a residential house.

The [[parol evidence rule]] limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a [[contract]]. This rule has practically ceased operation under [[UK]] [[law]], but remains functional in Australian Law.

==Implied terms==
{{main|Implied terms in English law}}
A term may either be expressed or implied. An Express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the [[contract]].

===Terms implied in fact===
The [[Privy Council]] established a five stage test in ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd  v Shire of Hastings]]'':&lt;ref name="BP Refinery"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]] |year=1977 |court=UKPC |num=13 |format=1 |parallelcite=(1977) 180 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Reasonableness and equitableness:''' The implied term must be reasonable and equitable.
# '''Business efficacy:''' The implied term must be necessary for the business efficacy of the contract. For instance, if the term simply causes the [[contract]] to operate better, that does not fit this criterion. This is the principle laid out in ''[[The Moorcock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1889)14 P.D. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding [[judge]] created a quaint concept of an ''officious bystander''; if the ''officious bystander'' were to propose a term and both the parties would be likely to reply "oh, of course", the term is implied.
# '''Obviousness:''' The term is so obvious that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be one and only one thing that would be implied by the parties. For example, in ''[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales]]'',&lt;ref name=Codelfa&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1982|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto |date=11 May 1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a term regarding the inability of construction company to work three shifts a day could not be implied because it was unclear what form it would have taken. In [[English Law]], This principle was established in the case of ''[[Spring v NASDS]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1956] 1 W.L.R. 585&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of a [[Trade Union]] membership contract.
# '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression. No specific technical knowledge should be required.
# '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term.

In [[Australia]], the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] has ruled that the test in [[BP|BP Refinery]] applies only to [[formal contract]]s, while the test in ''[[Byrne and Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1995|litigants=[[Byrne and Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1995) 185 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 410 |courtname=auto |date=11 October 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; shall apply to [[informal contract]]s:
* '''Necessity:''' The term must be necessary to ensure ''reasonable'' or ''effective'' operation of a [[contract]] of the nature before the [[court]].
* '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term (same as for formal contracts).
* '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression (same as for formal contracts).
* '''Obvious:''' McHugh and Gummow JJ have stated that it must also be obvious.

===Terms implied in law===
These are terms that have been implied into standardised relationships.

'''Common law'''.

*''[[Liverpool City Council v Irwin]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 2 WLR 562&lt;/ref&gt; established a term to be implied into all contracts between tenant and landlord that the landlord is obliged to keep the common areas in a reasonable state of repair.
*''[[Wong Mee Wan v Kwan Kin Travel Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1995] 4 All ER 745&lt;/ref&gt; established that when a tour operator contracts to for the sale of goods. The most important [[legislation]] under [[United Kingdom]] [[law]] is the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000]] and the [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]] which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided.

These terms will be implied into all [[contract]]s of the same nature as a matter of [[law]].

'''Statutory'''.

The rules by which many [[contract]]s are governed are provided in specialized [[statute]]s that deal with particular subjects. Most [[Country|countries]], for example, have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. For example, each [[U.S. state|American state]] except [[Louisiana]] has adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which regulates contracts for the sale of goods.&lt;ref&gt;For links and comparison among states on the adoption of the UCC, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/ucc.html Cornell Law Uniform Laws].&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[legislation]] implying terms under [[United Kingdom]] [[law]] are the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000]] and the [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]] which imply terms into all [[contract]]s whereby goods are sold or services provided.

===Terms implied by custom or trade===
One is generally bound by the custom of the industry that one is in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, one must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1986|litigants=[[Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 226 |courtname=auto |date=11 April 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Frigaliment Importing Co Ltd v BNS International Sales Corp]]'', 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (plaintiff failed to prove what he meant by "chicken") and U.C.C. § 1-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Course of dealing===
If two parties have regularly conduct business on certain terms, the terms may be assumed to be same for each [[contract]] made, if not expressly agreed to the contrary. The parties must have dealt on numerous occasions and been aware of the term purported to be implied. In ''[[Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1972] QB 71&lt;/ref&gt; four occasions over five years was held to be sufficient. In ''[[British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1975] QB 303&lt;/ref&gt; written terms were held to have been implied into an oral in which there was no mention of written terms.

===Good faith===
{{Main|Good faith}}
It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a [[Heads of Agreement (law)|heads of agreement]] document that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, [[Australian]] [[court]]s will imply an obligation to negotiate in [[good faith]] provided that certain conditions are satisfied&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd]]'' (1991) 24 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 1. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=24%20NSWLR%201 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Negotiations were well-advanced and the large proportion of terms have been worked out; and
* There exists some mechanism to resolve disputes if the negotiations broke down.

The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonably. There is no general obligation to act in good faith term under [[English contract law]]: an attempt was made by [[Lord Denning]] in a series of case during the 70s and 80s but they are no longer considered 'good law'. European legislation imposes this duty, but only in certain circumstances.  For the circumstances when an obligation of good faith may in certain circumstances be implied see Yam Seng PTE Ltd v International Trade Corporation Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/111.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]&lt;ref&gt;SI 1999/2083&lt;/ref&gt; reg 8 will render ineffective any 'unfair' contractual term if made between a seller or supplier and a consumer.&lt;ref&gt;For definitions, see reg 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
Regulation 5 of the [[Statutory Instrument]] further elaborates upon the concept of 'unfair', which is rather novel to [[England|English]] law. 'Unfair' is a term that was not individually negotiated (i.e. [[standard form contract|standard form]]) that "causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the [[contract]] to the detriment of the consumer".&lt;ref&gt;[[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] reg 5(1)&lt;/ref&gt; This is not possible if the term is not contrary to 'good faith'; such as in ''[[Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2001] 3 WLR 1297&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the lack of a seemingly unfair [[interest]] term would leave the bank open to a very poor deal whereby no [[interest]] could be charged.

=="Subject to" contracts==
If a [[contract]] specifies "subject to contract", it may fall into one of three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=[[Masters v Cameron]] |year=1954 |court=HCA |num=72 |parallelcite=(1954) 91 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a formalised contract that will not have a different effect; or
# The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formalised contract; or
# It is merely an agreement to agree, and the deal will not be concluded until the formalised [[contract]] has been drawn up.
Subsequent authorities have been willing to recognize a fourth category in addition to those stated in ''Masters v Cameron''.&lt;ref name="Baulkham Hills Private Hospital"&gt;''Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v GR Securities Pty Ltd'' (1986) 40 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 622 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=(1986)%2040%20NSWLR%20622 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
#&lt;li value="4"&gt;The parties intend to immediately bound by the terms agreed upon and expect to create a further contract as a replacement for the initial contract which will contain additional terms (if agreed upon).&lt;/li&gt;
If a [[contract]] specifies "subject to finance", it imposes obligations on the purchaser:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=[[Meehan v Jones]] |year=1982 |court=HCA |num=52 |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 571}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The purchaser must seek finance; and
* When offers of finance arrive, the purchaser must make a decision as to whether the offers of finance are suitable.

This may also refer to contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.
Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a [[contract]]
With conditions subsequent, parties have to perform until the condition is not met.
Failure of a condition repudiates the [[contract]] this is not to necessarily discharge it.  Repudiation will always gives rise to an [[Lawsuit|action]] for damages.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">The '''Corpus Christianorum''' ('''CC''') is a major publishing undertaking of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] publisher [[Brepols Publishers]] devoted to [[patristic]] and [[medieval Latin]] texts. The principal series are the ''Series Graeca'' (CCSG), ''Series Latina'' (CCSL), and the ''Continuatio Mediævalis'' (CCCM). There is also a smaller section, the ''Series Apocryphorum'' (CCSA), devoted to [[Apocryphal]] works, and a collection of autographs, the ''Autographa Medii Ævi'' (CCAMA). In the series ''Conciliorum Oecumenicorum Generaliumque Decreta'' (COGD) is published confessional documents from  Churches and Ecumenical organisations in the World with start in [[Nicæa]] 325 until today.  The principal series are seen in some ways as successors to [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s [[Patrologia]]e.

In 1947 Dom Eligius Dekkers, O.S.B. of the Sint-Pietersabdij in Steenbrugge, drew up a plan for editing afresh early Christian texts. His intention was to produce in a short timespan a "Corpus Christianorum", comprising new editions of the writings of Christian authors from Tertullian through to the Venerable Bede. Although some critics thought the project to be impracticable, Dom Eligius found support from the outset in Brepols Publishers from Turnhout. Collaboration started in 1951 with the publication of a highly valued and essential tool, the Clavis Patrum Latinorum, which paved the way for the future success of the series. New editions followed from 1953 on and ever since Corpus Christianorum has continued to flourish. New series within Corpus Christianorum have been established and new volumes were ever more regularly published. Although in the early years the modus laborandi relied on updating existing editions, this was soon replaced by the preparation of entirely new critical editions. This demanding ambition required increasing supervision and, together with the establishment of new Corpus-related initiatives, it has been necessary to establish new academic partnerships, comprising leading scholars and academic centres, to supervise every single Corpus series.

{{ref-improve|date=March 2016}}

The '''''Encyclopaedia Cambrensis''''' or '''''Y Gwyddoniadur Cymreig'''''  was the most ambitious [[encyclopedia]] in the [[Welsh language]]. It was published in ten volumes between 1854 and 1879 by [[Thomas Gee]] on his press in the town of [[Denbigh]], [[Gwasg Gee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=1&amp;coll_id=175&amp;expand Gee Printing Company Records]&lt;/ref&gt; The general editor was [[John Parry (editor)|John Parry]], Gee's brother in-law and lecturer at the [[Coleg y Bala|College of Bala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-PARR-JOH-1812.html PARRY , JOHN] at the [[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the largest paper publication in Welsh today.

The project cost for Gee was about [[Pound sterling|£]]20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-GEE0-THO-1815.html|title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=yba.llgc.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311225357/http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-GEE0-THO-1815.html|archive-date=2018-03-11|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was a huge sum at that time which amounts to about £1,000,000 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cylchgrawnbarn.com/index.php?tudalen=219&amp;PHPSESSID=4adcebc1e7af965f32798ea0a00d9c48 ''Barn''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213073750/http://www.cylchgrawnbarn.com/index.php?tudalen=219&amp;PHPSESSID=4adcebc1e7af965f32798ea0a00d9c48 |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The ''Encyclopaedia Cambrensis'' includes nearly 9,000 pages in double columns. While the number of articles relating to the [[Bible]] and theology is significantly higher than expected in such a reference work today, it also includes a large number of biographical articles, articles on [[Welsh history]] and [[Welsh literature|literature]], [[science]], [[geography]] and other [[Celtic nations]].

Among the numerous contributors were [[Owen Morgan Edwards]] and [[John Morris-Jones]]. The article that the latter contributed on the Welsh language was used as a basis for his ''A Welsh Grammar, Historical and Comparative''.

The '''Enderun School''' ([[Ottoman language|Ottoman Turkish]]: اندرون مکتب, ''Enderûn Mektebi'') was a [[palace school]] and [[boarding school]] mostly for the [[Janissaries]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which primarily recruited students via ''[[devşirme]]'',&lt;ref name="MalekianNordlöf2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farhad Malekian|author2=Kerstin Nordlöf|title=The Sovereignty of Children in Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTYsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249|date=17 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-3673-9|pages=249–}}&lt;/ref&gt; a system of the Islamization of Christian children for serving the Ottoman government in bureaucratic, managerial, and [[Janissary]] military positions.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal H Karpat "Social Change and Politics in Turkey: A Structural-Historical Analysis" page 204&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the Enderun School was fairly successful in creating [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|Ottoman statesmen]] by drawing among the empire's various ethnic groups and giving them a common Muslim education. The school was run by the "Inner Service" (''[[Enderûn]]'') of the Ottoman palace and had both academic and military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;https://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/471488/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh&lt;/ref&gt; The graduates were expected to devote themselves to government service and be free of links to lower social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal H Karpat "Social Change and Politics in Turkey: A Structural-Historical Analysis" page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The growth of Ottoman Empire is attributed and was dependent on the selection and education of statesmen. A vital component of Mehmet II's goal to revive the Roman Empire was to establish a special school to select the best youngsters within the Empire and to mold them for government. Mehmet II improved the existing palace school founded by his father, Murat II and established the Enderun Academy (Enderun) in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;Corlu, M. S., Burlbaw, L.M., Capraro, R.

==Buildings==
The [[Topkapı Palace#Third Courtyard|third courtyard]] of the [[Topkapı Palace]] was surrounded by the Imperial Treasury, the [[Sacred Relics (Topkapı Palace)|Pavilion of the Holy Mantle]], and the buildings of the [[Palace School]], which educated the top tier of students from Enderun as well as princes of the [[House of Osman]]. There were seven halls or grades within the Palace School, and within each hall there were 12 teachers responsible for the students' mental and academic development. Students wore special uniforms designated by their achievement level,&lt;ref&gt;Deri, M. (2009). Osmanlı Devletini cihan devleti yapan kurum: Enderun Mektebi. Populer Tarih. Retrieved from http://www.populertarih.com/osmanli-devletini-cihan-devleti-yapan-kurum-enderun-mektebi/&lt;/ref&gt; and Miller indicated that additional buildings included the library, mosque, music conservatories, dormitories, and baths.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, B. (1973). The palace school of Muhammad the Conqueror (Reprint ed.). NY: Arno Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The Enderun system consisted of three preparatory schools located outside of the palace in addition to the one within the palace walls itself. According to Miller,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, B. (1973). The palace school of Muhammad the Conqueror (Reprint ed.). NY: Arno Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there were 1,000-2,000 students in three Enderun Colleges, and about 300 students in the top school in the Palace. The curriculum was divided into five main divisions:&lt;ref&gt;Ipsirli, M. (1995). Enderun. In Diyanet Islam ansiklopedisi  (Vol. XI, pp. 185–187). Istanbul, Turkey: Turkiye Diyanet Vakfi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akkutay, U. (1984). Enderun mektebi. Ankara, Turkey: Gazi Üniversitesi Eğitim Fak.

* Islamic sciences; including Arabic, Turkish and Persian language education
* Positive sciences; mathematics, geography
* History, law, and administration: the customs of the Palace and government issues
* Vocational studies, including art and music education
* Physical training, including weaponry

At the end of the Enderun school system, the graduates would be able to speak, read, and write at least three languages, able to understand the latest developments in science, have at least a craft or art, and excel in army command as well as in close combat skills.

== Çıkma ==

The graduation ceremony for students leaving the Enderun School was known as çıkma.&lt;ref name="Murphey2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphey|first=Rhoads|title=Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty: Tradition, Image and Practice in the Ottoman Imperial Household, 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZCQlHyjGygC&amp;pg=PA345|date=20 October 2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-0251-5|page=345|quote=...exiting from the palace service (çıkma)...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduates themselves were referred as çıkma.&lt;ref name="́gostonMasters2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=́goston|first1=Ga ́bor A|last2=Masters|first2=Bruce Alan|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA452|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Türk dünyası kültür atlası: The Seljuk period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3U_AQAAIAAJ|publisher=Türk Kültürüne Hizmet Vakfı, Turkish Cultural Service Foundation|page=207|quote=After a set period of training and instruction, most of the graduates (Çıkma) were assigned to mil- itary units; the very ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name çıkma literary means "leaving" or "pulling out".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20152">'''Florence Annie Conybeare''' (13 September 1872 – 29 February 1916) was a British campaigner for the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement.&lt;ref name="Objections"&gt;''Women's Suffrage: Some Objections Answered'', an article written by Florence A.V. Conybeare, in [https://archive.org/stream/commonwealthempi14londuoft#page/282/mode/2up ''The Commonwealth &amp; Empire Review''], 1908, pp 282-287.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a fundraiser and [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) worker during the [[First World War]], and an active member of the [[Women's Liberal Federation]].

==Background==

===Bohemian glass merchant's daughter===
Florence Conybeare was born '''Florence Annie Strauss''' on 13 September 1872 at 10 St. Johns Villas, Brixton Road, [[Brixton]], London. She was the eldest daughter of Gustave Strauss,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Born 'Gustavus'.&lt;/ref&gt; a successful German-speaking [[Bohemian glass]] merchant &lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Birth_certificate_of_Florence_Annie_Strauss.PNG Birth certificate], 23 October 1872, General Register Office, Southport, England.&lt;/ref&gt; and patented inventor,&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;''Pottery Gazette'', 1 August 1890. Apparatus for producing glass tube for use in making large beads, Patent No. 49,659, Class XXXIII; refers to birthplace of inventor.&lt;/ref&gt; who emigrated to Britain and later became a naturalised British subject. Florence's father was born in 1843 in [[Gablonz]],&lt;ref name="Patent" /&gt; North [[Bohemia]], a town in the Czech Republic known for glass and jewellery production. Florence's mother was Frances Lehmaier (b. 1852 New York, USA; d. 1893 London, England). Florence was the elder sister of Bernard Edwin Strauss (born 1874) and Lily Julia Strauss (1877-1955), who later married [[George May, 1st Baron May]], and became Lady Lily Julia May, 1st Baroness of Weybridge.

==Early years==

===1881: Bleak House, Brixton===
In 1881, Florence (8) was living with her father (38) and mother (29) in ''Bleak House'', 7 Elgin Gardens, Effra Road, Brixton, in the [[London Borough of Lambeth|Borough of Lambeth]], London. She lived there with her brother Bernard Edwin (6 yrs) and sister Lily (4 yrs). Their household was run by four domestic servants and a cook.&lt;ref&gt;The 1881 England Census, Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1891: Kensington===
By 3 April 1891, aged 18, Florence Strauss had moved to 2 West Bolton Gardens, [[Kensington]], London—with her parents. No-one is listed as head of the household on that day as her parents were not present for census purposes. There were six servants looking after the household.&lt;ref&gt;The 1891 England Census, Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==

On 15 October 1896, Florence Annie Strauss, a twenty-four-year-old spinster from [[West Kensington]], married the 43-year-old bachelor, former Liberal MP for Camborne, Cornwall, and practising barrister, [[Charles Augustus Vansittart Conybeare]]. The marriage was conducted in accordance with to the rites and ceremonies of the Theistic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Marriage_certificate_of_Florence_Annie_Strauss_and_Charles_Augustus_Vansittart_Conybeare.PNG  Marriage certificate], 15 October 1896, General Register Office, Southport, England.&lt;/ref&gt; The service was officiated by [[Charles Voysey (theist)|Charles Voysey]], a freethinking Yorkshire vicar who was deposed for publishing heretical sermons and for denying the doctrine of everlasting hell. The church was situated in [[Swallow Street]], Piccadilly, in the District of [[Westminster]], London. Florence's brother and sister, Bernard and Lily, also got married in the same Theistic Church in 1900 and 1903, respectively.&lt;ref name="Zimapan"&gt;''The Zimapanners'' website, researched and published by Peter King Smith, 2010. [Note: Please do not add a hyperlink to this website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage settlement&lt;ref name="Zimapan"/&gt;===
On marriage, Florence Conybeare became the 'beneficial owner' of, among other properties, the ''Tregullow Offices'', a small dwelling and former mine office &lt;ref group=note&gt;The property was owned by, and lived in by, Sir William Robert Williams, 3rd Baronet of Tregullow, Cornwall, whose great grandfather was the mining mogul who built ''Scorrier House'' in 1778, built the Plymouth breakwater with the Fox family, controlled the copperbelt and copper smelting works in Swansea, developed the harbour at Portreath and linked it to the mineral tramway, which was used to deliver timber and supplies to mines and transported valuable minerals back down to the sea.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Scorrier]] in the County of Cornwall, as part of a marriage settlement which her husband, Charles A.V. Conybeare, arranged with various parties including the wealthy merchant banker [[Isaac Seligman]]. The marriage settlement was effected by means of a '''Deed of Trust''' signed by three moneylenders, two of whom had attended the same public school as Charles Conybeare: [[Tonbridge School]], in Kent, and one family member (uncle). "In those days, a marriage settlement was settled upon the marriage." &lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;Ian K. Nelson, conveyancing solicitor at the law firm of Nelson Nichols, Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Such settlements can be compared to prenuptials and should not be confused with financial settlements made on the dissolution of a marriage. In those days, it was a convenient way for a husband-to-be to make adequate financial provision for his wife-to-be. This prevented a wife from otherwise becoming destitute as a result of the husband deserting his wife, or from having to resort to prostitution in order to support herself.

==== 1896 Deed of Trust&lt;ref name="Zimapan"/&gt;====

&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On 11 March 1891, Florence's husband Charles Conybeare conveyed various properties &lt;ref group=note&gt;The 1901 Conveyance, which refers back to the Indenture (conveyance) of 1891, records the words ''inter alia'', which indicates that several properties were involved in the original loan, not just the ''Tregullow Offices''.&lt;/ref&gt; by way of a mortgage to William Henry Luard Pattisson and to the parties referred to in Point 2 of the 1896 Deed of Trust. In this mortgage arrangement, Charles Conybeare was able to secure a loan of ₤3,000 from his moneylenders, using the properties as collateral for the loan and the repayment of interest on the outstanding loan.

[[File:Transcription of first page of 1902 Conveyance between Conybeares &amp; CRWilliams.png|thumb|left|Transcription of first page of 1902 Conveyance between Conybeares &amp; CRWilliams]]

'''Deed of Trust'''&lt;br&gt;
On 14 October 1896, the day before Florence got married, Charles A. V. Conybeare placed those "various properties" including the ''Tregullow Offices'' (known together as "the estate") in trust—which properties were still subject to a mortgage—to Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (Charles's brother and JP) and merchant banker [[Isaac Seligman]]. As a result, Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the legal owners and trustees of the estate. This construction enabled Charles Conybeare to confer financial benefits to Florence Conybeare, so that when parts of the estate were sold, she would be entitled to a share of the proceeds. The Deed of Trust that was drawn up to make this possible, recognised four interested parties:
1. Charles A.V. Conybeare (husband and trustor).
2. Jacob Luard Pattisson (civil servant), James Jollie Pattisson (teacher) and Bixby Garnham Luard (vicar and uncle to the first two): the mortgagees (read: moneylenders).
3. Charles A.V. Conybeare and Florence Annie Conybeare (beneficial owners).
4. Isaac Seligman and Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (legal owners and trustees).

"Although Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the owners of the legal estate the moment it was conveyed to them in 1896, they never actually owned the properties themselves. They simply held on to the properties in trust as part of a marriage settlement, and were only entitled to act on the couple's instructions",&lt;ref name="settlement"/&gt; not independently of them.

'''Florence sells property interest'''&lt;br&gt;
On 21 July 1902, Florence Conybeare was a co-signatory to the ''1902 Deed of Conveyance'' (Indenture) which instructed Isaac Seligman and Henry Conybeare to sell her beneficial interest in &lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt; of the estate's properties, namely, the ''Tregullow Offices''. In doing so, she effectively sold that property with her husband, for ₤170, to a mining engineer called Charles Rule Williams, who had recently returned from Mexico after working 15 years in silver mines at Zimapan. The new owner changed the name of the property to ''Zimapan Villa''.

===Marital homes===
Florence and Charles Conybeare lived the first part of their married life in the fashionable part of London at No. 3 Carlyle Mansions, [[Cheyne Walk, Chelsea]], in a flat overlooking the Thames. She lived very close to another Women's Rights campaigner, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], who lived down the road at No. 120 Cheyne Walk. In 1891, Florence and Charles Conybeare MP [[Camborne, Cornwall]], moved to Tregullow House, [[Scorrier]], Cornwall, a country pile owned by John Williams the 5th, a direct descendant of the Williams mining-moguls' dynasty. She remained there in Cornwall until at least 1902.&lt;ref name="Zimapan" /&gt; The couple later moved to ''Oakfield Park'' in [[Dartford]], Kent.

==Women's suffrage==

===1907: Women's Enfranchisement Bill===
[[File:NUWSS poster.PNG|right|thumb|NUWSS poster]]
Florence Conybeare was an active organiser, supporter and voice within the Women’s Suffrage movement.&lt;ref name="Yesterday"&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Florence_conybeare_yesterday%27s_town_dartford_geoff_porteus_1981.PNG  ''Yesterday's Town: Dartford''], by Geoff Porteus, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Conybeare had supported Mr. W.H. Dickenson's&lt;ref group=note&gt;Liberal MP for St Pancras.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Women%27s_Suffrage_Movement,_A_Reference_Guide_1866_to_1928.PNG Women's Enfranchisement Bill] which received its first reading on 8 March 1907. Up till then, married women living in the same house were not regarded as 'joint owners' of that property in the eyes of the law. The Dickenson Bill proposed that husband and wife living under the same roof should both be considered as 'joint occupiers' of the property which, as a consequence, would give married women equal status with men and the right to vote.

===1908: Women's Suffrage: A Liberal Principle===
In her ‘treatise’ ''Some Objections Answered'' published in 1908,&lt;ref name="Objections"/&gt; in which she claimed that "Women’s Suffrage is essentially a Liberal principle", Florence Conybeare (aka: Mrs C.A.V. Conybeare) wrote a reply to an article written by Edith Calkin,&lt;ref&gt;Edith Calkin's article "Votes for Women", published in ''The Commonwealth and Empire Review''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.ca/The-Commonwealth-Empire-Review-Volume-14/207969/141#136 ''The Commonwealth and Empire Review''] Vol. XIV, Sep. 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the women critics of Women’s Suffrage. She rebuked Calkin for wanting to deny women political recognition and argued why women should be given the right to vote, and aired her objections to Edith Calkin’s approach to women's rights.

'''The inequities of legislation'''
* Florence Conybeare referred to Mr Dickenson's 'Women's Suffrage Bill of 1907' [ed. ''Women’s Enfranchisement Bill''], which, if passed, would treat married women as 'joint occupier' of a dwelling, and chided Calkin for ignoring recent legislative developments concerning Women's Suffrage.
* Conybeare believed that all women should be eligible to vote, irrespective of any 'property qualification'. 
* It was not right that women who paid rates and taxes had no right to decide how money is spent; taxation and representation belonged together. 
* The ''Married Woman’s Property Act of 1882'', she wrote, was "very unsatisfactory for women", especially given the fact that married woman typically ran 16-hour days multitasking for their husbands, and any savings a woman made while running a home were the property of her husband.
* The Law of Divorce "treated men and women differently, making it far easier for a husband to divorce his wife than for a wife to rid herself of a bad husband". 
* She objected to married women being barred from voting in municipal elections. 
* Women should be allowed to vote so they can help run the country, and pointed to the "very active part" women have played in the country's political life, and said that the last General Election [ed. 1906] "had been fought as much by men as women", thanks to the Women’s Liberal Associations and the Primrose League, whose work had been used by all the political parties.

'''The plight of working women'''
* Conybeare rebukes Calkin's claim that women's place is in the home, and for failing to address the issue of women's pay.
* Conybeare defined 'sweated labour' as "a woman who is paid less than a man for the same work".
* While highlighting the drudgery of working women, Conybeare asserted that "women of leisure have a duty to fight for the rights of the working woman".
* She urged working women to unite and lobby for Women’s Suffrage because it was not only for their own good, but also because it would "raise the status of working women", especially as "the status of the poorest class of male worker had vastly improved" once he had been granted the right to vote in 1884".

===1913: Suffragist meeting at Dartford===
On 24 July 1913, a meeting of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] was held in a meadow in Bullace Lane where the Australian suffragist, Miss [[Muriel Matters]], had been invited to address a gathering on the subject of [[votes for women]]. The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895. Florence kicked off the meeting by mounting the wagon which was being used as a stage. Her introduction made it clear that they were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from ''The Calm Before the Storm: Dartford 1900-1914'', by Dr Mike Still, Curator of the Dartford Borough Museum, 2014, based on a newspaper article in the ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newspaper_article_on_Suffragist_Meeting_published_in_the_Dartford_Chronicle_%26_District_Times.PNG Dartford Chronicle &amp; District Times]'', 1 August 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speech: Australian vs. British suffragism'''

Muriel Matters, who had been sentenced to a month in [[Holloway Prison]] for obstruction, having earlier chained herself to a grille in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], arrived by car with her entourage, as part of a publicity tour around the area, termed a 'pilgrimage'. In her speech, she contrasted the situation in this country with that in Australia where women already had the vote [ed. in 1902, see [[Women's suffrage in Australia]]], pointing out that women in Britain were being treated in the same way as criminals, foreigners and lunatics, despite having to pay taxes.

The journalist who reported on the event believed that most people who turned up for the meeting were not actually interested in votes for women at all, but had instead come to witness any trouble if there was any. The only violence on the day of the Dartford meeting, however, was a stone which was thrown at the wagon from a neighbouring backyard, but no damage was caused. At the end of the speech, Florence Conybeare invited Councillor W.H.D. King to give the vote of thanks. He said that he felt ashamed that he had the vote while they did not, but thanked the party for recognising Dartford as a place of importance worth visiting.

==Civic work==
[[File:VAD recruitment poster.PNG|right|thumb| VAD Recruitment poster World War I]]

===Voluntary Aid Detachment===
Florence Conybeare was actively engaged in [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] work at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], London. On 13 January 1916, when Lady Henry Grosvenor held a meeting at the new [[YMCA]] Hut at Dartford, Florence was present in VAD uniform. "Whatever she took up, Mrs Conybeare did thoroughly and with a will".&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;Obituary in the ''Dartford Chronicle'', March 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundraising for the Western Front===
Florence Conybeare was actively involved in fundraising in Dartford during the First World War. "As the grim reality developed in France, an appeal went out from Florence Conybeare, to 'all Florence's'.&lt;ref name="Yesterday" /&gt; Her plan was to raise money to purchase and equip an ambulance which would be sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] which would be used to move wounded British soldiers—referred to as "the devoted sons of our Empire" on [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Memorial_florence_a_c.PNG Florence's memorial stone]—from the battlegrounds back to the field hospitals. Not only did she want this done, she wanted volunteers called "Florences" to "man" the ambulance in France! She managed to raise the money, but she never got her wish to man the ambulance with Florence's.&lt;ref&gt;''Dartford and The Great War'', Gethyn Rees, 1998, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Liberal Association===
Florence was President of the Dartford Women's Liberal Association [ed. Federation], and had largely been responsible for the setting up and running of the Babies Club.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

==Last days==
[[File:Memorial florence a c.PNG|thumb|Florence Annie Conybeare's Memorial, 1916]]
Florence Conybeare died at her father's home in 2 West Bolton Gardens, Kensington, London, on 29 February 1916, aged 43.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Florence's father, Gustave Strauss, died three months later on 5 June 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; She left no issue. During the preceding 18 months, she had been in failing health, but no-one had anticipated her sudden demise from pneumonia. Her husband, Charles Conybeare, was unfortunately at Canterbury at the time.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Death certificate, 29 February 1916, General Register Office, Southport, England.&lt;/ref&gt; Florence was cremated and a memorial service was held for her in London. She was buried in the cemetery of [http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-373627-church-of-st-mary-the-virgin-ingatestone/photos St Mary the Virgin Church], [[Fryerning]], Ingatestone, Essex, and lies close to Charles Conybeare's parents. Charles Conybeare had a large obelisk-shaped memorial erected in her memory, which is mounted upon a square stone plinth,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Charles Conybeare followed Florence three years later, on 18 February 1919. His ashes lie in the same tomb as Florence's.&lt;/ref&gt; and devised the following poignant inscription:

===Memorial===
''Here rest the ashes of Florence Annie''&lt;br /&gt;
''The beloved wife of Charles Augustus Vansittart Conybeare''&lt;br /&gt;
''Late of 'Tregullow', Cornwall''&lt;br /&gt;
''Who gave her life in devoted service to the gallant sons of our Empire''&lt;br /&gt;
''She passed into immortality''&lt;br /&gt;
''on February 29th 1916''&lt;br /&gt;
''aged 43''&lt;br /&gt;
''She is not dead''

==Afterword==
On 18 August 1916, [[probate]] was granted on Florence Conybeare's will in London to her husband Charles A.V. Conybeare. Florence died a wealthy lady, leaving effects totalling £5,392 6s 2d, which in today's money [2010] is equivalent to £232,193.&lt;ref&gt;National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills &amp; Administrations), 1861-1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">The '''Global Address List''' ('''GAL''') is an electronic shared address book which contains usually all people of given organization (company, school etc.). This address book is accessed over the computer network using [[LDAP]] protocol, [[CardDAV]] or some other electronic means.

The GAL is usually read-only for users. Only administrators add or update the items. Users can search it, look up other people (employees, students, members etc.) and obtain information such as their e-mail address, phone number, work position, and office location.

A common usage of GAL is if the user is writing an e-mail, and knows the recipient's name, but doesn't know their e-mail address. The application, such as an e-mail client (e.g. [[SOGo]], [[Zimbra]] or [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]), can look up the e-mail address in the GAL while the user has written only a part of the recipient's name.

==Certificates and encryption==


LDAP directory can be used also for distribution of user certificates ([[X.509]], [[OpenPGP]]). So user can query the GAL not only for contact information but also for digital certificate of other users – in order to send them e.g. encrypted e-mails.

'''Google Dictionary''' is an online dictionary service of [[Google]] that can be accessed by using the ''"define"'' operator and other similar phrases{{NoteTag|Such as "meaning of [word]"; "spelling of [word]" etc. or simply "dictionary" for the English dictionary.&lt;ref name="goog"&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts &amp; info, dictionary, unit conversions, &amp; more - Google Home Help |url=https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7029487?hl=en |website=support.google.com |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apol"/&gt;}} in [[Google Search]].&lt;ref name="apol"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/07/21/google-search-upgrades-dictionary-card-separate-search-box-autocomplete-history/|title=Google Search upgrades its dictionary card with a separate search box, autocomplete, and history|date=2017-07-21|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available in [[Google Translate]] and in the form of an [[Browser extension|extension]] for [[Google Chrome]].The dictionary content is licensed from [[Oxford University Press]]'s [[OxfordDictionaries.com]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/23/oxford-english-dictionary-can-worlds-biggest-dictionary-survive-internet|title=Inside the OED: can the world’s biggest dictionary survive the internet?|last=Dickson|first=Andrew|date=2018-02-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|quote=Google, which – through a deal with Oxford Dictionaries – offers thumbnail definitions, audio recordings of pronunciations, etymology, a graph of usage over time and translation facilities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ox"/&gt; It is available in different languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. The service also contains pronunciation audio, Google Translate, word origin chart, [[Google Ngram Viewer|Ngram Viewer]], and word games among other features for the English language version.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=define+apple#duf3=0,duf3-4,d3s|title=define apple - Google Search|last=|first=|date=|website=[[google.com]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally available as a standalone service it was integrated into Google Search with the separate service being discontinued in August 2011.

Some words previously available in the English dictionary (and still available on OxfordDictionaries.com) have been removed from the service, entries for all proper nouns and entries with controversial definitions from Oxford have been removed.

[[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] also provides a similar dictionary service which licences dictionary data from Oxford Dictionaries as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=define apple |url=https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+apple |website=[[bing.com]] |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Apple also licences dictionary data from Oxford for its [[iOS]] and [[macOS]] products.&lt;ref name="aapl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dictionaries available on OSX |url=https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX.xml |website=mesu.apple.com |accessdate=29 August 2018 |format=XML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The service originated in [[Google Translate]], and was launched as a standalone service (google.com/dictionary) in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/12/google-dictionary.html|title=Google quietly rolls out Dictionary [Updated]|date=2009-12-03|website=LA Times Blogs - Technology|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freecol"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://googledictionary.freecollocation.com/|title=Google Dictionary Online|website=googledictionary.freecollocation.com|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google displayed definitions from [[Collins COBUILD Advanced Learner's English Dictionary]] for English until August 2010&lt;ref name="jack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english-jack.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chooses-colins-cobuild.html|title=English, Jack|author=Brett Reynolds|publisher=English-jack.blogspot.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-dictionary-has-new-content.html|title=Google Dictionary Has a New Content Provider|author=Alex Chitu|work=Google Operating System|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when it switched to the Oxford American College Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10593/742|title=Online dictionaries of English|last=Lew|first=Robert|date=17 December 2010|website=Repozytorium Uniwersytetu im. Adama Mickiewicza (AMUR)|publisher=|access-date=12 June 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being integrated into [[Google Search]] the dictionary was discontinued as a separate service on August 5, 2011.&lt;ref name="freecol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chitu"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chitu |first1=Alex |title=No More Standalone Google Dictionary |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/08/no-more-standalone-google-dictionary.html |website=googlesystem.blogspot.com |accessdate=1 September 2018 |date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And can now be accessed by using the "define" operator or by simply searching for the meaning of a word.&lt;ref name="apol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chitu"/&gt; The dictionary service is also still available in Google Translate and can be accessed by selecting a single word.&lt;ref name="chitu" /&gt; Google has also released the service as an extension for [[Google Chrome|Chrome]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja|title=Google Dictionary (by Google)|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2017|website=[[Chrome Web Store]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}} [[Google]] licenses dictionary data from [[OxfordDictionaries.com]] for multiple languages such as [[British English|British]]/[[American English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] among others ([[Google Dictionary#Languages|see below]]).&lt;ref name="ox"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/licensing/google|title=Case study: Google|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On [[UN Arabic Language Day|Arabic Language Day]] (December 18) in 2015 Google added an Arabic language dictionary, available globally, to the service that showed definitions, translations, and example usages of the word in a sentence.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arabia.googleblog.com/2015/12/blog-post_58.html|title=يوم سعيد لليوم العالمي للغة العربية!|last=Masri|first=Zain|date=December 18, 2015|work=Google Arabia Blog|access-date=2018-08-30|language=|trans-title=Happy Arabic Language Day!|quote=Starting today you can type in the words “ما معنى” followed by the word you want to define and access Arabic dictionary OneBox results. We expanded our dictionary search feature to all global Arabic users}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, online news website [[The Daily Caller|Daily Caller]] accused Google of changing the definition of the word "fascism" in Google Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailycaller.com/2017/02/04/google-redefines-the-word-fascism-to-smear-conservatives-protect-liberal-rioters/|title=Google Redefines The Word ‘Fascism’ To Smear Conservatives, Protect Liberal Rioters|last=|first=|date=February 4, 2017|website=[[Daily Caller]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found out that the definition was exactly from Oxford with no Google modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/webmasters/OEgU3rwqa4A/3Fv2hqDbBQAJ|title=Why are you not using the OXFORD DEFINITION FOR FACISM|last=|first=|date=May 4, 2017|website=productforums.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google eventually removed "''fascism''" and related entries like "''alt right''" from the Dictionary.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/8rscfg/ysk_google_has_removed_definition_entries_from/|title=r/YouShouldKnow - YSK Google has removed definition entries from its dictionary|last=apuw|first=|date=June 17, 2018|website=[[reddit]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since added feedback options for the dictionary which includes reporting options for "wrong" and "offensive" definitions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It also does not display definitions for proper nouns provided by Oxford Dictionaries, though [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] which also uses Oxford displays all included definitions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Google added a Hindi dictionary from Rajpal &amp; Sons licensed via Oxford Dictionaries which also supported transliteration and translation to the service in April 2017.&lt;ref name="gblog" /&gt;

In July 2017, the dictionary was made directly available by typing "dictionary" in Google Search and additional features such as a search box, autocomplete and search history were also added.&lt;ref name="apol" /&gt;

In January 2018, a "Similar-sounding words" feature was added to the English dictionary which highlights words that sound similar such as "aesthetic" and "ascetic", "pray" and "prey", "conscientious" and "conscious" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-adds-similar-sounding-words-dictionary-search-cards/233481/|title=Google Adds ‘Similar Sounding Words’ to Dictionary Search Cards|last=|first=|date=2018-01-22|work=Search Engine Journal|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Google Word Coach" vocabulary game was made available along with dictionary searches and as a separate game on mobile devices in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/02/26/google-word-coach-tests-vocabulary-knowledge-bite-sized-questions/|title=Google Word Coach tests your vocabulary knowledge in bite-sized questions|date=2018-02-26|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Google Search added an English and Hindi dictionary for mobile users in India with an option to switch to the English only dictionary.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/28/google-search-india-starts-showing-dictionary-definitions-english-hindi/|title=Google Search in India starts showing dictionary definitions in both English and Hindi|date=2018-08-28|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greater and lesser magic''' (known also as '''high and low magic''' or collectively '''Satanic magic''') is a system of magic within [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. Greater magic is a form of [[ritual]] practice and is meant as [[psychodramatic]] [[catharsis]] to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose.  Lesser magic is the practice of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] by means of [[applied psychology]] and [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]] (or [[Deception|"wile and guile"]]) to bend an individual or situation to one's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Command to Look: A Master Photographer's Method for Controlling the Human Gaze |first1=William |last1=Mortensen |first2=George |last2=Dunham |year=2014 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and definition==

Outlined in ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey defined magic as "the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable."{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=288&amp;ndash;289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2p=95|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=96}} This definition incorporates two broadly distinguished kinds of magic: ''greater'' and ''lesser''.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2012|1pp=95&amp;ndash;96|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=97}} According to LaVey, one of the goals of ritual magic is "to isolate the otherwise dissipated adrenal and other emotionally induced energy, and to convert it into a dynamically transmittable force."{{sfn|The Command to Look: A Master Photographer's Method for Controlling the Human Gaze|George Dunham|2014|p=221}} LaVey defined lesser magic as "wile and guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create change in accordance with one's will."{{sfn|Witchcraft and Magic in Europe, Volume 6: The Twentieth Century|Blecourt, Hutton, Fontaine|1999|page=91}} Within this system of magic, the terms [[warlock]] and [[witch]] are most commonly used by, and to refer to, male and female practitioners, respectively.

LaVey espoused the view that there was an objective reality to magic, and that it relied upon natural forces that were yet to be discovered by science.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} Rather than characterising these as [[supernatural]], LaVey expressed the view that they were part of the natural world.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=3–4}} He believed that the successful use of magic involved the magician manipulating these natural forces using the force of their own willpower.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} LaVey also wrote of "the balance factor", insisting that any magical aims should be realistic.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=98}} LaVey refused any division between [[black magic]] and [[white magic]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2p=377}} attributing this dichotomy purely to the "smug hypocrisy and self-deceit" of those who called themselves "white magicians".{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=377}} Such [[Gray magic|neutrality]] correlates with LaVey's philosophical view of an impersonal, and therefore amoral, universe.&lt;ref name="LaVey 1969"&gt;{{cite book |last=LaVey |first=Anton |authorlink=Anton LaVey |title= The Satanic Bible |year=1969 |publisher=Avon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magician, should have the ability to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals.

LaVey explains his reasons for writing ''The Satanic Bible'' in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors on the subject of magic,{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=55}} dismissing them as "nothing more than sanctimonious fraud" and "volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy." He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by "[[Left-hand path and right-hand path#Right-Hand Path|right-hand path]]" authors. He tells that ''The Satanic Bible'' contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, "What you see may not always please you, but you ''will see''!"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=21–22}} Much of LaVey's ideas on magic and ritual are outlined in The Satanic Bible. LaVey explains that some of the rituals are simply applied psychology or science, but that some contain parts with no scientific basis. The Satanic Rituals, published by LaVey in 1972, outlines the rituals more precisely.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=110}} The third book of ''The Satanic Bible'' describes rituals and magic.{{sfn|Steiger|2003|p=301}} According to Joshua Gunn, these are adapted from books of ritual magic such as Crowley's ''[[Magick (Book 4)#Part II: Magick (Elementary Theory)|Magick: Elementary Theory]]''.{{sfn|Gunn|2005|p=102}}

Greater magic is a [[ritual]] performed in order to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes, including ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' ([[hate]]), and ''sex'' ([[lust]]).{{sfn|The Invention of Satanism|Asbjorn Dyrendal, Jesper Aa. Petersen|2016|page=86}}  These rituals are often considered to be magical acts,{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} with LaVey's Satanism encouraging the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to aid one's selfish ends.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} Much of Satanic ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=98&amp;ndash;99}} The ritual is referred to as an "intellectual decompression chamber", where skepticism and disbelief are willfully suspended, thus allowing the magicians to fully express their mental and emotional needs, holding back nothing regarding their deepest feelings and desires. LaVey listed the key components to successful ritual as: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and "The Balance Factor" (awareness of one's own limitations).{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121–128}} LaVeyan rituals sometimes include anti-Christian blasphemies, which are intended to have a liberating effect on the participants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} In some of the rituals, a naked woman serves as the altar; in these cases it is made explicit that the woman's body itself becomes the altar, rather than have her simply lying on an existing altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} There is no place for sexual orgies in LaVeyan ritual.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} Neither animal nor human sacrifice takes place.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} Children are banned from attending these rituals, with the only exception being the Satanic Baptism, which is specifically designed to involve infants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}}

Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in ''The Book of Belial'', and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of [[Baphomet]]) are given.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=130–136}} LaVey described a number of rituals in his book, ''The Satanic Rituals''; these are "dramatic performances" with specific instructions surrounding the clothing to be worn, the music to be used, and the actions to be taken.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} This attention to detail in the design of the rituals was intentional, with their pageantry and theatricality intending to engage the participants' senses and aesthetic senses at various levels and enhancing the participants' willpower for magical ends.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=97, 98}} LaVey prescribed that male participants should wear black robes, while older women should wear black, and other women should dress attractively in order to stimulate sexual feelings among many of the men.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} All participants are instructed to wear amulets of either the upturned pentagram or the image of [[Baphomet]].{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} According to LaVey's instructions, on the altar is to be placed an image of Baphomet. This should be accompanied by various candles, all but one of which are to be black. The lone exception is to be a white candle, used in destructive magic, which is kept to the right of the altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Also to be included are a bell which is rung nine times at the start and end of the ceremony, a chalice made of anything but gold, and which contains an alcoholic drink symbolizing the "Elixir of Life", a sword that represents aggression, a model phallus used as an [[aspergillum]], a gong, and parchment on which requests to Satan are to be written before being burned.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Although alcohol was consumed in the Church's rites, [[drunkenness]] was frowned upon and the taking of illicit drugs was forbidden.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}

The final book of ''The Satanic Bible'' emphasizes the importance of spoken word and emotion to effective magic.{{sfn|Steiger|2003|p=301}} An "Invocation to Satan" as well as three invocations for the three types of ritual are given.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} The "Invocation to Satan" commands the dark forces to grant power to the summoner, and lists the Infernal names for use in the invocation. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of lust" is used for attracting the attentions of another. Both male and female versions of the invocation are provided. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of destruction" commands the dark forces to destroy the subject of the invocation. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of compassion" requests protection, health, strength, and the destruction of anything ailing the subject of the invocation.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} The rest of ''The Book of Leviathan'' is composed of the Enochian Keys, which LaVey adapted from Dee's original work. They are given in Enochian and also translated into English.{{sfn|Lavey|2005|pp=155–272}} LaVey provides a brief introduction that credits Dee and explains some of the history behind the Enochian Keys and language. He maintains that the translations provided are an "unvarnishing" of the translations performed by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in the 1800s,{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=155}} but others accuse LaVey of simply changing references to Christianity with those to Satan.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}}

In designing these rituals, LaVey drew upon a variety of older sources, with scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld noting that LaVey "assembled rituals from a hodgepodge of historical sources, literary as well as esoteric".{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=88}} LaVey openly toyed with the use of literature and popular culture in other rituals and ceremonies, thus appealing to artifice, pageantry, and showmanship.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=106&amp;ndash;107}} For instance, he published an outline of a ritual which he termed the "Call to Cthulhu" which drew upon the stories of the alien god [[Cthulhu]] authored by American horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. In this rite, set to take place at night in a secluded location near to a turbulent body of water, a celebrant takes on the role of Cthulhu and appears before the assembled Satanists, signing a pact between them in the language of Lovecraft's fictional "Old Ones".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=106}}

The word 'fascination' has a similarly occult origin. Fascination was the term applied the evil eye. To fix a person's gaze, in other words, fascinate, was to curse them with the evil eye. Therefore, if a woman had the ability to fascinate men, she was regarded as a witch." - Anton LaVey

}}

Lesser magic, also referred to as "everyday" or "situational" magic, is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology. LaVey wrote that a key concept in lesser magic is the “command to look”, which can be accomplished by utilizing elements of “sex, sentiment, and wonder”,{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis, Petersen||p=418}} in addition to the utilization of looks, body language, scents,{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} color, patterns, and odor.{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2014|p=90}} LaVey wrote that the terms "fascination" and "glamour" have origins in the world of "coercive" magic. The word "fascination" comes from the Latin word "fascinare", which means "to cast a spell upon". {{sfn|The Command to Look: A Master Photographer's Method for Controlling the Human Gaze|George Dunham|2014|p=203}} This system encourages a form of manipulative role-play, wherein the practitioner may alter several elements of their physical appearance in order to aid them in seducing or "bewitching" an object of desire.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|page=97}}

LaVey developed “The Synthesizer Clock”, the purpose of which is to divide humans into distinct groups of people based primarily on body shape and personality traits.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} The synthesizer is modeled as a clock, and based on concepts of [[somatotypes]].{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Petersen|2010|p=67}} The clock is intended to aid a witch in identifying themselves, subsequently aiding in utilizing the “attraction of opposites” to “spellbind” the witch's object of desire by assuming the opposite role.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} The successful application of lesser magic is said to be built upon one's understanding of their place on the clock.{{sfn|Sexuality and New Religious Movements|Lewis, Bogdan|2014|p=}} Upon finding your position on the clock, you are encouraged to adapt it as seen fit, and perfect your type by harmonizing its element for better success.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|page=97}} LaVey explains that, in order to control a person, one must first attract his or her attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=111–113}}

Dyrendal referred to LaVey's techniques as “Erving Goffman meets William Mortensen”.{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis, Petersen|2014|p=418}} Drawing insights from psychology, biology, and sociology,{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2010|p=89}} Petersen noted that lesser magic combines occult and “rejected sciences of body analysis [and] temperaments.”{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2010|page=68}}

==Ritual and ceremonial rites==
In the ''Book of Belial'', he discusses three types of rituals: lust rituals which work to entice another person, destruction rituals to destroy another person and compassion rituals to improve health, intelligence, success.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=114–117}} Lust rituals are designed to attract the desired romantic or sexual partner and can involve masturbation, with orgasm as the goal. Destruction rituals are designed to do harm to others{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} and involve the symbolic annihilation of an enemy through the use of "vicarious" human sacrifice often involving a customized effigy representing the intended victim which is then put through ritual fire, smashing, or other representation of obliteration. Compassion rituals are designed with the intent of helping people (including oneself), to evoke overwhelming pathos or sadness, and crying is strongly encouraged.

In ''The Satanic Rituals'', LaVey makes a distinction between the ritual and the ceremony, stating that rituals "...are directed for a specific end that the performer desires", and that ceremonies are "...pageants paying homage to or commemorating an event, aspect of life, admired personage, or declaration of faith [...] a ritual is used to attain, while a ceremony serves to sustain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKiJBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+satanic+rituals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vSSQVc--O8H7-AGRlL_QAw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20satanic%20rituals&amp;f=false|title=The Satanic Rituals Spell Book|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaVey emphasized that in his tradition, Satanic rites came in two forms, neither of which were acts of worship; in his terminology, "rituals" were intended to bring about change, whereas "ceremonies" celebrated a particular occasion.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=98|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=97}} 

A satanic baptism is a ceremony for a child is intended to be a symbolic recognition of the infant as being born a Satanist{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} and is only to be performed for those under the age of four, as LaVey claimed that beyond this age, the child has already begun to be influenced by "alien" ideas.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=95}} Adult baptisms serve as a declaration of "faith", where "falsehoods, hypocrisy and shame of the past" are symbolically cast away.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|page=95-97}} In 1967, LaVey performed the first publicly recorded Satanic baptism in history for his youngest daughter [[Zeena Schreck|Zeena]], which garnered worldwide publicity and was originally recorded on ''The Satanic Mass'' LP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Satanic Mass/Zeena's Baptism Track A9 go to 3:42|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_M09vuLQAc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Satanic Mass, Track A9 (Zeena's Baptism)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Anton-LaVey-The-Satanic-Mass/release/1166426|publisher=Murgenstrumm, 1968 Vinly LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satanist Anton LaVey Baptising Daughter|url=http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U1556387/satanist-anton-lavey-baptising-daughter|publisher=Bettmann/CORBIS|location=San Francisco, California, USA|date=May 23, 1967|quote=LaVey [...] said the mystic ceremony was the first such baptism in history.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525095013/http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U1556387/satanist-anton-lavey-baptising-daughter|archivedate=May 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=clippings of Zeena's baptism world wide|url=http://zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109%3Apress-coverage-of-zeenas-baptism-1967-1968&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Satanic Baptisms were written by LaVey and published in ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]''.

In February 1967, LaVey  officiated the first Satanic wedding, the much publicized marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=BpE-C2vX2LcC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=judith+case+wedding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeuM2rp5vLAhVM5yYKHcJsDEEQ6AEISDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=judith%20case%20wedding&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The Satanic Wedding ceremony was written by LaVey, but was never officially published. An official Satanic wedding ceremony was published in ''[[The Satanic Scriptures]]'' in 2007. The first Satanic funeral was for U.S. naval machinist-repairman, third-class, and Church of Satan member Edward Olsen. It was performed by LaVey at the request of Olsen's wife, complete with a chrome-helmeted [[honor guard]].{{sfn|Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture|Chris Mathews|2009|page=50}} The Satanic Funeral rite was first published in ''The Satanic Scriptures''.

==The Black Mass==

LaVey also developed his own [[Black Mass]], which was designed as a form of deconditioning to free the participant from any inhibitions that they developed living in Christian society.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2012|1pp=96&amp;ndash;97|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013|2p=76|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=98}} He noted that in composing the Black Mass rite, he had drawn upon the work of [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=86}}

==Symbolism== 
===Four Crown Princes of Hell=== 
{{main|The infernal names}}
LaVey utilized the symbolism of the Four Crown Princes of Hell in ''The Satanic Bible'', with each chapter of the book being named after each Prince. ''The Book of Satan: The Infernal Diatribe'', ''The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment'', ''The Book of Belial: Mastery of the Earth'', and ''The Book of Leviathan: The Raging Sea''.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121–140}}  This association was inspired by the demonic hierarchy from ''[[The Book of Abramelin|The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage]]''. 

*'''[[Satan]] (Hebrew) "Lord of the Inferno":''' 
The adversary, representing opposition, the element of fire, the direction of the south, and the Sigil of Baphomet during ritual. 
*'''[[Lucifer]] (Roman) "The Morning Star":'''
The bringer of light, representing pride and enlightenment, the element of air, the direction of the east, and candles during ritual. 
*'''[[Belial]] (Hebrew) "Without a Master":'''
The baseness of the earth, independence and self-sufficiency, the element of earth, the direction of the north, and the sword during ritual. 
*'''[[Leviathan]] (Hebrew) "Serpent of the Abyss":'''

"Hail Satan" a common greeting and ritual term in the [[Church of Satan]], both in its English form, ''Hail Satan'', as well as in the Latin version of it, ''Ave Satanas''. When ''Ave Satanas'' is used, it is often preceded by the term ''Rege Satanas'' ("Reign, Satan"). (''Rege Satanas'' can be heard in the video of a widely publicized Church of Satan wedding performed by LaVey on February 1, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pwAOSwHuTQ Video of 1967 Church of Satan wedding.]&lt;/ref&gt;) The combination "''Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Hail Satan!''" is found as a greeting in early Church of Satan correspondence,&lt;ref&gt;Published in {{cite book |last=Aquino |first=Michael |title=The Church of Satan |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in their 1968 recording ''The Satanic Mass'',&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton, ''The Satanic Mass'', LP (Murgenstrumm Records, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately in their 1969 book ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Satanic Bible|last=LaVey|first=Anton|authorlink=Anton LaVey|year=1969|pages=75|url=http://std.kku.ac.th/4830401674/The%20Satanic%20Bible.pdf|isbn=0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is used in some versions of the [[Black Mass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Messe Noire|last=Melech|first=Aubrey|year=1985|publisher=Sui Anubis|location=London|isbn=0-947762-03-5|pages=52|url=http://www.templeofbaphomet.com/library/LaMesseNoire.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it often accompanies the phrase [[Shemhamforash]] and is said at the end of each prayer.

'''''if i can cook / you know god can''''' (sometimes known as ''If I Can Cook You Know God Can'') is a culinary memoir by [[Ntozake Shange]]. It was originally published by [[Beacon Press]], in [[Boston]] MA, United States, in 1998. The piece is both memoir and cookbook. Short essays precede recipes written in personal vernacular, and these recipes cover locations such as [[Cuba]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Brazil]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]] and the United States.

== Synopsis ==

===Chapter 1===
The book begins with a discussion of celebrations and the food that accompanies them, mentioning [[Frederick Douglass]]'s lack of enthusiasm for the celebration of the Fourth of July, and asking why "would they want to celebrate the American Declaration of Liberation while the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], which allowed the kidnapping of free slaves back to slave states on the word of any white man, was in effect?"&lt;ref name="Primary Source"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shange|first=Ntozake|title=if I can cook / i know God can|year=1998|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-7241-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It details a winter during which Shange, determined to give her daughter a traditional Owens/Wilsons holiday, searches Clinton - Washington for ingredients. She looks for ways to recreate the traditional flavors, for she "tried to make again my very colored childhood and my very 'black' adolescence."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; In this first chapter, Shange expresses feeling a connection to her ancestors through the re-creation of pig's feet, [[chitlins]]' Hoppin’ John, [[baked ham]], [[collard greens]] and [[cornbread]] with syrup despite experiencing the holiday in a friends home and eating alone.

===Chapter 2===
Chapter 2 takes the reader to [[St. Louis]] and Shange uses the experience of listening to a [[short wave radio]] emanating the sounds of [[Fidel Castro]] as a child to talk about her experiences in [[Cuba]] as an adult. She says that her child was one of Cuba's Young Pioneers and shared food, recipes and traditions with children from a multitude of other locations, such as [[Zimbabwe]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. While in Cuba, the author experiences a [[blackface]] performance, which she is horrified by. She eats avocado with beer and reminds herself that "history, our history, mustn't scare me."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;  Cuba's slave trade history is discussed, and Shange is concerned with "How'd all these hardworking - cutting cane is torturous labor - Africans get fed and what'd they eat?"&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

===Chapter 3===
In Chapter 3, Shange is in [[Nicaragua]]. She describes it as the "little country with the black people on one side of the mountain and the mestizoes and blancos on the other, while the Amerindians made a way for themselves in the jungles as best they could."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; She shows the East and West coast as being uncommunicative and disconnected and the area she is familiar with being left with no infrastructure, which she describes as detrimental to the community. Shange's journey to the house of the esteemed poet [[Rubén Darío]] leads her to participate in a bus ride during the entire bus singing along to Usted Abuso, by Shange's favorite salsa singer. This makes her feel at home. Shange runs into Carlos Johnson and partakes in the experience of a dance hall. saying "we connect to the culture of the people we live with",&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

===Chapter 4===
Shange is in [[Brixton]], a working-class [[West Indian]] neighborhood and she describes shopping in the area with her daughter, as they look for food items. Savannah and Shange prepare for her friend Leila's birthday dinner, and each of the ingredients used is described. At the end of the chapter, she mentions the fact that Leila's partner Darcus Howe is from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and makes a reference to the presence of [[slavery]] in [[East India]]. She ends with the quote: "Now we are independent. We own the soil. We have our own name. We have our own flag. Let us have some wine and some music."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

===Chapter 5===
In Chapter 5, Shange is in the world of the Caribbean, and looking at the "matter of the flyin' fish"&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; in Trinidad and Tobago and [[Barbados]]. Here, she describes the different ways in which two communities looked at one commodity. The Trinidad and Tobago fishermen were catching the flyin fish that were essential to the Barbadian diet, and didn’t eat it. While the Barbadians argued that it was wrong for them to catch the fish that they didn’t even eat and then sell it back as a profit, they said that they were only supplying the demand. She then says that who knows what would happen if the Barbadians came after [[shark meat]], which is treasured by the Trinidadians.

===Chapter 6===
Chapter 6 is about [[Brazil]]. Shange talks about the different colors of the populations of different sections of Brazil, saying that the south is industrialized and "mythologically white",&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; while it's thought that the "Africans" live in the north. She talks about how when she was at a university in [[Bahia]] she asked each student to bring in the beginning of a performance piece or something based either off their lives or the world as they knew it. Each student talked about a myth, which she found disturbing and says that "My students were validating themselves as the 'other' where they were not the other."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; Shange says that "We are not folklore."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; In terms of Brazil, she says that "the epitome and apex of Brazilian life may be the continually multiplying mulatta, but we must all eat whatever our hue, or the hue and cry over who we are."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; She then goes about looking at what makes up the primary dishes, focusing on Brazilian rice. Shange makes the point that Brazil has the highest percentage of people of African descent who live outside continent and that "We eat what they eat, just differently. These recipes have stayed with us for centuries, being improvised here and there, where we found somethin' we were accustomed to in, say, Guinea was not available at the mouth of the Amazon."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

===Chapter 7===
In Chapter 7, Shange talks about the [[Juba dance|Juba]], "a dance of coutrin'",&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; that is found in the Caribbean and the community of slaves in North America. Chapter 7 briefly discusses dance in slave culture and says that "it's time to tend to our own gardens. Let's grow some sweet potatoes to keep the niggah alive."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; It mentions the crops that were carried into the new world, and talks about Carolina rice, which Shange was raised on. It talks about different preparations of rice, and Shange relates style of cooking to location. She chides her mother for thinking that spice and a burnt bottom are ruining the rice, when rice with a crusty bottom is common in the Caribbean. Shange then goes back to dance, talking about classes taken at the Clark Center.

===Chapter 8===
Chapter 8 talks about the assimilation of people to western territories and how old dishes are adapted to new locations, as well as the lack of knowledge newly arrived slaves had about the treatment of Native Americans. It talks about the ramifications of the [[Dred Scott decision]]. [[Oklahoma]] is mentioned as "our nearest place of safety",&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; and A. G. Belton is mentioned as an entrepreneur who wrote to the [[American Colonization Society]] about the problems of post slavery communities. She questions the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s' treatment of the Native Americans and the way that "we changed, made necessary readjustments to our gods and belief systems to accommodate the Christianity thrust upon us as our salvation." (p.&amp;nbsp;54). She also discusses debate around bones of freemen that were found along [[Vine Street Expressway]] in [[Philadelphia]]. She says that bones have to be moved to make room for other things and that it was acceptable for the removed bones to be moved because they belonged to what were considered a "lower species of man".&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; This leads to a part about the treatment of deceased African - Americans and what happens to their remains. Shange says that the world of slavery and the European took "what the world was to us out of our control?"&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

===Chapter 9===
Chapter 9 looks at African Americans in Texas. She says that slaves in Texas weren't immediately informed that they were free until General Order number three was issued. African American Texans created their own independence day (Juneteenth) and she asserts that they found ways of finding community. She describes arenas commanded by African American cowboys who were continuing tradition, as well as her own participation. She says that rodeos were another venue for food, with women producing barbecue; she provides a recipe for Texan beef barbecue. She tells a story about convincing her father to come see her race barrels in Hitchcock, Texas, and about the barbecue they had. She details her father's reaction the barbecue and sauce, and his comparison of it to his own barbecue. Shange makes mention of the fact that "I was raised to experiment with taste and sound, thus my interest in music, language, and food, but more importantly to never turn my nose or chin up to any kinda food that anybody ate."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

===Chapter 10===
Chapter 10 begins with a mention of Elijah Muhammad's column "How to Eat to Live". Shange talks about Frank Yerby's play Foxes of Harrow and looks at his characters "defiant and self - determining"&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; and at Yerby as someone who actively rejected Southern antebellum life, without denying its existence. From there, Shange looks at refusing food as "one of many methods Africans used to maintain some dignity, some control of their lives".&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; She discusses the relationship between crackheads, dope fiends and slavery and writes that "Cooking is a way of insisting on living,"&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; and saying that "When we are hungry for life, we search out spice, aromas, and texture to entice and please those around us."&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; She uses gumbo as an example here and references the cities of Charleston and New Orleans. She discusses different ways to make roux and then the way to add okra to gumbo, yet says that her own immediate family does not like okra.

===Chapter 11===
Chapter 11 looks at boys. Shange says that from the first, she was expected to serve boys food, and that this was part of a dating ritual "to prove I was of value, valued my visitors and our time together so much that I made a hands-on effort to create something for whoever this person was".&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; She discusses her adolescent reaction to it and her later realization that was being taught an important "Southern/African tradition of sharing the best I had with visitors". (p.&amp;nbsp;80). She describes the link between cooking and self value, as well as the energy and importance of time in the kitchen. She mentions that music can assist the kitchen process.

===Chapter 12===
Chapter 12 looks at the need "to re-create a 'where' for our people".&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; It looks at people who do not commit to the American way of life. Shange talks about meeting a Rastafarian in Cancun, Mexico, and the ways in which African culture was destabilized during slavery. She uses the limitation of diet as an example. Yvette, a friend, is used as an example; she explains that her vegetarianism is an alternative choice to the meat and dairy diet suggested by America. In this chapter, Shange looks at the idea that African Americans are a "people in transition"&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; describes the first bembe she ever attended and talks about African-American Jews.

===Epilogue===
The epilogue contains references to Shange's dance experience and talks about sugar, giving people something to make them happy, and providing dessert recipes.

== Analysis ==
The author herself once described this difficult to define project as one of "writing some thoughts about food",&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;{{cite news|title=If I Can Cook / You Know God Can|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/1998-11-20/520635/|accessdate=2014-04-24|date=November 20, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the author to see herself both within the tradition she is exploring as an individual, and is a tribute to black cuisine as a food that reflects the spirit and history of a people. Shange actually moved her bedroom into the kitchen while writing the book.&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt; She looks at food as something that celebrates the history, migration and soul of a people. Here, food provides the backdrop and basis for questions of identity that involve origin, relocation and what ultimately has the power to bring people together. The essays before each recipe endow them with historical, emotional, and communal importance. The small essays allow her to "understand or recognize herself in the history and culture of other African - origin people of the world... travels to Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or places undeniably products of the African Diaspora launch Shange's thoughts on being and identity."&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt; Shange puts extreme value on food, evident in an interview with The Sun, in which she says that "I believe you should eat and prepare food with the same care you treat a newborn infant",&lt;ref name="The Sun"&gt;{{cite web|last=Large|first=Elizabeth|title=Down-home fixings; Playwright and poet Ntozake Shange turns her talents to writing about food in "If I Can Cook/You Know God Can", a collection of recipes mixed with morsels of cultural history|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/406354284/|work=The Sun Magazine|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''if i can cook / you know god can'' explores history, and the ways in which food and culture are intertwined. Different people, cultures and locations come together in the food put on the table, and the recipes that the food comes from. By writing about the food culture she comes from, Shange asserts the importance of the food she details and provides recipes for, the food that is important to her people. She claims this food culture, and history, as important, worthy of recognition, remembrance, and immortality in writing. Shange refuses to let this history be ignored. As stated by ''Mosaic Literary Magazine'': "This is not a cookbook, it's a food lesson, a means by which the African diasporic existence is ultimately justified."&lt;ref name=Mosaic&gt;{{cite web|last=Haime|first=Deatra|title=If I Can Cook/You Know God Can by Ntozake Shange|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/217449237/|work=Mosaic Literary Magazine|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shange sees connection between food and history, and has said that "I also wanted to write about {blacks'} relationship to food as a people in bondage and how that changed."&lt;ref name="The Sun" /&gt; In this work, Shange actively addresses the past, and "goes well beyond mere listings of ingredients to show how various foods reflect the black experience from the slave ships to the present".&lt;ref name="Social Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Americans in Focus|publisher=Library Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Shange introduces the readers to "Afro-Atlantic foodways",&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; which is a type of food that came to being on slave ships.

This piece discusses the importance of location in relation to food. Eating brings people together. Shange displays the ways in which recipes are adapted according to location. When people move, they bring a food history with them, and yet it evolves according to the availability of ingredients, culture, traditions and influence of present location. Therefore, recipes are spread to different locations, evolving and yet simultaneously staying true to tradition. In a review in ''[[The Booklist]]'' by Alice Joyce, she says that Shange "paints a fervent, richly impassioned chronicle of African-American experience, at the same time making note of political situations and discord among the peoples of these nations and recording how connections are made beyond issues of class or skin color. Recipes serve as savory, nourishing garnishes"&lt;ref name="The Booklist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Alice|title=If I Can Cook/You Know God Can|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/235421339/|work=The Booklist|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange displays the ways in which certain recipes and traditions have survived over time, allowing people to remember and recall Africa, even when in a different place. Food is a way for "black folks in the Western Hemisphere to be full".&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt; For example, Shange "identifies the African-American migration west after the Civil War and how the voyage was fueled by the hunting and farming skills folks learned during slavery. She makes these connections from a fundamental love for and admiration of the development of African contributions to the new world order".&lt;ref name=Mosaic&gt;{{cite web|last=Haime|first=Deatra|title=If I Can Cook/You Know God Can by Ntozake Shange|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/217449237/|work=Mosaic Literary Magazine|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange claims that by continuing, but adapting, past food culture to location, African Americans declare the presence and importance of their culture in a new location, such as the United States. She is asking the questions "Where did black folks end up? How did they cope with relocation?"&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt; and realizing that the answer is "at the table, where hearts, minds, and bellies come together and are made full".&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt;

Shange looks at food as a feature of memory as well, for not only is the memory of history bestowed upon food but food, as a product of a long and rich culture, can trigger memory. When Shange spends New Years with her daughter in New York, she has an "insatiable desire to recreate for her daughter the family holidays she remembered".&lt;ref name="Primary Source" /&gt;

This work is a tribute to the universality and individuality of food, for it connects an entire group of people and yet can remain a specific, unique experience. As said in ''The Austin Chronicle'', "it's clear in her book that Shange takes a great deal of pleasure in the preparation, presentation, and savoring of well-prepared food".&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt; Shange writes her recipes with a specific reader in mind, one who will understand the references she makes and who has a prior knowledge of the foods she discusses. Shange reclaims the food history of her people, while dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions through an identification of facts, experiences, and feelings both cultural, historical, and social. Food ties people together, and Shange makes the point that "Our food isn't reflective of our lack of culture, it is, in fact, the very opposite - it's the foundation from which we grow and continue to thrive."&lt;ref name=Mosaic&gt;{{cite web|last=Haime|first=Deatra|title=If I Can Cook/You Know God Can by Ntozake Shange|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/217449237/|work=Mosaic Literary Magazine|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style/Tone ==
The recipes and essays are written informally in a personable tone of an experienced person conveying exactly how to recreate a recipe. The recipes make allowances for individual preference and skill level, while at the same time making basic assumptions about the reader's knowledge base. Shange writes in "trademark lilting vernacular"&lt;ref name="Social Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Americans in Focus|publisher=Library Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of a piece is extremely important, for Shange said in an interview with Neal A. Lester in 1990 that "I'm a firm believer that language and how we use language determines how we act, and how we act then determines our lives and other people's lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voices from the Gaps|title=Ntozake Shange|url=http://www.voices.cla.unm.edu/artistpages/shange_ntozake.php|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[Edited by] Christopher Tolkien. London: Unwin Hyman, [25 August] 1988. (The History of Middle-earth; 6) {{ISBN|0-04-440162-0}}. In [[General American]] the surname is also pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|oʊ|l|k|iː|n}}. This pronunciation no doubt arose by analogy with such words as ''toll'' and ''polka'', or because speakers of General American realise {{IPA|/ɒ/}} as {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, while often hearing British {{IPA|/ɒ/}} as {{IPA|[ɔ]}}; thus {{IPA|[ɔ]}} or General American {{IPA|[oʊ]}} become the closest possible approximation to the [[Received Pronunciation]] for many American speakers.

Harlow: Longman, {{ISBN|0-582-05383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, [[philology|philologist]], and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic [[high fantasy]] works ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

He served as the [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] and Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], from 1925 to 1945 and [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]] and Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]], from 1945 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;111, 200, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; He was at one time a close friend of [[C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]]—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the [[Inklings]]. Tolkien was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 28 March 1972.

After Tolkien's death, his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including ''The Silmarillion''. These, together with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and [[Middle-earth]]&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;"Middle-earth" is derived via Middle English ''{{lang|enm|middel-erthe, middel-erd}}'' from ''{{lang|ang|middangeard}}'', an Anglo-Saxon cognate of Old Norse {{lang|non|[[Midgard|Miðgarðr]]}}, the land inhabited by humans in [[Norse mythology]].&lt;/ref&gt; within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term ''[[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]'' to the larger part of these writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', nos. 131, 153, 154, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien,&lt;ref name="de Camp"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Camp |first=L. Sprague |authorlink=L.

==Biography==

===Family origins===
Tolkien's paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family had emigrated from Germany in the 18th century but had become "quickly intensely English".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the family tradition, the Tolkiens had arrived in England in 1756, as refugees from [[Frederick the Great]]'s invasion of the [[Electorate of Saxony]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pages 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Several families with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling live in northwestern Germany, mainly in Lower Saxony and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkien.html |title=Absolute Verteilung des Namens 'Tolkien' |language=German |work=verwandt.de |publisher=MyHeritage UK Ltd. |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510202325/http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkien.html |archivedate=10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkiehn.html |title=Absolute Verteilung des Namens 'Tolkiehn' |language=German |work=verwandt.de |publisher=My Heritage UK Ltd. |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510194451/http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkiehn.html |archivedate=10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien believed his surname derived from the German word ''tollkühn'', meaning "foolhardy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |title=Ash nazg gimbatul |language=German |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]] |issue=35/1969 |date=25 August 1969 |quote=Professor Tolkien, der seinen Namen vom deutschen Wort 'tollkühn' ableitet,... . |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427035821/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |archivedate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and jokingly inserted himself as a "cameo" into ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' under the literally translated name Rashbold. However, this origin of the name has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=J. R. R. Tolkien |first=Fabian |last=Geier |language=German |page=9 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-49950-664-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
[[File:Mabel Suffield Christmas Card.jpg|thumb|right|1892 Christmas card with a coloured photo of the Tolkien family in Bloemfontein, sent to relatives in Birmingham, England]]

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in [[Bloemfontein]] in the [[Orange Free State]] (now [[Free State Province]] in South Africa) to [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur Reuel Tolkien]] (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, ''née'' Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, [[Tolkien family#Hilary Tolkien|Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien]], who was born on 17 February 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large [[Harpactirinae|baboon spider]] in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his [[kraal]] to show him off, returning him the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;13. Both the spider incident and the visit to a kraal are covered here.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of [[rheumatic fever]] before he could join them.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in [[Kings Heath]],&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', Ch I, "Bloemfontein". At 9 Ashfield Road, King's Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to [[Sarehole]] (now in [[Hall Green]]), then a [[Worcestershire]] village, later annexed to Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed exploring [[Sarehole Mill]] and [[Moseley Bog]] and the [[Clent Hills|Clent]], [[Lickey Hills|Lickey]] and [[Malvern Hills]], which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as [[Bromsgrove]], [[Alcester]], and [[Alvechurch]] and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BirminghamOratoryDome.jpg|thumb|right|[[Birmingham Oratory]], where Tolkien was a parishioner and altar boy (1902–1911)]]
Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; She taught him a great deal of [[botany]] and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of [[Latin]] very early.&lt;ref name=DoughanBio&gt;{{cite web|last=Doughan |first=David |year=2002 |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |title=JRR Tolkien Biography |work=Life of Tolkien |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303050751/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |archivedate=3 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[The Pied Piper]]'' and thought ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] was "amusing but disturbing". He liked stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|"Red Indians"]] (Native Americans) and the fantasy works by [[George MacDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the "Fairy Books" of [[Andrew Lang]] were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KES Free Grammar School Charles Barry.jpg|thumb|right|King Edward's School in Birmingham, where Tolkien was a student (1900–1902, 1903–1911)&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–51.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,&lt;ref name=Biography31&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of [[diabetic ketoacidosis|acute diabetes]] at Fern Cottage in [[Rednal]], which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] could live without treatment—[[insulin]] would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."&lt;ref name=Biography31/&gt;

Prior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the [[Birmingham Oratory]], who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was ''not''. I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [i.e. Tolkien having grown up knowing more] about '[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]' than the [[Mother of Jesus]]—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no.&amp;nbsp;267.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the [[Edgbaston]] area of Birmingham and attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], and later [[St. Philip's School]]. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's. While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school's [[Officers Training Corps]] who helped "line the route" for the 1910 [[coronation]] parade of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. Like the other cadets from King Edward's, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name=Letters306&gt;''Letters'', no. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of [[Perrott's Folly]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] tower of [[Edgbaston Waterworks]], which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamheritage.org.uk/tolkien.html J.R.R.

===Youth===
While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a [[constructed language]], Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm |title=Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122010424/http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110153/http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm|title=Tolkien's Languages|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien learned [[Esperanto]] some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed "The Book of the Foxrook", a sixteen-page notebook, where the "earliest example of one of his invented alphabets" appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Perry C. |last=Bramlett |url={{Google books|8ef3-s6fixIC|page=PA136|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |title=I Am in Fact a Hobbit: An Introduction to the Life and Works of J.

In 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a "council" in London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.

In 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,&lt;ref name=Letters306/&gt; noting that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s journey across the [[Misty Mountains]] ("including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from [[Interlaken]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]] and on to camp in the [[moraine]]s &lt;!-- Tolkien spells "morains", but this is not a direct quote. Oxford English Dictionary offers standardized spelling of "moraines".--&gt; beyond [[Mürren]]. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Silberhorn]], "the Silvertine ([[Celebdil]]) of my dreams". They went across the [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to [[Grindelwald]] and on across the [[Grosse Scheidegg]] to [[Meiringen]]. They continued across the [[Grimsel Pass]], through the upper [[Valais]] to [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and on to the [[Aletsch glacier]] and [[Zermatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.valais-wallis-digital.ch/de/a/#!/explore/cards/173 |title=1911 – J.R.R.

In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. He initially studied [[Classics]] but changed his course in 1913 to English Language and [[English Literature|Literature]], graduating in 1915 with [[first-class honours]] in his final examinations.&lt;ref name = "RoyalMail"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Wayne G.

===Courtship and marriage===
At the age of 16, J.R.R. Tolkien met [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Mary Bratt]], who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, [[Edgbaston]]. According to Humphrey Carpenter,
{{quote|Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien's having "muffed" his exams and considered it "altogether unfortunate"&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"&gt;''Letters'', No. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, [[Church of England|Protestant]] woman. He prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doughan |first=David |year=2002 |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html#2 |title=War, Lost Tales and Academia |work=J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biographical Sketch |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303050751/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |archivedate=3 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled:
{{quote|I had to choose between disobeying and grieving (or deceiving) a guardian who had been a father to me, more than most fathers ... and "dropping" the love-affair until I was 21. I don't regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly ''three'' years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;}}

On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt "on the shelf" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.

On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field family was "insulted and angry".&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, "I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different."&lt;ref&gt;''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence.  Jessop, "like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]]", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;

===First World War===
In August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the [[British Army]]. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, "In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage."&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;

Instead, Tolkien, "endured the obloquy",&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt; and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were "becoming outspoken from relatives".&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt; He was then commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] on 15 July 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;77–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29232|page=6968|date=16 July 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, "Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed."&lt;ref&gt;''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt; Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.

On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to [[Folkestone]] for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough &amp; Harrow Hotel in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham.

He later wrote, "Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then&amp;nbsp;... it was like a death."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[Étaples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].

While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.&lt;ref&gt;Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at [[Rubempré]], near [[Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pages 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Garth, he "felt an affinity for these working class men", but military protocol prohibited friendships with "[[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]". Instead, he was required to "take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty."&lt;ref name="Garth149"&gt;Garth (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien later lamented, "The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity."&lt;ref name="Garth149"/&gt;

====Battle of the Somme====
Tolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. To get around the [[British Army]]'s [[postal censorship]], the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:
[[File:Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|''The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen. [[Imperial War Museum]], London.]]

{{quote|On one occasion I spent the night with the Brigade Machine Gun Officer and the Signals Officer in one of the captured German dugouts ... We dossed down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep, but it was not to be. We no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up. So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of ''[[hors d'oeuvre]]'' and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Garth (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked [[Regina Trench]], Tolkien came down with [[trench fever]], a disease carried by the [[lice]]. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the [[first day of the Somme]] while leading his men in the assault on [[Beaumont Hamel]]. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.

Tolkien might well have been killed himself, but he had suffered from health problems and had been removed from combat multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'' (2000 paperback edition), pp.&amp;nbsp;93, 103, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Garth: {{quote|Although [[Herbert Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s [[Kitchener's Army|army]] enshrined old social boundaries, it also chipped away at the class divide by throwing men from all walks of life into a desperate situation together. Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, "a deep sympathy and feeling for the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties". He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the [[Second World War]] were entirely mistaken:
{{quote|One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lord of the Rings''. Preface to the Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Home front====
A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;207 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien's [[Webley Revolver|Webley .455]] service revolver was put on display in 2006 as part of a [[Battle of the Somme]] exhibition in the [[Imperial War Museum]], London. (See {{cite web |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/second-lieutenant-j-r-r-tolkien |title=SECOND LIEUTENANT J R R TOLKIEN |work=Battle of the Somme |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=25 November 2018 }} and {{cite web |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30034679 |title=WEBLEY .455 MARK 6 (VI MILITARY) |work=Imperial War Museum Collection Search |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=25 November 2018 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Several of his service records, mostly dealing with his health problems, can be seen at the National Archives. ({{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/people/tolkien.htm |title=Officer's service record: J R R Tolkien |work=First World War |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308111409/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/people/tolkien.htm |archivedate=8 March 2009 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

During his recovery in a cottage in [[Little Haywood]], [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]], he began to work on what he called ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', beginning with ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''. ''Lost Tales'' represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 98] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116212207/https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 |date=16 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as "(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-Boat campaign]]) round about the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now".&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;

Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30588 |supp=y|page=3561|date=19 March 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was stationed at [[Kingston upon Hull]], he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby [[Roos]], and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered,{{quote|I never called Edith ''Luthien''—but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the ''Silmarillion''. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks&lt;ref&gt;Following rural English usage, Tolkien used the name "hemlock" for various plants with white flowers in umbels, resembling [[poison hemlock|hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum''); the flowers Edith danced among were more probably [[cow parsley]] (''Anthriscus sylvestris'') or [[wild carrot]] (''Daucus carota''). See John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'' (Harper Collins/Houghton Mifflin 2003), and Peter Gilliver, Jeremy Marshall, &amp; Edmund Weiner, ''The Ring of Words'' (OUP 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing—and ''dance''. But the story has gone crooked, &amp; I am left, and ''I'' cannot plead before the inexorable [[Mandos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This incident inspired the account of the meeting of [[Beren and Lúthien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cater |first=Bill |date=4 December 2001 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726863/We-talked-of-love-death-and-fairy-tales.html |title=We talked of love, death, and fairy tales |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=13 March 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131153700/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726863/We-talked-of-love-death-and-fairy-tales.html |archivedate=31 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic and writing career===

[[File:20 Northmoor Road, Oxford.JPG|thumb|20 [[Northmoor Road]], the former home of Tolkien in [[North Oxford]]]]

On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32110 |supp=y|page=10711|date=2 November 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first civilian job after World War I was at the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter ''W''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Gilliver| first=Peter|title=The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the OED|publisher=OUP| year=2006|first2=Jeremy |last2=Marshall |first3=Edmund |last3=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he took up a post as [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], and became the youngest professor there.&lt;ref name="Grotta2001 page 64 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Grotta |title=J.R.R. Tolkien Architect of Middle Earth |url={{Google books|9LHQvq6P5qIC|page=PA64|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=22 August 2010 |date=28 March 2001 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=978-0-7624-0956-3 |pages=64– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511071523/http://books.google.com/books?id=9LHQvq6P5qIC&amp;pg=PA64 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Leeds, he produced ''A Middle English Vocabulary'' and a definitive edition of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' with [[E. V. Gordon]], both becoming academic standard works for several decades. He also translated ''Sir Gawain'', ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', and ''[[Sir Orfeo]]''. In 1925, he returned to Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]].

In mid-1919 he began to privately tutor undergraduates, most importantly those of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's College]] given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6Q_GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q=lady%20margaret%20hall|title=J.R.R. Tolkien's Double Worlds and Creative Process: Language and Life|last=Zettersten|first=A.|date=25 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230118409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]] Tolkien wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first two volumes of ''The Lord of the Rings'', whilst living at 20 [[Northmoor Road]] in [[North Oxford]] (where a [[blue plaque]] was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name "[[Nodens]]", following Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s unearthing of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Asclepeion]] at [[Lydney Park]], Gloucestershire, in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Name Nodens'' (1932) in the bibliographical listing. For the etymology, see [[Nodens#Etymology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Beowulf''====
In the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of ''[[Beowulf]]'', which he finished in 1926. He never published it. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than forty years after Tolkien's death and almost 90 years since its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Acocella |first=Joan |date=2 June 2014 |title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's 'Beowulf' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530222018/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all |archivedate=30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics]]", which had a lasting influence on ''Beowulf'' research.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about ''Beowulf'' is "widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ramey|first=Bill| date= 30 March 1998|url= http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |title=The Unity of Beowulf: Tolkien and the Critics|work = Wisdom's Children|accessdate =13 March 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060421094854/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |archivedate = 21 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated ''Beowulf'' for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of ''Beowulf'' was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''. Chiefly, p.4 in the Introduction by [[Alan Bliss]].&lt;/ref&gt; Where ''Beowulf'' does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at [[Finnsburg]], Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', the discussion of ''Eotena'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: "Beowulf is among my most valued sources", and this influence may be seen throughout his [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kennedy|first=Michael|year=2001|url= http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |title=Tolkien and Beowulf&amp;nbsp;– Warriors of Middle-earth|work=Amon Hen|accessdate =18 May 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060509110607/http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |archivedate = 9 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on ''Beowulf'':{{quote|He would come silently into the room, fix the audience with his gaze, and suddenly begin to declaim in a resounding voice the opening lines of the poem in the original Anglo-Saxon, commencing with a great cry of ''[[wikt:hwæt|Hwæt]]!'' (the first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be "Quiet!" It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that ''Beowulf'' was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Decades later, [[W.H. Auden]] wrote to his former professor,{{quote|I don't think that I have ever told you what an unforgettable experience it was for me as an undergraduate, hearing you recite ''Beowulf''. The voice was the voice of [[Gandalf]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

====Second World War====
[[File:Merton College and chapel from St Marys.JPG|thumb|[[Merton College]], where Tolkien was Professor of English Language and Literature (1945–1959)]]

In the run-up to the [[Second World War]], Tolkien was earmarked as a [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]].&lt;ref name="spy1"&gt;''Letters'', no. 35 (see also editorial note).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spy3"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wayne G.|last1=Hammond|author1-link=Wayne G.

In 1945, Tolkien moved to [[Merton College, Oxford]], becoming the [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]],&lt;ref name="Grotta2001 page 110 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Grotta |title=J.R.R. Tolkien Architect of Middle Earth |url={{Google books|9LHQvq6P5qIC|page=PA110|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=22 August 2010 |date=28 March 2001 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=978-0-7624-0956-3 |pages=110– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111194008/http://books.google.com/books?id=9LHQvq6P5qIC&amp;pg=PA110 |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for [[University College, Dublin]], for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the [[National University of Ireland]] (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.

Tolkien also translated the [[Book of Jonah]] for the ''[[Jerusalem Bible]]'', which was published in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, John. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Bible'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher John Reuel Tolkien]] (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against [[goblin]]s who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, [[The Father Christmas Letters]] (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and later years===
[[File:Oxford Tolkien.JPG|Bust of Tolkien in the chapel of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford]]|thumb]]
During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend [[C. S. Lewis]] even nominated him for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=16784 |title=Nomination Database |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=20 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094448/http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=16784 |archivedate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.&lt;ref name=DoughanBio/&gt; At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meras |first=Phyllis |date=15 January 1967 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-gandalf.html |title=Go, Go, Gandalf |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062436/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-gandalf.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a [[Tolkien fandom|cult-figure]], but admitted that "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!"&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually he and Edith moved to [[Bournemouth]], which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow [[Inklings]]. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]]:

{{quote|Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage.

===Final years===
Edith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. According to [[Simon Tolkien]]:
[[File:Tolkien's grave, Wolvercote Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of J. R. R. and [[Edith Tolkien]], [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]]]
{{quote|My grandmother died two years before my grandfather and he came back to live in Oxford. [[Merton College]] gave him rooms just off the High Street. I went there frequently and he'd take me to lunch in the Eastgate Hotel. Those lunches were rather wonderful for a 12-year-old boy spending time with his grandfather, but sometimes he seemed sad. There was one visit when he told me how much he missed my grandmother.

Tolkien was appointed by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1972 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45554 |date=1 January 1972 |page=9 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the insignia of the Order at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 28 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 334 (editorial note).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Oxford University conferred upon him an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|Doctorate of Letters]].&lt;ref name = "RoyalMail" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J.R.R.

Tolkien had the name [[Lúthien]] engraved on Edith's tombstone at [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]. When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyKDAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35#v=onepage&amp;q=jrr+tolkien+bleeding+ulcer|title=J.

The engravings read:

{{Quote box|width=20%|align=center|quote=&lt;center&gt;Edith Mary Tolkien&lt;br /&gt;'''Lúthien'''&lt;br /&gt;1889–1971&lt;br /&gt;John Ronald&lt;br /&gt;Reuel Tolkien&lt;br /&gt;'''Beren '''&lt;br /&gt;1892–1973&lt;/center&gt;|source=[[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]|qalign=center}}

In Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]], Lúthien was the most beautiful of all the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], and forsook her [[immortality]] for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth]], Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking [[wolf hunting with dogs|wolfhound]] [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf [[Carcharoth]], Lúthien, like [[Orpheus]], approached the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.

==Views==
[[File:Eagle and Child (interior).jpg|thumb|right|The Corner of [[the Eagle and Child]] Pub, Oxford, where the [[Inklings]] met (1930–1950)]]
Tolkien was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[Distributism|distributist]], and [[monarchism|monarchist]] leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, "My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy ([[philosophical anarchism|philosophically understood]], meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)—or to 'unconstitutional' [[monarchism|Monarchy]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 52, to Christopher Tolkien, 29 November 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the [[British Empire]] and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, "The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies."&lt;ref&gt;"The Tolkien Family Album", (1992), page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and [[simple living|simpler life]]. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', nos. 64, 131, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced "industrialization" of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;nbsp;– Creator of Middle Earth | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | type = DVD |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators&lt;ref name=MEreffotrForeword&gt;{{ME-ref|fotr|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. ''The Lord of the Rings'' is often thought to represent England during and immediately after the Second World War. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.&lt;ref name=MEreffotrForeword/&gt; This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien objected strongly to C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.&lt;ref&gt;Longenecker, Dwight (2008). "[http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia Why Tolkien said No to Narnia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430143646/http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia |date=30 April 2011 }}", Spero News, 12 November 2008. Retrieved 4 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tolkien wrote that the [[Mount Doom]] scene exemplified lines from the [[Lord's Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph (2003). "[http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/literature/why-tolkien-says.html Why Tolkien Says ''The Lord of the Rings'' Is Catholic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001193403/http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/literature/why-tolkien-says.html |date=1 October 2016 }}", National Catholic Register, 12–19 January 2003. Retrieved 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

His love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed [[mythology]] to be the divine echo of "the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ralph C. [http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/wood-biography.html Biography of J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973)]. Addison, Texas; Leadership University. Updated 13 July 2002. Retrieved 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was expressed in his poem and essay entitled ''[[Mythopoeia (poem)|Mythopoeia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, Mythopoeia (the poem), c. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory that myths held "fundamental truths" became a central theme of the Inklings in general.

===Religion===
Tolkien's devout Roman Catholic faith was a significant factor in the conversion of [[C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]] from [[atheism]] to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="CSL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Humphrey|year=1978|title=The Inklings|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-0-00-774869-3}} Lewis was brought up in the [[Church of Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He once said, "It may be said that the chief purpose of life, for any one of us, is to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ware |first=Jim |title=Finding God in The Hobbit |page=xxii |url={{Google books|N_0VhzQKIIAC|page=PR22|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-1-4143-0596-7 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his grandson [[Simon Tolkien]], Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the [[liturgical]] reforms and changes implemented after the [[Second Vatican Council]]:{{quote|I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.&lt;ref name="SimonTolkien"/&gt;}}

===Politics and race===

====Anti-Communism====
Tolkien voiced support for the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] (eventually led by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]) upon hearing that communist [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] were destroying churches and [[Red Terror (Spain)|killing priests and nuns]].&lt;ref name="Letters83"&gt;''Letters'', no. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien was contemptuous of [[Joseph Stalin]]. During World War{{nbsp}}II, Tolkien referred to Stalin as "that bloodthirsty old murderer".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that ''The Lord of the Rings'' was an [[anti-communist]] [[parable]] and identified [[Sauron]] with Stalin. Tolkien said, "I utterly repudiate any such ''reading'', which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]]. Such [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to National Socialism====
Tolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] prior to the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi "race-doctrine" as "wholly pernicious and unscientific". He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering "letting a German translation go hang".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; He provided two letters to Rütten &amp; Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that "[[Aryan]]" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,{{quote|But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject—which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in "Nordicism":{{quote|You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil. But no one ever calls on me to "broadcast" or do a postscript. Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this "Nordic" nonsense. Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]", a term he said he disliked because of its association with [[Nordic theory|racialist theories]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total war====
Tolkien criticized [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] use of [[total war|total-war]] tactics against civilians of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,—you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter—leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also reacted with anger to the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during World War II. In 1944 he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:{{quote|...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tolkien was horrified by the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as "these lunatic physicists" and "[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders".&lt;ref name="atom"&gt;
''Letters'', no. 102.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
During most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Clark |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Timmons |title=J.R.R.

==Writing==
Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his ''[[legendarium]]'', beginning with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during [[The Battle of the Somme]]. The two most prominent stories, the tale of [[Beren and Lúthien]] and that of [[Túrin]], were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'').

===Influences===
{{Main|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}

====British adventure stories====
One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] [[polymath]] [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; from which he took hints for the names of features such as the [[Dead Marshes]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mirkwood]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;183, note&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; along with some general aspects of approach.

[[Edward Wyke-Smith]]'s ''The Marvellous Land of Snergs'', with its "table-high" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo's race in ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien also cited [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[She (novel)|She]]'' in a telephone interview: "I suppose as a boy ''She'' interested me as much as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Resnick | first = Henry | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Tolkien | magazine = [[Niekas]] | pages = 37–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supposed facsimile of this [[potsherd]] appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom.

Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett|S. R. Crockett]]'s historical novel ''The Black Douglas'' and of basing the Necromancer ([[Sauron]]) on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', p. 391, footnote, quoted in Jared C. Lobdell ''The World of the Rings: Language, Religion, and Adventure in Tolkien'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are similar in narrative and style to the novel,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien.&lt;ref&gt;Lobdell, Jared C. (2004). ''The World of the Rings: Language, Religion, and Adventure in Tolkien'', pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====European mythology====
Tolkien was inspired by early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], especially [[Anglo-Saxons|Old English]], literature, [[Germanic poetry|poetry]], and [[Germanic paganism|mythology]], which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included [[Old English literature]] such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Saga|Norse sagas]] such as the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'',&lt;ref&gt;As described by Christopher Tolkien in ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks Konung'' (Oxford University, Trinity College).

Tolkien also acknowledged several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas. [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' he cited as inspiring elements of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''. In addition, Tolkien first read [[William Forsell Kirby]]'s translation of the Finnish [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', while attending King Edward's School. He described its character of [[Väinämöinen]] as one of his influences for [[Gandalf the Grey]]. The ''Kalevala'''s [[antihero]] [[Kullervo]] was further described as an inspiration for [[Túrin Turambar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Handwerk |first=Brian |date=1 March 2004 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1219_tolkienroots.html |title=Lord of the Rings Inspired by an Ancient Epic |work=National Geographic News |accessdate=13 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316192124/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1219_tolkienroots.html |archivedate=16 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitra Fimi]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], John Garth, and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] ([[Irish mythology|Irish]], [[Scottish mythology|Scottish]] and [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]]) history and legends.&lt;ref name="Fimi"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Fimi|first = Dimitra|year = 2006|title = 'Mad' Elves and 'elusive beauty': some Celtic strands of Tolkien's mythology|journal = Folklore |volume = 117|issue = 2|pages = 156–170 |issn = 1547-3155|doi = 10.1080/00155870600707847 |jstor=30035484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fimi | first = Dimitra | year = 2007 | title = Tolkien's {{'"}}Celtic" type of legends': Merging Traditions | journal = [[Tolkien Studies]] | volume = 4 | pages = 51–71 | issn = 1547-3155 | doi = 10.1353/tks.2007.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ''Silmarillion'' manuscript was rejected, in part for its "eye-splitting" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin:
{{quote|Needless to say they are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason. They have bright colour, but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design. They are in fact "mad" as your reader says—but I don't believe I am.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letter144"/&gt;}} Fimi pointed out that despite his dismissive remarks about "Celtic things" in 1937 that Tolkien was fluent in medieval Welsh (though not modern Welsh) and declared when delivering the first O'Donnell lectures at Oxford in 1954 about the influences of Celtic languages on the English language that "Welsh is beautiful".&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt;

One of Tolkien's purposes when writing his Middle-earth books was to create what his biographer Humphrey Carpenter called a "mythology for England" with Carpenter citing in support Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman complaining of the "poverty of my country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil)" unlike the Celtic nations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which all had their own well developed mythologies.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Tolkien himself never used the exact phrase "a mythology for England", but he often made statements to that effect, writing to one reader that his intention in writing the Middle-earth stories was "to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own".&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; In the early 20th century, proponents of Irish nationalism like the poet William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory and others had succeeded in linking in the public mind traditional Irish folk tales of fairies and elves to Irish national identity while denigrating English folk tales as being merely derivative of Irish folk tales.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; This had prompted a backlash by English writers, leading to a savage war of words about which nation had the more authentic and better fairy tales with for example the English essayist G. K. Chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Even though there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Tolkien with his determination to write a "mythology for England" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' of the semi-divine [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha Dé Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha Dé Danann are driven underground, which causes their "fading", leading them to become diminutive and pale.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt;

====Catholicism====
Catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.&lt;ref name=DayTolkiensRing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bofetti|first=Jason|date=November 2001|url= http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm |title=Tolkien's Catholic Imagination|work = Crisis Magazine|accessdate =30 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821111145/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien acknowledged this himself:
{{quote|''The Lord of the Rings'' is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like "religion", to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Specifically, [[Paul H. Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the [[absence of good]]. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's "Lidless Eye": "the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], "whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kocher | first = Paul H. | year = 1972 | title = Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | pages = 76–77 | isbn = 978-0-395-14097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Shippey]] makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with [[Alfred the Great]]'s Anglo-Saxon translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', known as the ''[[Lays of Boethius]]''. Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: "evil is nothing". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of [[Frodo]]'s remark, "the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own", and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shippey | first = Tom | year = 1983 | title = The Road to Middle-earth | pages = 140–141 | isbn = 978-0-395-33973-2 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean heresy]]), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.&lt;ref&gt;''Road'', pp.&amp;nbsp;141–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stratford Caldecott]] also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: "The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldecott |first=Stratford |date=January–February 2002 |url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |title=The Lord &amp; Lady of the Rings |work=Touchstone Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426033720/http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |archivedate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

====''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''====
{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}
As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:{{quote|As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. (1963). ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''. Oxford. pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Children's books and other short works====
In addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillip |first=Norman |year=2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |title=The Prevalence of Hobbits |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062440/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''). Other works included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.

====''The Hobbit''====
Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen &amp; Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit"/&gt; When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.

====''The Lord of the Rings''====
The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.

Tolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=5 June 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |title=Oxford Calling |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genre that grew up after the success of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

''The Lord of the Rings'' became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seiler |first=Andy |date=16 December 2003 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-12-12-lotr-main_x.htm |title='Rings' comes full circle |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019074732/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-12-12-lotr-main_x.htm |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2003 "[[Big Read]]" survey conducted by the BBC, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was found to be the UK's "Best-loved Novel".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031065136/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml |date=31 October 2012 }}.

===Posthumous publications===

====''The Silmarillion''====
Tolkien wrote a brief "Sketch of the Mythology", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] (1993). ''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography'', London: Saint Paul's Biographies, {{ISBN|1-873040-11-3}}, American edition {{ISBN|0-938768-42-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[Númenor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]].

Tolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his [[literary executor]], and he (with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.&lt;ref name="WWE-1978"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Unfinished Tales'' and ''The History of Middle-earth''====
In 1980 Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title ''[[Unfinished Tales|Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth]]''. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Martinez |first=Michael|date=27 July 2002|url= http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |work = Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |accessdate =28 April 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Mr. Bliss''====
One of Tolkien's least-known short works is the [[Children's literature|children's storybook]] ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.

====''The Children of Húrin''====
More recently, in 2007, ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[Túrin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.

====''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún''====
''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modelled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.

According to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, "He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them."&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'', page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1967 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien wrote,{{quote|Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganising ''[[Völuspá|The Song of the Sibyl]]''. In return again I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn't lost), a thing I did many years ago when trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the Völsungs from the Elder Edda, written in the old eight-line [[fornyrðislag]] stanza.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''The Fall of Arthur''====
''[[The Fall of Arthur]]'', published on 23 May 2013, is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early-1930s. It is [[alliterative poem|alliterative]], extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the [[Old English poetry|Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' metre in Modern English.  Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman [[Migration Period]], both in form (using [[Germanic poetry|Germanic verse]]) and in content, showing Arthur as a [[Sub-Roman Britain|British]] [[warlord]] fighting the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Saxon invasion]], while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British "counter-invasion" to the [[Old Saxony|Saxon lands]] (''Arthur eastward in arms purposed'').&lt;ref&gt;announcing the 2013 edition, ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 9 October 2012 published the poem's first nine verses; Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur 'New' JRR Tolkien epic due out next year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202023157/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur |date=2 December 2016 }} guardian.co.uk, Tuesday 9 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary''====
''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher. The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf translation to be published |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415081413/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |archivedate=15 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also includes the previously unpublished "Sellic Spell" and two versions of "The Lay of Beowulf".

====''The Story of Kullervo''====
''[[The Story of Kullervo]]'', first published in ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'' in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015, is a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem. It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Flood |first=Alison |date=12 August 2015 |title=JRR Tolkien's first fantasy story to be published this month |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/12/jrr-tolkiens-first-fantasy-story-to-be-published-this-month |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202024432/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/12/jrr-tolkiens-first-fantasy-story-to-be-published-this-month |archivedate=2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript locations===
Before his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Hobbit'' and ''Farmer Giles of Ham''—to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at [[Marquette University]]'s John P.

==Languages and philology==

===Linguistic career===
Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and [[philology]]. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as his special subject.  He worked for the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including [[walrus]], over which he struggled mightily.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winchester, Simon]] (2003). ''[[The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860702-4}}; and Gilliver, Peter, Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner (2006). ''The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-861069-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]]. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a "[[Viking revival|Viking Club]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 7, to the Electors of the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, 27 June 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;Grotta, Daniel (2001). ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Architect of Middle Earth''. Philadelphia, Running Press. {{ISBN|0-7624-0956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Tolkien was attracted to "things of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture ''[[English and Welsh]]'', which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the "native language" as opposed to the "cradle-tongue" which a person first learns to speak.&lt;ref&gt;''English and Welsh'', O'Donnell Lecture, 1955, cited in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] &amp; [[Christina Scull]]: ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide: Reader's Guide'', London, HarperCollins 2006, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] dialect of Middle English to be his own "native language", and, as he wrote to [[W. H. Auden]] in 1955, "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it)."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language construction===
{{See also|Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien}}
[[File:Quenya Example.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|''Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of trees!'', the beginning of the Quenya poem [[Namárië]] written in [[Tengwar]] and in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script]]

Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for [[constructed languages|constructing languages]]. The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[esthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from "phonaesthetic" considerations; it was intended as an "Elvenlatin", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.&lt;ref name="letter144"&gt;''Letters'', no. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Adûnaic]] or [[Númenórean]], a language of a "faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the "[[Second Age]]" and the story of [[Eärendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century "real primary world" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.

Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html|title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice'|last=Corsetti|first=Renato|date=31 January 2018|website=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Your language construction will breed a mythology", but by 1956 he had concluded that "[[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &amp;c, &amp;c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends".&lt;ref name="letter180"&gt;''Letters'', no. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.

== Artwork ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}
He was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Big-Picture/The-fine-art-of-weaving-a-Tolkien-tale|title=The fine art of weaving a Tolkien tale|last=France|first=Connexion|website=''connexionfrance.com''|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses the paintings, drawings, and sketches of J.R.R. Tolkien and in total includes 200 reproductions of his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|oclc=33450124|title=J.R.R.

===Adaptations===
{{Main|Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien}}

In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a "body of more or less connected legend", of which "[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thygesen |first=Peter |date=Autumn 1999 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-46949881.html |title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age |work=Scandinavian Review |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227234252/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-46949881.html |archivedate=27 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as "too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':
{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected "blurbs", which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.&lt;ref name="letter144"/&gt;}}

He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", first presented in 1939:
{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ... Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy. Fantasy, even of the simplest kind, hardly ever succeeds in Drama, when that is presented as it should be, visibly and audibly acted.&lt;ref name="On Fairy-Stories"&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", in {{ME-ref|T&amp;L}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Film adaptations====
Tolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word ''Tollywood'', a portmanteau derived from "Tolkien Hollywood", to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in [[Tolkien's legendarium]] aimed at generating good [[Box office#Usage|box office]] results, rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1090-tollywood-and-the-hobbit-of-the-rings.php |title=Tollywood and The Hobbit of the Rings, Vol. I |publisher=Tolkienlibrary.com |accessdate=15 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826163033/http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1090-tollywood-and-the-hobbit-of-the-rings.php |archivedate=26 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote:
{{quote|I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene ("yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the first film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was released in 1978 as an animated [[rotoscoping]] film directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] with screenplay by the fantasy writer [[Peter S. Beagle]]. It covered only the first half of the story of ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=15 November 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html |title=Film: 'The Lord of the Rings' From Ralph Bakshi |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062438/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, an [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[television film]] of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was made by [[Rankin-Bass]], and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', which covered some of the portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' that Bakshi was unable to complete.

From 2001 to 2003, [[New Line Cinema]] released ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous [[Academy Awards|Oscars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3495748.stm |title=Rings scores Oscars clean sweep|work=BBC News|date= 1 March 2004|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 to 2014, [[Warner Bros.]] and [[New Line Cinema]] released ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', a series of three films based on ''The Hobbit'', with [[Peter Jackson]] serving as executive producer, director, and co-writer.&lt;ref name=february&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/the-hobbit-pics-to-shoot-in-february-1118025794/ |title='The Hobbit' Pics to Shoot in February |work=Variety |date=15 October 2010 |first=Dave |last=McNary |accessdate=20 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106100437/http://variety.com/2010/film/news/the-hobbit-pics-to-shoot-in-february-1118025794/ |archivedate=6 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first instalment, ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', was released in December 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehobbit.com/releasedates/release-dates.html |title=The Hobbit Worldwide Release Dates |publisher=TheHobbit.com |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215171953/http://www.thehobbit.com/releasedates/release-dates.html |archivedate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second, ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', in December 2013;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehobbit.com/releasedates/index.html |title=The Hobbit Worldwide Release Dates |publisher=TheHobbit.com |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109153155/http://www.thehobbit.com/releasedates/index.html |archivedate=9 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last instalment, ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appcloud.warnerbros.com/thehobbit/releasedates/ |title=The Hobbit : The Battle of the Five Armies Movie 2014 – Worldwide Release Dates |publisher=warnerbros.com |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227165759/http://appcloud.warnerbros.com/thehobbit/releasedates/ |archivedate=27 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People of Stoke-on-Trent |url=http://www.thepotteries.org/people/tolkien_john.htm |accessdate=13 March 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312180155/http://www.thepotteries.org/people/tolkien_john.htm |archivedate=12 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hall Green]] and [[Moseley]] areas of [[Birmingham]] there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien—most notably, the Millstream Way and [[Moseley Bog]].&lt;ref name="Country Park"/&gt; Collectively the parks are known as the Shire Country Parks.&lt;ref name="Country Park"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4147809.stm |title=Nature reserve remembers Baggins |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=10 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004103/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4147809.stm |archivedate=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in [[Weston-super-Mare]], Somerset, England there are a collection of roads in the 'Weston Village' named after locales of Middle Earth, namely Hobbiton Road, Bree Close, Arnor Close, Rivendell, Westmarch Way and Buckland Green.

In the Dutch town of [[Geldrop]], near [[Eindhoven]], the streets of an entire new neighbourhood are named after Tolkien himself ("Laan van Tolkien") and some of the best-known characters from his books.

In the Silicon Valley towns of [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in California, there are two housing developments with street names drawn from Tolkien's works. About a dozen Tolkien-derived street names also appear scattered throughout the town of [[Lake Forest, California]]. The [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], Maryland, neighbourhood of Hobbit's Glen and its street names (including [[Rivendell]] Lane, Tooks Way, and Oakenshield Circle) come from Tolkien's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bethan |last=Phillips |date=13 March 2012 |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9585643.Southampton_pub_The_Hobbit_in_battle_with_Hollywood/?action=complain&amp;cid=10185912 |title=The Hobbit in battle with Hollywood |work=[[Southern Daily Echo]] |accessdate=10 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305074330/http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9585643.Southampton_pub_The_Hobbit_in_battle_with_Hollywood/?action=complain&amp;cid=10185912 |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given scientific names honouring, or deriving from, characters or other fictional elements from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and other works set in [[Middle-earth]].&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several taxa have been named after the character [[Gollum]] (also known as Sméagol), as well as for various [[hobbit]]s, the small humanlike creatures such as [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]]. Various [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], and other creatures that appear in his writings as well as Tolkien himself have been honoured in the names of several species, including the amphipod ''[[Leucothoe (amphipod)|Leucothoe tolkieni]]'', and the wasp ''[[Shireplitis|Shireplitis tolkieni]]''. In 2004, the extinct hominid ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was described, and quickly earned the nickname "hobbit" due to its small size.&lt;ref name=Aiello&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21255 |last1=Aiello |first1=Leslie C. |title=Five years of ''Homo floresiensis'' |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |pages=167–179 |volume=142 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pmid=20229502 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Paleontologist [[Leigh Van Valen]] named over 20 taxa of extinct mammals after Tolkien lore in a single paper.&lt;ref name="Gee p55"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gee |first1=Henry |title=The Science of Middle-earth |date=2004 |publisher=Cold Spring Press |location=Cold Spring Harbor, NY |isbn=978-1593600235 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Valen1978"&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.

There are seven [[blue plaque]]s in England that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham and one in Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' and most of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

===Artwork===

In 2012, Tolkien was among the [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icons]] selected by artist Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New faces on Sgt Pepper album cover for artist Peter Blake's 80th birthday |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/peter-blake-sgt-pepper-cover-revisited |work=The Guardian |date=11 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105095109/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/peter-blake-sgt-pepper-cover-revisited |archivedate=5 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Peter Blake's new Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album cover |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17583026 |publisher=BBC |date=11 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103234105/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17583026 |archivedate=3 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autographs===
[[File:JRR Tolkien signature - from Commons.svg|thumb|Tolkien rarely signed his works, and his autograph has become highly valued by collectors.]]
Unlike other authors of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of ''The Hobbit'' from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|eHAyr784pREC|page=PA163|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |title=The Essential J.R.R.

===Possible canonization===
On 2 September 2017, a traditional low mass was held at the [[Oxford Oratory]] to mark the anniversary of his death. The mass was offered, however, not for the repose of Tolkien's soul – but rather praying for his Cause for [[beatification]] to be opened. Since then religious groups were founded promoting his cause towards sainthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://file770.com/tolkien-an-unexpected-sainthood/|title=Tolkien: An Unexpected Sainthood|work=file770.com|accessdate=25 October 2017|date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epicpew.com/tolkien-canonization-cause/|title="Saint Tolkien": Why This English Don Is on the Path to Sainthood|work=epicpew.com|accessdate=6 July 2018|date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palacestairslocation.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Location of the Jordan Staircase, within the palace.]]

The principal or '''Jordan Staircase''' of the [[Winter Palace]], [[St Petersburg]] is so called because on the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] the Tsar descended this [[imperial staircase]] in state for the ceremony of the "Blessing of the Waters" of the [[Neva River]], a celebration of [[Jesus|Christ]]'s [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] in the [[Jordan River]]. The staircase is one of the few parts of the palace retaining the original 18th-century style. The massive grey granite columns, however, were added in the mid 19th century.{{sfnp|Budberg|1969|p=198|ps=}}

The staircase was badly damaged by a fire that swept the palace in 1837, but [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] ordered the architect in charge of reconstruction, [[Vasily Stasov]], to restore the staircase using [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]'s original plans. Stasov made two small changes: he replaced the original gilt bronze handrails with white marble and the original pink columns with gray granite.{{sfnp|Norman|1998|pp=72–73|ps=}}

The stair hall, which has an 18th-century ceiling depicting the Gods at Olympus, is decorated with [[alabaster]] statues of [[Sophia (wisdom)|Wisdom]] and [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]] by Mikhail Terebenev (1795-1866);
[[wikt:grandeur|Grandeur]] and [[Wealth|Opulence]] by Alexander Ustinov (1796-1868); [[Fidelity]] and [[Equity (economics)|Equity]] by Ivan Leppe; and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] by Apollon Manyulov. At the centre of the first landing is an anonymous 18th-century marble sculpture, [[Sovereignty|Allegory of the State]].{{r|History}}

During state receptions and functions the Jordan Staircase was a focal point for arriving guests. After entering the palace through the Ambassadors' entrance, in the central courtyard, they would pass through the colonnaded ground floor Jordan Hall before ascending the staircase to the state apartments. Following a ball at the Winter Palace in 1902, [[Millicent Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|The Duchess of Sutherland]] wrote: "The stairs of the palace were guarded by cossacks, with hundreds of footmen in scarlet liveries, I have never in my life seen so brilliant a sight&amp;mdash;the light, the uniforms, the enormous rooms, the crowd, the music, making a spectacle that was almost Barbaric."{{sfnp|Stuart|1982|p=97|ps=}}

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its original decoration.

The '''Kungur Chronicle''', also known as the '''Kungur Chronicler''' and '''Brief Siberian Kungur Chronicle''' (''Кунгурская летопись'', ''Кунгурский летописец'', ''Летопись сибирская краткая Кунгурская'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) is one of the [[Siberian Chronicles]], written in the late 16th century by one of [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s companions during his [[Siberia]]n campaign.

The full version of the Kungur Chronicle did not survive to this day. It was partially included in one of the Siberian Chronicles known as the [[Remezov Chronicle]]. The Kungur Chronicle contains the description of Yermak's Siberian campaign and valuable [[historic]], [[geographic]] and [[ethnographic]] data on Siberia and its 16th-century inhabitants. It is written in a folk [[Cossack]]-style language.

'''National syndicalism''' is an adaptation of [[syndicalism]] to suit the social agenda of [[integral nationalism]]. National syndicalism developed in [[France]], and then spread to [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]].

== France ==
French National syndicalism was an adaptation of [[Georges Sorel]]'s version of [[revolutionary syndicalism]] to the monarchist ideology of integral nationalism, as practised by [[Action Française]]. ''Action Française'' was a French nationalist-monarchist movement led by [[Charles Maurras]].

===Background (1900–1908)===
In 1900, [[Charles Maurras]] declared in ''Action Française'''s newspaper that anti-democratic socialism is the "pure"&lt;ref&gt;
"''a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element'' fits nationalism as a well-made glove fits a beautiful hand" (italics in original). Published in L'Action française, page 863, 15 November 1900. Quoted in 
{{cite book|last1=Sternhell|first1=Zeev|authorlink1=Zeev Sternhell|last2=Sznajder|first2=Mario|last3=Ashéri|first3=Maia|title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|edition=Third printing, and first paperback printing|year= 1995|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-03289-0|page=82}}

: {{cite book|last=Mazgaj|first=Paul|title=The Action française and  Revolutionary Syndicalism|year=1979|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-0-8078-1316-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and correct form of socialism. From then on, he and other members of ''Action Française'' (like [[Jacques Bainville]], [[:fr:Jean Rivain|Jean Rivain]], and [[Georges Valois]]) interested in Sorel's thought discussed the similarity between the movements in ''Action Française'''s conferences and in essays published in the movement's newspaper, hoping to form a collaboration with revolutionary syndicalists. Such collaboration was formed in 1908 with a group of labor unions' leaders led by [[Émile Janvion]] . As a result of this collaboration, Janvion founded the journal ''[[Terre libre]]''.

===Beginning (1909)===
The collaboration between the integral nationalism of ''Action Française'' and the revolutionary syndicalism of Georges Sorel began in 1909. The connection was formed after Sorel read the second edition of Maurras' book, ''Enquête sur la monarchie''. Maurras favorably mentioned Sorel and revolutionary syndicalism in the book, and even sent a copy of the new edition to Sorel. Sorel read the book, and in April 1909 wrote a praising letter to Maurras. Three months later, on 10 July, Sorel published in ''Il Divenire sociale'' (the leading journal of Italian revolutionary syndicalism), an essay admiring Maurras and ''Action Française''. Sorel based his support on his anti-democratic thought. For example, he claimed that ''Action Française'' was the only force capable to fight against democracy.&lt;ref&gt;
"A vigorous protest had to be made against this spirit of decadence: no other group except Action française was able to fulfill a role requiring both literacy and faith. The friends of Maurras form an audacious avant-garde engaged in a fight to the finish against the boors who have corrupted
everything they have touched in our country. The merit of these young people will appear great in history, for we may hope that due to them the reign of stupidity will come to an end some day near at hand".

&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Action Française'' reprinted the essay in its newspaper on 22 August, titled "Anti-parliamentary Socialists".

===La cité française and L'Indépendance (1910–1913)===
In 1910 Sorel and Valois decided to create a national-socialist journal called ''La cité française''. A prospectus for the new journal was published in July 1910, signed by both revolutionary syndicalists (Georges Sorel and [[Édouard Berth]]) and ''Action Française'' members ([[Jean Variot]], [[Pierre Gilbert]] and Georges Valois). ''La cité française'' never got off the ground because of Georges Valois's animosity toward Jean Variot.

After the failure of ''La cité française'', Sorel decided to found his own journal. Sorel's biweekly review, called ''L'Indépendance'', was published from March 1911 to July 1913. Its themes were the same as the journal of ''Action Française'', such as [[nationalism]], [[antisemitism]], and a desire to defend the French culture and heritage of ancient Greece and Rome.

===Cercle Proudhon===
{{Details|Cercle Proudhon}}
During the preparations for launching ''La Cité française'', Sorel encouraged Berth and Valois to work together. In March 1911, [[:fr:Henri Lagrange|Henri Lagrange]] (a member of  ''Action Française'') suggested to Valois that they found an economic and social study group for nationalists. Valois persuaded Lagrange to open the group to non-nationalists who were anti-democratic and syndicalists (Valois wrote later that the aim of the group was to provide "a common platform for nationalists and leftist anti-democrats"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Sternhell|first=Zeev|title=Neither right nor left: fascist ideology in France|year=1986|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton,  New Jersey, USA|isbn=978-0-691-00629-1|authorlink=Zeev Sternhell|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The new political group, called ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', was founded on 16 December 1911. It included Berth, Valois, Lagrange, the syndicalist [[Albert Vincent]] and the royalists [[:fr:Gilbert Maire|Gilbert Maire]], [[René de Marans]], [[André Pascalon]], and [[Marius Riquier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Allen|title=From fascism to libertarian communism: Georges Valois against the Third Republic|year=1992|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Los Angeles]]|isbn=978-0-520-07678-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name ''Cercle Proudhon'' suggests, the group was inspired by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. It was also inspired by Georges Sorel and Charles Maurras. In January 1912 the journal of ''Cercle Proudhon'' was first published, entitled ''Cahiers du cercle Proudhon''.

== Italy ==
In the early 20th century, nationalists and syndicalists were increasingly influencing each other in Italy.&lt;ref name="Zeev Sternhell 1994. Pp. 161"&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; From 1902 to 1910, a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists including [[Arturo Labriola]], [[Agostino Lanzillo]], [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]], [[Alceste De Ambris]], [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Sergio Panunzio]] sought to unify the Italian nationalist cause with the syndicalist cause and had entered into contact with Italian nationalist figures such as [[Enrico Corradini]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994. pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; These Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of [[bourgeois]] values, [[democracy]], [[liberalism]], [[Marxism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], and [[pacifism]] while promoting [[heroism]], [[vitalism]], and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Italian revolutionary syndicalists joined the Fascist cause, but most syndicalist leaders eventually embraced nationalism and "were among the founders of the Fascist movement," where "many even held key posts" in Mussolini's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benito Mussolini]] declared in 1909 that he had converted over to revolutionary syndicalism by 1904 during a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrico Corradini promoted a form of national syndicalism that utilized [[Charles Maurras|Maurassian]] nationalism alongside the syndicalism of [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref name="Zeev Sternhell 1994. Pp. 163"&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Corradini spoke of the need for a national syndicalist movement that would be able to solve Italy's problems, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action through a willingness to fight.&lt;ref name="Zeev Sternhell 1994. Pp. 163"/&gt; Corradini spoke of Italy as being a "proletarian nation" that needed to pursue [[imperialism]] in order to challenge the "[[Plutocracy|plutocratic]]" nations of France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Martin Blinkhorn Pp. 9"&gt;Martin Blinkhorn. ''Mussolini and fascist Italy''. Second edition. New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2003 Pp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI) that claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption within its political class, liberalism, and division caused by "ignoble socialism".&lt;ref name="Martin Blinkhorn Pp. 9"/&gt; The ANI held ties and influence amongst [[Conservatism|conservatives]], Catholics, and the business community.&lt;ref name="Martin Blinkhorn Pp. 9"/&gt;

A number of Italian fascist leaders began to relabel national syndicalism as [[Fascist syndicalism]]. Mussolini was one of the first to disseminate this term, explaining that "Fascist syndicalism is national and productivistic… in a national society in which labor becomes a joy, an object of pride and a title to nobility."&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p 216, note 42, Mussolini "Commento" in ''Opera omnia'', vol. 18, pp. 228-229&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[Edmondo Rossoni]] became secretary-general of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations in December 1922, other Italian national syndicalists were adopting the "Fascist syndicalism" phrase in their aim at "building and reorganizing political structures… through a synthesis of State and labor."&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Gentile, ''The Origins of Fascist Ideology 1918-1925'',  New York, NY, Enigma Books, 2005, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; An early leader in Italian trade unionism, Rossoni and other fascist syndicalists not only took the position of radical nationalism, but favored "class struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, edit., ''Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe,'' chap. 2: Roland Sarti, "Italian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals," London/New York, Routledge, 2001, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Seen at the time as "radical or leftist elements," Rossoni and his syndicalist cadre had "served to some extent to protect the immediate economic interests of the workers and to preserve their class consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Rossoni was dismissed from his post in 1928, which could have been due his powerful leadership position in the Fascist unions,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; and his hostilities to the business community, occasionally referring to industrialists as "vampires" and "profiteers."&lt;ref&gt;''Lavoro d'Italia'', January 6, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Sergio Panunzio noted the national solidarity within France and Germany that suddenly arose in response to the war and claimed that should Italy enter the war, the Italian nation would become united and would emerge from the war as a new nation in a "''Fascio nazionale''" (national union) that would be led by an aristocracy of warrior-producers that would unite Italians of all classes, factions, and regions into a disciplined socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Gregor. ''Mussolini's intellectuals: fascist social and political thought''. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2005. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1918, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] defined national syndicalism as a doctrine that would unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Gregor. ''Mussolini's intellectuals: fascist social and political thought''. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2005. Pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iberian Peninsula==
{{Synthesis|date=July 2017}}
National syndicalism in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is a political theory very different from the fascist idea of corporatism, inspired by [[Integralism]] and the [[Action Française]] (for a [[France|French]] parallel, see [[Cercle Proudhon]]). It was formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos]] in a manifesto published in his periodical ''[[La Conquista del Estado]]'' on 14 March 1931.

National syndicalism was intended to win over the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) to a corporatist nationalism. Ledesma's manifesto was discussed in the CNT congress of 1931. However, the National Syndicalist movement effectively emerged as a separate political tendency. Later the same year, [[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]] was formed, and subsequently voluntarily fused with [[Falange|Falange Española]]. In 1936 Franco forced a further less voluntary merger with traditionalist [[Carlism]], to create a single party on the Nationalist side of the Spanish Civil War.
During the war, Falangists fought against the Second Spanish Republic, which had the armed support of CNT.
It was one of the ideological bases of [[Francoist Spain]], especially in the early years.

The ideology was present in [[Portugal]] with the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista]] (active in the early 1930s), its leader [[Francisco Rolão Preto]] being a collaborator of Falange ideologue [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]].

The Spanish version theory has influenced the [[Kataeb Party]] in [[Lebanon]], the [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] in [[Poland]] and various [[Falangism in Latin America|Falangist groups in Latin America]].

The [[Unidad Falangista Montañesa]] maintains a [[trade union]] wing, called the Association of National-Syndicalist Workers.

'''OpenStreetMap''' ('''OSM''') is a [[virtual community|collaborative project]] to create a [[free content|free]] editable [[map]] of the world. Rather than the map itself, the [[geodata|data]] generated by the project is considered its primary output. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable [[satellite navigation]] devices.&lt;ref name="GPS-inspires-DIY" /&gt; OSM is considered a prominent example of [[volunteered geographic information]].

Created by [[Steve Coast]] in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia&lt;ref name="tc10"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-open-mapping-data/ |title=For the Love of Mapping Data |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |last=Lardinois |first=Frederic |date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the predominance of [[Vendor lock-in|proprietary]] map data in the UK and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OpenStreetMap: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World |author1=Frederick Ramm |author2=Jochen Topf |author3=Steve Chilton |publisher=UIT Cambridge |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has grown to over 2 million registered users,&lt;ref&gt;

This [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] data is then made available under the [[Open Database License]]. The site is supported by the [[OpenStreetMap Foundation]], a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales.

The data from OSM is available for use in both traditional applications, like its usage by [[Facebook]], [[Craigslist]], [[OsmAnd]], [[Geocaching]], [[MapQuest]] Open, [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP statistical software]], and [[Foursquare]] to replace [[Google Maps]], and more unusual roles like replacing the default data included with GPS receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OSM Maps on Garmin |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Map_On_Garmin |publisher=OpenStreetMap Wiki |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenStreetMap data has been favourably compared with proprietary datasources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zielstra |first=Dennis |title=Comparing Shortest Paths Lengths of Free and Proprietary Data for Effective Pedestrian Routing in Street Networks |url=http://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu/hochmair/pubs/TRR_zielstra_hochmair_2012_finaldraft.pdf |publisher=University of Florida, Geomatics Program |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215023804/http://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu/hochmair/pubs/TRR_zielstra_hochmair_2012_finaldraft.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in 2009 data quality varied across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haklay |first=M. |date=2010 |url=https://kfrichter.org/crowdsourcing-material/day1/haklay10.pdf |title=How good is volunteered geographical information?

==History==
[[File:Steve Coast - OSM im Rheinland (0604).jpg|thumb|The founder of OSM, [[Steve Coast]], in 2009.]]

[[Steve Coast]] founded the project in 2004, initially focusing on mapping the United Kingdom. In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the [[Ordnance Survey]] created massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them. The first contribution, made in the British city of [[London]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coast |first1=Steve |title=Changest #1 on OpenStreetMap |url=https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/1 |website=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=September 19, 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was thought to be a road by the Directions Mag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sinton |first1=Diana |title=OSM: The simple map that became a global movement |url=https://www.directionsmag.com/article/1163 |website=The Directions Mag |accessdate=September 19, 2018 |date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2006, the [[OpenStreetMap Foundation]] was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free [[geospatial]] data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its [[aerial photography]] as a backdrop for map production.&lt;ref name="ogd-Coast1" /&gt;

In April 2007, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] (AND) donated a complete road data set for the [[Netherlands]] and [[trunk road]] data for [[India]] and China to the project&lt;ref name="ogd-Coast3" /&gt; and by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users. Sponsors of the event included [[Google]], Yahoo! and [[Multimap.com|Multimap]]. In October 2007, OpenStreetMap completed the import of a [[United States Census Bureau|US Census]] [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] road dataset.&lt;ref name="Boeing2017CEUS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309738462_OSMnx_New_Methods_for_Acquiring_Constructing_Analyzing_and_Visualizing_Complex_Street_Networks |author=Boeing, G. |title=OSMnx: New Methods for Acquiring, Constructing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Complex Street Networks |journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems |date=2017 |volume=65 |pages=126-139 |accessdate=26 August 2017 |doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.05.004|arxiv=1611.01890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linux" /&gt; In December 2007, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] became the first major organisation to use OpenStreetMap data on their main website.&lt;ref name="geothought" /&gt;

Ways to import and export data have continued to grow – by 2008, the project developed tools to export OpenStreetMap data to power portable GPS units, replacing their existing proprietary and out-of-date maps.&lt;ref name="systemed" /&gt; In March, two founders{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=of what?}} announced that they have received venture capital funding of €2.4{{nbsp}}million for CloudMade, a commercial company that uses OpenStreetMap data.&lt;ref name="CloudMade2" /&gt; In November 2010, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] changed their licence to allow use of their satellite imagery for making maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.bing.com/maps/2010/11/23/bing-engages-open-maps-community |title=Bing engages open maps community |date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the launch of pricing for [[Google Maps]] led several prominent websites to switch from their service to OpenStreetMap and other competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fossum |first=Mike |title=Websites Bypassing Google Maps Due to Fees |url=http://www.webpronews.com/websites-bypassing-google-maps-due-to-new-fees-2012-03 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief amongst these were [[Foursquare]], [[Craigslist]] who adopted OpenStreetMap, and [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], which ended a contract with Google and launched a self-built mapping platform which uses [[TomTom]] and OpenStreetMap data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ingraham |first=Nathan |title=Apple using TomTom and OpenStreetMap data in iOS 6 Maps app |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/11/3078987/apple-tomtom-openstreemap-ios-6-maps-app |accessdate=13 November 2012 |date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Map production==
[[File:Adding data to OSM after mapping Brighton Pier.jpg|thumb|Editing with [[JOSM]] after a ground survey]]
Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. [[Mapathon]] competition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non-profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area.

The availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Import/Guidelines |url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines |website=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=23 March 2015 |quote=The import guidelines, along with the Automated Edits code of conduct, should be followed when importing data into the OpenStreetMap database as they embody many lessons learned throughout the history of OpenStreetMap. Imports should be planned and executed with more care and sensitive than other edits, because poor imports can have significant impacts on both existing data and local mapping community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software for editing maps===
[[File:StreetComplete - House number quest.png|alt=A map with different colored icons on it, currently a quest about a house number|thumb|StreetComplete asking user a question, with answer filled in. After tapping "OK" this answer will be added to an OpenStreetMap database.]]
Editing of maps can be done using the default web browser editor called [[iD (software)|iD]], an [[HTML5]] application using [[D3.js]] and written by [[Mapbox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://Mapbox.com/blog/announcing-id/ |title=A New Editor for OpenStreetMap: iD |author=Saman Bemel Benrud |publisher=Mapbox |date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was originally financed by the [[Knight Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://knightfoundation.org/articles/collaborating-improve-openstreetmap-infrastructure |title=Collaborating to improve OpenStreetMap infrastructure |author=Alex Barth |date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The earlier Flash-based application [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch]] is retained for intermediate-level users. [[JOSM]] and [[Merkaartor]] are more powerful desktop editing applications that are better suited for advanced users.

Vespucci is a first full featured editor for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], it was released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://vespucci.io/ |title=Welcome to Vespucci |access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; StreetComplete is new easy Android app launched in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zwick |first=Tobias |title=StreetComplete: Surveyor app for Android |date=21 February 2018 |url=https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete |accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which allows users without any OpenStreetMap knowledge to answer simple quests for existing data in OpenStreetMap, and thus contribute data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete |title=StreetComplete - OpenStreetMap Wiki |website=wiki.openstreetmap.org |language=en|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maps.me]] is a mobile application (which runs on both Android and iOS) offering offline maps which also includes a limited OSM data editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.maps.me/hc/en-us/sections/201941155 |title= Map editor  |website=maps.me |access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[openstreetmap:Go_Map!!|Go Map!!]] is an iOS app that lets you create and edit information in OpenStreetMap. [http://www.pushpinosm.org Pushpin] is another iOS app that lets you add POI on the go.

===Contributors===
The project has a geographically diverse user-base, due to emphasis of local knowledge and [[ground truth]] in the process of data collection. Many early contributors were [[Bicycle|cyclists]] who survey with and for bicyclists, charting [[Bikeway|cycleroutes]] and navigable trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key and More Info |url=http://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/ |publisher=OpenCycleMap |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are [[Geographic Information System|GIS]] professionals who contribute data with [[Esri]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vines |first=Emily |title=Esri Releases ArcGIS Editor for OpenStreetMap |url=http://www.esri.com/news/releases/10_3qtr/openstreetmap.html |publisher=Esri |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors are predominately men, with only 3-5% being women.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender and Experience-Related Motivators for Contributing to OpenStreetMap". https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_218905.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2008, shortly after the second The State of the Map conference was held, there were over 50,000 registered contributors; by March 2009, there were 100,000 and by the end of 2009 the figure was nearly 200,000. In April 2012, OpenStreetMap cleared 600,000 registered contributors.&lt;ref name="osm-wiki-stats" /&gt; On 6 January 2013, OpenStreetMap reached 1 million registered users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Harry |title=1 million OpenStreetMappers |url=http://opengeodata.org/1-million-openstreetmappers |work=OpenGeoData |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30% of users have contributed at least one point to the OpenStreetMap database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Neis |first=Pascal |title=The OpenStreetMap Contributors Map aka Who's around me? |url=http://neis-one.org/2013/01/oooc/ |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveys and personal knowledge===
[[File:Motion X GPS and OSM.jpg|thumb|Surveying routes with a [[GPS receiver]]]]

Ground surveys are performed by a mapper, [[Pedestrian|on foot]], bicycle, or in a [[car]], motorcycle or boat. Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.

Once the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.

Some committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.

=== Street-level image data ===
In addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Bing Maps#Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360º image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[OpenStreetCam]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government data===
Some government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, OSM uses [[Landsat 7]] satellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from [[NOAA]], and [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported, while [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.

[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1&amp;nbsp;inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.

===Route planning===
In February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely [[OSRM]], [[GraphHopper]] and [[MapQuest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Routing on OpenStreetMap.org {{!}} OpenStreetMap Blog|url = https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/02/16/routing-on-openstreetmap-org/|accessdate = 28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.

The resulting data and maps have been used by several organisations providing relief aid, such as the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Andrew |title=World Bank Haiti Situation Room – featuring OSM |date=3 February 2010 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4329833289/in/photostream/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Commission Joint Research Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=European Commission Joint Research Centre |title=Haiti Earthquakes: Infrastructure Port-au-Prince 15/01/2010 |date=15 January 2010 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_pp_haiti_map_04.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025082950/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_pp_haiti_map_04.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]],&lt;ref name="pbatty_video"&gt;{{cite web |last=Batty |first=Peter |title=OpenStreetMap in Haiti – video |date=14 February 2010 |url=http://geothought.blogspot.com/2010/02/openstreetmap-in-haiti-video.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNOSAT]]&lt;ref name="pbatty_video" /&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="osm-wiki-haiti" /&gt;

NGOs, like the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and others, have worked with donors like [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) to map other parts of Haiti and parts of many other countries, both to create map data for places that were blank, and to engage and build capacity of local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OSM Marks the SpotHaitians use a crowdsourced map to chart their own country, and its development |url=https://medium.com/medium-for-haiti/f4582ed41656 |publisher=medium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Haiti, the OpenStreetMap community continued mapping to support humanitarian organisations for various crises and disasters. After the [[Northern Mali conflict]] (January 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OSM 2012 Mali Crisis wiki page |url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2012_Mali_Crisis |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in the Philippines (November 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Debora |last=MacKenzie |title=Social media helps aid efforts after typhoon Haiyan |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24565-social-media-helps-aid-efforts-after-typhoon-haiyan.html#.U-QaA2MmUro |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robinson |last=Meyer |title=How Online Mapmakers Are Helping the Red Cross Save Lives in the Philippines |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/how-online-mapmakers-are-helping-the-red-cross-save-lives-in-the-philippines/281366/ |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] (March 2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nuviun |title=How the Internet is Stopping the Ebola Outbreak, One Street Map at a Time |url=http://nuviun.com/content/blog/How-the-Internet-is-Stopping-the-Ebola-Outbreak-One-Street-Map-at-a-Time |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the OpenStreetMap community has shown it can play a significant role in supporting humanitarian organisations.

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team acts as an interface between the OpenStreetMap community and the humanitarian organisations.

Along with post-disaster work, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has worked to build better risk models and grow the local OpenStreetMap communities in multiple countries including [[Uganda]], [[Senegal]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in partnership with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vyncke |first1=Jorieke |title=A week in Lubumbashi (DRC) |url=https://hotosm.org/updates/2014-04-01_a_week_in_lubumbashi_drc |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Out and about in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: An OSM workshop sponsored by the World Bank |url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-07-13_out_and_about_in_yogyakarta_indonesia_an_osm_workshop_sponsored_by_the_world_bank |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other humanitarian groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Preventative Mapping in Uganda with the Red Cross |url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-08-21_preventative_mapping_in_uganda_with_the_red_cross |work=Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
OpenStreetMap data was used in scientific studies. For example, road data was used for research of remaining roadless areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6318/1423 Ibisch, Pierre &amp; Hoffmann, Monika &amp; Kreft, Stefan &amp; Pe'er, Guy &amp; Kati, Vassiliki &amp; Biber-Freudenberger, Lisa &amp; Dellasala, Dominick &amp; Vale, Mariana &amp; Hobson, Peter &amp; Selva, Nuria.

==Legal aspects==

===Licensing terms===
OpenStreetMap data was originally published under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike licence (CC BY-SA) with the intention of promoting free use and redistribution of the data. In September 2012, the licence was changed to the [[Open Database License|Open Database Licence]] (ODbL) published by Open Data Commons (ODC) in order to more specifically define its bearing on data rather than representation.&lt;ref name="ogd-Fairhurst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence |title=Licence - OpenStreetMap Foundation |website=wiki.osmfoundation.org |language=en|access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of this relicensing process, some of the map data was removed from the public distribution. This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://odbl.poole.ch |title=OSM V1 Objects ODbL acceptance statistics |author=Simon Poole |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/ |title=Automated redactions complete |author=Harry Wood |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a [[OpenStreetmap:Copyright|set of terms]] which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible.

Software used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application&amp;nbsp;– what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch2]], have been made available as [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="osm-wiki-legalfaq" /&gt;

===Commercial data contributions===
Some OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.

Notably, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a [[free content license|free]] and [[open content license|open]] licence,&lt;ref name="ogd-Coast1" /&gt; until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011.&lt;ref name="yahoo-maps-close" /&gt; In November 2010, [[Microsoft]] announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors.&lt;ref name="ogd-Coast2" /&gt; For a period from 2009 to 2011, [[NearMap|NearMap Pty Ltd]] made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a [[CC BY-SA]] licence.&lt;ref name="nearmap" /&gt;

In June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project - four times the number contributed by users and government data imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/microsoft-releases-building-footprints/|title=Microsoft releases more than 100 million Building Footprints in the US as open data|date=2018-07-03|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data|title=Microsoft Releases 125 million Building Footprints in the US as Open Data|website=blogs.bing.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
While OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance.

===Data format===
OpenStreetMap uses a [[topology|topological]] [[graph (discrete mathematics)|data structure]], with four core elements (also known as ''data primitives''):
* ''Nodes'' are points with a geographic position, stored as coordinates (pairs of a [[latitude]] and a [[longitude]]) according to [[WGS 84]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WGS_84 WGS 84] ''OpenStreetMap Wiki''&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of their usage in ways, they are used to represent map features without a size, such as [[point of interest|points of interest]] or mountain peaks.
* ''Ways'' are ordered lists of ''nodes'', representing a [[polyline]], or possibly a [[polygon]] if they form a closed loop. They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.
* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called "members"), where each member can optionally have a "role" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.
* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mocnik|first1=Franz-Benjamin|last2=Zipf|first2=Alexander|last3=Raifer|first3=Martin|title=The OpenStreetMap folksonomy and its evolution|journal=Geo-spatial Information Science|date=18 September 2017|volume=20|issue=3|pages=219–230|doi=10.1080/10095020.2017.1368193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data storage===
The OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.

The main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's '''main database'''. The main database is a [[PostgreSQL]] database with [[PostGIS]] extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OpenStreetMap Wiki: Database |url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database |website=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs |title=Databases and data access APIs |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.

For data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called [[Openstreetmap:planet.osm|planet.osm]]. These dumps exist in two formats, one using [[XML]] and one using the [[Protocol Buffers|Protocol Buffer Binary Format]] (PBF).

The LinkedGeoData&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linkedgeodata.org/ |title=linkedgeodata.org : About |website=linkedgeodata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; data uses the [[GeoSPARQL]] and [[well-known text]] (WKT) [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] vocabularies to represent OpenStreetMap data.
It is a work of the Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group at the [[University of Leipzig]], a group mostly known for [[DBpedia]].

===Popular services===
[[Image:Moovit Navigate 3.0.png|thumb|upright|Moovit Navigate]]
A variety of popular services incorporate some sort of [[geolocation]] or map-based component. Notable services using OSM for this include:
* [[Apple Inc.]] unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for [[IPhoto#iOS version|iPhoto for iOS]] on {{Start date|df=yes|2012|03|07}}, and launched the maps without properly citing the data source – though this was corrected in 1.0.1. OpenStreetMap is one of the many cited sources for Apple's custom maps in [[iOS]] 6, though the majority of map data is provided by [[TomTom]].
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Flickr]] uses OpenStreetMap data for various cities around the world, including [[Baghdad]], Beijing, [[Kabul]], Santiago, Sydney and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/08/12/around-the-world-and-back-again/ |title=Around the world and back again |publisher=blog-flickr.net |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/10/30/more-cities/ |title=More cities |publisher=blog-flickr.net |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSM-in-Japan" /&gt; In 2012, the maps switched to use [[Nokia]] data primarily, with OSM being used in areas where the commercial provider lacked performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ingraham |first=Nathan |title=Flickr is Now Using Nokia Maps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3126012/flickr-nokia-maps-photo-locations |accessdate=11 November 2012 |newspaper=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2015, [[Mapworks]] incorporated the OSM Data set for rendering under a vector publication method. This allows basic GIS analysis capabilities to be performed at web clients supporting [[HTML5]].
* In September 2009, [[Hasbro]], the toy company behind the real estate-themed [[board game]] ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', launched ''[[Monopoly City Streets]]'', a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMORPG) which allowed players to "buy" streets all over the world. The game used map tiles from Google Maps and the Google Maps API to display the game board, but the underlying street data was obtained from OpenStreetMap.&lt;ref name="pcworld" /&gt; The online game was a limited time offering, its servers were shut down in the end of January 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC-Monopoly" /&gt;

[[File:Palmetto leaves cover.jpg|thumb|First edition cover of ''Palmetto Leaves'']]

'''''Palmetto Leaves''''' is a [[memoir]] and [[travel guide]] written by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] about her winters in the town of [[Mandarin, Florida]], published in 1873. Already famous for having written ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861–1865). She purchased a plantation near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of ''Palmetto Leaves'' appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida.

Scion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly felt a sense of Christian responsibility that was expressed in her letters. She considered it her duty to help improve the lives of newly emancipated blacks and detailed her efforts to establish a school and church in Mandarin toward these ends. Parts of the book relate the lives of local African-Americans and the customs of their society. Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of "excessive" heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter. Her audience comprises relatives, friends, and strangers in New England who ask her advice about whether or not to move to Florida, which at the time was still mostly wilderness. Although it is a minor work in Stowe's ''oeuvre'', ''Palmetto Leaves'' was one of the first travel guides written about Florida and stimulated Florida's first boom of tourism and residential development in the 1880s.

== Background ==

=== Stowe buys an estate ===
[[File:StowePainting.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] in 1872 while she was writing the letters that would become ''Palmetto Leaves'']]

By the time [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] (1811–1896) moved to Florida in 1867, she was already internationally famous for authoring ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning [[slavery in the United States]]. Stowe's opposition to slavery sprang from a moral passion based on her [[Christian]] faith. She had grown up the daughter of a [[Presbyterian]] minister, [[Lyman Beecher]]; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.&lt;ref name="gotta"&gt;Gotta, John (September 2000).  "The Anglican Aspect of Harriet Beecher Stowe", ''The New England Quarterly'', '''73''' (3) p. 412–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, Stowe's son Frederick "Fred" William Stowe enlisted in the First Massachusetts Infantry Regiment when [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for volunteers in anticipation of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]]. Much beloved, yet troubled, Fred Stowe had developed a problem with alcohol as early as sixteen. He took to army life, however, and was promoted to lieutenant. After receiving a head wound at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863, he endured severe headaches and was forced to resign his commission.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; His alcoholism worsened, and he may have compounded it with a liberal use of [[opiate]]s and [[narcotic]]s, which were widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Fred encountered two young farmers in Connecticut who had spent time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful and cheap, and many recently emancipated blacks were available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; For $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1867|2009|r=0}}}} in 2009) she purchased a cotton plantation near [[Orange Park, Florida|Orange Park]], south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, [[Anna Kingsley|Anna Madgigine Jai]], until 1811.&lt;ref&gt;May, Philip S. (January 1945). "Zephaniah Kingsley, Nonconformist", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'' '''23''' (3), p. 145–159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Kingsley and Anna Jai moved to another plantation at the mouth of the St. Johns River in 1814 where they lived for 25 years, now protected by the [[National Park Service]] as [[Kingsley Plantation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stowe intended that Fred would manage the estate as he recovered from his wounds and addictions. As an extension of her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother [[Charles Beecher]], however, about her potential role in the endeavor: &lt;blockquote&gt;My plan...is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.&lt;br /&gt;
Corrupt politicians are already beginning to speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads with all sorts of vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Charles Stowe, her son, later wrote that his mother searched for higher purpose in everything she did, from growing potatoes to writing. She wrote that the prospect of setting up a series of churches along the St. Johns River would be the best way to train former slaves, remarking "I long to be at this work and cannot think of it without my heart burning within me".&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, Charles, p. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitfield"&gt;Whitfield, Stephen (April 1993). "Florida's Fudged Identity", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''71''' (4), p. 413–435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The publication of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' had made Stowe an international celebrity. Already active in abolitionist circles, she had been familiar with [[Frederick Douglass]], a former slave who had educated himself and risen to prominence throughout the North, giving lectures on the evils of slavery and thinking about how a population of freed but impoverished and uneducated blacks could sustain themselves (Thulesius, p. 61–65). At some point following ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' but before the Civil War, Stowe invited Douglass to her house and asked him this question personally. Education, according to Douglass, was the primary answer. Stowe was leaving soon on a speaking tour of England and she expected to be given a large sum of money from British sympathizers to be employed in charity work to assist runaway slaves. Douglass intended to start an industrial school for ex-slaves and anticipated she would give him about $20,000. Whether through some miscommunication, Stowe's mishandling of funds, or Douglass' own fault, Stowe eventually gave him only $500; Douglass was confused and disappointed (Thulesius, p. 65).&lt;/ref&gt; Florida was little populated and developed: it had just a fraction of the population of Georgia and Alabama. South of [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], approximately two people lived per square mile.&lt;ref&gt;Stover, John F. (February 2000). [http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-00559.html "Flagler, Henry Morrison"], American National Biography Online. Retrieved on June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida's school system was in disarray at the end of the Civil War; in 1866 a Northerner named A. E. Kinne noted there were fewer schools for white children than freedmen's schools for black children.&lt;ref name="wakefield"/&gt; In 1860, there were no official schools for black children and slaves were prohibited from any education. At the same time, there were 97 public schools for white children and 40 private academies for them, some of which appeared to get public funding.  In May 1865, the total Florida population was 154,000, and an estimated 47% of it was black, almost all of whom were former slaves.&lt;ref name="Wakefield2"&gt;[http://etd.fcla.edu/CF/CFE0000199/Wakefield_Laura_W_200412_MA.pdf Laura Wallis Wakefield, "'Set a Light in a Dark Place': Teachers of Freedmen in Florida, 1863-1874"], Fall 2004, MA Thesis, pp. 9, 12-14, University of Central Florida, accessed 17 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A difference in attitudes about education between the races was apparent as freed blacks saw education as the key to increasing their opportunities, or at least escaping conditions they had endured during servitude.&lt;ref name="wakefield"&gt;Wakefield, Laura (Spring 2003). "'Set a Light in a Dark Place': Teachers of Freedmen in Florida, 1864-1874", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''81''' (4), pp. 401–417.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation and failure ===
[[File:St johns map.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Map of the [[St. Johns River]] in 1876 showing [[Mandarin, Florida|Mandarin]]; Laurel Grove was on the opposite side of the river.]]

In the late winter of 1867, Stowe followed her son to Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her to spend more time on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become "young &amp; frisky".&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in [[Mandarin, Florida|Mandarin]], about {{convert|3|mi|km}} across the [[St. Johns River]]. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe fell in love with a cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking "How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?"&lt;ref name="gotta"/&gt; She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: "I hate to leave my calm isle of [[Patmos]]—where the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|[Ralph Waldo] Emerson]] could ''insulate'' himself here and keep his electricity. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|[Nathaniel] Hawthorne]] ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida."&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced and made poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, plantations had been largely self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took days off at a time to visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (''[[Helicoverpa zea]]'') destroyed much of the cotton crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Alcohol would haunt Fred Stowe for the rest of his life. He sailed to the Mediterranean to remove himself from temptation, but could not shake his addiction. In 1870, he was living with his parents in Mandarin when he resolved not to embarrass them anymore. He caught a ship to Chile, but continued to San Francisco, then a rough port. Some friends took him to a hotel, where he settled in and left to run an errand. He was never heard from again. Stowe tried in vain to have him located, and in her old age, she spoke of him constantly. (Wilson, p. 559–560.)(Stowe, Charles, p. 278–279.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 526–527.&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin.

Citrus was distributed primarily in a regional market and was a luxury in northern cities; oranges in New York sold for about 50 cents per fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1867|2009|r=0}}}} in 2009). Stowe wrote to author [[George Eliot]] to update her on the progress of improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the veranda around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, Charles, p. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1868 to 1884, Stowe split her time between her residence in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], a mansion named Oakholm, and her house in Mandarin. A few weeks before Christmas each year, she would oversee arrangements to close Oakholm for the season, which involved preparing the house for the winter, packing all their clothes, living necessities, her writing materials, and the carpets in the house and shipping everything to Florida. Various family members would accompany her, living in the comfortable two-story house she modestly called a "cottage" or "hut".&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hartford she was barraged with requests and at the center of a whirl of activity. Mandarin was not connected to a telegraph line until the 1880s and mail was received only once a week by boat. Stowe was able to relax somewhat in Mandarin and write for at least three hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--Hide paragraph for now As the South was recovering from the economic devastation of the Civil War, it was at times subject to Northern business prospectors, or [[carpetbagger]]s, who came to take advantage of the minimal infrastructure. Many Northerners were looked upon unfavorably in the South in the years following the Civil War. ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' had been banned throughout the South, and Stowe's reputation preceded her, sometimes with a frosty reception from white Floridians. During one occasion when she accompanied Calvin as he gave a sermon as a guest preacher at a Methodist church in Jacksonville, some members of the congregation stood up and left when they walked in.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the white residents of Mandarin, however, were English immigrants who sided with the Union, and they welcomed Stowe warmly.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Description of text and publication ==

Stowe remained active, attending speaking engagements, writing, traveling frequently and publishing several novels while she was wintering in Mandarin. Though she promised her publishers, [[James R. Osgood|J. R. Osgood]], another novel, she instead compiled a series of articles about Florida and letters to relatives in New England about her daily life. Some of them were first published in ''[[Christian Union (newspaper)|Christian Union]]'', a local New England newspaper established by her brother [[Henry Ward Beecher]].&lt;ref name="thulesius91"/&gt; In all, twenty chapters make up ''Palmetto Leaves'' that vary in tone depending upon Stowe's audience. "Buying land in Florida", "Florida for Invalids", and "Our Experience in Crops" are addressed more to general readers who may be considering moving to the region. Some essays are directed to describing the best sights in the area, such as "Flowery January in Florida", "Picnicking up Julington", "The Grand Tour up River", and "St. Augustine".  A more personal touch is included in chapters entitled "A Letter to the Girls", "Letter-Writing", and "Our Neighbor Over the Way" as Stowe includes intimate details about her daily life in Mandarin. Her observations of the state and characteristics of emancipated slaves are mentioned intermittently in letters and essays, but the final two chapters, "Old Cudjo and The Angel" and "Laborers of The South", are dedicated solely to this topic.&lt;ref name="robbins88"/&gt;

''Palmetto Leaves'' was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she published ''[[Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands]]'' about her first trip to Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She followed this with ''[[Agnes of Sorrento]]'' that appeared as a serial in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' from 1861 to 1862. Source material for ''Agnes of Sorrento'' was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of ''Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida'', recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to ''Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands'', writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;If the criticism be made that every thing is given ''couleur de rose'', the answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with too bright a pencil, the reader will consider that, after all, there are many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;
The object of publishing these letters is, therefore, to give to those who are true-hearted and honest the same agreeable picture of life and manners which met the writer's own eyes.&lt;ref name="thulesius91"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because little was known about the region, the elements of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature.&lt;ref name="eacker"&gt;Eacker, Susan A. (August 1998). "Gender in Paradise: Harriet Beecher Stowe and Postbellum Prose on Florida", ''The Journal of Southern History'', '''64''' (3) p. 495–512.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, ''Palmetto Leaves''—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was still very much a rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like.&lt;ref name="wilson576"&gt;Wilson, p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book ''Orange Blossoms'', but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.&lt;ref name="thulesius91"&gt;Thulesius, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject and themes ==

=== Duty and calling ===
[[File:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|Stowe was fascinated with oranges, calling them "golden apples" and using them as a metaphor for the duty she was called to do in Florida.]]

In the first chapter of ''Palmetto Leaves'', Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes attached to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals to take care of the poor and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impressive orange tree served as a [[metaphor]] for Stowe in ''Palmetto Leaves''. She calls it "the fairest, the noblest, the most generous, it is the most surprising and abundant of all trees which the Lord God caused to grow eastward in Eden", and compares it to her task of educating emancipated slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When she first arrived in Mandarin, from 1868 to 1870, religious services were held in the Stowes' home, with Calvin presiding and Stowe teaching Sunday School to both black and white children and sometimes serving as an acolyte during services.&lt;ref name="gotta"/&gt; Stowe purchased a lot in 1869 to build a church for her neighbors that would double as a school to educate children, freed slaves, and anyone eager to learn. Though she encountered considerable frustration in dealing with the bureaucracy of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], construction was finished within a year and a teacher was in place, procured from Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Stowe had an organ that was rolled from her home to the church, but after it became too difficult to roll back and forth, they locked it in a closet in the school. The building burned down to Stowe's deep dismay, probably because of some drifters who spent the night in it and caught the southern pine wood on fire from carelessness, although Olav Thulesius suggests it was arson committed by Stowe's neighbors who did not appreciate her efforts to educate black children.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; After a frost in 1835, the orange trees in north Florida were killed, even underground, but they sprouted back only to be assaulted by insects, yet they recovered. While her neighbors helped to raise funds to rebuild the church, Stowe and the small community handed spellers to local blacks who were eager to learn. She decried the delay in the children's education: "To see people who are willing and anxious to be taught growing up in ignorance is the sorest sight that can afflict one".&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Florida and daily life in Mandarin ===

From her first sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In ''Palmetto Leaves'', she sings the praises of Florida in January as a beautiful land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (''[[Gelsemium sempervirens]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 97–115.&lt;/ref&gt; and another to magnolia (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 87–96.&lt;/ref&gt; flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things to find in the woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (''[[Cardinalis cardinalis]]'') in a cage and four cats,&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 40–68.&lt;/ref&gt; but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 149–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an honest description of the disadvantages of Florida, Stowe attempts to disabuse readers of the notion that the region is perfect. She writes, "In New England Nature is an up-and-down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk" and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an "indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and does every thing when she happens to feel like it".&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, she would be a dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 26–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaria]] is a fact of life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with [[tuberculosis]]. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh all these issues before making their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 116–136.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Journal of Southern History'', Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a "woman's rights woman".&lt;ref name="eacker"/&gt;

[[File:Mrs. H.B. Stowe's Place at Mandarin, on St. Johns River, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.png|thumb|left|Stereoscopic view of Stowe's home in Mandarin showing the porch interrupted by a massive oak tree]]

Stowe recounts several sailing trips she takes on the St. Johns and [[Julington Creek]] and the animals she sees during her excursion, appreciating the alligators, "water-turkeys" (''[[Anhinga anhinga]]''), and "fish-hawks", or ospreys (''[[Pandion haliaetus]]''). Long an animal lover, she took her dogs, cats, and birds with her as part of the "earthquake" of the annual relocation from Hartford to Mandarin. She extended this care to other animals as well. In Naples, Italy, she once got out of a carriage to walk as it was being pulled up a steep hill by two beleaguered horses that were being whipped by the driver, and asked her companions and guide to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 104–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did she write the first travel guide to Florida, but Stowe also became the first defender of wild animals. She pays particular attention in ''Palmetto Leaves'' to hunters who shoot at anything they see. Not taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: "it must be something that ''enjoys'' and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it".&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's [[wader|wading birds]], whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.

=== Emancipated slaves ===
[[File:Old Cudjo illustration in Palmetto Leaves.jpg|thumb|Illustration accompanying the chapter entitled "Old Cudjo and the Angel"]]

The final two letters in ''Palmetto Leaves'' address the newly freed slaves in Florida. Two strong women who are less docile than Stowe is accustomed are included. One, a field hand turned domestic named Minnah, whom Stowe has tried in vain to teach how to do household chores, is so forthright in her speech that Stowe writes, "Democracy never assumes a more rampant form than in some of these old negresses, who would say their screed to the king on his throne if they died for it the next minute. Accordingly, Minnah's back was marked and scored with the tyrant's answers to free speech."&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Minnah eventually returns happily to the fields. Another, Judy, is complacent and enjoys taking mornings and afternoons off to see to her husband. Stowe attributes their work ethic to poor training and "the negligent habits inducted by slavery"; the truly talented and hard-working black laborers had moved on from homesteads to industry, able to demand their own price for their labors.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 314–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Stowe describes Minnah and Judy with some tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave owned by the captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues to work for him following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. Her knowledge of the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another story, Stowe and Calvin meet a man on a Mandarin dock who has been cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small homestead on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a [[Justice of the peace#United States|justice of the peace]] intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 267–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, pp. 279–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
[[File:Harriet Beecher Stowe house site Mandarin Florida.JPG|thumb|upright|Third incarnation of the school Stowe helped support, built in 1873, now the Mandarin Community Club]]

''Palmetto Leaves'' became a best-seller for Stowe and was released in several editions. It was published again in 1968 as part of ''Bicentennial Floridiana'', a series of original facsimile texts about the history of the state. It was so popular that through publishing it, Stowe virtually ruined the peace and quiet she sought in Mandarin to be able to work. The year following the publication of ''Palmetto Leaves'', Stowe reported that 14,000 tourists had visited North Florida.&lt;ref name="wilson576"/&gt; Two years after its initial publication, a writer working for ''[[Harper's]]'' magazine noted that Stowe was "besieged by hundreds of visitors, who do not seem to understand that she is not an exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stowe's house, which was located on the bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats shuffling tourists from Jacksonville to [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] or [[Green Cove Springs, Florida|Green Cove Springs]] passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt; One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.&lt;ref name="thulesius95"&gt;Thulesius, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stowe was among several authors who wrote about Florida following the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw.&lt;ref name="eacker"/&gt; Stowe wrote simply as herself, something that may have been allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of ''Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State'' writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.&lt;ref name="thulesius95"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was clearly Stowe's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' (although she considered ''[[Old Town Folks]]'', which was written while she was in Mandarin, to have that designation&lt;ref name="eacker"/&gt;), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying "So this is the little lady who made this big war?"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to it, ''Palmetto Leaves'' is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The ''Cambridge Introduction to Literature'' series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it "uneven in quality and unstable in stance".&lt;ref name="robbins88"&gt;Robbins, p. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. ''Cambridge Introduction to Literature'' author Sarah Robbins called it "downright offensive" and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a [[baboon]], for example—and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary.&lt;ref name="robbins88"/&gt; Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.&lt;ref name="eacker"/&gt;

== Post-publication ==
[[File:Gv000511.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Marcellus Stearns]], his cabinet, and the staff of the [[Florida State Capitol]] greet Stowe, dressed in black on the sixth step on the right in 1874]]

The effects of Stowe's writings about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in [[Newport, Wakulla County, Florida|Newport]] near [[Tallahassee]]. During a visit to his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor [[Marcellus Stearns]]. They were met by his cabinet and staff on the steps of the [[Florida State Capitol|state capitol building]]—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 Stowe purchased a plot of land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin [[Church of Our Saviour (Jacksonville, Florida)|Church of Our Saviour]], the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever to spend the rest of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window.&lt;ref name="hooker"/&gt; Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with plants and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, Charles, p. 300–301.&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1896.

[[File:Tiffany window Harriet Beecher Stowe memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stained glass window dedicated to the Stowes at the Church of Our Saviour, destroyed in 1964]]

A frost in 1886 killed much of the orange industry in Mandarin and the town saw an economic decline.  In 1916, an ornate stained glass window constructed by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was installed in the Church of Our Saviour, depicting a large oak tree overlooking the river. The church and Mandarin residents offered no more than $500 for the window; for three years ten cent subscriptions were raised around Mandarin, and notices were placed in New York magazines to solicit finances for it. Although scholars have stated that Stowe's efforts to educate local blacks were ultimately unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="eacker"/&gt; the woman who spearheaded the fundraising effort for the memorial window noted that the project was enthusiastically supported by local black churches and residents, who gave what they could out of affection for Stowe, remembering that she taught some of them to read. The window probably cost Tiffany $850 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|850|1914|2009|r=0}}}} in 2009), and though there is no record of exactly how much Tiffany was paid, he took the project on because he liked the design: the tree, the moss, the Southern motif, and because it was to memorialize the Stowes. He probably made no profit from it.&lt;ref name="hooker"/&gt;

Beneath it read "In that hour, fairer than daylight dawning/ Remains the glorious thought, I am with Thee", part of a hymn penned by Stowe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Stowe Memorial Planned; In Florida Hamlet Where the Author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" Lived", ''The New York Times'' (April 4, 1914), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The school Stowe sponsored closed in 1929. Following Stowe's departure, the next owners of the house turned it into a lodge named after her.  It closed in the 1940s and was subsequently replaced by a spacious home; what survives is the 500-year-old oak tree, which the Stowes built around instead of removing.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;  The oak had continued to grow and upset the foundation of the new home.&lt;ref name="hooker"&gt;Hooker, Kenneth W. (January 1940). "A Stowe Memorial", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''18''' (3) p. 198–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stained glass window became a tourist attraction and the last memorial to Stowe in Florida; in later decades some of the parishioners and clergy had doubts about its "churchliness" as it was a rare depiction in an Anglican church not referencing a Biblical theme.&lt;ref&gt;Thulesius, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 [[Hurricane Dora]] destroyed the Church of Our Saviour, including the stained glass window. Across the street, is the Mandarin Community Club, the former school sponsored by Stowe; the structure was given to Mandarin in 1936. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandarincommunityclub.org/ History], Mandarin Community Club website.

'''Republic Day''' honours the date on which the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] was founded on 28 May 1918 as the first secular democratic state in the Muslim East. The founder, first and only president of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] is [[Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh]]. 
Since 1990, 28 May - Republic Day is celebrated as a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Rais Rasulzade (his grandson), [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/73_folder/73_articles/73_rasulzade.html "Mammad Amin Rasulzade: Founding Father of the First Republic,"] in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 7:3 (Autumn 1999), pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Republic Day==
The [[Russian Empire]]  was overthrown by the short-lived [[February Revolution|February Revolution in 1917]]. 
The national movement of people who were trampled by the tyranny existed in the country started.
On May 28, 1918 the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan (1918-1920) - the first [[secular]] democratic state in the [[Muslim]] East was proclaimed.
The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, founded by [[Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh]], was the first parliamentary republic and the first democratic, legal and secular state in the [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Islamic]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Swietochowski.

[[File:Flag of Azerbaijan 1918.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Azerbaijan]]

Among the important accomplishments of the ADR was the extension of suffrage to women, making [[Azerbaijan]] one of the first countries in the world, and the very first majority-[[Muslim]] nation, to grant women equal political rights with men.
The first state, which officially recognized the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was the Ottoman Empire. That historic event took place on June 4, 1918.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Michael G. Smith.

On November 9, 1918 on the basis of the proposal by [[Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh]] the three-color flag of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was accepted.&lt;ref name="I.B.Tauris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atabaki|first1=Touraj|title=Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran|date=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781860645549|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until then the flag of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was red.
The Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was able to operate in a tense and complicated socio-political situation for only 23 months.
The Soviet Union invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. 
Though the idea of independence was not defeated, and in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Empire, Azerbaijan again declared its independence.&lt;ref name="Swietochowski2"&gt;{{cite book |last = Swietochowski |first=Tadeusz |title=Russian Azerbaijan, 1905-1920: The Shaping of a National Identity in a Muslim Community |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |location= |isbn=0-521-52245-5 |pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="azer.com"&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/73_folder/73_articles/73_parliamentfate.htm "The Fate of some of the ADR Parliament Members", Azerbaijan International (7.3) Autumn 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of Independence of Azerbaijan ({{lang-az|Azərbaycanın İstiqlal Bəyannaməsi}}) is the [[declaration of independence]] of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] from the [[Russian Empire]]. Azerbaijan was proclaimed independent in [[Tiflis]] on 28 May 1918.&lt;ref name="Элм"&gt;{{cite book|title=Азербайджанская Демократическая Республика (1918 - 1920)|year=1998|publisher=Элм|isbn=5-8066-0897-2|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was founded by the Azerbaijani National Council in [[Tiflis]] on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Muslim representation in the defunct [[Transcaucasian Seim]] had constituted itself into the Azerbaijani National Council, and on May 28, 1918 proclaimed that a new nation was born. So far only a geographical reference, Azerbaijan now became the name of a state, and some 2 million people, called variously Tatars, Transcaucasian Muslims and Caucasian Turks, officially became Azerbaijanis.&lt;ref name="Swietochowski"&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]].

==Memory==
1 year after the founding of the ADR, a military parade on the site of the [[Azerbaijan Carpet Museum]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.day.az/society/122461.html&lt;/ref&gt;In honor of this day the station of the [[Baku]] underground is named. Initially, it was called "April 28", since on April 28, 1920, [[Soviet]] power was established in Azerbaijan, and the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|ADR]] ceased to exist.
However, after the Republic gained independence for the second time, the name, reminiscent of the Soviet past, was replaced by "May 28".
It was enough to rename only letters, the numbers remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;''125 H.C.Debs.'', 58., February 24, 1920, p. 1467.&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of this day the street in Baku is named: Istiglaliyyat (Independence) street

On the wall of the hall of the former palace of the governor in the [[Caucasus]] in [[Tbilisi]], where the republic was proclaimed, a memorial plaque with an inscription in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[English language]]s was installed.

In Baku, on the  Istiglaliyyat (Independence) street, a [[stele]] with the text of the Declaration of Independence (in Arabic and Latin) was installed.
In 2008, a postage stamp was issued in connection with the 90th [[anniversary]] of the Republic.&lt;ref name="kazemzadeh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kazemzadeh |first=Firuz|authorlink=Firuz Kazemzadeh |title=The Struggle for Transcaucasia: 1917-1921 |publisher=The New York Philosophical Library |year= 1951 |location=|isbn=0-8305-0076-6 |pages=124, 222, 229, 269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rouse Hill House''' is a heritage-listed [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] and [[estate (land)|estate]] at Windsor Road, [[Rouse Hill, New South Wales|Rouse Hill]], [[City of Blacktown]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. Rouse Hill House and farm was the family home of Richard Rouse, the Colonial Superintendent of Public Works and Convicts at [[Parramatta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/rouse-hill-house-farm |title=Rouse Hill House &amp; Farm |work=Sydney Living Museums |publisher=[[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|Office of Environment and Heritage]], [[Government of New South Wales]] |date= |accessdate=6 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homestead, in the [[Australian residential architectural styles#Georgian|Australian Georgian]] style, was developed between 1813 and 1819 with further developments in {{circa|1863}}. The homestead is managed by [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales|Sydney Living Museums]] as a [[museum]] that is open to the public. Much of the former grounds have been transformed into Rouse Hill Regional Park and subsequent residential and commercial developments. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5044989|Rouse Hill House and Farm|hr=00002|fn=S90/05495; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Rouse family===

[[Richard Rouse (Australian colonial settler)|Richard Rouse]] (1774-1852) appears to have begun building at Rouse Hill in 1813 although the grant of {{convert|450|acre|ha|order=flip}} was not made until October 1816.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-14&gt;Broadbent &amp; Bogle 1990, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between 1818 and 1825, Rouse, his wife Elizabeth (1772-1849) and family moved from [[Parramatta]] to the new house. The son of an [[Oxfordshire]] cabinet maker and shop-keeper, Rouse came to the colony, free, in 1801. Prospering quickly, by 1805 he was Superintendent of Public Works and Convicts at Parramatta.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenehan, Marjorie|title=Rouse, Richard (1774–1852)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher=National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]] |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/rouse-richard-2612/text3601 |publication-date=1967 |format=published first in hardcopy |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this role he supervised the building of [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie]] and his wife's additions to [[Old Government House, Parramatta]], in the mid 1810s. It is possible that these works influenced Rouse to build a bigger house than he first intended, adding larger, longer rooms behind the front range.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

He chose the site of his new house while building [[toll houses]] for Macquarie's upgraded road to the [[Hawkesbury River]]. Rouse sited the new house prominently, possibly with an eye to its possible use as an inn, on a hilltop adjacent to the toll house (also built by him) on the Parramatta to [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] Turnpike. He acquired other properties, more fertile than the Rouse Hill farm, but Rouse Hill had the advantage of strategic siting. While other early colonial homesteads overlooked their crops or pastures, Rouse Hill has always overlooked the busy [[Windsor Road (Sydney)|Windsor Road]]. It was from here that Rouse and his descendants oversaw their distant pastoral and agricultural interests, rather than the estate itself being the focus of those interests.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Rouse was not bred to the land, but was shrewd and capable, careful of money and acquisitive of property. He left, on his death in 1852, extensive holdings throughout the colony. The Rouse Hill estate grew to {{convert|1200|acre|ha|order=flip}} by Rouse's death, by purchase of an adjacent grant.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-15&gt;https://www.hht.net.au/museums/rouse_hill, accessed 15/10/10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-2-16"&gt;Historic Houses Trust, 1997, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Rouse consolidated his land holdings at [[North Richmond, New South Wales|North Richmond]] from around 1806 and increased his pastoral holdings in the north west of New South Wales, using his sons to colonise further west while he continued to acquire land in Parramatta and [[Western Sydney]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

A number of the property's outbuildings finished construction following the completion of the house, including the laundry wing, cottage, barn and woolshed. The garden layout reflects the construction of the house between 1813 and 1818. Some trees remain from the plantings in the mid 19th century. With the exception of outbuildings, Rouse seems to have made no other alterations to the property's buildings. This was left to later generations. Rouse died in 1852 leaving the property to his son Edwin Rouse. The property went to Edwin's son Edwin Stephen Rouse on his death in 1862.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

A summerhouse, woolshed and a two storey service wing was added in the 1860s, the stables built in 1876 and 1877 and the house redecorated and partly furnished in 1885.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-16/&gt; The service wing made no direct connection with the house. A verandah, weighted sash windows, a modified front door and sidelights and other late 19th century innovations were also installed. These too have been done in such a way as to preserve the integrity of the house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Rouse Hill Public School opened to the east of Rouse Hill House and farm in 1888.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Edwin Stephen Rouse's eldest daughter Nina, who had left the house in 1895 to marry George Terry, returned with her husband to live at Rouse Hill in 1924. This was a result of their bankruptcy. Following the death of Edwin Stephen Rouse in 1931 his estate was administered by Trustees, mainly family members and later a family company, until 1969. In 1932 the studio was converted into a breakfast room. Estate subdivision had begun in 1951 and the property had been reduced to {{convert|106|acre|ha|order=flip}} by 1963. Nina Terry died at Rouse Hill House in 1968 and the following year the remaining {{convert|106|acre|ha|order=flip}} were subdivided. The homestead block of {{convert|29|acre|ha|order=flip}} went to her two sons Gerald and Roderick Terry as tenants in common.&lt;ref name="nswshr-2-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

When a family dispute occurred following the death of Edwin Rouse's grand-daughter Nina Terry in 1968, architect John Fisher (early member of the [[Australian Institute of Architects|Institute of Architects]], member of the Cumberland County Historic Buildings Committee and [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) Board member after its reformation in 1960) chaired the Rouse Hill Preservation Committee, which brought together the family and representatives of the National Trust of Australia (NSW). This led to the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] resuming the property, which later became a property under the care of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales (HHT).&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-18&gt;Lucas &amp; McGinness, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

A further subdivision in 1974 reduced the homestead block to {{convert|8.15|ha}}.&lt;ref name="nswshr-2-19"&gt;Historic Houses Trust, 1997, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

===State government ownership===

In March 1978 the NSW government purchased the property which also contained 24 outbuildings (and half its contents&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-20&gt;Mackaness, 2010, 5&lt;/ref&gt;). It was administered by the Planning and Environment Commission, later the Department of Planning, which commissioned restoration works from the Public Works Department.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-21&gt;Broadbent &amp; Bogle, 1990, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The Heritage Council's Restoration Steering (HC RS) Committee resolved to have a conservation statement prepared for the buildings and their site. Urgent repair works to the outbuildings were identified and undertaken under the supervision of the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Government Architect's]] Branch, Public Works Department and the main entrance driveway was regraded and regravelled. Urgent repair and stabilisation on the homestead and outbuildings continued and a fire control service was installed in the garden. A gardener was contracted to carry out urgent garden maintenance. The HC RS Committee considered the need for accurate documentation of interior finishes and contents of the buildings and for curatorial and materials conservation work to be carried out. The initial conservation programme was endorsed and circulated to various interested conservation bodies for comment. The Royal Australian Historical Society was requested to undertake an historical research programme on the property. An archaeologist was contracted to be present during any excavation works associated with the repairs programme.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

There has been a continuity of family ownership at Rouse Hill until 1978. Particular forces in the family's history and those of wealth in the 19th century, followed by financial hardship, longevity and resistance to change in the 20th century have left the property in a poignantly fragile condition. This fragility is inherent in much of the property's historic fabric and is integral to the archival significance of the place.&lt;ref name="nswshr-2-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

===Historic Houses Trust===

In 1984 the summer house was repaired/reconstructed, and the property was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust in 1987. Family association with the property continued through the occupancy of Gerald Terry from 1968, Roderick Terry, 1968-80, and the latter's daughter and son in law, Miriam and Ian Hamilton and the Hamiltons' ownership of a significant portion of the collection. The collection was subsequently transferred to the Hamilton Rouse Hill Trust.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Since 1978 descendents have returned many significant family items and the collection now comprises over 20,000 objects as diverse as costume, furniture, tools and automobiles.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

By 1993, there were 25 acres (10 hectares) of land left, in the management of the Historic Houses Trust.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-22&gt;Bogle, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

When the HHT opened Rouse Hill House and Farm to the public in 1999 it was in a limited capacity and a very different context. In 2007, anticipating the extraordinary residential growth in the area, the HHT sought funding of $19m from Treasury to provide new visitor and cultural facilities (interpretation, programs, research and access to the collection) along with commercial activities (cafe, retail, auditorium and flexible public spaces to be used as venues). The project aimed to improve the property's sustainability and allowed it to be opened up to thousands of visitors a year.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The property received an Energy Australia National Trust Heritage Award in 2004.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

In 2008, HHT got first stage funding for the education component of its vision for the site. To protect the heritage precinct the State Government established the Rouse Hill Regional Park, transferred the 1888 Rouse Hill Public School (former) and adjacent lands to the HHT and diverted the upgraded Windsor Road (to the east away from the house and school).&lt;ref name="nswshr-2-23"&gt;Mackaness, 2010, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy by the Friends of the HIstoric Houses Trust was in large part responsible for moving the road to create this bypass, protecting the site's setting from encroachment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

On 10 March 2009, remnant [[Roads &amp; Traffic Authority]] (RTA) lands were transferred to the HHT (from the Windsor Road bypass which is open further to the east than the old road alignment (in a cutting). [[The Hills Shire|The Hills Shire Council]] approved stage one development application for works.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

In 2009-10, the construction program was almost complete on former RTA land and Rouse Hill Public School (former) adjoining re-aligned Windsor Road. The school house was conserved, repainted in Victorian colour scheme and interpreted as 19th century school; cafe, retail, education centre and outdoor auditorium (for 60); parking; security; flexible public spaces to be used as venues and landscaping works completed. The property's capacity and visitation rate increased, including increasing numbers of local schools (capacity now for 20,000 children a year to visit).

Transfer of the remnant RTA lands created a new opportunity for research and interpretation. HHT historians Joy Hughes, Jane Kelson and curator Fergus Clunie began gathering historic maps of the region. Searching for the location of the original Toll House at Rouse Hill, he unearthed new evidence about the line of the old Hawkesbury Road (1794-1813) on which the pursuit and "[[Castle Hill convict rebellion|battle of Vinegar Hill]]", an armed conflagration between convicts and troops, took place in 1804. Although the road has long since disappeared, it defined the boundary of the first land grant in the area, the 1000 acre "Copenhagen" given to [[William Bligh|Captain William Bligh]]. It also ran close to the surviving kilometre stretch of the old Windsor Road built by convicts in 1812-13 as the first turnpike in the colony between [[Sydney]] and the Hawkesbury. The exact location of the battle of Vinegar Hill has long been debated, but the map evidence and line of the old Hawkesbury Road indicate that it most likely took place between Second Ponds Creek and the crest of Rouse Hill, formerly known as Vinegar Hill. A line of very early trees at the edge of the road is believed to date back to the time of the battle.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Rouse Hill House dating from 1813, is remarkable as one of the longest continuously occupied houses in Australia, set in the oldest surviving garden in Australia and with original outbuildings, interiors and collections intact. As the likely site of the battle of Vinegar Hill, it now has a new level of significance, with exciting interpretive possibilities, and this has encouraged HHT to rethink its approach to the property.&lt;ref name="nswshr-2-24"&gt;Mackaness, 2010, 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

By June 2016, increased visitation had been achieved by introducing a series of limited-number tours of the house's interiors. Works to conserve the farm's dairy precinct had been completed. Two main posts whose subsoil bases had decayed were re-footed, with new spliced material and a pad footing. Guttering was replaced, along with some roof sheeting where discrete patching was no longer sufficient and deacyed timber trimming on the milk house has been replaced&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-25&gt;Hill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The bathhouse was conserved and repaired in September 2017.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-26&gt;Long, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===

== Description ==

Rouse Hill House is arguably unrivalled in Australia for the wealth of physical evidence of its own history and its use by the family which built it. This intactness extends to all aspects of the property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-30&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1997:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The property is perhaps unique for its survival as a largely intact estate with an unbroken chain of occupancy, allwing the survival of major garden and interior elements of every period of its history to the present.  This layering of artefacts and fashions is especially prevalent in the gardens where designs and physical details such as edging, fencing, planting containers, bed designs and paths provide a case history for the study of the development of garden practices in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The physical condition of the property was reported as being good as at 18 September 1997.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

===House===
Rouse Hill House is a large two storey Georgian House set on top of a ridge which falls away gradually to all cardinal points. The house is oriented to the northeast, midway between Parramatta &amp; Windsor.  The house has a separate two storey brick service wing, offices forming an arcaded [[courtyard]], 22 rooms, staircase hall, service stair and two cellar rooms. The house gas a fine stone-flagged stair hall with cantilevered timber stair. The doors are all six panelled with some [[architraves]] and panelled jamb linings. The main house is built of [[sandstone]] with a slate roof, timber floors(kitchen, scullery, staircase, hall, [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and verandah are flagged) and oakgrained hardwood joinery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

===Garden===
The garden is perhaps Australia's oldest surviving colonial garden in relatively intact form. The surviving physical evidence in the gardens includes borders in a variety of materials, fence and gate remnants, fragments of trellis and arbours, paving and numerous soil displacements that become evident with the location's annual dry spells.  These physical remains, matched with pictorial evidence from photographs, drawings and engravings of the property, and writings, have resulted in the identification of four stages of the garden's development: {{circa|1825}}, {{circa|1865}}, {{circa|1885}} and {{circa|1968}}.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

This continuity and evidence of evolution of a very early intact garden from the first quarter of the 19th century to the Edwardian era and 20th century is extremely rare in Australia. The effects of new technologies in Australian estate gardening with replacement of palings with wire fences, displacement of stone and brick garden or path edgings with terracotta tile edgings, etc. are quite evident.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-28&gt;Bogle, 1993 adapted by Read, S., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Dominating the garden and seen from afar are tall, mature Araucaria pines (Bunya pine, ''[[Araucaria bidwillii|A. bidwillii]]'' and hoop pine, ''[[Araucaria cunninghamii|A. cunninghamii]]'').&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Read, 6/2014 visit&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bath House (1858)===
Picturesque building in the garden thought to have been built by Scottish-born Parramatta buildder and architect, James Houison, it originally featured ine arched timber [[Trellis (architecture)|trellises]] on the two [[Veranda|verandahs]] and porches on each side. This treillage supported climbing plants and gave some privacy to users of the bathroom and lavatory. MOrewood &amp; Rogers roofing (tin) tiles, stone flagging. Restored in 2017.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-27&gt;https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/what-lies-beneath-conservation-works&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

===Dairy===
The dairy design is essentially the same as one for a model dairy promoted in 1947 by the NSW Department of Agriculture as suitable for smaller farmers. "Model dairies" (a term dating to the 1800s) were structures that exemplified the most up-to-date hygiene and production principles and materials, and could serve as a model to other farmers to copy. The Rouse dairy contains a linear row of bails, with a gabled, fibre-cement-clad "milk house" at the western end that held the pumping machinery and generator. As per 1947 plan specifications, the floor was laid with easily washed concrete to maintain strict hygiene. A much earlier timber structure, containing two cow bails for hand-milking, also survives at Rouse Hill House and features in tours of its outbuildings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-25/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

===Outbuildings===
Other buildings on the site include a slab built cow [[shed]], brick bath house, a reconstructed timber summer house, brick stables.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-29&gt;Chivell 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt; The property also has an extant caretaker's house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Rouse Hill House is one of the most significant and substantial houses of the Macquarie period which dates from 1810 to 1822.  Rouse Hill House Estate is the largest and most complete publicly owned physical record - in the form of buildings, furnishings, artefacts and landscape relationship - of the occupancy and culture of a European-Australian family, encompassing the tastes, fortunes, and endeavours of seven generations from the early 19th century to the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-33&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1997:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Rouse Hill House was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Rouse Hill House is significant for the record of the Rouse and Terry family occupancy over the seven generations and 180 years which the property constitutes. This record is to be found physically in the house, its outbuildings, finishes, collection, garden and rural curtilage.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The property is significant for:
* Its association with Richard Rouse, building contractor and free settler, and Superintendent of Public Works, based at Parramatta.
* Its association with the convict period through assignment of convicts for the building of the house and operation of Rouse Hill House and nearby properties.
* As a record of the history of taste and level of cultural awareness held by a particular class of people in the [[History of New South Wales|history of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The property provides evidence of recurrent themes in NSW history, for example, the family's prosperity throughout the 19th century followed by relative poverty in the 20th century is representative of "Boom and Bust" themes in Australian social and economic history.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

Of local significance is its association with a local population which included men and women who worked on the Rouse Hill property, shop keepers, local clergy, school masters and their families.
&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-34&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1997:6-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

Rouse Hill House is exceptional as a record of the aesthetic tastes of seven generations of a single family.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

The aesthetic responses to the place depend on the diversity of the visual evidence - in the building, range of decorative and applied arts, garden and the agricultural surrounds, and their interconnectedness.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-35&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1997:7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The family history is representative of a class of people who survived the 1840s depression to rise to social prominence in the second half of the 19th century. It encompasses:&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-30/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;
*the family's role as landowners with significant commercial interests in Parramatta
*the family's pre {{circa|1910}} commercial and social prominence as pastoralists
*the social make-up of the extended family which included, free settlers, emancipists, pastoralists, businessmen, merchants and military, political and engineering men.

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The property is significant for:
*The evidence that the wide range of building works, including agricultural works, provides of various forms of design and construction from 1812 to the present
*The wide range of services and domestic equipment at the place dating from 1812 to the present.
*the immense research potential of the continuum of building techniques, services and equipment on the site and for the one family.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-35/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The garden is important for its layout rather than its plants. It is perhaps the earliest garden design to have survived in NSW, almost unaltered in form although modified slightly in detail.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2-36&gt;Broadbent &amp; Bogle 1990:24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

The historical relationship of Rouse Hill to other properties owned by the Rouse family is representative of historical patterns of settlement in NSW in which first generation properties on the [[Cumberland Plain]] were supplemented or eclipsed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-2/&gt;

'''SDS-PAGE''' ('''sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis''') is a variant of [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], an analytical method in biochemistry for the separation of charged molecules in mixtures by their [[molecular mass]]es in an [[electric field]]. It uses [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate [[protein]] molecules.

SDS-PAGE is a [[Discontinuous electrophoresis|discontinuous electrophoretic system]] developed by [[Ulrich K. Laemmli]] which is commonly used as a method to separate [[protein]]s with molecular masses between 5 and 250 [[Kilodalton|KDa]].&lt;ref name="Laemmli1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laemmli|first1=U.

SDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS ([[sodium dodecyl sulfate]]) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein,&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reynolds JA, [[Charles Tanford]] | title=Binding of dodecyl sulfate to proteins at high binding ratios.

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.

SDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules ([[monomer]]) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules.&lt;ref name="TurroYekta1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turro|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Yekta|first2=Ahmad|title=Luminescent probes for detergent solutions.

Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent [[cross-link]]ing and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the [[chemical equilibrium]] of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against [[protease]]s and an increased [[biological half-life]].&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Manning M, Colón W| title=Structural basis of protein kinetic stability: resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests a central role for rigidity and a bias toward beta-sheet structure. | journal=Biochemistry | year= 2004 | volume= 43 | issue= 35 | pages= 11248–54 | pmid=15366934 | doi=10.1021/bi0491898 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15366934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or [[western blot]]ting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.

=== Gel production ===
[[File:Electrophoresis gel combs 2.jpg|thumb|Sample combs with different numbers of pockets, each prong leaves a pocket in the gel when pulled out]]
[[File:Acrylamidgel.JPG|thumb|Polymerised separating and stacking gel before removing the sample comb (white) between the spacers (black), in the stacking gel are small amounts of bromophenol blue for improved visibility, the separating gel is unstained]]
When using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the [[diffusion]] does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.

By using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Margolis J, Kenrick KG| title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056–7 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=5774398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris–glycine and neutral pH Bis–Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237–245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiltfangArold1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352–366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer ([[continuous gel electrophoresis]]) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt; Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect.

=== Sample preparation ===
[[File:Disulfide reduction by DTT-2.png|thumb|Disulfide reduction by DTT]]
During sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95&amp;nbsp;°C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing [[thiol]]s such as [[β-mercaptoethanol]] (β-ME, 5% by volume), [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT, 10 millimolar) or [[dithioerythritol]] (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.

In addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian M. Rosenberg|title=Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gi-UgCF8G6EC&amp;pg=PA103|date=22 December 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4412-3|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.

=== Electrophoresis ===
[[File:Gelelektrophoreseapparatur.jpg|thumb|Electrophoresis chamber after a few minutes of electrophoresis. In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]
For separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.

The fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.

The most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.&lt;ref name="Schäggervon Jagow1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schägger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368–379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Protein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. [[Glycoprotein]]s have differential levels of [[glycosylations]] and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands.&lt;ref name="Cryo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryo-EM Part A: Sample Preparation and Data Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1mPepNTgxcC&amp;pg=PA28|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-095695-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Membrane protein]]s, because of their [[transmembrane domain]], are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower [[solubility]] in aqueous solutions, tend to bind [[lipid]]s, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to [[hydrophobic effect]]s when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in "tailing" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color ("smear") below a band.&lt;ref name="BurgessDeutscher2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P. Deutscher|title=Guide to Protein Purification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6Lp4yna4hoC&amp;pg=PA184|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092317-8|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a [[gel extraction]] can be performed.

=== Archiving ===
[[File:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|Two SDS gels after completed separation of the samples and staining in a drying frame]]
After protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Molecular mass determination ==
[[File:LogM over Rf.png|thumb|The proteins of the size marker (black X) show an approximately straight line in the representation of log M over Rf. The molecular weight of the unknown protein (red X) can be determined on the y-axis.]]
For a more accurate determination of the molecular weight, the relative migration distances of the individual protein bands are measured in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="BonnerHargreaves2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip L.R. Bonner|author2=Alan J. Hargreaves|title=Basic Bioscience Laboratory Techniques: A Pocket Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pavxt_jKi80C&amp;pg=PT140|date=24 August 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-95644-0|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holtzhauer2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Holtzhauer|title=Basic Methods for the Biochemical Lab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lymxOH6cGCoC&amp;pg=PA243|date=13 September 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-32786-8|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements are usually performed in triplicate for increased accuracy. The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility. Bands of proteins with glycosylations can be blurred.&lt;ref name="Cryo"/&gt; Proteins with many basic amino acids (e. g. [[histone]]s)&lt;ref name="VenrooijMaini2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.J. van Venrooij|author2=Ravinder N.

Accordingly, many acidic amino acids can lead to accelerated migration of a protein and an underestimation of its molecular mass.&lt;ref name="GuanZhu2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guan|first1=Yihong|last2=Zhu|first2=Qinfang|last3=Huang|first3=Delai|last4=Zhao|first4=Shuyi|last5=Jan Lo|first5=Li|last6=Peng|first6=Jinrong|title=An equation to estimate the difference between theoretically predicted and SDS PAGE-displayed molecular weights for an acidic peptide|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|year=2015|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep13370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.

Additionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).

In [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].

In medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].

== Variants ==
SDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].

== Alternatives ==
While being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].&lt;ref name="Janson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]&lt;ref name="Desai2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed A. Desai|title=Downstream Processing of Proteins: Methods and Protocols|url=|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-027-8|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[ultrafiltration]].&lt;ref name="Raja2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghosh Raja|title=Protein Bioseparation Using Ultrafiltration: Theory, Applications And New Developments|url=|date=11 June 2003|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-78326-126-0|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a [[pull-down assay]]. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of [[Extraction (chemistry)|extractions]] and [[precipitation]]s using [[kosmotropic]] molecules, for example the [[ammonium sulfate precipitation]] and the [[polyethyleneglycol]] precipitation.

== History ==
In 1948, [[Arne Tiselius]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field.&lt;ref name="Pederson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pederson|first1=T.|title=Turning a PAGE: the overnight sensation of SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis|journal=The FASEB Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2007|pages=949–953|issn=0892-6638|doi=10.1096/fj.08-0402ufm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a [[zone electrophoresis]] improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, L., Davis, B. J.: ''Disc Electrophoresis –1. Background and Theory.'' In: ''Ann NY Acad Sci.'' 121, 1964, pp. 321–349.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by [[David F. Summers]] in the working group of [[James E. Darnell]] to separate poliovirus proteins.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Summers DF, Maizel JV, Darnell JE| title=Evidence for virus-specific noncapsid proteins in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 1965 | volume= 54 | issue= 2 | pages= 505–13 | pmid=4285933 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.54.2.505| pmc=219696 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=4285933}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K.

'''''San Sombrèro''''' (subtitled ''A Land of Carnivals, Cocktails and Coups'') is a [[parody]] travel [[guide book]] examining the [[eponymous]] [[fictional country]], described as the birthplace of [[sunglasses|tinted sunglasses]] and [[sequin]]s. This country is set in [[Central America]], and was created by Australian comedic writers [[Tom Gleisner]], [[Santo Cilauro]] and [[Rob Sitch]] (of ''[[The D-Generation]]'' and ''[[The Panel (Australian TV series)|The Panel]]'' fame).

In Spanish, San Sombrèro would be translated into English as "Saint Hat", "San" being the shortened word for the Spanish word "santo" meaning saint, and "sombrero" (no [[accent mark]] in real-world Spanish) meaning hat.

According to the book the "full and technically correct" name of San Sombrèro is the "'''Democratic Free People's United Republic of San Sombrèro'''", and citizens may be arrested, without a warrant, if the title is ''not'' used.

== About San Sombrèro ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SanSombrèroMap.png|right|thumb|Map of San Sombrèro.|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 18 August 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
The "Democratic Free People’s United Republic of San Sombrèro" is a composite of many [[stereotype]]s and [[cliché]]s about [[Central America]] and South America. It would be difficult to position the fictional San Sombèro on a map of Central America. Although it is presented as a thin country between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] (similar to [[Panama]]), it runs diagonally from northeast to southwest, in comparison to the other states on the Central American strip of land that run more from the northwest to southeast, or west to east. If San Sombrèro were to be geographically placed it would probably fit best between Panama and [[Costa Rica]].

The book says the nation has "362 separate public holidays (not including the 'carnivale' long weekend)". San Sombrèro appears to be a stereotypically corrupt and unstable [[banana republic]] with seemingly endless revolutions and counter-revolutions. The country is said to have had 17 different presidents over 10 years.

San Sombrèro is described as having a very high literacy rate because of an anti-illiteracy campaign in which "over 53,000 citizens who were unable to read [were] jailed or deported to [[Haiti]]".

Before the arrival of the Spanish, San Sombrèro was said to inhabited by several "Amer-Indian" ethnic groups, called the "Ciboney" (Siboney) (Nomadic hunter-gatherers), "[[Taíno|Taino]]" (who lived on seafood), "Puorcina" (who practiced simple agriculture) and the most dominant "Guanajaxo" (they just stole from everyone else). But there was a tribe that existed before called the "Bollivquar", fierce warriors who regarded themselves as a very complex and advanced society, which is said to be odd because they "never quite" mastered fire, irrigation or star jumps. But they learnt how to farm tobacco, which to this day still remains a part of the Bollivquar diet, explaining their stunted growth. Note that their inability to light a fire made it harder to take up smoking.

=== Language ===
San Sombrèro is a Spanish-speaking country, but a dialect has developed known as San Sombrèran, which combines Castilian grammar, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] pronunciation, and indigenous shouting. San Sombrèran Spanish is spoken a lot faster than normal Spanish, because it is considered impolite for people to take a breath during a sentence (particularly since their breath is so foul). San Sombrèran Spanish has many English [[loanwords]], some of which are "beisbol" - baseball, "hamburgesa" - hamburger (these two are actual Spanish words), "beeras" - beers, and "dryvebyshooting" - [[Drive-by shooting|drive by shooting]].

=== National anthem ===
The San Sombrèran national anthem is "'''O Patria Gloriosa'''" (O Glorious Motherland), written in 1853 by independence leader Juan Robirro, who is famous for uttering "He who loves his country, lives forever" shortly before falling off a ladder and dying. The national anthem is set to a [[bossa nova]] beat, and loyal citizens of San Sombrèro will stand respectfully, place a hand on each hip and start to gyrate while the anthem is played.

*A verse
:: My baby melts my heart
:: My baby drives me nuts
:: The way she swings her hips
:: The way her hair hangs down
:: Give me a kiss,
:: O gorgeous woman
:: Cover my lips
:: In passionate bliss
:: Long live San Sombrèro
:: O glorious fatherland.

=== Flag ===
[[File:Camouflagio.png|thumb|right|Flag of San Sombrero]]
The flag of San Sombrèro is the "Camouflagio", which resembles [[military camouflage]], with a narrow vertical white stripe on the left side. When the nation first became independent from Spain a dirty red and white chequered [[tablecloth]] made an impromptu flag.

=== Regions ===
The capital city of San Sombrèro is '''Cucaracha City''' in '''Polluçión'''. There are five provinces in San Sombrèro including Polluçión, the other provinces are: 
*'''Maracca''' (Capital: '''San Pistachio''')
*'''Guacomala''' (Capital: '''Fumarole''')
*'''Lambarda''' (Capital: '''Aguazura''')
*'''San Abandonio''' (Capital: '''Nicotiño''')

== Fictional travel guides ==

The book advertises (fictional) guides on the following places: Unaudited Arab Emirates (the Middle East), Costa Lottsa (akin to Monaco), the Barbituros Islands (the Caribbean), Alpenstein (the Alps), Tyranistan (Former Soviet Union), Nuku'la Atoll (Polynesia), frozen Norgborg (Scandinavia), and the miserable Isle of Fogg (North Sea). It also advertises its website's forum, as well as world tours for botanists and golfers, and an opportunity to spend a year in an untouched part of Europe.

The book ends with The Jetlag Story.

'''Software Heritage''' is an &lt;!--non-profit--&gt;initiative whose goal is to collect, preserve, and share software code — both freely licensed and not — in a universal software storage archive.&lt;ref name=BoingBoing-Feature-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Paul|title=Software Heritage: Creating a safe haven for software|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/06/30/software-heritage-creating-a.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=[[Boing Boing]]|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DebConf16-DandrimontPres-2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dandrimont|first1=Nicolas|title=Software Heritage: Building the Universal Software Archive  by Nicolas Dandrimont at DebConf16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXLv1wkgIw|website=Software Heritage|accessdate=26 July 2016|format=Video presentation|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although started in 2015, the initiative was worked on as a research project for two years before that time. Software Heritage began public operations on June 30, 2016.&lt;ref name=SoftwareHeritage-Opening-PressRelease-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Collect, organise, preserve and share the Software Heritage of mankind|url=https://www.softwareheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PressReleasePressKit-2016-06-30.en_.pdf|website=Software Heritage|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed under the auspices of the French research institute, [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation|French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Inria)]], which hosts the initiative on its servers. The budget Inria is providing for the project is €500,000 over three years.&lt;ref name=Archimag-Launch-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jost|first1=Clémence|title=Open source: lancement de Software Heritage, la plus grande bibliothèque de codes source de la planète|url=http://www.archimag.com/demat-cloud/2016/07/01/open-source-software-heritage-archive-codes-source|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=Archimag|date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software Heritage was founded by computer scientists [[Roberto Di Cosmo]] and [[Stefano Zacchiroli]].&lt;ref name=ArsTechnica-Alexandria-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moody|first1=Lyn|title=Software Heritage, the “Library of Alexandria of software,” launches today|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/business/2016/06/software-heritage-the-library-of-alexandria-of-software-launches-today/|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its repository holds over 20 million software projects, with an archive of over 2.7 billion unique source files as of July 2016.&lt;ref name=SoftwareHeritage-Opening-PressRelease-2016 /&gt; 

Additional sponsors of the Software Heritage initiative include [[Microsoft]] and the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the
[[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]]'s Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS).&lt;ref name=LWN-Analysis-2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DANS-Inria-MoU-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=DANS and Inria sign the MoU for Software Heritage — English|url=https://dans.knaw.nl/en/current/news/dans-and-inria-sign-the-mou-for-software-heritage|website=Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons]], [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GitHub]], [[Jason Scott]], the [[Linux Foundation]], and [[Microsoft]] among others have endorsed the project.&lt;ref name=Slate-Alexandria-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brogan|first1=Jacob|title=Introducing Software Heritage, the Library of Alexandria for Code|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/06/30/software_heritage_from_inria_wants_to_preserve_old_versions_of_computer.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Software Heritage's goal is to preserve software in its original source code that is [[free/open source software|free/open source software (FOSS)]].&lt;ref name=netzpolitik-Overview-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schießle|first1=Björn|title=Software Heritage – Erhalt eines Kulturerbes|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2016/software-heritage-erhalt-eines-kulturerbes/|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=[[netzpolitik.org]]|date=4 July 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the initiative is to collect, preserve, and share software that is across cultural heritage, industry, education, science, and research communities, with the concern that software that is made up of technical and scientific knowledge will be lost without preservation.&lt;ref name=BoingBoing-Feature-2016 /&gt; The project came about because software code is seen as being even more vulnerable to corruption and obsolescence than typical archival holdings like books and other media like video and film.&lt;ref name=LWN-Analysis-2016 /&gt;

The interface is built using open source code, with an initial focus on search, where end-users search by [[SHA-1]] hashes.&lt;ref name=LWN-Analysis-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willis|first1=Nathan|title=Preserving the global software heritage [LWN.net]|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/693471/|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=[[LWN.net]]|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Software Heritage initiative is open to scientific researchers, with the idea that it would be a [[Library of Alexandria]] type resource for software.&lt;ref name=Slate-Alexandria-2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LesEchos-Feature-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moreira|first1=Enrique|title=Bienvenue dans la bibliothèque d’Alexandrie du logiciel|url=http://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/0211095188110-bienvenue-dans-la-bibliotheque-dalexandrie-du-logiciel-2012058.php|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=[[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Échos]]|date=4 July 2016|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Software Heritage will be an infrastructure resource upon which developers can build applications on top of the archive.&lt;ref name=DebConf16-DandrimontPres-2016 /&gt; Another goal is to get guidance from researchers on what features might be valuable as a way to structure output and collection curation.&lt;ref name=LWN-Analysis-2016 /&gt;

Other grass-roots initiatives exist, like archivist [[Jason Scott|Jason Scott's]] [[Textfiles.com]] project, the Code Archive (which attempts to archive [[GitHub]]),&lt;ref name=CodeArchive-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=The Code Archive|url=https://the-code-archive.launchrock.com/|website=The Code Archive|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOPEXI-CodeArchive-2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valsorda|first1=Filippo|last2=Aljammaz|first2=Salman|title=The Code Archive - from HOPE XI - NOETHER|url=http://livestream.com/internetsociety2/hopeconf/videos/130613964|website=[[Hackers on Planet Earth|HOPE XI]]|accessdate=26 July 2016|format=Video presentation|date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOPEXI-CodeArchive-Deck-2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valsorda|first1=Filippo|last2=Aljammaz|first2=Salman|title=The Code Archive - HOPE XI|url=https://speakerdeck.com/filosottile/the-code-archive-hope-xi|website=The Code Archive|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Internet Archive]]'s [[Wayback Machine]].&lt;ref name=Slate-Alexandria-2016 /&gt; Software Heritage is gathering software that has free licenses from sources that include [[GitHub]], [[Debian]] package archive, and [[GNU Project]] [[FTP]] archive and from entities like [[Gitorious]] and [[Google Code]], projects that no longer exist.&lt;ref name=BoingBoing-Feature-2016 /&gt; 

The archive is structured so knowledge can be preserved, enabling continuous access to digital information, as well as creating a building block for thematic portals and collections of software. The initiative can be used to create better software for the industry, where original software has often been lost. Software Heritage will ensure long-term preservation of software, making software provenance more traceable, integrated, and reusable, with an ability to know licensing (which is not always present) and use constraints, track security vulnerabilities, and assist in the discovery of prior code assets.&lt;ref name=BoingBoing-Feature-2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DebConf16-DandrimontPres-2016 /&gt;

'''''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy''''' is a 1997 [[reference work]] concerning [[fantasy]] fiction, edited by [[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]]. Other contributors include [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Diana Wynne Jones]], [[David Langford]], [[Sam J. Lundwall]], [[Michael Scott Rohan]], [[Brian Stableford]] and [[Lisa Tuttle]].
 
The book was well-received on publication. During 1998, it received the [[Hugo Award]],&lt;ref name="hugo1998"/&gt; [[World Fantasy Award]],&lt;ref name="worldfantasy1998"/&gt; and [[Locus Award]].&lt;ref name="locusaward1998"/&gt; The industry publication ''[[Library Journal]]'' described ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' as "the first of its kind".&lt;ref name="libraryjournal"/&gt;

Since November 2012, the full text of ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' is available on-line, as a companion to the on-line ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At last the Encyclopedia of Fantasy is free and searchable online!|url=http://io9.com/5963412/at-last-the-encyclopedia-of-fantasy-is-free-and-searchable-online|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=[[i09]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' have stated that there are not any plans to update the ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', at least for the foreseeable future, although some death dates post-1997 have been added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy|url=http://sfencyclopedia.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/the-encyclopedia-of-fantasy/|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and content==
The ''Encyclopedia'' was published in a format that matches the 1993 second edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]''. It is slightly smaller in terms of content, containing 1,049 alphabetical pages, over 4,000 entries and approximately one million words, the bulk of which were written by Clute, Grant and Ashley. A later [[CD-ROM]] edition contains numerous revisions.

The ''Encyclopedia'' uses a similar system of [[categorization]] to ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', but does not include an index of theme entries. A theme index was later included in the on-line addenda: see "External links" below. One of the major differences is that there are no entries related to [[publishing]].

==Neologisms==
The ''Encyclopedia'' often invented new terms for theme entries, rather than using headings that may have previously appeared in critical literature. Examples include:

* ''Instauration Fantasy'': a story in which the real world is transformed; the authors cite ''[[Little, Big]]'' (1981) by [[John Crowley]] as the first full-fledged example.
* ''Thinning'': the gradual loss or decay of magic or vitality, as when the Elves depart from [[Middle-earth]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In many novels by [[Tim Powers]], denizens of the 20th century can work magic, but not as easily as could be done in earlier centuries.
* ''Wainscots'': secret societies hiding from the mainstream of society, as in [[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]]'s ''[[The Borrowers]]''.
* ''Water Margins'': shifting or ill-defined boundaries used as both a physical description and a metaphor; derived from the [[Japan]]ese [[television]] adaptation of ''[[Water Margin|The Water Margin]]''.
* ''Polder'': defined as "enclaves of toughened reality demarcated by boundaries" that are entered by crossing a threshold. [[Shangri-La]] is an example, as is Medwyn's valley in ''[[The Book of Three]]'' by [[Lloyd Alexander]]. 
* ''Crosshatch'': A situation where the demarcation line between two realities is blurred and "two or more worlds may simultaneously inhabit the same territory"—such as in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
* ''[[Sources of fantasy|Taproot texts]]'': examples of fantasy literature that predates the emergence of fantasy as a genre in the late 18th century, such as Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]''.
* ''Pariah elite'': a marginalized but uniquely talented or knowledgeable minority.
* ''Into the woods'': the process of transformation or passage into a new world signalled by entering woods or forests.
* ''Wrongness'': the growing awareness that something is "wrong" in the world, such as when the [[Hobbit]]s first glimpse the [[Nazgûl]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
*''Slick Fantasy'': a style of Fantasy writing which uses certain specific themes: typically a [[deal with the Devil|Pact with the Devil]]; three wishes; or identity exchange. So named because these were the fantasy stories mostly likely to be published by [[Slick (magazine format)|slick magazine]]s, as opposed to [[pulp magazine]]s.

==Reception==

Characterizing the book as "an excellent and highly readable source for fantasy", the industry publication ''[[Library Journal]]'' described ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' as "the first of its kind".&lt;ref name="libraryjournal"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Scarecrow''''' is a 2013 animated [[short film]] and [[Advertising|advertisement]] by the American restaurant chain [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]]. The film features [[Fiona Apple]] singing a [[cover version]] of "[[Pure Imagination]]", originally performed by [[Gene Wilder]] as [[Willy Wonka]] in the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2013/09/chipotle-mexican-restaurants-animated-film-sustainable-food-marketing.html|title= What Does "The Scarecrow" Tell Us About Chipotle?|accessdate=September 25, 2013|date=September 23, 2013|first=Elizabeth|last=Weiss|work=[[The New Yorker]]|location=New York City|issn=0028-792X|oclc=320541675|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Fiona Apple 2012.png|thumb|left|[[Fiona Apple]] (''pictured in 2012'') performs "[[Pure Imagination]]".]]

In a [[dystopia]]n world,&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; the main character, Scarecrow, starts work at the "smoke-spewing" Crow Foods Incorporated. He sees a tube extracting a substance labeled "100% Beef-ish", but being marketed to consumers as "[[Natural foods|all natural]]". He then witnesses a [[robot]]ic crow injecting a chicken with green fluid to [[growth hormone|promote expansion]], followed by cows being held [[Captivity (animal)|captive]] in small metal boxes while machines continuously milk the cows forcefully.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Scarecrow returns to his small farm, seemingly upset by what he witnessed during the workday. He picks a red pepper, which inspires him to harvest other vegetables and open a burrito stand in the city. Above his stand is a banner that reads "Cultivate a Better World".&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

The computer-animated film features a [[cover version]] of "[[Pure Imagination]]" ([[Leslie Bricusse]], [[Anthony Newley]]) by [[Fiona Apple]],&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; a song originally performed by [[Gene Wilder]] as [[Willy Wonka]] in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971), itself an adaptation of [[Roald Dahl]]'s book, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964). According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Apple's performance "scores scenes of dark devastation" and offers "stark contrast between the world of pure imagination of the lyrics" and the animals being processed.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; In the film, when Scarecrow returns home from work and picks a red pepper, the song transitions from "mournful" and "menacing" to a "happier" tone.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Apple released the recording on [[iTunes]], with proceeds benefiting the [[nonprofit organization]], Chipotle Cultivation Foundation.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

''The Scarecrow'' ends with a brief teaser for a [[mobile app]] game available for [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s, where the player can take down the fictional Crow Foods.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/09/12/221736558/taking-down-big-food-is-the-name-of-chipotles-new-game|title=Taking Down Big Food Is the Name of Chipotle's New Game|accessdate=September 26, 2013|date=September 12, 2013|first=Eliza|last=Barclay|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipotle described the film as a "companion" piece to the game.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-fiona-apple-covers-willy-wonka-in-striking-new-chipotle-clip-20130913,0,6756902.story|title=Fiona Apple covers Willy Wonka in striking new Chipotle clip|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Randall|last=Roberts|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2013|location=Los Angeles, California|issn=0458-3035|oclc=3638237|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:William Joyce Oscar Parade Shreveport Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] in 2012]]

[[Chief Marketing Officer]] Mark Crumpacker stated that because his company "is on a mission to change the way the world thinks of and eats fast food," they wished to inform the public about how the food they eat is raised. Brand Voice Lead William Espey added that they wanted to create "this experience, this film and mobile game that would help us support that mission."&lt;ref name=YouTubeBehindtheScenes&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ZOFIE5e4g&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=PLo5Sq8vGKhMOxUUOaMorLgYULnbwH7OeI|title=The Scarecrow – Behind the Scenes|work=[[YouTube]]|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpacker also stated that the film depicts the "elaborate facade that's been created by the [[Food industry|industrial food]] producers," who have done a "very good job of creating a rosy picture of their industry."&lt;ref name=YouTubeBehindtheScenes/&gt; The film reflects Chipotle's marketing strategy of avoiding television advertising; the company's goal is to come across as an alternative to [[factory farming]] and a more "highbrow" option over other fast food restaurants.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-interviews/cmo-crumpacker-chipotle-bucking-fast-food-model/233210/|title=Chipotle Bucks Fast-Food Convention While It Still Can|accessdate=September 26, 2013|date=March 12, 2012|first=Maureen|last=Morrison|work=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Scarecrow'' was animated by Moonbot Studios, a small firm co-founded by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] and [[Brandon Oldenburg]] that won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=AdWeekSept12&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-chipotle-makes-magic-again-fiona-apple-and-dark-animated-film-152380|title=Ad of the Day: Chipotle Makes Magic Yet Again with Fiona Apple and a Dark Animated Film|work=[[Adweek]]|first=Tim|last=Nudd|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2013|location=|issn=|oclc=|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moonbot liked Chipotle's food and ethos and created a video centered around [[scarecrow]]s, which "normally protect food," but in this film they protect "something we call food, but it's something that seriously overproduced on a dramatic scale... which is not that far from the truth."&lt;ref name=YouTubeBehindtheScenes/&gt; Co-directors Oldenburg and Limbert Fabian found inspiration from ''Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory'', as well as from [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournalSept19/&gt;

Chipotle originally selected [[Frank Ocean]] to perform "Pure Imagination" for the commercial, but he asked to be removed after the chain declined to remove its logo from the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beltrone|first1=Gabriel|title=Frank Ocean Gets the Last (Four-Letter) Word in Spat With Chipotle|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/frank-ocean-gets-last-four-letter-word-spat-chipotle-156232|website=Adweek|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately replaced by Fiona Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitehill|first1=Gaby|title=Fiona Apple claims Frank Ocean was due to sing Chipotle TV advert {{!}} Gigwise|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/84925/fiona-apple-claims-frank-ocean-was-due-to-sing-chipotle-tv-advert|website=gigwise.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Chipotle sued Ocean for the $212,500 advance that they had paid him to perform in the commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coleman|first1=Miriam|title=Frank Ocean Sued by Chipotle Over Ad Deal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-ocean-sued-by-chipotle-over-ad-deal-20140308|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed later that month after Ocean repaid the advance in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Jason|title=Frank Ocean Settles Chipotle Lawsuit|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-ocean-settles-chipotle-lawsuit-with-curse-free-check-20140320|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
The short film was released on September 11, 2013. By September 19, it had been viewed 5.5 million times on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournalSept19&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/19/the-story-behind-that-fiona-apple-chipotle-ad/?mod=WSJBlog |title= The Story Behind That Fiona Apple Chipotle Ad |accessdate=September 26, 2013|date=September 19, 2013|first=Alexandra|last=Cheney|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|location=New York City|publisher=[[News Corp]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Scarecrow'' has been praised as innovative marketing and a "beautiful" work of art.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; ''[[AdWeek]]'' felt that the effective animation and Apple's voice "connects the viewer emotionally to the story," but felt that it was "not quite as magical" as Chipotle's similarly-themed "Back to the Start" video.&lt;ref name=AdWeekSept12/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} Randall Roberts called the film surreal, direct and "visually magnetic", and wrote that "the song as covered by Apple is gorgeous, filled with electronic flourishes and rococo arrangements. The images imbue her version with a melancholy, but, taken on its own, the song shimmers."&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'s}} [[Matthew Yglesias]] complimented the film's animation and music, and called the scene in which cows are seen in small crates "the most poignant moment you've ever witnessed in [[fast food advertising|fast food marketing]]".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/09/12/chipotle_scarecrow_video_is_totally_amazing.html|title=You Want to Watch Chipotle's Amazing "Scarecrow" Video|first=Matthew|last=Yglesias|accessdate=September 26, 2013|date=September 12, 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|authorlink=Matthew Yglesias}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that, if Chipotle's goal was to create "high-quality high-impact stuff that really gets attention and is designed to be memorable", the company was successful.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; Marketing reporter Bruce Horovitz, contributing for ''[[USA Today]]'', named it the fifth best advertisement of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/12/23/worst-ads-2013-worst-ads/4111489/ |title= Horovitz: Best and worst ads of 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013|date=December 24, 2013|first=Bruce |last=Horovitz|work=[[USA Today]]|location=Tysons Corner, Virginia|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thomas J. Watson Library''' is the main [[research library]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (MMA), and supports the research activities of the museum staff, as well as outside researchers. 

==Description==
Located on the first floor of the MMA, the Watson Library can be visited without appointment. At the MMA, each department also maintains its own internal library, most of which have materials that are requestable online through the Watson Library catalog. The collection is a closed-shelf reference library, and materials are not available for borrowing by the general public, but may be used in a secure reading room; some items may be borrowed by MMA staffers.

In addition, the MMA hosts the [[Nolen Library]] on its ground floor, a collection of 10,000 items in an open-shelf, non-circulating collection intended for the general public, including children. The Nolen Library also includes a large collection of children's books, as well as specialized curriculum materials for educators.

The Watson Library’s collection contains approximately 900,000 volumes, including monographs and exhibition catalogs; over 11,000 periodical titles; and more than 125,000 auction and sale catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/portal/collections/ |title=Thomas J. Watson Library » Blog Archive » Collections |publisher=Libmma.org |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library also includes a reference collection, a rare book collection, manuscript items, and vertical file collections. The library is accessible to anyone over 18, simply by registering online and providing a valid photo ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/portal/access-hours-and-policies/ |title=Thomas J. Watson Library » Blog Archive » Access and Hours |publisher=Libmma.org |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a free account is set up, a researcher may issue reserve requests online, in advance of an on-site visit, and may also issue requests in person at the library.

The library houses several display cases which are used for temporary exhibits of books and publications from its collections. Exhibits may focus on a single artist, an artistic movement, a publication medium or style, or any other topic of interest. Items which are on exhibit are clearly flagged in the online catalog as temporarily unavailable for use.

The Watson Library is named for [[Thomas J.

'''Thurloe Square''' is a traditional [[garden square]] in [[South Kensington]], London, England.

There are private [[communal gardens]] in the centre of the square for use by the local residents. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] is close by to the north across '''Thurloe Place''' and [[Cromwell Gardens]]. The nearest tube station is [[South Kensington tube station|South Kensington]] to the west along '''Thurloe Street'''.

The square (and the adjacent streets) are named after [[John Thurloe]], an advisor of [[Oliver Cromwell]], who owned the land in the seventeenth century. His descendant, Harris Brace, had a godson called John Alexander, who developed the area in the 1820s. [[George Basevi]] designed most of the houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Ben Weinreb|Weinreb, Ben]] and [[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]] |title=[[The London Encyclopaedia]] |edition=reprint |year=1992 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |page=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Henry Cole]] (1808–1892), the first Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, lived at 33 Thurloe Square just opposite the museum. The building is marked with a [[blue plaque]] and is now the [[Kazakhstan]] Embassy.

The homeopath [[Margery Blackie]] lived and practised at no. 18 from 1929-1980. The building is marked with a blue plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackie's home and practice on Thurloe Square|url=http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmgallery/general/large.asp?gallery=vm_blue_plaques&amp;img=blue_plaques/thumb/vm_bp_0095.jpg&amp;size=large&amp;caller=&amp;cpg=&amp;tpg=|website=RBKC|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yalta Memorial Garden]] which contains a memorial to those repatriated as a result of the [[Yalta Conference]] following World War II, ''[[Twelve Responses to Tragedy]]'', is situated at the north of the square between the square and the Cromwell Road.&lt;ref name=WMO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/node/140490|title=Communist Victims/Twelve Responses to Tragedy|publisher=War Memorials Online|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TreeRing''' is a Silicon Valley, CA-based technology company providing [[print on demand|on-demand digital printing]] of customizable school yearbooks in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web|title=College yearbooks retain relevance in print|url=http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/pulse/college-yearbooks-retain-relevance-in-print|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=Jacob Hawkins|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nd&gt;{{cite web|title=More school yearbooks adding online content|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/more-school-yearbooks-adding-online-content-1.3806994|work=[[Newsday]]|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=Scott Eidler|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the first start-ups that changed the traditional yearbook industry: the company designed free software with social-networking features allowing the creation of personalized yearbooks&lt;ref name=abclocal&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating high school memories digitally|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/education&amp;id=8705458|publisher=[[WABC-TV]]|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=[[Art McFarland]]|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered a new [[business model]] eliminating the financial cost of yearbooks for schools.

==Distinctive features==
TreeRing's publishing platform allows the high school community to collaborate on web-based yearbooks saved using [[cloud storage]]. Its users can add, share, and comment on photos, memories, and events. Students and their parents can customize their copy of the school yearbook by uploading their own content for personalized pages.&lt;ref name=nday&gt;{{cite web|title=LI school yearbooks get a boost from technology|url=http://long-island.newsday.com/kids/li-school-yearbooks-get-a-boost-from-technology-1.6123909|work=[[Newsday]]|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=Beth Whitehouse|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=psfk&gt;{{cite web|title=High-Schoolers Can Personalize Yearbooks with Facebook Pictures|url=http://www.psfk.com/2013/05/personalize-yearbooks-social-network.html#!slWko|work=PSFK|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=Leah Gonzalez|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite web|title=Yearbooks in the Age of Cloud Computing|url=http://thejournal.com/articles/2013/04/29/yearbooks-in-the-cloud.aspx|work=The Journal|publisher=1105 Media Inc.|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=Margo Pierce|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in addition to a print version, schools can opt to share an online yearbook.&lt;ref name=usa /&gt;

The company's business model does not impose any financial obligation on schools signing up with TreeRing. Unlike traditional publishers business models based on [[offset printing]] techniques, there are no minimum orders.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Likely to Succeed|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/05/on_demand_yearbooks_treering_saves_students_and_schools_big_money.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=[[Farhad Manjoo]]|date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eschool&gt;{{cite web|title=New yearbook model is a win for students—and schools|url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/2013/06/19/new-yearbook-model-is-a-win-for-students-and-schools/|work=eSchool News|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=Ryan Novack|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordering and paying for yearbooks is done online.&lt;ref name=journal /&gt;

==Business activities==
In 2012, TreeRing printed 125,000 yearbooks and raised $3.6 million in the first round of [[Venture capital financing|venture funding]] in the [[Silicon Valley]]. The list of the company's investors included [[Mike McCue]] (a [[Flipboard]] co-founder), [[Rich Barton]] ([[Expedia (website)|Expedia]] and [[Zillow]] founder), [[Second Avenue Partners]], Cedar Grove Investments and others.&lt;ref name=giga /&gt;&lt;ref name=gw&gt;{{cite web|title=A yearbook for the Facebook generation: Rich Barton, Mike McCue back TreeRing|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/yearbook-facebook-generation-rich-barton-mike-mccue-bankroll-treering/|work=GeekWire|accessdate=16 January 2014|author=John Cook|date=25  September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the company served more than 2,000 schools across the US and was anticipating production of over 200,000 yearbooks.&lt;ref name=slate /&gt;

The organisation uses the concept of [[crowdsourcing]] for social activism and public accountability, serving as an initial model for what has been coined as "activist mapping"—the combination of social activism, [[citizen journalism]] and [[geospatial]] information.

== Products ==
=== Ushahidi v3 ===
Ushahidi v3 was released in September 2015. As an improvement to the v2 platform it is built as an API with a web client. It allows for custom survey creation, and the running of multiple surveys on a single deployment, amongst other feature improvements from v2 such as embeddable maps and surveys, analytics, private deployments, and management of roles and permissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/plans-detail|title=Plans|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built on the Laravel PHP web framework. It is open source under the AGPL license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=platform: Ushahidi Platform v3 API|date=2017-07-21|url=https://github.com/ushahidi/platform|publisher=Ushahidi|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ushahidi v2 ===
Ushahidi v2  is built on the [[Kohana (web framework)|Kohana]] web framework, a fork of the [[CodeIgniter#CodeIgniter|CodeIgniter]] framework. It includes support for Nexmo wholesale SMS API and Clickatell SMS Gateway. Furthermore, the official Ushahidi-hosted websites use the commercial service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickatell.com/press/press_article.php/154|title=SMS Helps Provide Instant SOS During Times of Crisis – Clickatell and Ushahidi Urge Support to Haiti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ushahidi provides the option of using [[OpenStreetMap]] maps in its user interface, but requires the [[Google Maps]] API for [[geocoding]]. Ushahidi is often set up using a local SMS gateway created by a local [[FrontlineSMS]] set-up.

===Crowdmap===
{{See also|Crowdmapping}}
Crowdmap is designed and built by the team behind Ushahidi, a platform that was originally built to crowdsource crisis information. As the platform evolved, so did its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5612368/crowdmap-puts-any-data-on-an-interactive-map|title=Crowdmap Puts Any Data on an Interactive Map|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdmap now allows users to set up their own deployments of Ushahidi without having to install it on a web server. Since its release in 2010, prominent deployments of Crowdmap have documented the global [[Occupy movement]] and the [[2011 London anti-cuts protest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/288952/the-tech-tools-of-political-revolution/8#fbid=Q78O4eF6bPV|title=The Tech Tools of Political Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://map.15october.net/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930132624/http://map.15october.net/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-30|title=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Crowdmap was a hosted version of the Ushahidi v2 open source software platform.

On 31 December 2010, the Ushahidi team announced a new version of Crowdmap, that differed from the Ushahidi v2 codebase: Checkins, a geosocial add-on to Crowdmap that allows users to create a [[White-label product|white-label]] alternative to sites like [[Foursquare]] and [[Gowalla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/12/31/announcing-checkins-for-ushahidi-and-crowdmap/|title=Announcing Checkins for Ushahidi and Crowdmap}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2011/01/03/check-ins_with_a_purpose_with_crisis-mapping_ushah#awesm=~okeEErmHcnhLYe|title=Checkins with a Purpose|publisher=ReadWrite}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than filling out submission forms online, checkins allow Crowdmap users to expedite data entry to their deployment, focussing first on location and adding more detailed information later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geospatialworld.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=21289%3Aushahidi-launches-crowdmap-checkins&amp;catid=42%3Aproduct-gis&amp;Itemid=1|title=Ushahidid launches Crowdmap Checkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ushahidi describes the effort as "checkins with a purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-29/tech/ushahidi.checkin.map_1_check-ins-gowalla-map?_s=PM:TECH|title=Ushahidid tests 'checkin' Funciton|date=23 August 2010|work=CNN|access-date=25 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827011736/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-29/tech/ushahidi.checkin.map_1_check-ins-gowalla-map?_s=PM:TECH|archive-date=27 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SwiftRiver (discontinued) ===
SwiftRiver was designed as a suite of intelligence and real-time data gathering products that complement Ushahidi's mapping and visualization products. Often referred to as ''the SwiftRiver Initiative'' the goal of the project was "to democratize access to the tools for making sense of information". The project attracted a lot of interest from newsrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/10/start/tagging-a-crisis|title=SwiftRiver: Tagging a Crisis|last=Kirwan|first=Peter|newspaper=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015111740/http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/10/start/tagging-a-crisis|archive-date=15 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Ushahidi announced that it would stop development and support and reallocate the resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushahidi.com/2014/12/08/bittersweet-farewell-swiftriver/|title=Bittersweet Farewell to SwiftRiver|website=Ushahidi|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SwiftRiver was a free and [[Open-source platform]] that helped people make sense of a lot of information in a short amount of time. It was born out of the need to understand and act upon a wave of massive amounts of crisis data that tends to overwhelm in the first 24 hours of a disaster. There had been a great deal of interest in Swift for other industries such as newsrooms, political analysts and marketers as an open-source alternative to more expensive, proprietary intelligence software platforms. The SwiftRiver platform offered applications which combine natural language/artificial intelligence process, [[Data mining|data-mining]] for SMS and Twitter, and verification algorithms for different sources of information.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Rollcall ===
Ushahidi built [https://www.rollcall.io/ RollCall] after a team member was involved in the terrorist attack at Westgate Malle in Nairobi in 2013. Rollcall is a quick way to check in with the people someone is responsible for during critical situations. Rollcall sends a one-click message with a binary question such as "Are you okay?" to a pre-prepared contact list, such as list of colleagues, parents at a school, or an embassy's list of citizens in a country at that time, via text, email, mobile app, and Slack. The recipients respond with a "yes" or "no" allowing the organization responsible for them to quickly triage who is in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollcall.io/|title=RollCall|website=www.rollcall.io|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Juliana Rotich.jpg|thumb|Juliana Rotich]]
===Beginnings in Kenya===
Ushahidi ([[Swahili language|Swahili]] for "testimony" or "witness") is a website created in the aftermath of Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election (see [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]]) that collected eyewitness reports of violence sent in by email and text-message and placed them on a [[Google map]].&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2008/1208/114.html|title=Citizen Voices|author=Megha Baree|date=20 November 2008|work=Forbes Magazine|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software developed for that site, which has since been improved, released freely, and used for a number of similar projects around the globe.

The Kenyan site was developed and run by several bloggers and software developers, all current or former residents of Kenya. They include [[Erik Hersman]], [[Juliana Rotich]], [[Ory Okolloh]], and [[David Kobia]].&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://venturebeat.com/2008/01/15/kenyan-tech-bloggers-launch-crisis-report-site/|title= Kenyan tech bloggers launch crisis-report site |author= David Adewumi  |date= 15 January 2008 |work= VentureBeat |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was initially proposed by Okolloh, developed cheaply, and put online within a few days.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/thestatewerein/otherstates/twsi-081206-Kenya-violence-redirected |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120714063214/http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/thestatewerein/otherstates/twsi-081206-Kenya-violence-redirected |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 14 July 2012 |title= Mapping violence in Kenya |author= Chris Chambers |date= 12 May 2008 |work= Radio Netherlands Worldwide |accessdate= 16 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International media, government sources, NGOs, and Kenyan journalists and bloggers were used to verify eyewitness testimony.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2008/0131/p99s01-duts.html?s=rel |title= Cellphone and Internet access helps – and hinders – accurate reporting in Kenya |author= Peter Smith |date= 31 January 2008 |work= Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mshale"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mshale.com/article.cfm?articleID=18192 |title= Kenyan Techie Honored for Role in Tracking Post-election Violence  |author= Dorcas Komo |date= 3 July 2008 |work= Mshale |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was later also used to facilitate donations from abroad.&lt;ref name="mshale" /&gt;

An analysis by [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Kennedy School of Government]] found that Ushahidi was better overall at reporting acts of violence as they began. The data collected by Ushahidi was superior to that reported by the mainstream media in [[Kenya]] at the time. The service was also better at reporting non-fatal violence as well as information coming in from rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]]. 2010. ''[[Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age]]''. New York: Penguin Press. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2010, Ushahidi Co-founder and Executive Director [[Ory Okolloh]] announced that she was stepping down from her role to become Manager of Policy for Africa at [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/12/google-hires-kenyan-activist-ory-okolloh-as-policy-manager-for-africa.html|title=Google hires Kenyan activist Ory Okolloh as policy manager for Africa | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenyanpundit.com/2010/12/23/stepping-down-as-ushahidi-executive-director/|title=Stepping Down as Ushahidi Executive Director}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Kenya crisis uses===
Soon after its initial use in Kenya, the Ushahidi software was used to create a similar site to track [[Xenophobia in South Africa#May 2008 riots|anti-immigrant violence in South Africa]], in May 2008.&lt;ref name="mshale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/world/africa/23iht-23saf.13165981.html | work=The New York Times | title=Anti-immigrant violence spreads in South Africa, with attacks reported in Cape Town | date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software has since been used to map violence in eastern Congo, beginning in November 2008.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7773648.stm |title= Web tool maps Congo conflict  |author= Alka Marwaha |date= 10 December 2008  |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ushahidi is used in Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in June 2009 to track pharmacy [[stockout]]s in several Southeast African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pcworld.com/article/169416/mobiles_help_put_a_stop_to_drug_stockouts.html%3C |title= Mobiles Help Put a Stop to Drug Stock-outs |author= Ken Banks |date= 31 July 2009 |work= Pc World |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was used to monitor elections in Mexico and India, among other projects.&lt;ref name="infoworld"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/technology-elevates-africas-global-status-494 |title= Technology elevates Africa's global status |author= Rebecca Wanjiku |date= 12 August 2009 |work= Computerworld |publisher= Infoworld |accessdate= 16 January 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110608082752/http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/technology-elevates-africas-global-status-494 |archive-date= 8 June 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by [[Al Jazeera]] to collect eyewitness reports during the 2008–09 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]].&lt;ref name="infoworld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://labs.aljazeera.net/warongaza |title=War on Gaza – Experimental Beta |publisher=Labs.aljazeera.net |accessdate=1 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228053334/http://labs.aljazeera.net/warongaza/ |archive-date=28 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ekine|first=Sokari|title=Ushahidi Platform Used to Document Congo, Gaza Crises|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/01/ushahidi-platform-used-to-document-congo-gaza-crises009.html|work=MediaShift|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=19 March 2011|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===

====Haiti====
In 2010, due to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]], Patrick Meier launched a joint effort between Ushahidi, The Fletcher School of Law &amp; Diplomacy at Tufts University, [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|UN OCHA]]/Colombia and the International Network of Crisis Mappers (CM*Net) to start the Haiti implementation. A few hours later many humanitarian/tech workers joined this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/gleaning-information-from-haiti-online/ |title=Tuesday and Wednesday's Updates on Haiti's Earthquake |first1=Robert |last1=Mackey |first2=Nick |last2=Corasaniti |date=12 January 2010 |work=New York Times |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011502650.html |title= Crisis mapping brings online tool to Haitian disaster relief effort |author= Monica Hesse |date= 16 January 2010 |work= Washington Post|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 40,000 independent reports were sent to the Ushahidi Haiti Project of which nearly 4,000 distinct events were plotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/uhp-eval-executive-summary-prelim-findings-1-12-11-draftb[2].pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111108092116/http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/uhp-eval-executive-summary-prelim-findings-1-12-11-draftb%5B2%5D.pdf|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2011-11-08|title= Independent Evaluation of the Ushahidi Haiti Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2010 BP’s offshore [[Deepwater Horizon|Deepwater Horizon oil rig]] exploded killing eleven workers and precipitating the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|largest accidental offshore oil spill]] in the history of the petroleum industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-27-oil-spill-news_N.htm|title=Gulf oil spill now largest offshore spill in history as BP continues plug effort|publisher=USA Today|date=27 May 2010|last=Staff and wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May the [[Louisiana Bucket Brigade]] (LABB) publicly released the Oil Spill Crisis Map, the first application of the Ushahidi platform in a humanitarian response in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the years since the BP oil spill, LABB continues to use the map (now the iWitness Pollution Map) as a repository of eyewitness reports and photos documenting the impacts of petrochemical pollution on human health and the environment. Reports to the map come from cities all over Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, St. Rose, and Chalmette. Since 2010 LABB has collected over 14,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwitnesspollution.org|title=iWitness Pollution Map|publisher=Louisiana Bucket Brigade|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports, making it the largest and longest-running deployment of an Ushahidi instance.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Elena Rapisardi, together with Giovanni Lotto, launched the first Italian crowdmap Open Foreste Italiane in order to list and map information to prevent and manage forest fires; the meaning of this project has been reported on the Ushahidi blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ushahidi.com/2010/05/05/ushahidi-used-in-italy-to-prevent-forest-fires |title= Ushahidi Used in Italy to Prevent Forest Fires |author= Monica Palmeri |date= 5 May 2010 |work= Ushahidi Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though OpenForeste did not completely achieve his goals, it showed importance for two reasons: (1) unlike previous instances, the platform was utilized in absence of an acting crisis or emergency to collect, map, share and spread information in order to manage future and potential emergencies, thus joining the awareness of the possibilities of [[Web 2.0]] and a different approach to natural risk prevention;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web2expo.com/webexny2009/public/schedule/speaker/61873 |title=See speech at Web 2.0 Expo on 2009 |publisher=Web2expo.com |date= |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) it brought to Italy the knowledge and potential of Ushahidi, [[crowdmapping]] and social use of [[crowdsourcing]], which was then used in following years in several instances, both private and public, especially from local Civil Protection structures and based on the new approach to the Ushahidi platform (see here a non-complete crowdmap of Italian Crowdsourcing Projects).

====Russia====
Ushahidi was used in Russia to set up a "map of help" for voluntary workers needed after the [[2010 Russian wildfires]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===2011===
;Christchurch
Using Ushahidi, the [[Christchurch Recovery Map]] website was launched less than 24 hours after the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]] in Christchurch, New Zealand. The site maps locations of services such as food, water, toilets, fuel, [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and medical care. Information was gathered via Twitter using the #eqnz hashtag, SMS messages, and email. The site was founded by a group of web professionals, and maintained by volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

;Middle East
This software allowed pro-democracy demonstrators across the Middle East to organise and communicate what was happening around them in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ushahidi.com/?s=egypt&amp;submit_button=Search&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March, the UN [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) requested that the Standby Volunteer Task Force be activated for Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/?p=345|title = The Volunteers Behind the Libya Crisis Map: A True Story|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force's Tech Team set up a password protected Ushahidi platform almost immediately and several days later launched a public version at OCHA's request. This allowed users to contribute relevant information about ground conditions as they occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.ushahidi.com/2011/03/06/using-new-ushahidi-map-libya/|title = Using the New Ushahidi Platform to Crisis Map Libya|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nigerian Elections'''

Ushahidi was used to monitor the Nigerian 2011 elections under the project Reclaim Naija. A published article in the Journal of Information Technology &amp; Politics by Catie Snow Bailard &amp; Steven Livingston showed that, "Controlling for a number of factors, we find that the number and nature of crowdmap reports generated by citizens is significantly correlated with increased voter turnout (by 8%) in the 2011 Nigerian presidential election as a result of providing officials with improved information about the functionality of local polling stations."&lt;ref name="Bailard 349–367"/&gt;

===2012===
;Balkans (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia)

[[Al Jazeera Balkans]] deployed Ushahidi crisis mapping platform on 5 February 2012 to track the snow/cold emergency in the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec2-46-51-135-144.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/AJB/Feb2012/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213110919/http://ec2-46-51-135-144.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/AJB/Feb2012/ |date=13 February 2012 }} Snjezna oluja nad Balkanom&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
'''Kenya Elections'''

Ushahidi helped run the Uchaguzi partnership to monitor the 2013 Kenyan elections. The deployment gathered over 8000 reports, a report "Uchaguzi: A Qualitative and Quantitive Analysis of ICTS, Statebuilding, and Peacebuilding in Kenya." showed that 75% of reporters said their report was responded to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu/publications/uchaguzi-a-qualitative-and-quantitative-analysis-of-icts-statebuilding-and-peacebuilding-in-kenya/|title=Uchaguzi: A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of ICTS, Statebuilding, and Peacebuilding in Kenya|website=CGCS Media Wire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
'''Kenya'''

Ushahidi announced Ping (now called Rollcall) in response to the attacks on Westgate Mall in Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://opensource.com/life/13/9/ushahidi-kenya-mall-siege|title = Software company Ushahidi uses open source skills to help during Kenya mall siege|date = 24 September 2013|accessdate = |website = opensource.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The software was used to map out all the blood drive center locations in Nairobi and let users quickly identify places to donate, see which blood types were in demand, and identify whether equipment or volunteers were needed at any locations. Among the goals of this map was to help ensure that when the Kenyan population came out to donate blood, they would know which donation centers needed their blood type the most.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== 2015 ===
Crowd sourced data were extensively used during the relief and rescue operations at Quakemap.org. Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), a volunteer organization, set up a platform to collect and manage data from crowd using Ushahidi. KLL further managed to conduct first level of verification as well, providing the Nepalese Army with the following details: location, number of affected people, number of death/injured, support requirements, level of urgency, and contact information.

The Nepalese army report said that "Crowd Sourcing is one of the common approaches to collect information from the public. Although it is not new in the context of disaster management, but during April Earthquake in Nepal, this approach was appropriately used in a matured way. The systematic process defined by Kathmandu Living Labs volunteers marked a path in utilization of crowd sourced data by implementing agency like Nepalese Army."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/opssankatmochan/english_part1.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724171126/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/opssankatmochan/english_part1.pdf|archive-date=2017-07-24|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Sexual harassment allegations ===
On July 9, 2017, allegations surfaced online of Ushahidi covering up a sexual harassment incident perpetrated by one of the members of their senior leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techmoran.com/kenyas-ushahidi-reportedly-covering-executives-accused-sexual-harassment/|title=Kenya's Ushahidi reportedly protecting its senior executive accused of sexual harassment - TechMoran|date=2017-07-09|work=TechMoran|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1026890/kenyas-ushahidi-is-investigating-sexual-harassment-claims-against-a-senior-employee/|title=Kenya’s vibrant tech sector has been hit with its first sexual harassment scandal|last=Dahir|first=Abdi Latif|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ushahidi released a statement the next day confirming they were aware of the allegations which were the subject of an ongoing internal inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/07/10/statement-from-ushahidi-board-on-alleged-sexual-harassment-claim|title=Statement from Ushahidi Board on alleged sexual harassment claim|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Ushahidi board member and co-founder Ory Okolloh, strongly condemned the laxity with which the board dealt with the issue on Jul 11 saying:

“More clarity on steps that have been taken so far and the relevant timelines should be shared and those found culpable either by their action or inaction should resign”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ookolloh/no-sacred-cows-ea835a78ab37|title=No Sacred Cows|last=Okolloh|first=Ory|date=2017-07-11|website=Ory Okolloh|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushahidi released a second statement on July 17, 2017 detailing the chronology of events showed that the incident occurred on January 19, 2017 and was reported to the board on May 4, 2017, and that on May 5th the accused was placed on temporary leave, given due process, and  an investigation was undertaken. After back and forth with both parties' lawyers, the board held an inquiry on July 3 and the accused was alerted of his firing 14 days later on July 17 the date of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/07/17/update-from-ushahidi-board-on-inquiry-into-alleged-sexual-harassment-complaint|title=Update from Ushahidi board on inquiry into alleged sexual harassment complaint|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela Kabari came out publicly on July 20 as the victim in a Medium post detailing a 6-month ordeal and called for the resignation of the entire Ushahidi board that consisted of [[David Kobia]], [[Erik Hersman]], [[Juliana Rotich]] and Jenny Stefanotti at the time. She identified Daudi Were, Ushahidi's Executive Director, as the accused. Her statement to the board when she reported the matter included an un-notarized transcript of the recording of the incident and claimed an earlier occurrence the previous year. In her post, she said she encountered 11 other victims some of whom were current employees of the organisation and that the board members were aware of Daudi's misconduct in separate incidents spanning 10 years, however, no others came forward. She castigated the board for lack of support, victim shaming, slander, delays and character attacks. Angela resigned on June 28 citing frustration due to “continual stalling and inaction from the board 55 days after my complaint.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AngieWan/dont-raise-your-voice-here-5910b821a2f0|title=Don’t raise your voice here.|last=Kabari|first=Angela|date=2017-07-20|website=Angela Kabari|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daudi Were was alerted of his dismissal on July 17th, formally dismissed on July 22, and Ushahidi released an apology to Angela for the harassment she experienced while working at Ushahidi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/07/22/ushahidi-board-dismisses-executive-director-daudi-were|title=Ushahidi Board dismisses Executive Director, Daudi Were|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/07/22/we-would-like-to-apologize-to-angela|title=We Would Like to Apologize to Angela|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushahidi staff and staff from Ushahidi related organizations, under the banner "Women in Tech Kenya", released a statement on Jul 24 that supported Angela's speaking out, condemned Daudi Were's conduct, applauded his dismissal, and supporting the board following due process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@womenintechke/the-road-ahead-in-building-the-kenyan-tech-ecosystem-perspectives-from-womenintechke-3c81df3943a4|title=The road ahead in building the Kenyan tech ecosystem: Perspectives from #WomenInTechKE|last=Kenya|first=Women in Tech|date=2017-07-24|website=Medium|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@GeoForceKe/hello-ladies-48a418f6050|title=Hello Ladies.|last=Namnyek|first=Jane|date=2017-07-25|website=Jane Namnyek|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@womenintechke/thank-you-for-reading-and-your-feedback-dcdfc44d47ac|title=Thank you for reading, and your feedback.|last=Kenya|first=Women in Tech|date=2017-07-25|website=Women in Tech Kenya|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ushahidi board did not resign and through a series of posts defended their conduct, saying that they followed due process in the pursuit of justice. In a statement released on July 28, Ushahidi said that due to the legal process, agreed upon by all parties, all communications had to go through the legal representation and called Ms. Kabari's claims that they did not care about her disingenuous for not understanding the neutral position the board undertook in the sexual harassment investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/07/28/information-for-ushahidi-funders-and-project-partners-regarding-the-recent-sexual-harassment-case|title=Information for Ushahidi funders and project partners regarding the recent sexual harassment case|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/08/08/observations-regarding-sexual-harassment-cases|title=Observations Regarding Sexual Harassment Cases|website=Ushahidi|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">'''Walumbe''' is a character in the Ganda [[creation myth]], [[The_legend_of_Kintu|The Legend of Kintu]]. He is the son of [[Ggulu]] and the brother of Nambi. His name is translated as "disease" or "death" and he is responsible for death on Earth according to Ganda mythology.

==The Legend==

In [[The_legend_of_Kintu|The Legend of Kintu]], after Kintu passes all of [[Ggulu]]'s tests, Ggulu gives him his daughter, Nambi, among other gifts to take back to Earth. He gives them multiple vegetable plants, a hen, and some millet. He warns them then to hurry back to Earth to avoid gaining the attention of Walumbe, Nambi's brother. He tells them not to come back for anything, but when Kintu forgets the hen's millet, he returns for it. After much deliberation, Kintu and Nambi allow Walumbe to stay with them on Earth for a time.

In tradition with Gandan culture, Walumbe, as a brother of the bride, claimed one of Kintu's children as his own. Kintu refuses Walumbe and continues to do so throughout the years. Frustrated, Walumbe, then begins to kill a single child every day. After conversing with [[Ggulu]], [[Kaikuzi]] is sent to aid Kintu in sending Walumbe back to heaven. Walumbe grapples with [[Kaikuzi]] and then retreats by digging and hiding within the ground. [[Kaikuzi]] soon tires of pursuing Warumbe and asks all of mankind to be silent for two days to lure Walumbe out. When Walumbe finally emerges, children cry out at the sight of him and he again retreats into the earth. Upon Kintu's dismissal, [[Kaikuzi]] then returns to [[Ggulu]] and explains the situation. Upon hearing of this, Ggulu allows Walumbe to remain on Earth.

Walumbe is therefore blamed as the reason for death on Earth.
