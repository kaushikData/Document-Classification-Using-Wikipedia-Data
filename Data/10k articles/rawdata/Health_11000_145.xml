[[File:Michael Marshall talks about the 1023 campaign at QED.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]] leads a homoeopathic overdose at [[QED (conference)|QED 2011]]]]
The '''10:23 Campaign''' is an awareness and protest campaign against [[homoeopathy]] organised by the [[Merseyside Skeptics Society]],&lt;ref name=1023.org.uk&gt;{{cite web|title=1023.org.uk|url=http://www.1023.org.uk/|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organisation, to oppose the sale of [[homoeopathic]] products in the United Kingdom.  The campaign has staged public "overdoses" of homoeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name="Overdose' protest against homoeopathy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Overdose' protest against homeopathy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8488286.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080153/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8488286.stm |archivedate=2 February 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8488946.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202075630/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8488946.stm |archivedate=2 February 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and name ==
In 2004, the Belgian skeptical organisation [[SKEPP]] made headlines when thirty skeptics at [[Ghent University]] performed a "mass suicide [[publicity stunt|stunt]]" with an overdose of homeopathically diluted [[snake poison]], [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] and [[arsenic]], in an attempt to publicly show that homeopathy does not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://skepp.be/nl/gezondheid/alternatieve-behandelingen/homeopathie/gif-slikken-om-homeopathie-te-ontmaskeren |title=Gif slikken om homeopathie te ontmaskeren |author=Hilde Pauwels |work=[[De Standaard]] |publisher=[[Corelio|VUMmedia]] |date=12 January 2004 |accessdate=25 August 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://skepp.be/nl/gezondheid/alternatieve-behandelingen/homeopathie/de-homeopathie-stunt De Homeopathie stunt]. Skepp.be, 1 March 2004 (overview of media articles)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bonneux |first=Luc |date=May–June 2004 |title=Belgium Skeptics Commit Mass Suicide |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/belgium_skeptics_commit_mass_suicide/ |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Belgian skeptics met with Merseyside Skeptics during a [[Skeptics in the Pub]] in 2010, the idea was adopted to hold an international event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/2010/09/skeptics-with-a-k-episode-031/ |title=Skeptics with a K: Episode #031 |last=Hall |first=Mike |last2=Marshall |first2=Marsh |authorlink2=Michael Marshall (skeptic) |last3=Harris |first3=Colin |series=Skeptics with a K |number=31 |type=podcast |publisher=[[Merseyside Skeptics Society]] |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}{{rp|at=14:27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign's name, 10:23, is a reference to [[Avogadro's number]], which is approximately 6.022 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.1023.org.uk/faq.php |title= 10:23 Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate= 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==
The campaign aims to raise awareness of implausible and unsubstantiated claims made by homoeopaths.&lt;ref name=1023.org.uk /&gt; It opposes [[High Street|high street]] retailers, such as [[Boots UK]], stocking homoeopathic remedies alongside mainstream medicines,&lt;ref name="Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest" /&gt; saying that "the support lent by Boots to this quack therapy contributes directly to its acceptance as a valid medical treatment by the British public, acceptance it does not warrant and support it does not deserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1023.org.uk/an-open-letter-to-alliance-boots.php |title=An Open Letter to Alliance Boots |author=Merseyside Skeptics Society|authorlink=Merseyside Skeptics Society |work=10:23 Campaign website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisers state that homoeopathy is "an unscientific and absurd pseudoscience",&lt;ref name="Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest" /&gt; and that, according to their statement, "There is nothing in it."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527455.800-homeopathy-overdosing-on-nothing.html?full=true#.UnRhavn0F8E&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1023.org.uk/the-1023-challenge.php |title=The 10:23 Challenge |author=Merseyside Skeptics Society|authorlink=Merseyside Skeptics Society |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They question the ethics of selling treatments to the public which have not been proven to be efficacious and are widely disregarded by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Margaret |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mass-overdose-staged-in-homeopathic-protest-1884019.html |title=Mass 'overdose' staged in homeopathic protest – Health News – Health &amp; Families |publisher=The Independent |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2010, members participated in a protest involving a mass overdose of homoeopathic products to demonstrate its inefficacy.&lt;ref name="Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Overdose' protest against homoeopathy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/news/Mass-overdose-Leicester-city-centre/article-1782650-detail/article.html |title=Mass "overdose" in Leicester city centre |publisher=[[Leicester Mercury]]|date=30 January 2010 | accessdate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many protesters stood outside branches of [[Boots UK]], other shops selling homoeopathic products, and other prominent public spaces and took 84 pills each of ''arsenicum album'', 20 times the recommended dose.&lt;ref name="Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest" /&gt;

A second overdose was organised for 5–6 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1023.org.uk/ |title=The 10:23 Challenge |author=Merseyside Skeptics Society|authorlink=Merseyside Skeptics Society |accessdate=5 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205215413/http://www.1023.org.uk/ |archivedate=5 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, the campaign received commitments of participation from 70 cities in 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1023.org.uk/the-1023-challenge.php |title=The 10:23 Challenge 2011|author=Merseyside Skeptics Society|authorlink=Merseyside Skeptics Society |accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1023.org.uk/the-1023-challenge.php |title=The 10:23 Challenge 2011 &amp;#124; The 10:23 Campaign &amp;#124; #ten23 |publisher=1023.org.uk |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, events took place in Manchester, as part of the [[QED (conference)|QED Conference]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qedcon.org/schedule/ |title=Event Schedule&amp;nbsp;:: QED&amp;nbsp;:: Question Explore Discover |publisher=North West Skeptical Events Ltd |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewelshboyo.co.uk/?p=194 |title=Consumers in Cardiff stage homeopathic 'overdose' |author=Morgan, Rhys | authorlink=Rhys Morgan |date=28 January 2011 | work=Skeptical | accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Belgian SKEPP and the Dutch organisations [[Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij]] and [[Stichting Skepsis]] also participated in the worldwide 10:23 Campaign. They carried out their tongue-in-cheek suicide attempt in Brussels and Amsterdam specifically to protest the recognition of homeopathic preparations by the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/hd360pk2 |title=Skepp pleegt collectief zelfmoord |author= |work=De Standaard |publisher=Corelio |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=25 August 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.wereldburgers.tv/2011/02/05/homeopathische-zelfmoordpoging/ Homeopathische zelfmoordpoging] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213721/http://www.wereldburgers.tv/2011/02/05/homeopathische-zelfmoordpoging/ |date=3 March 2016 }} wereldburgers.tv. 5 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Czech [[Český klub skeptiků Sisyfos|Sisyfos]] organization joined this happening when its members tried to publicly overdose themselves in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="tyden"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hympl |first1=Josef |title=Protestující se demonstrativně "předávkovali“ homeopatiky |journal=Tyden.cz |date=6 February 2011 |url=https://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/protestujici-se-demonstrativne-predavkovali-homeopatiky_193166.html |language=Czech |issn=1210-9940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cro"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kořínek |first1=Petr |title=Homeopatika neléčí |url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/regina/denik/_zprava/847286 |website=Český rozhlas Regina |publisher=Český rozhlas |language=Czech |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, at the Berkeley SkeptiCal conference, over 100 people participated in a mass overdose, taking ''caffea cruda'', which is intended to treat sleeplessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munger|first=Kel|title=Drugs, not bugs|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/drugs-not-bugs/content?oid=5825955&amp;fb_source=message|publisher=Sacramento News Review|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Mixing Homeopathic "Remedies" for 2011 San Francisco 10:23 "Overdose" ''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Bg-aSjNM4|publisher=10:23 campaign|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no reports of ill effects following any of the overdoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/no-ill-effects-after-public-homeopathic-overdose |title=No ill effects after public homeopathic overdose |publisher=Medical Observer |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==

Notable scientists and public figures have shown support for the 10:23 Campaign, including [[Phil Plait]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plait|first=Phil |authorlink=Phil Plait|title=Homeopathy and the 10:23 project|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/04/homeopathy-and-the-1023-project/#.UnUpKvn0F8F|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=Discover|date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi Educational Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/1188-worldwide-1023-campaign-on-homeopathy-feb-5.html |title=Worldwide 10:23 campaign on homeopathy: Feb. 5 |publisher=Randi.org |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Singh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Print Email Shortlink |url=http://simonsingh.net/media/online-videos/alternative-medicine/andy-lewis-and-simon-discuss-homeopathy-and-the-1023-campaign/ |title=Andy Lewis and Simon discuss Homeopathy and the 10:23 Campaign |publisher=Simonsingh.net |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Novella]],&lt;ref name="Randi issues a Challenge Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randi issues a Challenge|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/randi-issues-a-challenge/|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penn Jillette]],&lt;ref name="Penn Point : Massive Homeopathic Overdose Cures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Penn Point : Massive Homeopathic Overdose Cures|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ZbJRAyexM|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10:23 Event|url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/4934-the-10-23-event|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Randi]] invited advocates and retailers of [[homoeopathy]] to take the [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]] to prove that homoeopathy was efficacious to win a prize and has himself overdosed on homoeopathic sleeping pills as part of his stage show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|title=''James Randi Speaks Homeopathy Week 2010 ''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WyzM_TsIXc|publisher=[[JREF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|title=''James Randi Lecture @ Caltech – Homeopathy ''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jqP_1beVXQ|publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|authorlink=James Randi |title=''James Randi's Challenge to Homeopathy Manufacturers and Retail Pharmacies''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMukj31qw1U|publisher=[[JREF]]|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction and media coverage ==
The campaign gained international coverage in the press from ''[[The Australian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/good-week-for-sceptics/story-e6frg8y6-1226004002890|title=Good week for sceptics|publisher=The Australian |accessdate=11 April 2011|author=Adam Taor}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The [[Medical Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/no-ill-effects-after-public-homeopathic-overdose|title=No ill effects after public homeopathic overdose|publisher=The Medical Observer|accessdate=11 April 2011|author=Caroline Brettingham-Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]],&lt;ref name="Liverpool anti-homeopathy campaigners stage protest" /&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7028989/Boots-hit-by-mass-homeopathy-overdose.html |title=Boots hit by mass homeopathy 'overdose' |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Robbins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jan/29/homeopathy-10-23-overdose |title=Homeopathy: At 10:23 tomorrow we will prove there's nothing in it &amp;#124; Martin Robbins &amp;#124; Life and style |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Homeopathic Association]] dismissed the 10:23 Campaign as "grossly irresponsible", describing the public overdose as dangerous, and claimed that the participants had no understanding of how to select remedies appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhomeopathic.org/media-centre/news-press-release/the-british-homeopathic-association-dismisses-1023-campaign/ |title=The British Homeopathic Association dismisses 10:23 campaign |publisher=British Homeopathic |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne-based Dr Ken Harvey told ''Pharmacy News'' "the campaign would raise awareness of the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) transparency review and concerns over homeopathic products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/news/homeopathy--overdose-to-highlight-tga-transparenc |title=Homeopathy "overdose" to highlight TGA transparency|publisher=Pharmacy News |accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">The '''Luynes aqueduct''' is a former [[Gallo-Roman]] [[bridge]] [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] located in [[Luynes, Indre-et-Loire|Luynes]], [[France]].[[File:Luynes (France) Roman Aqueduct.jpg|thumb|right|Luynes Aqueduct]]

==Description==
The remains show a stack of five [[arch]]es and it is the most famous [[Roman Empire|Roman]] monument in the [[French Department|Department]] of [[Indre-et-Loire]], despite its modest dimensions. It is also one of the best preserved of the Northern aqueducts. It was classified a [[Monuments historiques|historical monument]] in 1862 and is owned by the town of [[Luynes, Indre-et-Loire|Luynes]].

It originally had a total length of {{convert|1825|m|ft}}, almost in a straight line, including {{convert|525|m|ft}} of raised causeway. Its underground portion, and in particular its final journey, passes the hamlet of Villeronde.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Laurencin, « L'aqueduc gallo-romain de Luynes et l'antique Maillacum », Revue archéologique du Centre, t. 6, 1967, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Dubois, Archéologie aérienne : Patrimoine de Touraine, Alan Sutton, 2003,  p91.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a portion of the aqueduct-bridge is now visible as it passes through the "Valley of the Arennes".&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Jeremy, ''Roman France'',  (2001) {{ISBN|0 7524 1915 3}}, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual channel for the water is masonry and not a lead or [[Terra cotta]] piping and has a slope of 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm to 2.9 m per kilometre. The maximum height of the arches of the aqueduct is 8.90 m.

==History==
The remains of the aqueduct-bridge are located 1.5 [[Kilometer|km]] northeast of the centre of Luynes, in Indre-et-Loire. It has a general orientation of north-northeast to south-southwest, taking water from the now dry [[Pie Noire]] (or Pinnoire),&lt;ref&gt;Michel Provost, Carte archéologique de la Gaule - L'Indre-et-Loire, Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, 1988,  p108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to have supplied water to ancient Luynes,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Laurencin, ''L'aqueduc gallo-romain de Luynes et l'antique Maillacum'', Revue archéologique du Centre, vol6  1967], p. 195-204.&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[Tours|Caesarodunum]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Provost, Carte archéologique de la Gaule - L'Indre-et-Loire, Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres,1988,  p109.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been conjectured, however, that the aqueduct was privately owned and serviced the complex of private [[Roman Villa|villas]] at [[Sainte-Roselle]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Dubois, ''Archéologie aérienne : Patrimoine de Touraine'', (Alan Sutton, 2003), p34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Dubois, ''Archéologie aérienne en Touraine'', Revue archéologique de Picardie, no spécial 17,1999, p.359-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
Its construction has not yet been dated with certainty; the construction style would indicate the 2nd or 3rd century, like the resort that it fed.

It remained in use until the 12th or 13th century and has been the subject of several repair campaigns, especially at the beginning of the 10th century, under [[Charles the Simple]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://structurae.info/ouvrages/aqueduc-de-luynes aqueduc-de-luynes].&lt;/ref&gt; which is why it has survived so well, even if number of stones of its collapsed batteries had to be recovered and used. This suggests that its use has changed throughout this period, despite the abandonment of the seaside resort of Sainte-Roselle.

'''Groupe Auchan SA''' ({{IPA-fr|oʃɑ̃}}) is a French international retail group and [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Croix, Nord|Croix]], France.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groupe-auchan.com/en/pied-de-page/contact/?no_cache=1 Contact] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430130335/http://www.groupe-auchan.com/en/pied-de-page/contact/?no_cache=1 |date=30 April 2016 }}." Auchan. Retrieved on 24 October 2012.

The company began when [[Gérard Mulliez]] opened his first self-service shop in [[Roubaix]] in the district of Hauts-Champs, the pronunciation of which is nearly identical to that of "Auchan".&lt;ref&gt;Cédric Citrain, "A Cap occitan, on fête les 50 ans d'Auchan", ''Midi Libre" (Bézier edition),19 January 2011, p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Auchan has branches in France, and internationally in China, Hungary, India, Iraq, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Spain, Ukraine and Vietnam.

Auchan had 639 [[hypermarket]]s and 2874 [[supermarket]]s around the world.

== Mulliez family ==
Auchan SA is controlled by the [[Mulliez family]], one of the wealthiest in France and in Europe. The Mulliez family has interests in a large number of companies.

==Slogan==
The slogan of the company was ''La Vie, La Vraie'', which translates into English as "Life, the real one".  The slogan was changed in 2007 to:  ''La vie Auchan, elle change la vie'' – "Auchan's lifestyle changes life (itself)".

===China===
Auchan opened its first store in Shanghai in 1999, and according to the Auchan (China) Investment Co. Ltd. official report in 2009, there are 114 stores opened nationwide in China. [[Suzhou]] Jinji Lake store that is located in [[Suzhou Industrial Park]] had nine million population during that [[fiscal year]] with over four hundred million turnover and became one of the biggest Auchan hypermarkets in the world. Suzhou store expanded in 2008 and is the biggest Auchan Hypermarket in China, the second biggest in the world.  Also, Auchan China led to open its online shopping website for the stores in Shanghai and Suzhou.

Auchan offers online shopping only in those two cities so far and is opening in Suzhou its first AuchanDrive store, based on its French model (click &amp; go) in May 2012. The AuchanDrive service allows customers to purchase groceries online for home delivery, these locations being examples of [[online supermarkets in China]].

Since 2017, a number of unmanned convenience stores, marketed as BingoBox, are being operated by Auchan in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are China's Staff-less Stores a Glimpse into the Future?|url=https://www.thatsmags.com/shenzhen/post/20384/are-china-s-staff-less-stores-a-glimpse-into-the-future|date=26 August 2017|author=Allison Bew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2017/08/15/new-retail-in-china-new-growth-engine-for-the-retail-industry.html|title=New Retail in China: a Growth Engine for the Retail Industry|date=15 August 2017|author=Moliang Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Auchan (branded as Aшан) has been active on the Russian market since 2002 and had over 100 hypermarkets in the country by December 2016. It's the company's third largest market, after France and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French hypermarket chain Auchan stepping up investment in Russia|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/auchan-russia-idUSL5N1E84DZ|work=Reuters|date=13 December 2016|ref=acrobata}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenues for the country reached $5 billion in 2014, ranking third behind the local retailers [[X5 Retail Group]] and [[Magnit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia sends food inspectors into Auchan stores|url=https://www.ft.com/content/78f95178-467d-11e5-b3b2-1672f710807b|accessdate=20 May 2017|work=Ft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was ranked first in a list of the largest foreign-owned companies by the Russian edition of Forbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 крупнейших иностранных компаний в России - 2016|url=http://www.forbes.ru/rating/50-krupneishikh-inostrannykh-kompanii-v-rossii-2016/2016|accessdate=20 May 2017|work=Forbes.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1993-1994. &lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20020608044353/http://www.auchan.com/pages/auchan1_113.html Etats-Unis]." Auchan. 25 May 2002. Retrieved on 13 January 2011. "Aujourd'hui, Auchan est la seule enseigne française d'hypermarchés encore implantée aux Etats- Unis."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first American Auchan (pronounced by Houstonians as “o-shawn”) store opened in western [[Houston]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Auchantoclose"&gt;"[http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/01/06/daily8.html Auchan to close Houston hypermarkets]."

The store was one of the first hypermarkets to open in the U.S,
after [[Walmart]] debuted [[Hypermart USA]] in 1987, a year prior to Auchan debuting in America. &lt;ref name="Foodtown"/&gt; David Kaplan of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said "it was fairly unusual and became something of a tourist attraction" when it had first opened, as it was big enough to house lots of small businesses in front, such as a travel agency, a jewelry store, a bank, and a food court containing a [[Taco Bell]], [[McDonald’s]], and [[Pizza Hut]]. It also featured a huge cheese selection, a huge beer and wine selection, featuring local breweries such as [[Celis White]], and a bakery, and like most hypermarkets operating in the U.S. in the late ’80s, as well as [[Aldi]],  Auchan also made customers use quarters to use the shopping carts, and in order to appeal to Houstonians, it had a huge seafood selection, as well as rodeo wear. &lt;ref name=Kaplanclosing&gt;Kaplan, David.

Retrieved on 13 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Auchan also opened a store in the Chicago suburb of [[Bridgeview, Illinois]], in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n5_v27/ai_6416073 | work=Discount Store News | title=Auchan chooses Chicago for its 2nd hypermarket | first=Laura | last=Liebeck | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only sold food, and it was not as large as the Houston store. In 1991 the store closed.&lt;ref name=Kaplanclosing/&gt; It was later bought by a local Chicago supermarket chain, [[Dominick's]], and converted into an [[Omni Superstore]] by 1991.

Auchan's second [[Greater Houston]] location opened in southeast Houston in September 2000, in a former [[Target Corporation|Target]] store, which Auchan heavily renovated (and partially built up on) prior to opening, the most obvious example being the entrances, designed to make it look huge, despite its past as a Target. &lt;ref name="Auchantoclose"/&gt; Kaplan said, "Auchan had solid business its first years, but with only two stores in the country, the company lacked buying power and economy-of-scale advantages."&lt;ref name=Kaplanclosing/&gt; In early January 2003 Auchan announced that both of its U.S. stores were making losses and were going to be closed; Auchan stated that it was instead going to concentrate its expansion in Asia and Europe, and on January 6, 2003, Auchan closed the two money-losing stores, ending all American operations after 15 years. &lt;ref name="Auchantoclose"/&gt; Auchan USA sold its first Houston location to Ho Enterprises. [[Lewis Food Town]] occupied about {{convert|110000|sqft|sqm}} of the space, with the rest of the space taken by other tenants, which makes the store a bit like a mini-mall today.&lt;ref name="Foodtown"/&gt; Kaplan said that by 2003, "the Houston market is saturated with huge discounters and large grocery stores."&lt;ref name=Kaplanclosing/&gt; In addition, many similar stores, including an [[H-E-B]] Food and Drug Store, the Hong Kong Supermarket, a [[Sam's Club]], and a [[Wal-Mart]] had opened in proximity to the west Houston Auchan. In Europe, zoning laws would prevent such a high concentration of similar stores. Kaplan further added that "In Europe, shopping malls are not as prevalent as they are in America, and Auchan's everything-under-one-roof concept has greater appeal" in Europe rather than in the United States.&lt;ref name=Kaplanclosing/&gt; The second former Auchan is now used by a local scaffolding company, and was used as a shelter for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims in 2005 and [[Hurricane Ike]] victims in 2008 due to its large space.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=weather/hurricane&amp;id=6407039&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawn ventures==
Auchan opened a number of stores in Mexico; the first of these opened in [[Mexico City]] in 1997 and eventually grew to five stores. Faced with stiff competition from [[Wal-Mart]], as well as local superstore chains [[Supermercados Gigante|Gigante]] and [[Comercial Mexicana]], and French rival [[Carrefour]] (who also sold their stores and left the country in March 2005), Auchan decided to sell their stores to [[Comercial Mexicana]] and withdrew from Mexico in early 2003, most of these stores were to [[Soriana]] in 2015.

In 1997 Auchan sold its hypermarkets in Thailand to [[Groupe Casino]].

In 2007 Auchan sold its Argentine stores to [[Wal-Mart]] and withdrew from the country.

Following a conflict with its Moroccan partner ONA, Auchan sold its 49% share in August 2007.

In January 2011 Auchan dropped out of the Dubai market after just two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auchan closes its hypermarkert in DragonMart |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/253128.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212224512/http://www.ameinfo.com/253128.html |archivedate=12 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20085">In [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG), also officially known as the [[Independent State of Papua New Guinea]], [[capital punishment]] (also called the ''[[death penalty]]'' or ''[[execution]]'') is a [[legal]] form of punishment. Despite its legality, capital punishment has not been imposed in PNG in over sixty years. The last known execution took place under the colonial administration of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty USA "Urgent Action: Papua New Guinea plans for executions" (4 June 2013) &lt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/uaa13513.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The last execution is understood to have been done by way of [[hanging]] and took place in the [[capital city]] of PNG, [[Port Moresby]], in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University "Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea" (23 January 2011) &lt;http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Papua+New+Guinea&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Within the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], all countries (albeit PNG) have either completely [[Death penalty#Abolitionism|abolished]] capital punishment or have refrained from imposing it for numerous [[decades]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International "Papua New Guinea - The state as killer?" (April 2004) &lt;https://archive.org/details/Asa340012004en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of capital punishment in PNG has fluctuated throughout history and has again become unsettled in recent years.

Since 1954, PNG appeared to have maintained a strong "long-standing [[moratorium (law)|de facto moratorium]]"&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Colville "UN human rights office regrets Papua New Guinea's decision to resume death penalty" (31 May 2013) &lt;http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45049#.VT8Cu87E-Iw&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later passed into law. The complete abolishment of capital punishment occurred in 1970 whilst PNG was still under the colonial administration of Australia. However, in 1973, PNG took the first step towards becoming independent and began the process of self governance. Two years later in 1975, Australia gave up its remaining powers over PNG, allowing the country to proceed to complete [[independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown "Papua New Guinea: History" (28 April 2015) &lt;http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/papua-new-guinea/history&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1991 the [[Government]] of PNG re-introduced capital punishment as an [[amendment]] to the PNG [[Criminal Code]] Act 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, section 299(2).&lt;/ref&gt; At this point its application was limited to cases of [[wilful murder]],&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair Dinnen Law and order in a weak state: Crime and politics in Papua New Guinea (University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 2001) &lt;http://file93.meetbooks.org/pdf/law-and-order-in-a-weak-state-crime-and-politics-in-papua-new-guinea_1go39r.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; but the imposition of the death penalty would not be [[mandate (criminal law)|mandatory]] and therefore be "at the discretion of the Judge."&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University "Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea" (23 January 2011) &lt;http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Papua+New+Guinea&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-introduction of capital punishment into [[legislation]] was greeted with a mixed response not only in PNG but throughout the world. The Government at the time justified its actions by arguing that it was aligning legislation to reflect public perception that there was a necessity to deter abhorrent behaviour. According to [[Bernard Narokobi]] (the [[Justice Minister]] at the time), "it reflected the community's outrage and disgust"&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown "Death Penalty Plan for PNG" The Canberra Times (Australia, 25 March 1991) at 16.&lt;/ref&gt; to heinous criminal offences. Despite his support for [[Papua New Guinean]] communities to express their views, Narokobi made it clear that he did not endorse the move towards the re-introduction of capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown "Death Penalty Plan for PNG" The Canberra Times (Australia, 25 March 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the country's [[Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Rabbie Namaliu]], argued that the alarming deterioration in the country's enforcement of [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] was a threat to the country's future and needed to be dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown "Death Penalty Plan for PNG" The Canberra Times (Australia, 25 March 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, there was also strong opposition for the re-introduction of capital punishment. [[Amnesty International]] pleaded that PNG addressed the deterioration of law and order in other ways and declared that Amnesty International "opposed the death penalty in all cases on the grounds that it is a violation of the human right to life."&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International "Papua New Guinea - The death penalty: Not the solution" (February 1996) at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Manfred Nowak]] undertook a comprehensive review of PNG's use of "torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Nowak "UN Special Rapporteur on Torture represents preliminary findings on his Mission to Papua New Guinea" (25 May 2010) &lt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10058&amp;LangID=E&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently recommended that PNG took immediate steps to abolish the death penalty. Following this, Nowak also suggested that PNG become party to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (the ICCPR) and ratify the second optional protocol,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Nowak "UN Special Rapporteur on Torture represents preliminary findings on his Mission to Papua New Guinea" (25 May 2010) &lt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10058&amp;LangID=E&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at abolishing the death penalty worldwide.

However, in May 2013 PNG took further steps to revive the use of capital punishment, simultaneously amending legislation to reflect harsher punishments for a variety of criminal offences.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Fox "PNG death penalty condemned as 'barbaric' by Amnesty International" (29 May 2013) &lt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-29/amnesty-international-slams-png-death-penalty-move/4719414&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the failed deterrence of criminal offences following the 1991 Criminal Code amendment, the government subsequently passed another amendment to the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 6) 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Under earlier versions of the PNG Criminal Code, offences of treason, piracy and attempted piracy were also punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, sections 37, 81, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 2013 amendment allowed that aggravated rape and robbery, alongside wilful murder would be punishable by death. Concurrently, the Government [[repealed]] the Sorcery Act 1971&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Sorcery Act 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore making sorcery-related murder also punishable by death. The Prime Minister (past and present) [[Peter O'Neill]] stated "the proposed laws are tough, but they are necessary. We have to address a situation which is destroying our country."&lt;ref&gt;Palash Ghosh "Papua New Guinea seeks to resume death penalty in wake of horrific crime spree, but activists object" International Business Times (USA, 2 May 2013) &lt;http://www.ibtimes.com/papua-new-guinea-seeks-resume-death-penalty-wake-horrific-crime-spree-activists-object-1233469&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments came into force on 18 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 6) 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent events==
Throughout 2014, PNG's actions indicated that it was moving closer towards reinitiating capital punishment since its re-introduction in 1991 and broadened scope in 2013. The Constitutional [[Law Reform Commission]] (Commission) discussed the death penalty in a [[public forum]] which was held in November 2014&lt;ref&gt;Cedric Pajole "Forum to discuss death penalty today" Papua New Guinea Loop (Papua New Guinea, 13 November 2014)&lt;http://www.pngloop.com/2014/11/13/forum-discuss-death-penalty-today/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; following the report given to the PNG Government on preferred execution methods.

On 5 February 2015 the Secretary of the [[Justice ministry|Department of Justice]] and [[Attorney General]] of PNG, Lawrence Kalinoe indicated that there are currently 13 people on [[death row]] in PNG. All of whom have exhausted their appeals and will likely be executed this year.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Buchanan "Papua New Guinea: Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Implantation of the Death Penalty" (11 February 2015) &lt;https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205404303_text&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinoe also confirmed that the PNG government had "approved an interagency committee to oversee the implementation of the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown "Church leaders condemn PNG government's decision to implement the death penalty" Papua New Guinea Today (Papua New Guinea, 5 February 2015) &lt;https://www.google.co.nz/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Church+leaders+condemn+PNG+government's+decision+to+implement+the+death+penalty&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=MrlAVfb_O6Lu8weA7IHQBA&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A new facility will be built at Bomana Prison in Port Moresby to accommodate the executions of the 13 people currently on death row.&lt;ref&gt;Johnny Blades "PNG's government adamant on death penalty implementation" Radio New Zealand News (New Zealand, 6 February 2015) &lt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/265458/png's-government-adamant-on-death-penalty-implementation&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==

===Charles Bougapa Ombusu===

On 20 February 1995 Charles Bougapa Ombusu was the first person to be sentenced to death after PNG's re-introduction of capital punishment in 1991, following his supposed "fatal shooting of the father of a girl he had raped"&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International "Papua New Guinea - The state as killer?" (April 2004) &lt;https://archive.org/details/Asa340012004en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Popondetta]], Northern Province. Ombusu was later [[acquitted]] in April 1995. The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] found that Ombusu had acted in self-defence. Critics of capital punishment have raised concerns that this form of punishment risks executing innocent people.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University "Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea" (23 January 2011) &lt;http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Papua+New+Guinea&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995 other death sentences have been handed down, but no executions have been carried out due to an absence of regulations surrounding the appropriate process.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Fox "PNG 'waiting for death penalty guidelines" Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Australia, 7 July 2009) &lt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-07/png-waiting-for-death-penalty-guidelines/1344918&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steven Loke Ume===

On 2 December 1995, the three [[appellant]]s were among a group of nine who abducted and brutally killed a woman. The trial judge deemed the facts of the case to accord with the worst kind of wilful murder and thus sentenced each of the appellants to death. The issue in the case on appeal was whether or not the trial judge had erred in reaching the conclusion of imposing the death sentence. The question was essentially whether or not there were "extenuating circumstances or mitigating factors which warranted lesser punishment"&lt;ref&gt;''Ume v The State'' [2006] SC 836 at [68].&lt;/ref&gt; than the death penalty. The PNG Supreme Court [[quashed]] the death sentences imposed on each appellant and concluded that without further guidance from legislation, "Parliament may wish to consider prescribing the types of aggravating circumstances in wilful murder cases which warrant the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;''Ume v The State'' [2006] SC 836 at [67].&lt;/ref&gt; Or further, clarify when "extenuating circumstances"&lt;ref&gt;''Ume v The State'' [2006] SC 836 at [21].&lt;/ref&gt; are relevant. Finally, the PNG Supreme Court concluded with situations in which the imposition of the death penalty would be more appropriate;&lt;ref&gt;''Ume v The State'' [2006] SC 836 at [67].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The killing of a child, a young or old person, or a person under some disability needing protection;
# The killing of a person in authority or responsibility in the community providing invaluable community service, whether for free or for fee who are killed in the course of carrying out their duties or for reasons to do with the performance of their duties e.g. policeman, correctional officer, government officer, school teacher, church worker, company director or manager:
# The killing of a leader in government or the community, for political reasons;
# The killing of person in the course of committing other crimes perpetrated on the victim or other persons such as rape, robbery or theft;
# The killing for hire;
# The killing of two or more persons in the single act or series of acts;
# For an offence committed by a prisoner in detention or custody serving sentence for another serious offence of violence; or
# The prisoner has prior conviction(s) for murder offences.
Applying this case, prosecutors are to determine whether the death penalty is the appropriate sentence in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

==Methods of execution==
The preferred method of capital punishment in PNG is hanging. Whilst precise statistics of all execution cases are unknown, it is known that "at least 67 people were executed by hanging" &lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International "Papua New Guinea - The state as killer?" (April 2004) &lt;https://archive.org/details/Asa340012004en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; under the colonial administration of Australia, [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Following the 2013 amendment of the Criminal Code, the government introduced capital punishment by way of [[lethal injection]], depravation of oxygen ("medical" [[asphyxiation]]),&lt;ref&gt;Rob Taylor "Papua New Guinea may review death penalty, Prime Minister says" Wall Street Journal (America, 10 March 2015) &lt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/papua-new-guinea-may-review-death-penalty-prime-minister-says-1425954144&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[firing squad]] and [[electrocution]]&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 6) 2013, section 614.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the pre-existing option of hanging. With the addition of four alternate methods of execution, the Commission was requested to report on the best method of execution and the most appropriate for PNG to utilise.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Tahana "PNG says executions will go ahead this year" (28 January 2014) &lt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/2583779/png-says-executions-will-go-ahead-this-year&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission travelled to countries with experience in capital punishment: [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]], [[Capital punishment in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Capital punishment in Thailand|Thailand]] and [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore]] "in order to provide advice to the government on what methods of execution should be adopted."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Buchanan "Papua New Guinea: Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Implantation of the Death Penalty" (11 February 2015) &lt;https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205404303_text&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the report by the Commission, the PNG [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] endorsed hanging, firing squad and lethal injection as appropriate execution methods. One of these three methods would likely be used if an offence punishable by death is committed and a sentence of capital punishment is imposed.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Buchanan "Papua New Guinea: Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Implantation of the Death Penalty" (11 February 2015) &lt;https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205404303_text&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
There are three situations in which a sentence of capital punishment may be adjusted or denied; individuals under 18 years of age at the time the offence was committed; pregnant women; and mentally ill persons.

===Under 18 years of age===

If a person under the age of 18 commits a criminal offence that is punishable by death, they will not be executed.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; PNG has [[ratified]] the ICCPR&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC),&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, article 37(a).&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are international instruments that prohibit the execution of a person under 18.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University "Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea" (23 January 2011) &lt;http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Papua+New+Guinea&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnant women===

If a pregnant woman is sentenced to capital punishment, she may request to have the execution stayed (delayed) until after the birth of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, section 599.&lt;/ref&gt; This is provided that it is sufficiently proven that she is in fact pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Papua New Guinea, Criminal Code Act 1974, sections 599(2) and 599(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mentally ill persons===

A person with the incapacity to understand or control their actions will not be liable for a criminal offence which they have committed. Secondly a person who commits an offence due to a delusion will only be "held liable insofar as the delusion would support criminal liability if it were true."&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University "Death Penalty Worldwide Papua New Guinea" (23 January 2011) at 3 &lt;http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Papua+New+Guinea&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
PNG is governed by a mixture of national and international laws and regulations.

===National===

PNG has two notable pieces of legislation concerning capital punishment. The Criminal Code Act 1974 and the [[Constitution]] of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (Constitution) are at the forefront of the law. Imposing capital punishment for wilful murder in PNG is prescribed in section 299(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1974 and is validated by the country's constitution. The ''right to life'' provision states "no person shall be deprived of his life intentionally except...in execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of an offence for which the penalty of death is prescribed by law”.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, section 35(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The provision concerning the ''freedom from inhuman treatment'' confirms that the killing of a person under section 35(1)(a) does not contravene section 36(1).&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, section 36(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, confirming that imposing a sentence of capital punishment is legal in PNG.

===International===

The ICCPR and the CRC are fundamental [[human rights]] documents both of which PNG is a party to. On 21 July 2008, PNG ratified the ICCPR. However PNG is not party to the [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] which is predominately aimed at abolishing the death penalty. In the same year, PNG abstained from the vote on the [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]] and went on to oppose a similar notion in 2011. PNG signed the CRC on 30 September 1990 and ratified it on 2 March 1993.

The '''cervix''' or '''cervix uteri''' (''{{lang-la|neck of the uterus}}'') is the lower part of the [[uterus]] in the [[human female reproductive system]]. The cervix is usually 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape, which changes during [[pregnancy]]. The narrow, central [[cervical canal]] runs along its entire length, connecting the [[uterine cavity]] and the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[vagina]]. The opening into the uterus is called the [[Internal orifice of the uterus|internal os]], and the opening into the vagina is called the [[external os]]. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], over 2,000 years ago.

The cervical canal is a passage through which [[sperm]] must travel to fertilize an [[egg cell]] after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including [[cervical cap]]s and [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|cervical diaphragm]]s, aim to block or prevent the passage of sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the [[Creighton model]] and [[Billings method]], due to its changes in consistency throughout the [[menstrual period]]. During vaginal [[childbirth]], the cervix must flatten and [[Cervical dilation|dilate]] to allow the [[fetus]] to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use the extent of the dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.

The cervical canal is lined with a single [[columnar epithelia|layer of column-shaped cells]], while the ectocervix is covered with [[stratified squamous|multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells]]. The two types of [[epithelium|epithelia]] meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, which can lead to [[cancer of the cervix]]. [[Exfoliative cervical cytology|Cervical cytology]] tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and [[HPV vaccines|HPV vaccination]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NCI2011/&gt; --&gt; HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.&lt;ref name=NCI2011&gt;{{cite web |title= Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines |url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/HPV-vaccine |website= National Cancer Institute |location= Bethesda, MD |date= 29 December 2011 |accessdate= 18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cervical canal varies greatly in length and width between women or over the course of a woman's life,&lt;ref name=KURMAN1994 /&gt; and it can measure 8&amp;nbsp;mm (0.3&amp;nbsp;inch) at its widest diameter in [[Menopause#Premenopause|premenopausal]] adults.&lt;ref name=Blaustein2002/&gt; It is wider in the middle and narrower at each end. The anterior and posterior walls of the canal each have a vertical fold, from which ridges run diagonally upwards and laterally. These are known as ''palmate folds'', due to their resemblance to a palm leaf. The anterior and posterior ridges are arranged in such a way that they interlock with each other and close the canal. They are often effaced after pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner69"/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous five sentences --&gt;

The ectocervix (also known as the vaginal portion of the cervix) has a convex, elliptical shape and projects into the cervix between the anterior and posterior [[vaginal fornix|vaginal fornices]]. On the rounded part of the ectocervix is a small, depressed [[external orifice of the uterus|external opening]], connecting the cervix with the vagina. The size and shape of the ectocervix and the external opening (external os) can vary according to age, hormonal state, and whether natural or normal [[childbirth]] has taken place. In women who have not had a vaginal delivery, the external opening is small and circular, and in women who have had a vaginal delivery, it is slit-like.&lt;ref name=Blaustein2002&gt;{{cite book|title=Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract |edition=5th |page=207 |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |veditors = Kurman RJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, the ectocervix is {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=KURMAN1994 /&gt;

After [[menstruation]] and directly under the influence of [[estrogen]], the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture.

=== Development ===

As a component of the female [[reproductive system]], the cervix is derived from the two [[paramesonephric duct]]s (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]].

Some methods of [[fertility awareness]], such as the [[Creighton Model FertilityCare System|Creighton model]] and the [[Billings ovulation method|Billings method]] involve estimating a woman's periods of fertility and infertility by observing physiological changes in her body.  Among these changes are several involving the quality of her cervical mucus: the sensation it causes at the vulva, its elasticity (''[[Spinnbarkeit]]''), its transparency, and the presence of [[Fern test|ferning]].&lt;ref name="Weschler"/&gt;

=== Cervical mucus ===

Several hundred glands in the endocervix produce 20–60&amp;nbsp;mg of cervical [[mucus]] a day, increasing to 600&amp;nbsp;mg around the time of ovulation. It is viscous as it contains large proteins known as [[mucin]]s. The viscosity and water content varies during the [[menstrual cycle]]; mucus is composed of around 93% water, reaching 98% at midcycle. These changes allow it to function either as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. It contains electrolytes such as calcium, sodium, and potassium; organic components such as glucose, amino acids, and soluble proteins; trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and selenium; free fatty acids; enzymes such as [[amylase]]; and [[prostaglandins]].&lt;ref name=CERVIX2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharif|first=Khaldoun|author2=Olufowobi, Olufemi |title=The Cervix|editor=Jordan, Joseph |editor2=Singer, Albert |editor3=Jones, Howard |editor4=Shafi, Mahmood |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA | date=2006|edition=2nd|pages=157–68 |chapter=The structure chemistry and physics of human cervical mucus|isbn=978-1-4051-3137-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites four previous sentences --&gt; Its consistency is determined by the influence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. At midcycle around the time of [[ovulation]]—a period of high estrogen levels— the mucus is thin and serous to allow sperm to enter the uterus, and is more alkaline and hence more hospitable to sperm.&lt;ref name=BRANNIGAN2008 /&gt; It is also higher in electrolytes, which results in the "ferning" pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern.&lt;ref name = Weschler/&gt; The mucus has stretchy character described as ''Spinnbarkeit'' most prominent around the time of ovulation.&lt;ref name="pmid15775876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson M, Karasz A, Friedland S | title = Are vaginal symptoms ever normal? a review of the literature | journal = MedGenMed | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 49 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15775876 | pmc = 1480553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[cervical mucus plug]], called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against the entry of pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during the first stage of childbirth or shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Becher|first=Naja|author2=Waldorf, Kristina Adams |author3=Hein, Merete |author4= Uldbjerg, Niels |title=The Cervical Mucus Plug: Structured Review of the Literature|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica |date=May 2009 |volume=88|issue=5|pages=502–13|doi=10.1080/00016340902852898}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Deitra |last=Leonard Lowdermilk |first2=Shannon E. |last2=Perry|title=Maternity Nursing|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=Edinburgh, United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-323-03366-4|page=394|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Childbirth ===
[[File:Positive Feedback- Childbirth (1).svg |thumb|upright=0.6|When the head of the fetus pushes against the cervix, a signal (2) is sent to the brain. This causes a signal to be sent to the [[pituitary gland]] to release oxytocin (4) . Oxytocin is carried in the bloodstream to the uterus causing contractions to induce childbirth.]]
The cervix plays a major role in [[childbirth]]. As the [[fetus]] descends within the uterus in preparation for birth, the [[Presentation (obstetrics)|presenting part]], usually [[cephalic presentation|the head]], rests on and is supported by the cervix.&lt;ref name=WILLIAMS2005/&gt; As labour progresses, the cervix becomes softer and shorter, begins to dilate, and rotates to face anteriorly.&lt;ref name=GOLDENBERG2008 /&gt; The support the cervix provides to the fetal head starts to give way when the uterus begins its [[Uterine contraction|contractions]]. During childbirth, the [[Cervical dilation|cervix must dilate]] to a diameter of more than {{convert|abbr=on|10|cm|in|1}} to accommodate the head of the fetus as it descends from the uterus to the vagina. In becoming wider, the cervix also becomes shorter, a phenomenon known as [[cervical effacement|effacement]].&lt;ref name=WILLIAMS2005 /&gt;

Along with other factors, midwives and doctors use the extent of cervical dilation to assist decision making during [[Stages of labor|childbirth]].&lt;ref name=NICE-labour&gt;&lt;NICE (2007).

=== Contraception ===

Several methods of [[contraception]] involve the cervix. [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|Cervical diaphragm]]s are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted by a woman prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against the walls of the vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing [[fertilisation]]. [[Cervical cap]]s are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with [[spermicide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=NSW|first=Family Planning|title=Contraception : healthy choices : a contraceptive clinic in a book|year=2009|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney, New South Wales|isbn=978-1-74223-136-5|pages=27–37|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trussell|first=James|title=Contraceptive failure in the United States|journal=Contraception|year=2011|volume=83|issue=5|pages=397–404|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.01.021|pmid=21477680|pmc=3638209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trussell|first=J|author2=Strickler, J |author3=Vaughan, B |title=Contraceptive efficacy of the diaphragm, the sponge and the cervical cap.|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|date=May–Jun 1993|volume=25|issue=3|pages=100–05, 135|pmid=8354373|doi=10.2307/2136156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most types of [[progestogen-only pill]]s are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal.&lt;ref name=FPA-POP&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Guide to the progesterone-one pill |url=http://www.fpa.org.uk/sites/default/files/progestogen-only-pill-your-guide.pdf |publisher=Family Planning Association (UK)|accessdate=9 November 2014 |pages=3–4 |isbn=978-1-908249-53-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name=FPA-POP/&gt; In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s, work mainly by preventing [[ovulation]].&lt;ref name=FPA-COC/&gt; They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.&lt;ref name=FPA-COC&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Guide to the combined pill |url=http://www.fpa.org.uk/sites/default/files/the-combined-pill-your-guide.pdf |publisher=Family Planning Association (UK) |accessdate=9 November 2014 |page=4 |date =January 2014 |isbn=978-1-908249-50-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.&lt;ref name=sherris&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sherris, Jacqueline |author2=Wittet, Scott |author3=Kleine, Amy |author4=Sellors, John |author5=Luciani, Silvana |author6=Sankaranarayanan, Rengaswamy |author7=Barone, Mark A. |title= Evidence-based, alternative cervical cancer screening approaches in low-resource settings |journal=Int Perspect Sex Reprod Health |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages= 147–54 |date= September 2009 |pmid= 19805020 |doi= 10.1363/ifpp.35.147.09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A result of [[dysplasia]] is usually further investigated, such as by taking a [[cone biopsy]], which may also remove the cancerous lesion.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2010B/&gt; [[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer.&lt;ref name=NEJM1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cannistra |first= Stephen A. |author2= Niloff, Jonathan M. |title= Cancer of the Uterine Cervix |journal= New England Journal of Medicine |date=1996 |volume= 334 |issue=16 |pages=1030–37 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199604183341606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms.

===Inflammation===
{{Main|Cervicitis}}
Inflammation of the cervix is referred to as [[cervicitis]]. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix.&lt;ref name=STAMM2013&gt;{{cite book |last=Stamm |first= Walter |title=The Practitioner's Handbook for the Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases |date=2013 |publisher= Seattle STD/HIV Prevention Training Center |pages= Chapter 7: Cervicitis |url= http://depts.washington.edu/handbook/syndromesFemale/ch7_cervicitis.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130622033953/http://depts.washington.edu/handbook/syndromesFemale/ch7_cervicitis.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-06-22  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the [[sexually transmitted infection]]s such as [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhoea]].&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2010 /&gt; As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic.&lt;ref name=Kenner2014&gt;{{cite book |last= Kenner |first= Carole |title= Comprehensive neonatal nursing care | publisher= Springer Publishing Company, LLC |place= New York |edition=5th |year= 2014 | isbn= 9780826109750}} Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes include overgrowth of the [[commensal flora]] of the vagina.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Robbins, Stanley L. |author4=Abbas, Abul K. |author5=Fausto, Nelson |title= Robbins basic pathology |publisher= Saunders/Elsevier |year=2007 |edition=8th | pages=716–21 |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the [[herpes simplex]] virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]], which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2010&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Anthony S. |editor-last= Fauci |displayeditors=etal |others= Editors of previous edition: T.

===Anatomical abnormalities===
[[Stenosis of uterine cervix|Cervical stenosis]] refers to an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or [[cervical cancer]] itself.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Valle |first=Rafael F. |author2= Sankpal, Rajendra |author3= Marlow, John L. |author4= Cohen, Leeber |title= Cervical Stenosis: A Challenging Clinical Entity |journal= Journal of Gynecologic Surgery |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=129–43 |doi= 10.1089/104240602762555939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diethylstilbestrol]], used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated with the development of cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: [[vaginal adenosis]], in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as [[clear cell adenocarcinoma]]s; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Casey |first= Petra M. |author2=Long, Margaret E. |author3= Marnach, Mary L. |title= Abnormal Cervical Appearance: What to Do, When to Worry? |journal= Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=147–51 |doi= 10.4065/mcp.2010.0512 |pmc= 3031439 |pmid= 21270291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the condition wherein, as the name suggests, the cervix of the [[uterus]] is shaped like a [[comb (anatomy)|cockscomb]]. About one third of women born to [[diethylstilbestrol]]-treated mothers (i.e. in-utero exposure) develop a cockscomb cervix.&lt;ref name="CaseyLong2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=Petra M.|last2=Long|first2=Margaret E.|last3=Marnach|first3=Mary L.|title=Abnormal Cervical Appearance: What to Do, When to Worry?|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|volume=86|issue=2|year=2011|pages=147–151|issn=0025-6196|doi=10.4065/mcp.2010.0512|pmid=21270291|pmc=3031439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlarged folds or ridges of cervical [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] (fibrous tissues) and [[epithelium]] constitute a cockscomb cervix.&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;{{cite web|title=Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Cervix|url=https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=7590|website=National Cancer Institute Visuals|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, cockscomb [[polyp]]s lining the cervix are usually considered or grouped into the same overarching description. It is in and of itself considered a [[benign]] abnormality; its presence, however is usually indicative of DES exposure, and as such women who experience these abnormalities should be aware of their increased risk of associated pathologies.&lt;ref name="Wingfield1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wingfield|first1=M|title=The daughters of stilboestrol.|journal=BMJ|volume=302|issue=6790|year=1991|pages=1414–1415|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6790.1414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittendorf1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mittendorf|first1=Robert|title=Teratogen update: Carcinogenesis and teratogenesis associated with exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero|journal=Teratology|volume=51|issue=6|year=1995|pages=435–445|issn=0040-3709|doi=10.1002/tera.1420510609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerbstPoskanzer1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Arthur L.|last2=Poskanzer|first2=David C.|last3=Robboy|first3=Stanley J.|last4=Friedlander|first4=Lawrence|last5=Scully|first5=Robert E.|title=Prenatal Exposure to Stilbestrol|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=292|issue=7|year=1975|pages=334–339|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJM197502132920704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cervical agenesis]] is a rare congenital condition in which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fujimoto |first=Victor Y. |author2= Miller, J.Heath |author3= Klein, Nancy A. |author4= Soules, Michael R. |title= Congenital cervical atresia: Report of seven cases and review of the literature |journal= American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=177 |issue=6 |pages=1419–25 |doi= 10.1016/S0002-9378(97)70085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and [[uterus]]. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as [[bicornuate uterus]] and [[uterine didelphys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Patton |first=PE |author2= Novy, MJ |author3=Lee, DM |author4= Hickok, LR |title=The diagnosis and reproductive outcome after surgical treatment of the complete septate uterus, duplicated cervix and vaginal septum |journal= American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=Jun 2004 |volume=190 |issue=6 |pages= 1669-75; discussion p.1675-78 |pmid= 15284765 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.02.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cervical polyp]]s, which are benign overgrowths of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth may be present in the cervical canal.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt; [[Cervical ectropion]] refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2010 /&gt;

==Other mammals==
Female marsupials have [[Marsupial female reproductive system|paired uteri and cervices]]. Most [[eutheria]]n (placental) mammal species have a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. [[Lagomorph]]s, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices.&lt;ref name=feldhamer&gt;{{cite book |last= Feldhamer |first= George A. |last2=Drickamer |first2=Lee C. |last3=Vessey |first3=Stephen H. |last4=Merritt |first4=Joseph F. |last5=Krajewski |first5=Carey |title= Mammalogy: Adaptation, Diversity, Ecology |publisher=JHU Press |location= Baltimore, MD |date=2007 |page=198 |isbn=9780801886959 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=udCnKce9hfoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=cervix&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous 3 sentences --&gt; Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade [[Glires]]. Anteaters of the family [[myrmecophagidae]] are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they are thought to have lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.&lt;ref name=novacek&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Novacek, Michael J. |author2=Wyss, André R. |title=Higher-level Relationships of the Recent Eutherian Orders: Morphological Evidence |journal= Cladistics |year= 1986 | volume=2 |issue=4 |pages= 257–87 |doi= 10.1111/j.1096-0031.1986.tb00463.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous 3 sentences --&gt; In [[domestic pig]]s, the cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads that hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livestocktrail.illinois.edu/swinerepronet/paperDisplay.cfm?ContentID=6274|title=The Female - Swine Reproduction|last=|first=|date=|website=livestocktrail.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''cervix'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜːr|v|ɪ|k|s}}) came to English from Latin, where it means "neck", and like its Germanic counterpart, it can refer not only to the [[neck]] [of the body] but also to an analogous narrowed part of an object. The cervix uteri (neck of the uterus) is thus the uterine cervix, but in English the word ''cervix'' used alone usually refers to it. Thus the adjective ''cervical'' may refer either to the neck (as in ''[[cervical vertebrae]]'' or ''[[cervical lymph nodes]]'') or to the uterine cervix (as in ''[[cervical cap]]'' or ''[[cervical cancer]]'').

Latin ''cervix'' came from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''ker-'', referring to a "structure that projects". Thus, the word cervix is linguistically related to the [[English language|English]] word "[[wikt:horn|horn]]", the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for "head" ({{lang-fa|سر}} ''sar''), the Greek word for "head" ({{lang-grc-gre|κορυφή}} ''koruphe''), and the Welsh word for "deer" ({{lang-cy|carw}}).&lt;ref name=ETYCERVIX2014&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first=Douglas |title= Cervix |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cervix&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work= Etymology Online |accessdate= 19 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first=Douglas |title=Horn |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=horn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work= Etymology Online |accessdate= 19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cervix was documented in anatomical literature in at least the time of [[Hippocrates]]; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 years ago, with descriptions provided by both [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aretaeus]].&lt;ref name=GASPARINI2009&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gasparini |first=R |author2= Panatto, D |title= Cervical cancer: from Hippocrates through Rigoni-Stern to zur Hausen. |journal=Vaccine |date= May 29, 2009|volume=27 Suppl 1|pages=A4–5 |pmid= 19480961 |doi= 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.11.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was some variation in [[word sense]] among early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Galen/Johnston |title=Galen: On Diseases and Symptoms |year=2011 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-46084-2 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attested use of the word to refer to the cervix of the uterus was in 1702.&lt;ref name= ETYCERVIX2014 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2885">&lt;!-- Do other mammals have this reflex? If so, say "in male mammals". The article is focused on humans, though. --&gt;
[[File:Cremasteric reflex.jpg|thumb|Area A (in orange) represents the area of sensory fibers controlled by the genitofemoral nerve; area B (in green) represents that controlled by the ilioinguinal nerve; arrow C (in red with blue outline) shows the direction and location where the skin must be stroked to elicit this reflex.]]
The '''cremasteric reflex''' is a superficial (i.e., close to the skin's surface) [[reflex]] observed in human males.

This reflex is elicited by lightly stroking or poking the superior and medial (inner) part of the thigh—regardless of the direction of stroke.&lt;ref name="titleDefinition: cremasteric reflex from Online Medical Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?cremasteric+reflex |title=Definition: cremasteric reflex from Online Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-06 |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal response is an immediate contraction of the [[cremaster muscle]] that pulls up the [[testis]] ipsilaterally (on the same side of the body).
The reflex utilizes sensory and motor fibers from two different nerves. When the inner thigh is stroked, sensory fibers of the [[ilioinguinal nerve]] are stimulated. These activate the [[axon|motor fibers]] of the [[genital branch]] of the genitofemoral nerve which causes the cremaster muscle to contract and elevate the testis.&lt;ref name= GRAYS2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|title=Gray's anatomy for students|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-443-06612-2|edition=Pbk.|author2=Vogl, Wayne |author3=Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell  |author4=illustrations by Richard |author5= Richardson, Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262}}

==Clinical conditions==
In boys, this reflex may be exaggerated which can occasionally lead to a misdiagnosis of [[cryptorchidism]].

The cremasteric reflex may be absent with [[testicular torsion]], upper and lower motor [[neuron]] disorders, as well as a spine injury of L1-L2. It can also occur if the ilioinguinal nerve has accidentally been cut during a [[hernia]] repair. 

The cremasteric reflex can be helpful in recognizing testicular emergencies.  The presence of the cremasteric reflex does not eliminate testicular torsion from a differential diagnosis, but it does broaden the possibilities to include [[epididymitis]] or [[acute scrotum|other causes]] of scrotal and testicular pain.  In any event, if testicular torsion cannot be definitively eliminated in an expeditious manner, a testicular [[Medical ultrasonography|Doppler ultrasound]] or exploratory surgical intervention is usually implemented to prevent possible loss of the testicle to [[necrosis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">Dr. '''Eugene Saenger''' (March 5, 1917 &amp;ndash; September 30, 2007)&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Thomas H. Maugh, [http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-saenger6oct06,1,4945570,print.story "Eugene Saenger, 90; pioneer in radiation research",''][[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] university professor and physician. A graduate of [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt; Saenger was a pioneer in [[radiation]] research and [[nuclear medicine]]. He taught at the [[University of Cincinnati]] for more than thirty years.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071004/NEWS01/710040398/1077/COL02 |title=Radiology guru Saenger dies
|accessdate=2007-10-04 |author=Peggy O'Farrell |date= |work= |publisher=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960 until 1971, Dr. Eugene Saenger, a radiologist at the University of Cincinnati, led an [[Cincinnati_Radiation_Experiments_(1960-1971)|experiment]] exposing 88 cancer patients, mostly poor and 60% of whom identified as Black, to whole body radiation, even though this sort of treatment had already been discredited by other researchers for the types of cancer these patients had. They were not told the Pentagon funded the study, however, according to the New York Times '...In the first five years, the researchers said, they obtained oral consent, and later various written consent forms.'  They were told they would be getting an experimental treatment that might help them. Patients were exposed, in the period of one hour, to the equivalent of about 20,000 x-rays worth of radiation. Nausea, vomiting, severe stomach pain, loss of appetite, and mental confusion were the results. A report in 1972 indicated that some of the patients died of radiation poisoning, but some of the deaths might have been due simply to the late-stage cancer they already had when experimented on. Dr. Saenger received a gold medal for “career achievements” from the Radiological Society of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DICKE|first1=WILLIAM|title=Eugene Saenger, Controversial Doctor, Dies at 90|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/us/11saenger.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the families of the patients sued Saenger, the University of Cincinnati, and the federal government. In 1999, the families won a $3.6 million settlement.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

'''Exercise addiction''' is a state characterized by a compulsive engagement in any form of physical exercise, despite negative consequences. While regular exercise is generally a healthy activity, exercise addiction generally involves performing excessive amounts of exercise to the detriment of physical health, spending too much time exercising to the detriment of personal and professional life, and exercising regardless of physical injury.&lt;ref name="Exercise addiction review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landolfi E | title = Exercise addiction | journal = Sports Med | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 111–9 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23329605 | doi = 10.1007/s40279-012-0013-x | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Demetrovics/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sussman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sussman S, Lisha N, Griffiths M |title=Prevalence of the addictions: a problem of the majority or the minority? |journal=Eval Health Prof |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=3–56 |date=March 2011 |pmid=20876085 |pmc=3134413 |doi=10.1177/0163278710380124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may also involve a state of [[substance dependence|dependence]] upon regular exercise which involves the occurrence of severe withdrawal symptoms when the individual is unable to exercise.&lt;ref name="Exercise addiction review" /&gt; Differentiating between addictive and healthy exercise behaviors is difficult but there are key factors in determining which category a person may fall into.&lt;ref name=Krivoschekov&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krivoshchekov SG, Lushnikov ON |title=[Psychophysiology of sports addiction (exercises addiction)] |language=Russian |journal=Fiziol Cheloveka |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=135–40 |year=2011 |pmid=21950095 |doi=10.1134/S0362119711030030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise addiction shows a high comorbidity with eating disorders.&lt;ref name=Demetrovics&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Demetrovics Z, Kurimay T |title=[Exercise addiction: a literature review] |language=Hungarian |journal=Psychiatr Hung |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=129–41 |year=2008 |pmid=18956613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise addiction is not listed as a disorder in the fourth revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV). This type of [[addiction]] can be classified under a [[behavioral addiction]] in which a person’s behavior becomes obsessive, compulsive, and/or causes dysfunction in a person's life.&lt;ref name=Villella&gt;{{MEDRS|date=November 2011}}&lt;!--this is a primary study, used incorrectly in this article--&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Villella C, Martinotti G, Di Nicola M |title=Behavioural addictions in adolescents and young adults: results from a prevalence study |journal=J Gambl Stud |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=203–14 |date=June 2011 |pmid=20559694 |doi=10.1007/s10899-010-9206-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next revision of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]) will include an addictions and related disorders section; [[gambling]] is the only non-substance addiction that is likely to be included.  Other non-substance addictions, such as exercise addiction, are being researched but their inclusion is undetermined.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Charles|title=Addiction and dependence in DSM-V|journal=Addiction|date=1 May 2011|volume=106|issue=5|pages=866–867|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03144.x|pmc=3812919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
A concrete classification of exercise addiction has proven to be difficult due to the lack of a specific and widely accepted diagnostic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Olwyn|title=Excessive Exercise: From Quantitative Categorisation to a Qualitative Continuum Approach|journal=Eur. Eating Disorders Rev.|year=2011|volume=19|pages=237–248|doi=10.1002/erv.970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most interpretations of addiction have traditionally been limited to drugs and alcohol, which makes it even more difficult to identify addictive tendencies in exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landolfi|first=Emilio|date=2012-12-21|title=Exercise Addiction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-012-0013-x|journal=Sports Medicine|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=111–119|doi=10.1007/s40279-012-0013-x|issn=0112-1642|pmid=23329605}}&lt;/ref&gt; While excessive exercise is the overarching theme with exercise addiction, the term also includes a variety of symptoms like withdrawal, "exercise buzz", and impaired physical function.&lt;ref name=Veale/&gt; Excessive exercise has been classified in different ways; sometimes as an [[addiction]] and sometimes as a more general [[compulsive behavior]]. Psychiatric case studies have shown that exaggerated exercise could lead to negligence of work and family life. With an addiction, individuals become "hooked" to the feeling of euphoria and pleasure that exercise provides. This pleasure keeps the individual from stopping and leads to excessive exercise. With a compulsion people often do not necessarily enjoy repeating certain tasks, as they may feel like performing it will fulfill a duty that is required of them.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt; There are many opinions on whether concrete diagnostic criteria should be created for this type of addiction. Some say preoccupation with exercise that causes significant impairment in a person's life, not due to another disorder, may be enough criteria to label this disorder.&lt;ref name=Veale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veale|title=Does primary exercise dependence really exist?|journal=The British Psychological Society|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say there is not enough information about exercise addiction to develop diagnostic criteria. {{As of|2007}}, the term "excessive exercise" continues to be used while the "exercise addiction" model continues to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elbourne|first=K.|author2=Chen, J.|title=The continuum model of obligatory exercise: A preliminary investigation|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|year=2007|volume=62|pages=73–80|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2004.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main types of disorders are associated with excessive exercise:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crchealth.com/find-a-treatment-center/texas-treatment-information/good-thing-compulsive-exercise-devastating-results/|title=Too Much of a Good Thing: Compulsive Exercise Can Have Devastating Results {{!}} CRC Health Group|website=www.crchealth.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Anorexia athletica]] (obligatory exercise) - When an individual feels compelled to exercise beyond the point of benefitting one's body. Individuals will participate in athletic activities regardless of pain, injury, illness, etc., and will try to arrange their lives in order to maximize workout time. 
# [[Exercise bulimia]] - When an individual has binge eating sessions that are followed by periods of high-intensity exercise. 
# [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] - When an individual is obsessed with parts of their body and perceive them to be different or odd.  These individuals will create highly regimented routines in order to improve their perception of the "flawed" body part.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Five indicators of exercise addiction are:&lt;ref name="Krivoschekov"/&gt;
# An increase in exercise that may be labeled as detrimental, or becomes harmful.
# A desire to experience [[euphoria]]; exercise may be increased as [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] of the euphoric state increases.
# Not participating in physical activity will cause [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]] in one's daily life.
# Severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms following exercise deprivation including [[anxiety]], restlessness, depression, guilt, tension, discomfort, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and headaches.
# Exercising through trauma and despite physical injuries.

Key differences between healthy and addictive levels of exercise include the presence of withdrawal symptoms when exercise is stopped as well as the addictive properties exercise may have leading to a dependence on exercise.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Olwyn |author2=Reilly, Jackie |author3=Kremer, John|title=Excessive exercise: From quantitative categorisation to a qualitative continuum approach|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|date=1 May 2011|volume=19|issue=3|pages=237–248|doi=10.1002/erv.970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who succumb to exercise addiction may experience overtraining, which is best defined as a “condition of poor adaptation to a chronic period of excessive stress caused by a physical exertion, resulting in the development of the syndrome, compromising the health and sports performance”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guimaraes Teixeria|first1=Thiago|last2=Terra|first2=Rodrigo|last3=Lourenco Dutra|first3=Patricia Maria|title=Chronic Effects of Exhausting Exercise and Overtraining on the Immune Response: Th1 and Th2 Profile|journal=Motricidade|date=2017|volume=13|issue=3|pages=69 - 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overtraining includes one or more of the following &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=David Jonathan|title=Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome, Part 2: Adrenal Function and Overtraining|journal=Athletic Therapy Today|date=2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=28 - 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Persistent muscle soreness
*Elevated resting heart rate
*Increased susceptibility to infections
*Increased incidence of injuries
*Insomnia
*Decreased appetite
*Weight loss
*Impaired performance
*Decreased motor coordination and force production

Exercise addiction may also lead to mood disturbances. Those who undergo rigorous training without adequate rest are more likely to experience depression, anger, fatigue and confusion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobar|first1=David A.|title=Trait Anxiety and Mood State Responses to Overtraining in Men and Women College Swimmers|journal=International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology|date=2012|volume=10|issue=2|pages=135 - 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, excessive training may cause exhaustion of the autonomic nervous system. Some symptoms include decreased total testosterone level, an imbalance between testosterone and cortisol, decreased sympathetic tone, and decreased exercise-induced lactate. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=David Jonathan|title=Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome, Part 2: Adrenal Function and Overtraining|journal=Athletic Therapy Today|date=2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=28 - 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemical balances can lead to premature osteoporosis, where the lack of testosterone accelerates bone loss, and elevated levels of cortisol alters calcium and bone metabolism by “increasing bone reabsorption and decreasing bone formation or intestinal absorption of calcium”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delimaris|first1=Ioannis|title=Potential Adverse Biological Effects of Excessive Exercise and Overtraining Among Healthy Individuals|journal=Acia Medicia Martiniana|date=2014|volume=14|issue=3|pages=5 - 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium undernutrition may eventually occur, accelerating premature osteoporosis.

== Mechanisms ==

{{As of|2016}}, the mechanisms involved in the development of an exercise addiction, associated with the transition from healthy committed exercise to compulsive exercise, are unknown.

== Assessment ==
Different assessment tools can be used to determine if an individual is addicted to exercise.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=Annabel |author2=Szabo, Attila |author3=Griffiths, Mark|title=The exercise addiction inventory: a new brief screening tool|journal=Addiction Research and Theory|volume=12|issue=5|pages=489–499|doi=10.1080/16066350310001637363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most tools used to determine risk for exercise addiction are modified tools that have been used for assessing other behavioral addictions. Tools for determining eating disorders can also show a high risk for exercise addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Olwyn|title=Execessive Exercise: From Quantitative Categorisation to a Qualitative Continuum Approach|journal=Eur. Eat. Disorders Rev|year=2011|volume=19|pages=237–248|doi=10.1002/erv.970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire was created by Thompson and Pasman in 1991, consisting of 20 questions on exercise habits and attitudes toward exercise and body image. Patients respond to statements on a scale of 1 (never) to 4 (always).&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite web|title=The Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire|url=http://jkthompson.myweb.usf.edu/oeqweb.htm|accessdate=22 November 2011|author=J.K. Thompson|author2=L. Pasman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This questionnaire aided in the development of another assessment tool, the Exercise Addiction Inventory.&lt;ref name="Terry"/&gt;

The Exercise Addiction Inventory was developed by Terry ''et al'' in 2004. This inventory was developed as a self-report to examine an individual's beliefs toward exercise. The inventory is made up of six statements in relation to the perception of exercise, concerning: the importance of exercise to the individual, relationship conflicts due to exercise, how mood changes with exercise, the amount of time spent exercising, the outcome of missing a workout, and the effects of decreasing physical activity. Individuals are asked to rate each statement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). If an individual scores above 24 they are said to be at-risk for exercise addiction.&lt;ref name="Terry"/&gt;

== Treatment ==
[[Behavioral addiction]] and [[substance abuse]] disorders are treated similarly; treatment options include [[exposure and response prevention]].  No medications have been approved for the treatment of behavioral addictions. Studies have shown promise in the use of [[glutamatergic]] altering drugs to treat addictions other than exercise.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant JE, Potenza MN, Weinstein A, Gorelick DA |title=Introduction to behavioral addictions |journal=Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=233–41 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20560821 |pmc=3164585 |doi=10.3109/00952990.2010.491884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise addictions comorbid in patients with an [[eating disorder]] may be treated through [[psychotherapy]] involving education, behavioral interventions, and a strengthened family support structure. In treating the eating disorder, obsessions and compulsions produced by obscured [[body image]] ideals will also be treated, this includes exercise addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Comer|first=Ronald J.|title=Abnormal psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1631-9|pages=363–65|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Most research has focused on adult population or on college students, but little is known about epidemiology of behavioral addictions in adolescence.&lt;ref name=Villella/&gt; A study conducted by Villella ''et al'' looked at a group of students and the prevalence of various addictions. His results showed exercise addiction was the second most prevalent, after [[compulsive buying]].&lt;ref name=Villella/&gt;
High risk groups that appear to be addicted to exercise include athletes in sports encouraging thinness or appearance standards, young and middle-age women, and young men.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Prognosis ==
Individuals with exercise addiction may put exercise above family and friends, work, injuries, and other social activities.&lt;ref name="Krivoschekov"/&gt; If not identified and treated, an exercise addiction may lead to a significant decline in one's health.&lt;ref name="Krivoschekov"/&gt;

== Comorbidity ==
An [[addiction]], by definition, includes repeated compulsive behaviors that negatively affect daily living.&lt;ref name=Sussman/&gt; There are two ways to classify addictive behaviors: [[substance addiction]] and [[process addiction]]. An exercise addiction is a type of process addiction, in which an individual's mood toward a certain event becomes dependent on addictive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Sussman"/&gt; Many educational, occupational, and social activities are stopped due to excessive exercising. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] may develop if exercise is neglected or may result from reoccurring physical injuries that limit exercise.&lt;ref name="Sussman"/&gt; Exercise addiction is often related to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] as exercise addicts may have obsessions or compulsions toward physical activity. Exercise addiction is also commonly associated with eating disorders as a secondary symptom of [[bulimia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt; Approximately 39-48% of people that have an eating disorder are also addicted to exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freimuth|first=Marilyn|last2=Moniz|first2=Sandy|last3=Kim|first3=Shari R.|date=2011-10-21|title=Clarifying Exercise Addiction: Differential Diagnosis, Co-occurring Disorders, and Phases of Addiction|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/8/10/4069|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|language=en|volume=8|issue=10|pages=4069–4081|doi=10.3390/ijerph8104069|pmc=3210598|pmid=22073029}}&lt;/ref&gt; When diagnosing bulimia, exercise addiction is referred to as a compensatory behavior and indicator of the underlying disorder. Research also shows exercise addiction influences not only the development of eating disorders but also their maintenance.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

== Animal models ==
As with many human [[diseases]] and [[disorder (medicine)|disorder]]s, [[animal models]] are sometimes used to study addiction.  For example, [[hamster wheel|voluntary wheel running]] by [[rodents]], viewed as a model of human voluntary [[exercise]], has been used to study [[withdrawal symptoms]], such as changes in [[blood pressure]], when wheel access is removed from [[Laboratory mouse|mice]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, E. M., S. A. Kelly, and [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|T. Garland, Jr.]] 2013. Mice from lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running exhibit lower blood pressure during withdrawal from wheel access. Physiology &amp; Behavior 112-113:49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3526">'''F-100''' and '''F-75''' (also known as '''Formula 100''' and '''Formula 75''') are [[therapeutic food|therapeutic]] [[milk]] products designed to treat severe [[malnutrition]]. In 1994, [[Action Against Hunger]] / [[Action Contre la Faim]] (ACF) pioneered the use of milk formula F-100 for the treatment of [[severe acute malnutrition]]. In 1997, a French medical researcher together with the French company Nutriset succeeded in making a nutrient-dense spread for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition. The formula is used in therapeutic feeding centres where children are hospitalized for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/chd/publications/referral_care/chap7/chap72.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131118225606/http://www.who.int/chd/publications/referral_care/chap7/chap72.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-18 |title=IMCI Referral Guide, chapter 7.2.7 Initial refeeding |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=2007-09-23 }} Link includes nutritional statistics and recipe instructions.&lt;/ref&gt; Action Against Hunger’s Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula (F-100), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat acute malnutrition. As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/malnutrition/FoodIsNotEnough.pdf Food is not Enough]&lt;/ref&gt; F-100 and other therapeutic nutritional products are widely used by a number of [[humanitarian aid]] organizations, such as [[Unicef]], [[Action Against Hunger]], [[Concern Worldwide]], Valid International, and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], when treating severe malnutrition among vulnerable populations.

F-75 is considered the "starter" formula, and F-100 the "catch-up" formula.&lt;ref name="Parthasarathy2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=A Parthasarathy|title=Partha's Fundamentals of Pediatrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1rm1NSmHdsC&amp;pg=PT73|date=30 April 2013|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5090-361-2|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designations mean that the product contains respectively 75 and 100 [[calorie|kcals]] per 100 ml. Both are very high in energy, fat, and protein, and provide a large amount of nutrients. Ingredients include concentrated milk powder, food oil (sometimes grease), and dextrin vitamin complexes. The formulas may be prepared by mixing with the local water supply.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Module on Feeding: Training Course on the management of severe malnutrition|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70449/7/WHO_NHD_02.4_Module4_eng.pdf|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[Plumpy'nut]] is substituted for F-100. F-75 may be cereal-based in place of milk.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;
F-75:full cream milk 30ml +sugar 2 tsp(10g) +MCT oil 1/2 tsp + water to make it 100ml.This provides 75 kcal and 1g protein.F -100 provides 100 kcal and 3 g protein
There are other variants like Low Lactose F-75 and Lactose Free F-75 which are used in case of persistent diarrhoea in severe acute malnutrition.

'''Family Carers Ireland''' began as '''The Carers Association''' in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ggfToS_SD3QC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=%22caring+for+carers%22+%22ireland%22&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caring+for+carers%22+%22ireland%22&amp;f=false|title=Care Work: The Quest for Security|first=International Labour|last=Office|date=30 September 2017|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=30 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first national carers association for lobbying government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Andrew |date=2010 |title=Landscapes of Care: Comparative Perspectives on Family Caregiving |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHcApr6jQEkC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=Carers+Association+Ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCGoVChMI0tLYspHLxwIVQaKACh2MAgt9#v=onepage&amp;q=Carers%20Association%20Ireland&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |page=138 |isbn=0754679500 |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing family [[carer]]s and advocate for carers rights in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The national census of 2006 shows that there are 160,917 people who stated that they are carers and almost 41,000 of these carers are providing 43 or more hours of care each week. The association estimates that carers  provide 194 million hours of care a year to the value of about 2.5 billion Euros to the economy. Approximately 33,000 full-time carers qualify for the Carers Allowance from the government. This Allowance is [[means test]]ed. The government has committed to developing a National Carers Strategy by the middle of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.activelink.ie/content/irish-links/carers/carers-association | title=Carers Association | publisher=Active Link | accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carers Association was the subject of a chapter-length study in ''Care Work: The Quest for Security''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Care Work: The Quest for Security|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|year=2001|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ggfToS_SD3QC|editor-last=Daly|editor-first=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Campbell Rose''' [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]] (1865 &amp;ndash; 18 July 1946) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[civil engineer]] who spent most of his career in [[India]].

Rose was born in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and educated at [[Trinity College, Glenalmond]] and the [[Royal Indian Engineering College]]. He joined the Indian Public Works Department in 1886 and was posted to the Irrigation Branch in the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], where he spent most of his career, becoming a leading authority on [[irrigation]]. In 1916 he was appointed Secretary of the Public Works Department, which carried with it membership of the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy's]] Legislative Council.

He retired from Indian service in 1919 to take up the post of chief engineer of river improvements in the [[Hebei|Chili]] Province of Northern [[China]], finally retiring in 1927.

Rose was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Star of India]] (CSI) in the 1920 New Year Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=4 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gingival sulcus''' is an area of [[potential space]] between a tooth and the surrounding [[gingiva|gingival tissue]] and is lined by [[sulcular epithelium]].  The depth of the sulcus (Latin for ''groove'') is bounded by two entities: [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apically]] by the [[gingival fibers]] of the [[connective tissue]] attachment and [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|coronally]] by the [[free gingival margin]]. A healthy sulcular depth is three millimeters or less, which is readily self-cleansable with a properly used [[toothbrush]] or the supplemental use of other oral hygiene aids.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Pathology==
{{Main|Gingival and periodontal pockets}}
When the sulcular depth is chronically in excess of three millimeters, regular home care may be insufficient to properly cleanse the full depth of the sulcus, allowing food debris and [[microbe]]s to accumulate, forming dental biofilm. This poses a danger to the [[Periodontal fiber|periodontal ligament (PDL)]] fibers that attach the gingiva to the tooth.  If accumulated microbes remain undisturbed in a sulcus for an extended period of time, they will penetrate and ultimately destroy the delicate soft tissue and periodontal attachment fibers.  If left untreated, this process may lead to a deepening of the sulcus, recession, destruction of the periodontium, including the bony tooth socket, tooth mobility, and tooth loss.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Nanci, Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Elsevier, 2007, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; A periodontal pocket is a dental term indicating the presence of an abnormally deepened gingival sulcus.

'''''Growing Up''''' is a [[sex education]] film for schools, 23 minutes in length, first shown in April 1971, which was made by [[Martin Cole (sexologist)|Dr Martin Cole]]. It is now available as part of ''The Joy of Sex Education'' DVD&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;BFI video (2 Feb 2009) ASIN: B001MGUAEW&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by one critic as "the most famous and controversial inclusion",&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;[http://www.moviemail-online.co.uk/scripts/reviews.pl?attribution=Alex%20Davidson Moviemail] Film Reviews By Alex Davidson&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as the "undoubted masterpiece of this double-DVD set".&lt;ref name=Bradshaw&gt;Peter Bradshaw [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/feb/11/sex-education-films "Sex education films: they don't make them like they used to",] ''The Guardian'' (film blog), 11 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its release it was said to be "the most explicit and frank film ever made for use in schools",&lt;ref name=DMirror710113&gt;"A sex-act film for children", ''Daily Mirror'' 13 January 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted condemnation by [[Mary Whitehouse]], [[Lord Longford]],&lt;ref name=DMirror710417&gt;"Peer slams school sex film", ''Daily Mirror'', 17 April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]]&lt;ref name=DMirror710422&gt;"That sex film gets 'X' certificate", ''Daily Mirror'', 22 April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] who all, excepting Thatcher, attended the first public screening.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Roger Lewin [https://books.google.com/books?id=s_mRNA9HJwgC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=%22Martin+Cole%22+biologist+sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N8vs_kRQ5e&amp;sig=d1Cbx3MtEI8UraazkiRdz0y2N48&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cF-4TLrBJoyOjAfou-WpDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Growing up too fast",] ''New Scientist and Science Journal'', 6 May 1971, p.301&lt;/ref&gt; Made two years before its earliest public showing, Cole though soon regretted a traditionalist description of gender roles in the film's opening commentary. The function of women was described as "giving birth to children", while it claimed men were "better at giving birth to ideas", a sequence which the Women's Liberation Movement objected to.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11691820/Martin-Cole-sexologist-obituary.html "Martin Cole, sexologist - obituary"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 22 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There was a version of the film shown to [[Aston University]] students earlier for feedback prior to the final version being released. It features scenes rather than drawings of naked people, which included intercourse and masturbation. Teachers and pupils gave it positive feedback, but the absence of a discussion of [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] (VD) was noted by sympathetic reviewers.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

The film triggered a national controversy;&lt;ref name=Limond&gt;Limond, David (2008) ''History of Education'' '''37''' (3) 409&amp;ndash;429 "‘I never imagined that the time would come’: Martin Cole, the Growing Up Controversy and the Limits of School Sex Education in 1970s England"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7892257.stm "The Joy of Sex Education"], BBC Magazine, 16 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;"Educationally speaking, it is a rotten film", Whitehouse said after viewing the film, "which makes children no more than animals."&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"&gt;Dominic Sandbrook ''State of Emergency, The Way We Were: Britain 1970-74'', London: Allen Lane, 2010, p.421-22&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Thatcher, then secretary of state for education who had sent an advisor to view the film, told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 21 April that she was "very perturbed" at the thought of the film being shown in schools and suggested local education authorities consider it "with extreme caution".&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"/&gt;

After insisting on a screening, the education authority in [[Birmingham]], where Cole lived, banned the film from being shown in the city's schools.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arnot [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/how-lack-of-orgasms-turned-to-lack-of-interest-remember-the-sex-therapist-whose-patients-were-treated-by-surrogate-lovers-chris-arnot-tracked-him-down-happily-practising-in-suburban-birmingham-1487642.html "How lack of orgasms turned to lack of interest",] ''The Independent'', 28 July 1993&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of the film being shown to school children anywhere by the end of 1971, although it was shown to students at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"/&gt;

'''Health care in [[Saudi Arabia]]''' can be classified as a national [[health care]] system in which the government provides health care services through a number of government agencies. In the meantime, there is a growing role and increased participation from the private sector in the provision of health care services.

==Ministry of Health==
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is the major government agency entrusted with the provision of [[preventive care|preventive]], [[curative care|curative]] and [[Physical therapy|rehabilitative]] health care for the Kingdom’s population. The Ministry provides primary health care (PHC) services through a network of [[health care center]]s (comprising 1,925 centers)&lt;ref name=MOH&gt;[http://www.moh.gov.sa/statistics/S1427/Chapter%201.pdf Health Indicators, 2006]. Ministry of Health, Department of Statistics,&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the kingdom. It also adopts the referral system which provides curative care for all members of society from the level of general practitioners at health centers to advanced technology specialist curative services through a broad base of general and specialist hospitals (220 hospitals).&lt;ref name=MOH/&gt; The MOH is considered the lead Government agency responsible for the management, planning, financing and regulating of the health care sector. The MOH also undertakes the overall supervision and follow-up of health care related activities carried out by the private sector. Therefore, the MOH can be viewed as a national health service (NHS) for the entire population.

There are also three other mini-NHS which finance and deliver primary, secondary and tertiary care to specific enrolled security and armed forces populations: the Ministry of Defense and Aviation (MODA), the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG). In addition to these agencies, there are several autonomous government agencies which are responsible for the delivery and financing of health care services in the KSA. The Ministry of Education provides immediate primary health care to students. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs operates institutions for the mentally ill and custodial homes for orphans. These facilities provide their guests a certain amount of medical care.  The General Organization for Social Insurance and General Presidency of Youth Welfare provide health services for certain categories of the population in connection with its management of sport facilities. The Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu provides health facilities for employees and residents at the two industrial cities (Jubail and Yanbu). The Saudi Arabian Airlines operates its own health care facilities with the aim of providing health care services to its employees. The Kingdom’s universities provide, through their medical colleges or hospitals, specialist curative services and medical education and training programs, while they also conduct health research in collaboration with other research centers.
 
The Government also finances and provides care on a referral basis in its major specialized national tertiary care referral hospitals King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital. The King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center uses highly advanced technologies and act as a reference hospital for cases that require advanced and specialist treatment, while it also conducts research on health issues in general and those related to the Kingdom in particular. The King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital is designed to be a large health facility offering high quality specialized services for ophthalmology and eye surgery and medicine as well as being a regional research center in the area of ophthalmology. The hospital also has a cornea bank in which imported corneas are stored.

The ministry maintains the Saudi Health Office in London.

===Budget===
Budget allocated to the health sector by the Ministry of Health was in:
*1956: 39,549,458 [[Saudi riyal|SR]]
*1958: 68,480,000 SR
*1960: 116,395,000 SR
*2009: 40.43 billion SR
*2010: 61.2 billion SR
*2011: 68.7 billion SR&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yahind.com/saudi-budget-for-2011-helps-attain-robust-healthcare-system_24325.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Red Crescent Society===
The Saudi Red Crescent Society undertakes an important and effective role in providing emergency services at the pre-hospital stage, either at the scene of accidents or during the transportation of patients to hospitals. The society also undertakes a unique task by providing such services for pilgrims during Hajj and Umrah at the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina.

===[[Electronic health record]]s===

In 2010, [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] Health Affairs was recognized with the Arab Health Award for "Excellence in Electronic Health Records".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia Health Care System Receives Coveted "Excellence in Electronic Health Records" Award with QuadraMed's EHR solution|url=http://www.quadramed.com/news/pr_detail.cfm?pr_id=474|website=QuadraMed|publisher=QuadraMed Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520155914/http://quadramed.com/news/pr_detail.cfm?pr_id=474|archive-date=20 May 2011|location=Reston, Virginia|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private sector===
Moreover, the private sector provides health services through its health facilities including hospitals, dispensaries, laboratories, pharmacies and physiotherapy centers throughout the kingdom. The following are the major indicators provided by the private sector by the end of the year 2000:
* 100 hospitals with 8,485 beds, accounting for about 19 percent of the total number of hospitals beds in the kingdom.
* 622 dispensaries, 785 clinics, 45 medical laboratories and 11 physiotherapy centers.
* 273 pharmaceutical stores and 3,209 pharmacies.
* Increased investments in manufacturing of drugs and medical supplies of medical appliances, and pharmaceuticals, in addition to the operation of some governmental hospitals and maintenance and cleaning in all health facilities.
* Increased contribution of the private sector in the provision of health care services, where out-patient visits to its facilities increased from 12.1 percent of total out-patient visits in 1994 to 16.1 percent in 1998. In addition, in-patients in the Kingdom’s private hospitals as a percentage of total in-patients rose from 16.6 percent in 1994 to 27.1 percent in 1998.

==Benefits==
Saudis and public sector expats are eligible for a comprehensive package of benefits including, public health, preventive, diagnostic, and curative services and pharmaceuticals with few exclusions and no cost sharing. Most services including state of the art cardio-vascular procedures, organ transplants, and cancer treatments (including bone marrow transplants) are covered. Sponsors/employers are responsible for paying for an extensive package of services for private sector expatriates.

The health sector during the past two decades, like all other sectors shared a great deal of support and attention to improve their level worker's performance in its facilities on the basis of quality assurance. In 1983, before the application of primary health care, health services were in the form of "e-medical" services in hospitals and clinics. Prevention programs also involved through limited health care centers offices and Maternal and Child Health (MCH) centers.

==History==
Government prioritization of [[preventive healthcare]] and environmental health began in 1925 following the establishment a public health department. The decision to create it came after a royal decree from King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]]. By 1926, the first school of nursing was opened, followed by the school of health and emergencies in 1927.

Health services expanded in 1951 with the establishment of the Ministry of Health. A ministerial ordinance in 1980 led to a conglomeration of the administration of the existing dispensaries, health centers, health offices and maternal and child health (MCH) centers into one unit. By the end of the 1980s, there were 253 hospitals, 38,955 hospital beds and 1,640 primary health centers. The proportion of positions filled by Saudi nationals was low, with Saudi nationals representing 13% doctors (22,633 doctors), 11.2% nurses (45,840 nurses) and 38% health technicians (25,192 health technicians).
In 1993, the total number of hospitals was 281, 41,789 hospital beds and 1,707 primary health centers and the positions filled by Saudi nationals increased to 22.7% doctors, 24.5% nursing staff and 41.8% health technicians.

In the end of the 2000, the major indicators provided by the private sector were:
*87 hospitals with 8,485 beds.
*273 pharmaceutical stores and 3,208 pharmacies.
*622 dispensaries, 785 clinics, 45 medical laboratories and 11 physiotherapy centers

In 2002, the Saudi health system was established by a Royal decree to insure the provision of comprehensive and integrate health care to all population in Saudi Arabia in a fair minded, organized and affordable manner. In 2004, there were 1,848 primary health care centers and the total number of hospitals was 200. The Ministry of Health (MOH) budget increased from 2.8% of the total National budget in 1970 to 6.4% in 2004. In 2006, there were 20.4 doctors and 35.4 nurses per 10,000 population. In 2008, health care centers were 1925 centers throughout the kingdom and 220 hospitals which adopted the referral system which provided curative care for all members of society from the level of general practitioners at health care centers to antecedent technology specialist curative services through a broad base of general and specialist hospitals.

===Government Hospitals in Riyadh (public hospitals)===

*King Khaled Eye Specialist - It is one of the leading hospitals in the field of ophthalmology for the citizens of Saudi Arabia.
*[[King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center]] - Founded in 1975, and specialized in incurable diseases, which can not be treated in other centers and the hospital has a section of x-rays contains all types of diagnostic radiology such as MRI, CT scan.

*King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) in Riyadh city is one of the newest medical cities in Saudi Arabia.

===Introduction of health insurance===
In 2005, health insurance was made compulsory for all non-Saudi nationals working in the country under the Cooperative Health Insurance Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20051025034746/SecIndustries/pagFinancial%20Services/lok034700051025&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cchi.gov.sa/sites/en/Pages/Cooperative_Act.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this act was extended to include Saudi nationals working for the private sector. Enforcements of this compulsory coverage include fines for non-compliant companies and a refusal to renew working permits without insurance.

'''International Women's Year''' ('''IWY''') was the name given to 1975 by the [[United Nations]]. Since that year March 8 has been celebrated as [[International Women's Day]], and the '''United Nations Decade for Women''', from 1976 to 1985, was also established.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2010/history.shtml International Women's Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt;

==History==
After years of work by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women, in 1965, CSW began working in earnest to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates drafted the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (DEDAW), which was passed by the General Assembly on 7 November 1967.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=891-892}} Once support had been garnered for the declaration, the next step was to prepare it to become a [[Treaty|Convention]]. Though there were delays, by 1972, when the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Title IX]], eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding, hope that passage could be secured surged.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}} In the meantime, members of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] (WIDF) had long been pressing for an international women's year and conference to address women's inequality. As WIDF was designated as an observer and not a member of the CSW, they could not propose the event directly, but drafted a proposal. Persuading the [[Romania]]n delegate of CSW to present their proposal, it was seconded by Finland. In turn, CSW approved the proposal and submitted it to the General Assembly, which proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year in December 1972.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=201}} The date was significant because it would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=123}} But there were problems with the conference. Initially Soviet women rejected the call for a conference and [[filibuster]]ed the negotiations, preferring to host their own conference in [[East Berlin]] that would not be subject to the UN structure.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}}{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} As part of the [[Cold War]] politics, the United States then proposed that the conference not be limited to women, but should be gender neutral, because an all-woman conference would not be taken seriously.{{sfn|Teltsch|1974|p=43}} Finally, [[Mexico City]] agreed to host the conference, and CSW set about the tasks to prepare the "machinery" necessary to secure passage of CEDAW.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} [[Helvi Sipilä]], was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events for the year.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}}

==International==
===Mexico City===
The first [[World Conference on Women, 1975|UN World Conference on Women]] was held in [[Mexico City]] from 19 June to 2 July.&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt; The 1975 conference led to the adoption of the [[World Plan of Action]], as well as the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]].{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} It led to the establishment of monitoring mechanisms such as, [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW) and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) and set in motion plans for follow-up conferences, the first of which would be held in 1980 in [[Copenhagen]]. It established the period of 1975 to 1985 as the [[United Nations Decade for Women|UN Decade for Women]], to enable progress and failures to be evaluated and resulted in urging that the [[CEDAW|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] be quickly ratified.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}}{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=155}} The 1985 third conference in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], not only closed the decade of women, but set a series of member state schedules for removal of legislated gender discrimination in national laws by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=dowie&gt;Allison Dowie, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456 Dangers on the Road to Complete Emancipation], ''Glasgow Herald'', 22 October 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvonne S.

===East Berlin===
The World Congress of Women was held in East Berlin as a part of IWY soon after the Mexico City event. It idealized women’s equality as the "true embodiment of the socialist conception of human rights".{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=68-69}} The Working Group on Equal Rights, composed of experts on government and law from the [[East German Academy of Sciences]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] and [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist United Party Central Committee]] rejected the notion that women's rights should fall under a separate area designated by gender, but instead should be governed by the United Nations Human Right's position.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=79}} [[Angela Davis]] was one of the key guests at the conference, as was [[Hortensia Bussi de Allende]], former [[First Lady of Chile]].{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=81}} The state-sponsored program advocated women's solidarity in the national struggles to free women from oppression based on class, race and gender through state socialism.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=83-85}}

===Brussels===
The [[International Tribunal on the Crimes Against Women]] was planned as an event for IWY but was not held until 4 to 8 March 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. Limited by funding strictures, the conference hosted 2000 women from forty countries. Speakers addressed economic exploitation and violence against women in its many forms. The most significant development to come out of the conference was the [[International Feminist Network]].{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=214}}

==Zionism controversy==
The 1975 conference was also notable for passing the first "Zionism is racism" resolution passed at any UN-sponsored forum, thus preparing the way for [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] in 1975 the following November.&lt;ref&gt;Text of resolution 3379:

:''TAKING NOTE of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that "international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, Zionism, apartheid and racial discrimina as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination".''; {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206052903/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |archivedate=2012-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/exhibits/jsp/general.jsp?&amp;imgfile=exhibits%2Fimages%2Fexhban7.gif&amp;media_id=abamexic&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement equating Zionism with racism was also included in an annex to a report to be considered at the final conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Sam Roberts, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/bernice-tannenbaum-who-fought-un-resolution-on-zionism-dies-at-101.html?_r=0 "Bernice Tannenbaum, Who Fought U.N. Resolution on Zionism, Dies at 101"], 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in ''It Takes a Dream: The Story of Hadassah'' (1997), by Marlin Levin, "[[Bernice Tannenbaum|Bernice]] asked [President Ronald] Reagan to publicly repudiate the U.N. resolution. He agreed and promised that the U.S. delegation would walk out of Nairobi if the Zionism-equals-racism resolution was included in the final conference declaration."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Tannenbaum also convinced the United States Senate to condemn the conference resolution and demand its withdrawal.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; She also personally flew to Kenya with a draft of the Senate resolution, where [[Maureen Reagan]], President Reagan's daughter and the head of the American delegation, repeated the president’s promise to withdraw from the conference if the resolution was included in the final conference delegation.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Kenya then brokered a compromise in which Zionism was omitted from the final conference report.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==National==
===Australia===
A conference on 'Women and Politics' was held in September,&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"/&gt; attended by 700 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/occa_lect/transcripts/290906/index.htm | author = [[Marian Sawer]] | title = Red, White and Blue, What Do They Mean to You? The Significance of Political Colours |date= 29 September 2006 | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The events of IWY in Canada as a whole raised awareness with Canadian women as well as the general public on a wide range of women’s issues and accomplishments. It spurred creation of the Ontario Women and the Law Association and the Service, Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC) and offered funding for many to participate in educational and artistic endeavors aimed at presenting women’s perspectives. One such effort was a petition to the [[National Film Board of Canada]] which led to the creation of Studio D. The [[University of Guelph]] hosted a conference in September dedicated to [[Nellie McClung]] and the reform issues which had been important to her.{{sfn|Pierson|Cohen|1993|p=362}}

===New Zealand===
In June a United Women's Convention was held in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |title=Forum 1975 |accessdate=15 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170942/http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Events in support of IWY were held throughout the United States by private organizations and NGOs, such as those held in [[Connecticut]], 11–12 June 1977 and the ''[[Greater Cleveland]] Congress'', October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.lib.uconn.edu/online/research/speclib/ASC/findaids/IWY/MSS19860003.html | title = International Women's Year Conference Records | work = Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, [[University of Connecticut]] | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=IWYGCC | title = INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR, GREATER CLEVELAND CONGRESS | work = [[Case Western Reserve University]] | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant US events, because it was funded by the US government, was held in [[Houston, Texas]] and though planned as an IWY event, did not take place until 1977. The [[1977 National Women's Conference]] included women from each state in the United States and developed a National Plan of Action, mirroring many of the points of the World Plan of Action.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}}

== Outcomes ==
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3520|Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace}}
As a result of the international focus on Women in 1975, a number of institutions were established:
* [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW)
* [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM)
* [[Women's Studies Resource Centre]] was established in [[South Australia]] during July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=677 | title = Women's Movement page 6 | work = ''[[South Australia|SM]] Memory'', [[State Library of South Australia]] | accessdate =15 July  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
The IWY also launched the "dove" emblem used by the IWY, CEDAW, and UNIFIL.  A stylized dove intersected by a female symbol and an equal sign, the emblem was donated by then 27-year-old New York City advertising company graphic designer Valerie Pettis. It remains the official symbol of [[UN Women]]&lt;ref&gt;[tools.unifem.org/unifem_logos/UNIFEM-GraphicStandards.pdf Graphic Standards]. UNIFEM Headquarters, United Nations Secretariat document, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in [[International Women's Day]] celebrations to this day.&lt;ref name=dowie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456&amp;dq=valerie+pettis&amp;hl=en Dangers on the road to complete emancipation].

'''Joe Kieyoomia''' (November 21, 1919 – February 17, 1997) was a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] soldier in [[New Mexico]]'s [[200th Coast Artillery (AA) Regiment|200th Coast Artillery]] unit who was captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Military history of the Philippines during World War II|fall of the Philippines]] in 1942 during [[World War II]]. Kieyoomia was a [[POW]] in [[Nagasaki]] at the time of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]] but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.&lt;ref name="paths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/navcode.htm|title=How Effective Was Navajo Code? One Former Captive Knows|publisher=News from Indian Country|date= August 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese tried unsuccessfully to have him decode messages in the "[[Navajo Code Talker|Navajo Code]]" used by the [[United States Marine Corps]], but although Kieyoomia understood [[Navajo language|Navajo]], the messages sounded like nonsense to him because even though the code was based on the Navajo language, it was decipherable only by individuals specifically trained in its usage.&lt;ref name="paths" /&gt;

Kieyoomia is notable for having not only survived the [[Bataan death march]] and related internment and torture in a [[concentration camp]], but also being a ''[[hibakusha]]'' (survivor of an [[atomic bomb]] blast).

==The capture of the Philippine Islands==
The surrender of Bataan would hasten the fall of [[Corregidor Island|Corregidor]], a month later. Without this stand, however, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific. Bataan forced them to slow down, giving the allies valuable time to prepare for conflicts such as the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and the [[Battle of Midway]] which followed closely thereafter. Ultimately, Kieyoomia, along with more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the infamous [[Bataan Death March]].

==Prisoner of war==
[[Image:NA 127-N-114541.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Prisoners on the march from Bataan to the prison camp, May 1942. (National Archives)]]
[[image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The atomic bomb's [[mushroom cloud]] after detonating over Nagasaki.]]
Initially [[torture]]d because his captors thought he was [[Japanese-American]] (and therefore a traitor), Joe Kieyoomia suffered months of beatings before the Japanese accepted his claim to Navajo ancestry.

He survived the [[Bataan Death March|Death March]] that killed thousands of starved U.S. and Philippine soldiers. When the "[[Navajo Code Talker|Navajo Code]]" had the Japanese baffled, Kieyoomia was questioned and then tortured, although he could only understand bits and pieces of what trained Navajo Code Talkers were saying; the code was so sophisticated that he eventually told the Japanese that it sounded like nonsense to him.

Kieyoomia was not trained as a code talker and did not know about the code. He was stripped naked and forced to stand for hours in deep snow until he talked. When he was finally allowed to return to his cell, a guard shoved him, causing the soles of his feet to tear as they were [[frostbite|frozen]] to the ground.

After surviving the [[internment|prison camp]]s, the "[[hell ship]]s" and the torture, Kieyoomia was a prisoner in Nagasaki when that city was the target of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|second atomic bomb]] dropped by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Kieyoomia [[Hibakusha|survived]] the attack, saying he was protected by the concrete walls of his cell. After 3½ years as a [[prisoner of war]], he  was abandoned for three days after the bombing, but says a Japanese officer finally freed him.

'''Johrei''' {{nihongo|"purification of the spirit"|浄霊|Jōrei}}, sometimes spelled ''jyorei'', is a form of [[alternative medicine]] similar to [[Reiki]].&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Luke|first=Jesse|title=Johrei: The next energy healing craze?|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/johrei-the-next-energy-healing-craze/|website=Science Based Medicine|date=21 July 2017|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in [[Japan]] in the 1930s by [[Mokichi Okada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Jyorei — 'purification of the spirit' |url= http://www.jyorei.org |website= www.jyorei.org |publisher= |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SBM"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|publisher=Visible Ink Press LLC|year=2008|isbn=1578592097|location=Canton, MI|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite presenting itself as a form of alternative medicine, the Johrei Fellowship maintains that it does not prescribe, diagnose, or treat physical illnesses&lt;ref name="SBM"/&gt; and that their focus is on spiritual health and world peace instead of physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Okada |editor-first= Mokichi |year= 1998b |publisher= Johrei Fellowship |title= Fragments from the Teachings of Meishu-sama |isbn=  9780962918346 |page= 56 |ref= {{SfnRef|Okada|1998b}} |origyear= 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cfn|date=June 2015}}

== Origin and history ==
Okada, who was also a previous member of Omoto, one of Japan's new religions, claimed to have a vision in 1925 of the Buddhist [[Bodhisattva]] Kannon (Kuan Yin) and she gave him the divine light, along with a command that Okada proclaim himself a prophet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He later established the Great Japan Association for the Veneration of the Bodhisattva Kanon, with divine healing as its main purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Practitioners claim to channel [[Vitalism|vitalist]] [[Energy (esotericism)|"energy"]] into patients by waving their hands over the patient's body.&lt;ref name="SBM" /&gt; 

There is a claim that, in lectures and classes, there are numerous reports of dramatic healings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vibrational Energy Medicine|last=Guimares|first=Fernando|publisher=Pedia Press|year=2006|isbn=9780826138057|location=New York|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from its association with these miracles, Johrei is known for its two significant features. The first involves simplicity of the healing practice because the placement of the hand over another person can be performed anywhere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Prayer Below the Equator: How Brazilians Believe in the Church of World Messianity|last=Matsuoka|first=Hideaki|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2007|isbn=0739113798|location=Lanham|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egalitarianism]] constitutes the second feature of Johrei. This is based on the fundamental idea that one person administers healing and another receives it and that "there is no difference between clergy and followers in their ability to transmit the light of God." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Johrei was introduced to America in 1953, and there are numerous Johrei centers throughout the United States and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= About us |url= http://johreifellowship.org/about-us |website= johreifellowship.org |publisher= |date= |accessdate= November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42851">'''Lip reading''', also known as lipreading or '''speechreading''', is a technique of understanding [[speech]] by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue when normal sound is not available. It relies also on information provided by the context, knowledge of the language, and any residual hearing. Although ostensibly used by deaf and hard-of-hearing people, most people with normal hearing process some speech information from sight of the moving mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = L | last2 = Hickson | first2 = L | last3 = Dodd | first3 = B | year = 2009 | title = Review of visual speech perception by hearing and hearing-impaired people: clinical implications | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 253–70 | doi = 10.1080/13682820802090281 | pmid = 18821117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

Although [[speech perception]] is considered to be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make  movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports aural comprehension &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5808871 | volume=12 | title=Interaction of audition and vision in the recognition of oral speech stimuli | year=1969 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=423–5 | last1 = Erber | first1 = NP | doi=10.1044/jshr.1202.423}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see [[McGurk effect]]).  The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.

===Phonemes and visemes===
The [[phoneme]] is the smallest detectable unit of sound in a language that serves to distinguish words from one another. /pit/ and /pik/ differ by one phoneme and refer to different concepts. Spoken English has about 44 phonemes. For lip reading, the number of visually distinctive units - [[viseme]]s - is much smaller, thus several phonemes map onto a few visemes. This is because many phonemes are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. These include [[glottal consonants]] and most gestures of the tongue. [[Voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] pairs look identical, such as [p] and [b], [k] and [g], [t] and [d], [f] and [v], and [s] and [z]; likewise for [[nasalisation]] (e.g. [m] vs. [b]). [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophene Homophenes] are words that look similar when lip read, but which contain different phonemes. Because there are about three times as many phonemes as visemes in English, it is often claimed that only 30% of speech can be lip read. Homophenes are a crucial source of  [[Bad Lip Reading|mis-lip reading]].

[[File:  Sam Loyd lipreading puzzle.jpg|thumb| The legend to this puzzle reads "Here is a class of a dozen boys, who, being called up to give their names were photographed by the instantaneous process just as each one was commencing to pronounce his own name. The twelve names were Oom, Alden, Eastman, Alfred, Arthur, Luke, Fletcher, Matthew, Theodore, Richard, Shirmer, and Hisswald. Now it would not seem possible to be able to give the correct name to each of the twelve boys, but if you practice the list over to each one, you will find it not a difficult task to locate the proper name for every one of the boys."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Loyd|Sam Loyd's]] Cyclopedia of Puzzles, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Co-articulation]]===
Visemes can be captured as still images, but speech unfolds in time. The smooth articulation of speech sounds in sequence can mean that mouth patterns may be ‘shaped’ by an adjacent phoneme:  the ‘th’ sound in ‘tooth’ and in ‘teeth’ appears very different because of the [[vowel|vocalic]] context. This feature of dynamic speech-reading affects lip-reading 'beyond the viseme'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7162162 | volume=25 | title=Coarticulation effects in lipreading | year=1982 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=600–7 | last1 = Benguerel | first1 = AP | last2 = Pichora-Fuller | first2 = MK | doi=10.1044/jshr.2504.600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===How can it 'work' with so few visemes?===
The statistical distribution of phonemes within the lexicon of a language is uneven. While there are clusters of words which are phonemically similar to each other ('lexical neighbors', such as spit/sip/sit/stick...etc.), others are unlike all other words: they are 'unique' in terms of the distribution of their phonemes ('umbrella' may be an example). Skilled users of the language bring this knowledge to bear when interpreting speech, so it is generally harder to identify a heard word with many lexical neighbors than one with few neighbors. Applying this insight to seen speech, some words in the language can be unambiguously lip-read even when they contain few visemes - simply because no other words could possibly 'fit'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | year = 2010 | title = Investigating speechreading and deafness | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Audiology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 163–8 | doi = 10.3766/jaaa.21.3.4 | pmid = 20211120 | pmc = 3715375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation in readability and skill===
Many factors affect the visibility of a speaking face, including illumination, movement of the head/camera, frame-rate of the moving image and distance from the viewer (see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = TR | last2 = Thomas | first2 = SM | year = 2011 | title = When half a face is as good as a whole: effects of simple substantial occlusion on visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 73 | issue = 7| pages = 2270–85 | doi = 10.3758/s13414-011-0152-4 | pmid = 21842332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Head movement that accompanies normal speech can also improve lip-reading, independently of oral actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = SM | last2 = Jordan | first2 = TR | year = 2004 | title = Contributions of oral and extraoral facial movement to visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 873–88 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.30.5.873 | pmid = 15462626 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when lip-reading [[connected speech]], the viewer's knowledge of the spoken language, familiarity with the speaker and style of speech, and the context of the lip-read material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spehar | first1 = B | last2 = Goebel | first2 = S | last3 = Tye-Murray | first3 = N | year = 2015 | title = Effects of Context Type on Lipreading and Listening Performance and Implications for Sentence Processing | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 1093–102 | doi = 10.1044/2015_JSLHR-H-14-0360 | pmid = 25863923 | pmc=4610295}}&lt;/ref&gt; are as important as the visibility of the speaker. While most hearing people are sensitive to seen speech, there is great variability in individual speechreading skill. Good lipreaders are often more accurate than poor lipreaders at identifying phonemes from visual speech.

A simple visemic measure of 'lipreadability'  has been questioned by some researchers. The 'phoneme equivalence class' measure takes into account the statistical structure of the lexicon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Files | first1 = BT | last2 = Tjan | first2 = BS | last3 = Jiang | first3 = J | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = LE | year = 2015 | title = Visual speech discrimination and identification of natural and synthetic consonant stimuli | url = | journal = Front Psychol | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 878 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00878 | pmid = 26217249 | pmc=4499841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also accommodate individual differences in lip-reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9407662 | volume=102 | title=Speechreading and the structure of the lexicon: computationally modeling the effects of reduced phonetic distinctiveness on lexical uniqueness | year=1997 | journal=J Acoust Soc Am | pages=3704–10 | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = LE | doi=10.1121/1.420402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feld J1, Sommers M 2011 There Goes the Neighborhood: Lipreading and the Structure of the Mental Lexicon. ''Speech Commun.''  Feb;53(2):220-228&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, excellent lipreading is often associated with more broad-based cognitive skills including general language proficiency, [[executive function]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tye-Murray | first1 = N | last2 = Hale | first2 = S | last3 = Spehar | first3 = B | last4 = Myerson | first4 = J | last5 = Sommers | first5 = MS | year = 2014 | title = Lipreading in school-age children: the roles of age, hearing status, and cognitive ability | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 556–65 | doi = 10.1044/2013_JSLHR-H-12-0273 | pmid=24129010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feld | first1 = JE | last2 = Sommers | first2 = MS | year = 2009 | title = Lipreading, processing speed, and working memory in younger and older adults | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 52 | issue = 6| pages = 1555–65 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0137) | pmid = 19717657 | pmc=3119632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipreading and language learning in hearing infants and children==

===The first few months===

Seeing the mouth plays a role in the very young infant's early sensitivity to speech, and prepares them to become speakers at 1 – 2 years. In order to imitate, a baby must learn to shape their lips in accordance with the sounds they hear; seeing the speaker may help them to do this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/16/babies-learning-to-talk_n_1209219.html&lt;/ref&gt; Newborns imitate adult mouth movements such as sticking out the tongue or opening the mouth, which could be a precursor to further imitation and later language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 897687 | volume=198 | title=Imitation of facial and manual gestures by human neonates | year=1977 | journal=Science | pages=74–8 | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = AN | last2 = Moore | first2 = MK | doi=10.1126/science.897687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are disturbed when audiovisual speech of a familiar speaker is desynchronized &lt;ref&gt;Dodd B.1976 Lip reading in infants: attention to speech presented in- and out-of-synchrony. ''Cognitive Psychology'' Oct;11(4):478-84&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to show different looking patterns for familiar than for unfamiliar faces when matched to (recorded) voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spelke | first1 = E | year = 1976 | title = Infants intermodal perception of events | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 553–560 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(76)90018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants are sensitive to [[McGurk effect|McGurk illusions]] months before they have learned to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burnham | first1 = D | last2 = Dodd | first2 = B | year = 2004 | title = Auditory-visual speech integration by prelinguistic infants: perception of an emergent consonant in the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 204–20 | doi = 10.1002/dev.20032 | pmid = 15549685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9136265 | volume=59 | title=The McGurk effect in infants | year=1997 | journal=Percept Psychophys | pages=347–57 | last1 = Rosenblum | first1 = LD | last2 = Schmuckler | first2 = MA | last3 = Johnson | first3 = JA}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies and many more point to a role for vision in the development of sensitivity to (auditory) speech in the first half-year of life.

===The next six months; a role in learning a native language===

Until around six months of age, most hearing infants are sensitive to a wide range of speech gestures - including ones that can be seen on the mouth - which may or may not later be part of the [[phonology]] of their native language. But in the second six months of life, the hearing infant shows [[perceptual narrowing]] for the phonetic structure of their own language - and may lose the early sensitivity to mouth patterns that are not useful. The speech sounds  /v/ and /b/ which are visemically distinctive in English but not in Castilian Spanish are accurately distinguished in Spanish-exposed and English-exposed babies up to the age of around 6 months. However, older Spanish-exposed infants lose the ability to 'see' this distinction, while it is retained for English-exposed infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pons | first1 = F | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Narrowing of intersensory speech perception in infancy | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 106 | issue = 26| pages = 10598–602 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0904134106 | pmid = 19541648 | pmc=2705579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies suggest that rather than hearing and vision developing in independent ways in infancy, multimodal processing is the rule, not the exception, in (language) development of the infant brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = DJ | last2 = Ghazanfar | first2 = AA | year = 2009 | title = The emergence of multisensory systems through perceptual narrowing | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 11| pages = 470–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.004 | pmid=19748305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early language production: one to two years===

Given the many studies indicating a role for vision in the development of language in the pre-lingual infant, the effects of congenital blindness on language development are surprisingly small.  18-month-olds learn new words more readily when they hear them, and do not learn them when they are shown the speech movements without hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Havy, M., Foroud, A., Fais, L., &amp; Werker, J.F. (in press; online January 26, 2017). The role of auditory and visual speech in word-learning at 18 months and in adulthood. Child Development.  (Pre-print version)&lt;/ref&gt; However, children blind from birth can confuse /m/ and /n/ in their own early production of English words – a confusion rarely seen in sighted hearing children, since  /m/ and /n/ are visibly distinctive, but auditorilly confusable.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, A.E. 1987 The development of phonology in the blind child. In B.Dodd &amp; R.Campbell(Eds) Hearing by Eye: the psychology of lipreading, Hove UK, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; The role of vision in children aged 1–2 years may be less critical to the production of their native language, since, by that age, they have attained the skills they need to identify and imitate speech sounds. However, hearing a non-native language can shift the child's attention to visual and auditory engagement by way of lipreading and listening in order to process, understand and produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewkowicz | first1 = DJ | last2 = Hansen-Tift | first2 = AM | date = Jan 2012 | title = Infants deploy selective attention to the mouth of a talking face when learning speech | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 1431–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1114783109 | pmid = 22307596 | pmc=3277111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In childhood===
Studies with pre-lingual infants and children use indirect, non-verbal measures to indicate sensitivity to seen speech. ''Explicit'' lip-reading can be reliably tested in hearing preschoolers by asking them to 'say aloud what I say silently'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies R1 | first1 = Kidd E | last2 = Lander | first2 = K | year = 2009 | title = Investigating the psycholinguistic correlates of speechreading in preschool age children | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 164–74 | doi = 10.1080/13682820801997189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In school-age children, lipreading of familiar closed-set words such as number words can be readily elicited.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd B. 1987 The acquisition of lipreading skills by normally hearing children. In B.Dodd &amp; R.Campbell (Eds) Hearing by Eye, Erlbaum NJ pp163-176&lt;/ref&gt; Individual differences in lip-reading skill, as tested by asking the child to 'speak the word that you lip-read', or by matching a lip-read utterance to a picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jerger | first1 = S | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Developmental shifts in children's sensitivity to visual speech: a new multimodal picture-word task | url = | journal = J Exp Child Psychol | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 40–59 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2008.08.002 | pmid = 18829049 | pmc=2612128}}&lt;/ref&gt; show a relationship between lip-reading skill and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyle | first1 = FE | last2 = Campbell | first2 = R | last3 = Mohammed | first3 = T | last4 = Coleman | first4 = M | last5 = MacSweeney | first5 = M | year = 2013 | title = Speechreading development in deaf and hearing children: introducing the test of child speechreading | url = | journal = Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 416–26 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2012/12-0039) | pmid = 23275416 | pmc=4920223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tye-Murray | first1 = N | last2 = Hale | first2 = S | last3 = Spehar | first3 = B | last4 = Myerson | first4 = J | last5 = Sommers | first5 = MS | year = 2014 | title = Lipreading in school-age children: the roles of age, hearing status, and cognitive ability | url = | journal = J Speech Lang Hear Res | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 556–65 | doi = 10.1044/2013_JSLHR-H-12-0273 | pmid = 24129010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In hearing adults: lifespan considerations==
While lip-reading silent speech poses a challenge for most hearing people, adding sight of the speaker to heard speech improves speech processing under many conditions. The mechanisms for this, and the precise ways in which lip-reading helps, are topics of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peelle | first1 = JE | last2 = Sommers | first2 = MS | year = 2015 | title = Prediction and constraint in audiovisual speech perception | journal = Cortex | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 169–81 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.03.006 | pmid=25890390 | pmc=4475441}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeing the speaker helps at all levels of speech processing from [[Phonetics|phonetic feature]] discrimination to interpretation of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] utterances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | year = 2008 | title = The processing of audio-visual speech: empirical and neural bases | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 363 | issue = 1493| pages = 1001–1010 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2155 | pmid=17827105 | pmc=2606792}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The positive effects of adding vision to heard speech are greater in noisy than quiet environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sumby | first1 = WH | last2 = Pollack | first2 = I | year = 1954 | title = Visual contribution to speech intelligibility in noise | doi = 10.1121/1.1907309 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 212–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
where by making speech perception easier, seeing the speaker can free up cognitive resources, enabling deeper processing of speech content.

As [[Hearing loss|hearing becomes less reliable in old-age]] people may tend to rely more on lip-reading, and are encouraged to do so. However, greater reliance on lip-reading may not always make good the effects of age-related hearing loss. Cognitive decline in aging may be preceded by and/or associated with measurable hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taljaard | first1 = Schmulian | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = The relationship between hearing impairment and cognitive function: A meta-analysis in adults | url = | journal = Clin Otolaryngol | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1111/coa.12607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hung | first1 = SC | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Hearing Loss is Associated With Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Case-Control Study in Older People | url = | journal = J Epidemiol | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 517–21 | doi = 10.2188/jea.JE20140147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus lipreading may not always be able to fully compensate for the combined hearing and cognitive age-related decrements.

===In specific (hearing) populations===

A number of studies report anomalies of lipreading in populations with distinctive developmental disorders. [[Autism]]:  People with autism may show reduced lipreading abilities and reduced reliance on vision in audiovisual speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = EG | last2 = Bennetto | first2 = L.J | year = 2007 | title = Audiovisual speech integration and lipreading in autism | url = | journal = Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 813–21 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01766.x | pmid = 17683453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = JR | last2 = Tornatore | first2 = LA | last3 = Brancazio | first3 = L | last4 = Whalen | first4 = DH | year = 2011 | title = Can children with autism spectrum disorders "hear" a speaking face? | url = | journal = Child Dev | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 1397–403 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01619.x | pmid = 21790542 | pmc=3169706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be associated with gaze-to-the-face anomalies in these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = JR | last2 = Brancazio | first2 = L | year = 2014 | title = Seeing to hear?

==Deafness==
"When you are deaf you live inside a well-corked glass bottle. You see the entrancing outside world, but it does not reach you. After learning to lip read, you are still inside the bottle, but the cork has come out and the outside world slowly but surely comes in to you." &lt;ref name="Clegg1953"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|Debate has raged for hundreds of years]] over the role of lip-reading ('[[oralism]]') compared with other communication methods (most recently, [[total communication]]) in the education of deaf people. The extent to which one or other approach is beneficial depends on a range of factors, including level of hearing loss of the deaf person, age of hearing loss, parental involvement and parental language(s). Then there is a question concerning the aims of the deaf person and her community and carers. Is the aim of education to enhance communication generally, to develop [[sign language]] as a first language, or to develop skills in the spoken language of the hearing community? Researchers now focus on which aspects of language and communication may be best delivered by what means and in which contexts, given the hearing status of the child and her family, and their educational plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handsandvoices.org/articles/research/v9-2_marschark.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bimodal bilingualism]] (proficiency in both speech and sign language) is one dominant current approach in language education for the deaf child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swanwick | first1 = R | year = 2016 | title = Deaf Children's bimodal bilingualism and education | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 49 | issue = 01| pages = 1–34 | doi = 10.1017/S0261444815000348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf people  are often better lip-readers than people with normal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = LE | last2 = Demorest | first2 = ME | last3 = Tucker | first3 = PE | year = 2000 | title = Speech perception without hearing | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 233–52 | doi=10.3758/bf03205546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some deaf people practice as professional lipreaders, for instance in [[forensic lipreading]]. In deaf people who have a [[cochlear implant]], pre-implant lip-reading skill can predict post-implant (auditory or audiovisual) speech processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bergeson TR1 | first1 = Pisoni DB | last2 = Davis | first2 = RA | year = 2005 | title = Development of audiovisual comprehension skills in prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants | url = | journal = Ear &amp; Hearing | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 149–64 | doi=10.1097/00003446-200504000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many deaf people, access to spoken communication can be helped when a spoken message is relayed via a trained, ''[http://lipspeaking.co.uk/ professional lip-speaker]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/communication-support-for-deaf-people&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lipspeaker.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with lipreading and literacy development, children born deaf typically show [[Reading disability|delayed development of literacy]] skills&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/reading-and-dyslexia-deaf-children&lt;/ref&gt; which can reflect difficulties in acquiring elements of the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = What really matters in the early literacy development of deaf children | url = | journal = J Deaf Stud Deaf Educ | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 411–31 | doi=10.1093/deafed/enm020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reliable [[Phonics|phoneme-grapheme mapping]] may be more difficult for deaf children, who need to be skilled speech-readers in order to master this necessary step in literacy acquisition.

[[Cued Speech]] uses lipreading with accompanying hand shapes that disambiguate the visemic (consonant) lipshape. Cued speech is said to be easier for hearing parents to learn than a sign language, and studies, primarily from Belgium, show that a deaf child exposed to cued speech in infancy can make more efficient progress in learning a spoken language than from lipreading alone

==Teaching and training==
The aim of teaching and training in lipreading is to develop awareness of the nature of lipreading, and to practice ways of improving the ability to perceive speech 'by eye'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lipreading.org/lipreading-&lt;/ref&gt; Lipreading classes, often called ''lipreading and managing hearing loss classes'', are mainly aimed at adults who have hearing loss. The highest proportion of adults with hearing loss have an [[Presbycusis|age related]], or [[Occupational hearing loss|noise related loss]], and with both these the high frequency sounds are lost first. Since many of the consonants in speech are high frequency sounds, speech becomes distorted. Hearing aids help, but may not cure this. Lipreading classes have been shown to be of benefit in  UK studies  commissioned by the charity, [[Action on Hearing Loss]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/notjustlipservice.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012.

Trainers recognise that lipreading is an inexact art. Students are taught to watch the lips, tongue and jaw movements, to follow the stress and rhythm of language, to use their residual hearing, with or without hearing aids, to watch expression and body language, and use their ability to put two and two together. They are taught the [http://limpingchicken.com/2016/04/05/molly-berry-what-lipreading-classes-can-offer-deaf-people/  lipreaders alphabet], groups of sounds that look alike on the lips (visemes) like p, b, m, or f, v. The aim is to get the gist, so as to have the confidence to join in conversation, and avoid damaging social isolation that often accompanies hearing loss. Lipreading classes are recommended for anyone who struggles to hear in noise, and help to adjust to hearing loss.
[http://atlalipreading.org.uk ATLA ](the association for teaching lipreading to adults) is the professional association in the UK  for qualified lipreading tutors.

=== Tests ===

Most tests of lipreading were devised to measure individual differences in performing specific speech processing tasks, and to detect changes in performance following training.  Lipreading tests have been used with relatively small groups in experimental settings,  or as clinical indicators with individual patients and clients. That is, lipreading tests to date have limited validity as markers of lipreading skill in the general population.

==Lipreading and lip-speaking by machine==
[[Automated Lip Reading|Automated lip-reading]] has been a topic of interest in computational engineering, as well as in [[2001: A Space Odyssey|science fiction movies]]. The computational engineer [[Steve Omohundro]], among others, pioneered its development. In [[facial animation]], the aim is to generate realistic facial actions, especially mouth movements, that simulate human speech actions. Computer algorithms to deform or manipulate images of faces can be driven by heard or written language. Systems may be based on detailed models derived from facial movements ([[motion capture]]); on anatomical modelling of actions of the jaw, mouth and tongue; or on mapping of known viseme- phoneme properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rwalker/Walker/Publications_files/1996_CohenWalker%26Massaro_VisualSpeech.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A318099&amp;dswid=2041&lt;/ref&gt; Facial animation has been used in speechreading training (demonstrating how different sounds 'look').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f#/page-1 | doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f | volume=33 | title=Development and Evaluation of a Computer-Animated Tutor for Vocabulary and Language Learning in Children with Autism | journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | pages=653–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are a subset of [[speech synthesis]] modelling which aim to deliver reliable 'text-to-(seen)-speech' outputs.  A complementary aim—the  reverse of making faces move in speech—is to develop computer algorithms  that can deliver realistic interpretations of speech (i.e. a written transcript or audio record)  from natural video data of a face in action: this is facial speech recognition. These models too can be sourced from a variety of data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/visual-speech-synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic visual speech recognition from video has been quite successful in distinguishing different languages (from a corpus of spoken language data).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/lip-reading-computer-can-distinguish-languages/&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstration models, using machine-learning algorithms, have had some success in lipreading speech elements, such as specific words, from video&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2vInqqHX8&lt;/ref&gt;  and for identifying hard-to-lipread phonemes from visemically similar seen mouth actions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/the-innovators-can-computers-be-taught-to-lip-read-artificial-intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; Machine-based speechreading is now making successful use of [https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602949/ai-has-beaten-humans-at-lip-reading/ neural-net based algorithms] which use large databases of speakers and speech material (following the successful model for auditory [[automatic speech recognition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2113299-googles-deepmind-ai-can-lip-read-tv-shows-better-than-a-pro/&lt;/ref&gt;

Uses for machine lipreading could include automated lipreading of video-only records, automated lipreading of speakers with damaged vocal tracts, and speech processing in face-to-face video (i.e. from videophone data). Automated lipreading may help in processing noisy or unfamiliar speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Bodoff/publication/234819242_An_improved_automatic_lipreading_system_to_enhance_speech_recognition/links/5628b96008ae04c2aeaeb404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Automated lipreading may  contribute to [[biometric]] person identification, replacing password-based identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol1/954/a954.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetbiometrics.com-article-details-i-2250&lt;/ref&gt;

==The brain==
Following the discovery that [[Auditory cortex|auditory brain regions]], including [[Heschl's gyrus]], were activated by seen speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calvert | first1 = GA | last2 = Bullmore | first2 = ET | last3 = Brammer | first3 = MJ | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1997 | title = Activation  of auditory cortex during silent lipreading | url = | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5312| pages = 593–6 | pmid = 9110978 | doi=10.1126/science.276.5312.593}}&lt;/ref&gt; the neural circuitry for speechreading was shown to include supra-modal processing regions, especially [[superior temporal sulcus]] (all parts) as well as posterior inferior occipital-temporal regions including regions specialised for the processing of [[Fusiform face area|faces]] and [[visual area MT|biological motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = LE | last2 = Liebenthal | first2 = E | year = 2014 | title = Neural pathways for visual speech perception | url = | journal = Front Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 386 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00386 | pmid = 25520611 | pmc=4248808}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some but not all studies, activation of Broca's area is reported for speechreading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skipper | first1 = JI | last2 = van Wassenhove | first2 = V | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = HC | last4 = Small | first4 = SL | year = 2007 | title = Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices: How Cortical Areas Supporting Speech Production Mediate Audiovisual Speech Perception | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 2387–2399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhl147 | pmid=17218482 | pmc=2896890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11587893 | volume=12 | title=Cortical substrates for the perception of face actions: an fMRI study of the specificity of activation for seen speech and for meaningless lower-face acts (gurning) | year=2001 | journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res | pages=233–43 | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M | last3 = Surguladze | first3 = S | last4 = Calvert | first4 = G | last5 = McGuire | first5 = P | last6 = Suckling | first6 = J | last7 = Brammer | first7 = MJ | last8 = David | first8 = AS | doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(01)00054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that articulatory mechanisms can be activated in speechreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swaminathan | first1 = S. | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M. | last3 = Boyles | first3 = R. | last4 = Waters | first4 = D. | last5 = Watkins | first5 = K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39796">The following is a '''list of television actors who died during production''' of the [[television show]] in which they were appearing. In many cases, a show will handle the death of an [[actor]] by [[kill off|killing off]] their character or otherwise writing them out of the show. In other cases, the show may [[casting (performing arts)|recast]] the part with another actor. In extreme cases, the show may be [[cancellation (television)|cancelled]] outright.

With Season 3 episodes still in production, the first two episodes filmed after Kearns' death do not feature Mr. Wilson nor any acknowledgement of why he is absent; the episodes simply focus on other characters. Starting with the last six episodes of Season 3, the character of John Wilson ([[Gale Gordon]] as George's brother) is introduced and will remain for the rest of the series' run; the initial explanation of George's absence is that he is "away" on business. George (along with wife, Martha) are officially written out in the fourth-season premiere as having moved, and after a few scattered mentions in a few subsequent episodes are not referred to again.

| No on-screen acknowledgement was given, although Hoss' death is alluded to in at least two episodes.

| Episodes completed prior to Prinze's death were aired on schedule. The first aired episode after Prinze's death included an on-air acknowledgement from [[James Komack]] (the series' creator and executive producer) thanking everyone for their kind words and outpouring of sympathy. Following the airing of Prinze's last completed episode, for the rest of season three, Chico's absence is explained as being "away" (either on business or visiting his father), with completed scripts focusing on other characters and Chico's lines either removed or rewritten for other characters. Starting with Season 4, Chico was replaced by a 12-year-old boy named Raul (Gabriel Melgar), while other characters initially continued to explain that Chico was away. Finally, in the [[very special episode]] "Raul Runs Away," aired January 20, 1978 (nearly one year after Prinze's death), it is explained that Chico had died but with no explanation of the circumstances. However, the ratings declined and, with Prinze's death a primary factor, the series was cancelled in the spring of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snauffer|first=Douglas |author2=Thurm, Joel |title=The Show Must Go on: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|page=78|isbn=0-7864-3295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping this view in mind in the year 1980–81 medical colleges were started functioning at Comilla, Khulna, Pabna and IPGMR (Dhaka). Subsequently, the programme was abandoned and the students were shifted to the established existing eight medical colleges. In the year 1991–92 the government felt the need of establishment more medical colleges for medical education facilities in the country and thereby release the burden imposed on the existing medical colleges. Accordingly, the government made commitment to establish 5 new medical colleges at Dinajpur, Bogra, Khulna, Faridpur and Comilla. Thus 5 medical colleges had been established in 1999-91-year with annual intake of 50 students each medical college. On 16 August 1992 Dinajpur Medical Colleges started functioning at Dinajpur main town occupying a hostel of general government college and a rented private building named 'Hamana Bhaban'. It was shifted to new building proper at Ananada Sagor area near Dinajpur main town on 1 July 2000. Dinajpur Sadar hospital was used as temporary medical college hospital. Medical college was started functioning in building proper in college campus on 7 March 2010.Now Dinajpur Medical College and Hospital is have excellent campus with annual intake of approximately 150 students.

{{coord|43|30|43.48|N|6|45|23.40|E|region:FR_type:landmark|display=title}}

The '''Malpasset Dam''' was an [[arch dam]] on the [[Reyran River]], located approximately 7&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Fréjus]] on the [[French Riviera]] (Côte d'Azur), southern [[France]], in the [[Var (department)|Var département]]. It collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_french/malpasset/malpasset.htm The Malpasset Catastrophe in 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mAh3Bt9bQk 1999 documentary in French with interviews and footage of the disaster]&lt;/ref&gt; The damage amounted to an equivalent total of [[United States dollar|$]]68 million.

==Construction==
The [[dam]] was a doubly curved equal angle arch type with variable radius. It was built to supply drinking and irrigation water for the region. Construction began in April 1952 and was finished in 1954. Another source reports that construction began as early as 1941. Delays due to lack of funding and labor strikes interrupted construction a few times. The project was led by well-known French engineer [[Andre Coyne|André Coyne]]. Construction cost 580 million francs (by 1955 prices), and was funded and owned by [[Var (département)|Var]] [[Département in France|département]]. Concurrent with the dam construction, the [[A8 autoroute]] was also being built 1,400 meters further down the course of the Reyran from the dam location.

The dam was supposed to regulate the rate of the flow of the river that it was near and store 50 million m cubed of water for agriculture, and domestic use and for the tourism sector of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French Ministry for Sustainable Development|first=DGPR/SRT/BARPI|date=April 2009|title=Burst of a Dam, 2 December 1959, Malpasset (Var) France|url=https://www.aria.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/wp-content/files_mf/FD_29490_malpasset_1959_ang.pdf|journal=ARIA|volume=|pages=1–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam was 222 metres in width, 66 metres high, and had a thickness of 6.78 metres at the base and 1.5 metres at the rim.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rivierareporter.com/local-living/151-the-malpasset-dam-disaster-could-the-var-suffer-again|title=The Malpasset Dam Disaster – could the Var suffer again? – Riviera Reporter|website=www.rivierareporter.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
During November 1959, there are first warning signs as "trickle of clear water observed high on the right [side]" and then cracks noticed later in the month in the concert apron at the dam toe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Richard E|date=May 16, 2013|title=On the Failure of Malpasset Dam|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.aegweb.org/resource/resmgr/Dams/2-goodman_malpasset_dam_fail.pdf|journal=University Cal. Berkeley PowerPoints|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam was breached at 21:13 on December 2, 1959. This was partially due to the water level in the dam rising at a fast pace due to rainfall, and by noon on 2 December 1959 the reservoir had reached its maximum level. The guardian Ferro asked for permission to release the excess water and was denied the ability to do so until 6pm of that day, the amount of water was so high it took 3 hours to release only a few centimeters of water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The entire wall collapsed with only a few blocks remaining on the right bank. Pieces of the dam are still scattered throughout the area.

The breach created a massive [[Dam failure|dam break wave]], or wall of water, {{convert|40|m|ft}} high and moving at {{convert|70|km|mi}} per hour, destroying two small villages, Malpasset and Bozon, the highway construction site, and in 20 minutes, still standing {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} high, reaching Fréjus. The water was recorded traveling at speeds up to 70 kph with large chunks of the concrete wall some weighing up to 600 tons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Various small roads and railroad tracks were also destroyed, water flooding the western half of Fréjus and finally reaching the sea.

It was reported that the death toll of the dam breach was 423, with 135 children under the age of 15, 15 minors between 15 and 21 years old, 134 men, 112 women, and 27 individuals that were never identified. Separately 79 children were orphaned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, 83 people were injured.&lt;ref name=AeM/&gt; The physical toll was higher with 155 buildings destroyed, 796 buildings damaged, and 1350 hectares destroyed, totaling the amount of destruction to be about 425 million euros in 2010 terms.&lt;ref name=AeM&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Luino |first1=Fabio |last2=Trebò |first2=Pier Giuseppe |title=The Malpasset dam (France) fifty years after the failure of December 2, 1959 and references to similar Italian cases |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282697431_The_Malpasset_dam_France_fifty_years_after_the_failure_of_December_2_1959_and_references_to_similar_Italian_cases |journal=Geoingegneria Ambientale e Mineraria |date=January–April 2010 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=53–80 |language=Italian |issn=1121-9041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Geological and hydrological studies were conducted in 1946 and the dam location was considered suitable. Due to lack of proper funding, however, the geological study of the region was not thorough. The [[lithology]] underlying the dam is a [[metamorphic rock]] called [[gneiss]]. This rock type is known to be relatively [[Permeability (fluid)|impermeable]], meaning that there is no significant groundwater flow within the rock unit, and it does not allow water to penetrate the ground. On the right side (looking down the river), was also rock, and a concrete [[wing wall]] was constructed to connect the wall to the ground. 

A [[Geologic faults|tectonic fault]] was later found as the most likely cause of the disaster. Other factors contributed as well; the water pressure was aimed diagonally towards the dam wall, and was not found initially. As a consequence, water collected under a wall and was unable to escape through the ground due to the impermeability of the gneiss rock underneath the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erpicum|first=S|last2=Archambeau|date=2004|title=Computation of the Malpasset Dam Break with a 2D Conservative Flow Solver on a Multiblock Structured Grid|url=https://orbi.uliege.be//bitstream/2268/2616/1/HIC_conf29a341.pdf|journal=International Conference on Hydroinformatics; World Scientific Publishing Company|volume=|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, another theory quotes a source stating that explosions during building of the highway might have caused shifting of the rock base of the dam. Weeks before the breach, some cracking noises were heard, but they were not examined. It is not clear when the cracking noises started. The right side of the dam had some leaks in November 1959. 

Between November 19 and December 2, there was {{Convert|50|cm}} of rainfall, and {{Convert|13|cm}} in 24 hours before the breach. The water level in the dam was only {{Convert|28|cm}} away from the edge. Rain continued, and the dam guardian wanted to open the discharge valves, but the authorities refused, claiming the highway construction site was in danger of flooding. Five hours before the breach, at 18:00 hours, the water release valves were opened, but with a discharge rate of 40 m³/s, it was not enough to empty the reservoir in time.

Until the Malpasset incident, only 4 other incidents of arch-type dam breaches were recorded:
* [[Manitou dam]], [[Manitou Springs]], Colorado, 1924 at {{coord|38|52|35.47|N|104|59|38.30|W|region:US-CO_type:landmark|name=Manitou dam)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11240">The '''National Sleep Foundation''' ('''NSF''') is a U.S. nonprofit organization that promotes public understanding of sleep and [[sleep disorder]]s. It engages in various activities to advance its purpose and goals, including the operation of several websites and the sponsorship of research. Though the foundation denies endorsing commercial products, some sellers have claimed that their products have some sort of "official" status with it.

==Purpose==
Founded in 1990, the nonprofit National Sleep Foundation promotes public understanding of sleep and sleep disorders. It seeks to improve public health and safety by supporting sleep-related education, research, and advocacy.&lt;ref name="Healthfinder"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://healthfinder.gov/FindServices/Organizations/Organization.aspx?code=HR2875 |title=National Sleep Foundation - NSF |work=Healthfinder website |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |date=2015-10-06 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's goals are increased understanding of the importance of sleep to good health and productivity; prevention and/or remediation of health and safety problems related to insufficient sleep and untreated sleep disorders; expanded scientific research in sleep and sleep medicine; and implementation of public policy that promotes sleep education, research and treatment. The foundation is based in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Healthfinder"/&gt;

==Activities==
The foundation engages in various activities to advance its purpose and goals. Many of these are described on its website.&lt;ref name="NSF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sleepfoundation.org/ |title=National Sleep Foundation - Sleep Research &amp; Education |work=NSF website |publisher=National Sleep Foundation |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help reduce the incidence and consequences of [[sleep-deprived driving]], it sponsors Drowsy Driving Prevention Week and maintains a "Drowsy Driving" website.&lt;ref name="DrowsyDriving"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drowsydriving.org/ |title=Drowsy Driving - Stay Alert, Arrive Alive |work=Drowsy Driving website |publisher=National Sleep Foundation |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To inform the public about the positive benefits of sleep health, it operates a sleep health website, covering sleep science, bedroom design, lifestyle, and the effect of age on sleep requirements.&lt;ref name="Sleep"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sleep.org/ |title=Sleep.org by the National Sleep Foundation |work=Sleep.org website |publisher=National Sleep Foundation |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its promotional activities have been occasionally covered by national news media.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Deutsch |first=Lindsay |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/02/03/sleep-duration-recommendations/22790433/ |title=National Sleep Foundation changes recommended snooze time |work=USA TODAY Network |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-sleep-foundation-new-recommendations-for-good-nights-rest/ |title=National Sleep Foundation's new recommendations for a good night's rest |work=CBS News website |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation has been published in journal of the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]],&lt;ref name="JCSM"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Sleep and Technology Use of Americans: Findings from the National Sleep Foundation's 2011 Sleep in America Poll |journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine |last=Gradisar |first=Michael |volume=9 |issue=12 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/jcsm/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=29249 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its educational conferences have been provisionally accredited for [[Continuing Medical Education]] credits by the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]].&lt;ref name="ACCME"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accme.org/find-cme-provider/national-sleep-foundation |title=National Sleep Foundation |work=ACCME website |publisher=[[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==
The foundation's programs are funded by corporate and individual contributions, and through its partnerships with corporations and government entities.&lt;ref name="Healthfinder"/&gt; Its recent revenues are in the $3.5 million range, and its recent assets are about $5 million. Contributions are tax-deductible.&lt;ref name="ERI2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=National Sleep Foundation |journal=Economic Research Institute: Nonprofit Comparables Assessor (Subscription Required) | url=http://www.erieri.com/nonprofitcomparablesassessor|year=2017 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to then-CEO Richard Gelula, "The largest single source of National Sleep Foundation funding is pharmaceutical and medical device companies."&lt;ref name="GriffithWeigand2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffith|first1=Dorsey|last2=Wiegand|first2=Steve|title=Health groups' funding faulted Not-for-profit advocates often have strong ties to the drug industry|url=http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/projects/drugs/story/13132395p-13976434c.html|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=26 June 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125110732/http://www.sacbee.com/|archivedate=25 November 2005|page=A1|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, nearly $1 million of its $3.6 million budget at the time came from manufacturers of sleeping medications.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2005"/&gt;

==Controversies==
The NSF has been criticized by the [[American Institute of Philanthropy]],&lt;ref name="GriffithWeigand2005"/&gt; Dr. [[Sidney M. Wolfe]] of [[Public Citizen]]'s Health Research Group,&lt;ref name="Holguin2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holguin|first1=Jaime|title=Sleep Study A Pipe Dream?|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sleep-study-a-pipe-dream/|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=[[CBS News]]|date=29 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Avorn]] (head of the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at [[Harvard Medical School]]),&lt;ref name="Lieberman2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=LIEBERMAN|first1=Trudy|title=Bitter Pill:  How the press helps push prescription drugs, sometimes with deadly consequences|url=http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CJR-2005-07-Bitter-Pill.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=July–August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other consumer and medical ethics groups for its reliance on industry funding, and the possible influence of such funding on its work.&lt;ref name="GriffithWeigand2005"/&gt; In 2005, for instance, they released a survey purporting to find extremely high rates of [[insomnia]], declared insomnia to be a "crisis" and an "epidemic,"&lt;ref name="Holguin2005"/&gt; announced an "Insomnia Awareness Day" and a "National Sleep Awareness Week," but the poll, the declaration of a dedicated day and week, and the widely distributed press kits were paid for by manufacturers of sleeping medications, and the [[public relations]] firm assigned to contact medical reporters about the poll took the opportunity to mention the shortly-approaching release of [[Lunesta]] (eszopiclone), the first sleeping medication approved in the United States for extended use.&lt;ref name="GriffithWeigand2005"/&gt; Simultaneously, the drug's manufacturer assigned 1,250 [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s to educate physicians about Lunesta, as part of a $60 million advertising push.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2005"/&gt;

A [[Sacramento Bee]] report on these connections also noted that 10 of NSF's 23-member Board of Directors had current or past financial ties to manufacturers of sleeping medications.&lt;ref name="GriffithWeigand2005"/&gt;

A previous 2002 "Sleep in America" poll from NSF, which similarly characterized the results as revealing an "epidemic" of daytime sleepiness in its press release, was similarly characterized in a report by [[The Seattle Times]] as industry "[[astroturfing]]" due to sponsorship from the makers of the sleeping medications [[Unisom]], [[Sonata]], and [[Ambien]].&lt;ref name="Duff2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duff|first1=Wilson A|title=Many new drugs have strong dose of media hype|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/many-new-drugs-have-strong-dose-of-media-hype/|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=29 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, NSF also worked with pharmaceutical company [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] to launch what they characterized as a "new educational program that highlights personal stories about sleep for four individuals from across the country;"&lt;ref name="NSFbeyondTiredPressRelease"&gt;{{cite web|website=National Sleep Foundation|title=The National Sleep Foundation and Merck Urge Insomnia Sufferers to Prioritize Sleep and Move Beyond Tired|url=https://sleepfoundation.org/press-release/the-national-sleep-foundation-and-merck-urge-insomnia-sufferers-prioritize-sleep-and|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a report in the [[Huffington Post]] described this effort as part of a multi-pronged "unbranded" marketing effort for [[Belsomra]] (suvorexant), Merck's then-forthcoming new sleeping drug.&lt;ref name="Cohn2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohn|first1=Jonathan|title=Drugs You Don't Need for Disorders You Don't Have: Inside the Pharmaceutical Industry's Campaign to Put Us All to Sleep|url=http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/sleep-advertising/|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=[[HuffPo]] Highline|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sepracor]], manufacturer of Lunesta, also awarded a $300,000 grant to NSF for a series of "Sleep Medicine Alert" brochures designed raise awareness of insomnia amongst physicians.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2005"/&gt;
 
Though the foundation claims that it does not make commercial endorsements,&lt;ref name="Disclaimer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sleepfoundation.org/about-us |title=About NSF: Mission and Leadership |work=NSF website |publisher=National Sleep Foundation |accessdate=2017-03-19 |quote=NSF does not endorse specific sleep therapeutics, therapies, products and services. }}&lt;/ref&gt; some merchants and products have claimed to be "endorsed by the National Sleep Foundation" or have implied such endorsement in their literature. Notable among these is [[My Pillow]], which makes such claims in its very-frequently-run television ads. In 2016, My Pillow agreed to stop making this claim in California, and paid a large fine for this and other claims.&lt;ref name="HomeDepot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homedepot.com/s/national%2520sleep%2520foundation?NCNI-5 |title=Search results for National Sleep Foundation at The Home Depot |work=Home Depot website |publisher=[[The Home Depot]] |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TruthInAd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.truthinadvertising.org/mypillow/ |title=My Pillow / Truth in Advertising |work=truthinadvertising.org website |publisher=[[Truth in Advertising (organization)]] |date=2016-01-14 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary therapeutic use of nicotine is in treating nicotine dependence in order to eliminate [[smoking]] with the damage it does to health. Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through [[nicotine gum|gums]], [[nicotine patches|dermal patches]], lozenges, electronic/substitute cigarettes or nasal sprays in an effort to wean them off their dependence.

In pregnancy, a 2013 review noted that "Although the exact mechanisms by which nicotine produces adverse fetal effects are unknown, it is likely that hypoxia, undernourishment of the fetus, and direct vasoconstrictor effects on the placental and umbilical vessels all play a role. Nicotine also has been shown to have significant deleterious effects on brain development, including alterations in brain metabolism and neurotransmitter systems and abnormal brain development." It also notes that "abnormalities of newborn neurobehavior, including impaired orientation and autonomic regulation and abnormalities of muscle tone, have been identified in a number of prenatal nicotine exposure studies", that there is weak data associating fetal nicotine exposure with newborn [[facial cleft]]s, that there is no good evidence for newborns suffering [[nicotine withdrawal]] from fetal exposure to nicotine, and that "nicotine is only 1 of more than 4000 compounds to which the fetus is exposed through maternal smoking.

The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RouteDFosB Primary"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marttila K, Raattamaa H, Ahtee L |title=Effects of chronic nicotine administration and its withdrawal on striatal FosB/DeltaFosB and c-Fos expression in rats and mice |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=44–51 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16631212 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2006.02.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, repeated daily exposure (possibly excluding [[oral route]]) to nicotine can result in accumbal ΔFosB overexpression, in turn causing nicotine addiction.&lt;ref name="Nestler 2013Rev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Addiction molecular neurobiology"/&gt;

Calcium triggers the [[exocytosis]] of [[Chromaffin cell|chromaffin granules]] and thus the release of [[epinephrine]] (and norepinephrine) into the [[bloodstream]].

The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking can depend on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. However, it has been found that the nicotine yield of individual products has only a small effect (4.4%) on the blood concentration of nicotine,&lt;ref&gt;Russell MA, Jarvis M, Iyer R, Feyerabend C.

Br Med J. 1980 April 5; 280(6219): 972–976.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting "the assumed health advantage of switching to lower-tar and lower-nicotine cigarettes may be largely offset by the tendency of smokers to compensate by increasing inhalation".

Nicotine has a half-life of 1–2&amp;nbsp;hours. [[Cotinine]] is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood with a half-life of 18–20&amp;nbsp;hours, making it easier to analyze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhalala|first=Oneil |name-list-format=vanc |title=Detection of Cotinine in Blood Plasma by HPLC MS/MS |journal=MIT Undergraduate Research Journal |volume=8 |date=Spring 2003 |pages=45–50 |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/89426297/Detection-of-Cotinine-in-Blood-Plasma-by-HPLC-MS-MS |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105112/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/89426297/Detection-of-Cotinine-in-Blood-Plasma-by-HPLC-MS-MS |archive-date=24 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that compose nicotine. Metabolic studies show that the [[pyridine]] ring of nicotine is derived from [[niacin]] (nicotinic acid) while the pyrrolidone is derived from ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrollidium cation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamberts BL, Dewey LJ, Byerrum RU |title=Ornithine as a precursor for the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=22–6 |date=May 1959 |pmid=13651178 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(59)90492-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01495a059 |title=The Biosynthesis of Nicotine from Isotopically Labeled Nicotinic Acids1 |year=1960 |vauthors=Dawson RF, Christman DR, d'Adamo A, Solt ML, Wolf AP |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=82 |issue=10 |pages=2628–2633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosynthesis of the two component structures proceeds via two independent syntheses, the NAD pathway for niacin and the tropane pathway for ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrollidium cation.

The NAD pathway in the genus ''[[Nicotiana]]'' begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into α-imino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give [[quinolinic acid]]. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoriboxyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form niacin mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce niacin via the conversion of [[nicotinamide]] by the enzyme [[nicotinamidase]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with [[decarboxylation]] of [[ornithine]] by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce [[putrescine]]. Putrescine is then converted into ''N''-methyl putrescine via [[methylation]] by SAM catalyzed by putrescine ''N''-methyltransferase (PMT). ''N''-methylputrescine then undergoes [[deamination]] into 4-methylaminobutanal by the ''N''-methylputrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrollidium cation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrollidium cation and niacin. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of niacin into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrollidium cation to form [[enantiomer]]ically pure (−)-nicotine.&lt;ref name=plant-meta&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Hiroshi |editor1-last=Ashihara |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Crozier |editor3-first=Atsushi |editor3-last=Komamine |name-list-format=vanc |title=Plant metabolism and biotechnology |publisher=Wiley |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-470-74703-2}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection in body fluids===

Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Benowitz NL, Hukkanen J, Jacob P |title=Nicotine chemistry, metabolism, kinetics and biomarkers |volume=192 |issue=192 |pages=29–60 |date=1 January 2009 |pmid=19184645 |pmc=2953858 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69248-5_2 |isbn=978-3-540-69246-1 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Randall Clint |last=Baselt| name-list-format=vanc  |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|year=2014|publisher=Biomedical Publications|isbn=978-0-9626523-9-4|edition=10th|pages=1452–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mündel T, Jones DA |title=Effect of transdermal nicotine administration on exercise endurance in men |journal=Experimental Physiology |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=705–13 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16627574 |doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2006.033373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]],'' which in turn is named after the [[France|French]] ambassador in [[Portugal]], [[Jean Nicot|Jean Nicot de Villemain]], who sent tobacco and seeds to [[Paris]] in 1560, presented to the French King,&lt;ref name="Rang H. P 2007, page 598"&gt;{{cite book  | vauthors =  Dale MM, Ritter JM, Fowler RJ, Rang HP |title=Rang &amp; Dale's Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |isbn=978-0-8089-2354-1 |edition=6th | page = 598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and who promoted their medicinal use. Smoking was believed to protect against illness, particularly the plague.&lt;ref name="Rang H. P 2007, page 598"/&gt;

[[Tobacco]] was introduced to [[Europe]] in 1559, and by the late 17th century, it was used not only for [[smoking]] but also as an [[insecticide]]. After [[World War II]], over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=Ujvary/&gt;

Currently, nicotine, even in the form of tobacco dust, is prohibited as a [[pesticide]] for [[organic farming]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=prohibited_dust&gt;US Code of Federal Regulations. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/7/205.602 7 CFR 205.602 – Nonsynthetic substances prohibited for use in organic crop production]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff IFOAM | url = http://classic.ifoam.org/growing_organic/1_arguments_for_oa/criticisms_misconceptions/misconceptions_no7.html | title = Criticisms and Frequent Misconceptions about Organic Agriculture: The Counter-Arguments: Misconception | issue = 7 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016092722/http://classic.ifoam.org/growing_organic/1_arguments_for_oa/criticisms_misconceptions/misconceptions_no7.html | archive-date= 16 October 2013 | dead-url= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical identification===
Nicotine was originally isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by chemists Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and Karl Ludwig Reimann from [[Germany]], who believed it was a poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Henningfield JE, Zeller M |title=Nicotine psychopharmacology research contributions to United States and global tobacco regulation: a look back and a look forward |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=184 |issue=3–4 |pages=286–91 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16463054 |doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0308-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Posselt W, Reimann L |title=Chemische Untersuchung des Tabaks und Darstellung eines eigenthümlich wirksamen Prinzips dieser Pflanze|trans-title=Chemical investigation of tobacco and preparation of a characteristically active constituent of this plant|language=German|journal=Magazin für Pharmacie|volume=6|issue=24|pages=138–161|year=1828|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgkCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chemical [[empirical formula]] was described by [[Louis Melsens|Melsens]] in 1843,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Melsens | first = Louis-Henri-Frédéric | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1843 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j-E3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA465#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Note sur la nicotine | trans-title = Note on nicotine | language = French | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique | series = third series | volume = 9 | pages = 465–479; see especially page 470 }} [Note: The empirical formula that Melsens provides is incorrect because at that time, chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).]&lt;/ref&gt; its structure was discovered by [[Adolf Pinner]] and [[Richard Wolffenstein (chemist)|Richard Wolffenstein]] in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ueber Nicotin |year=1891 | vauthors=Pinner A, Wolffenstein R |journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|volume=24|pages=1373–1377|doi=10.1002/cber.189102401242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ueber Nicotin.

==Society and culture==

The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has increased over time, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Connolly GN, Alpert HR, Wayne GF, Koh H |title=Trends in nicotine yield in smoke and its relationship with design characteristics among popular US cigarette brands, 1997–2005 |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=e5 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17897974 |pmc=2598548 |doi=10.1136/tc.2006.019695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of nicotine receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitisation of nicotine receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with early research showing low dose nicotine patches could be an effective treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] in non-smokers.&lt;ref name="pmid20965579"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineur YS, Picciotto MR |title=Nicotine receptors and depression: revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=580–6 |date=December 2010 |pmid=20965579 |pmc=2991594 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2010.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original research concluded that: "Nicotine patches produced short-term improvement of depression with minor side effects. Because of nicotine's high risk to health, nicotine patches are not recommended for clinical use in depression."&lt;ref name="pmid9746444"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salín-Pascual RJ, Rosas M, Jimenez-Genchi A, Rivera-Meza BL, Delgado-Parra V |title=Antidepressant effect of transdermal nicotine patches in nonsmoking patients with major depression |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=387–9 |date=September 1996 |pmid=9746444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref name="pmid19105840"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peters R, Poulter R, Warner J, Beckett N, Burch L, Bulpitt C |title=Smoking, dementia and cognitive decline in the elderly, a systematic review |journal=BMC Geriatrics |volume=8 |pages=36 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19105840 |pmc=2642819 |doi=10.1186/1471-2318-8-36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is evidence that nicotine itself has the potential to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=pmid19184661&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Henningfield JE, Zeller M |title=Nicotine psychopharmacology: policy and regulatory |volume=192 |issue=192 |pages=511–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19184661 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69248-5_18 |isbn=978-3-540-69246-1 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into nicotine's most predominant metabolite, [[cotinine]], suggests that some of nicotine's psychoactive effects are mediated by cotinine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grizzell JA, Echeverria V |title=New Insights into the Mechanisms of Action of Cotinine and its Distinctive Effects from Nicotine |journal=Neurochemical Research |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=2032–46 |date=October 2015 |pmid=24970109 |doi=10.1007/s11064-014-1359-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crooks PA, Dwoskin LP |title=Contribution of CNS nicotine metabolites to the neuropharmacological effects of nicotine and tobacco smoking |journal=Biochemical Pharmacology |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=743–53 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9353128 |doi=10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00117-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">The '''Pneumatic school''' of [[medicine]] (''Pneumatics'', or ''Pneumatici'', {{lang-el|Πνευματικοί}}) was an ancient school of medicine in [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]]. They were founded in [[Rome]] by [[Athenaeus of Cilicia]], in the 1st century AD.

The [[Roman era]] was a time when the [[Methodic school]] had enjoyed its greatest reputation, from which the Pneumatic school differed principally in that, instead of the mixture of primitive [[atoms]], they adopted an active principle of immaterial nature, ''[[Pneuma (ancient medicine)|pneuma]]'', or spirit. This principle was the cause of [[health]] and [[disease]]. It is from [[Galen]] that we learn the doctrines of the founder of the Pneumatic school.

==Doctrines==
[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] had already laid the foundations of the doctrine of ''pneuma'', for which, Aristotle was the first to describe the ways in which the ''pneuma'' is introduced into the body and the sanguineous system. The [[Stoics]] developed the theory even more and applied it to the functions of the body. [[Erasistratus]] and his successors had made the ''pneuma'' act a great part in health and disease. Thus, the theory of the ''pneuma'' was not a new one. The Methodic school, however, appears to have done away with much of the theory. The Pneumatic school, in choosing to oppose the Methodic school, adopted a firmly established principle, and chose the ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' principle of the Stoics.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, ''De Differeat Puls.'', iii&lt;/ref&gt;

They thought that [[logic]] was indispensable to medicine, and Galen tells us that the Pneumatic school would rather have betrayed their country than renounce their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, ''De Differeat Puls.'', ii&lt;/ref&gt; Athenaeus had also adopted much of the doctrines of the [[Peripatetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen, ''De Semiae'', ii&lt;/ref&gt; and besides the doctrine of the ''pneuma'', he developed the theory of the [[classical elements|elements]] much more than the Methodic school had done. He recognised in the four elements the positive qualities (''poiotes'') of the animal body; but he often regarded them as real substances, and gave to the whole of them the name of ''Nature of Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, ''De Element.'', i&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Pneumatici attributed the majority of diseases to the ''pneuma'',&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Galen, ''Introd.''&lt;/ref&gt; they nevertheless paid attention to the mixture of the elements. The union of [[heat]] and [[moisture]] was the most suitable for the preservation of health. Heat and dryness give rise to acute diseases, cold and moisture produce [[phlegmatic]] affections, cold and dryness give rise to [[Melancholia|melancholy]]. Everything dries up and becomes cold at the approach of [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Galen, ''De Temperam.'', i.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Cross''' is the name of a [[demographic]] trend that occurred in [[Russia]]. Starting in 1988, birth rates among native Russians (as well as most other ethnic groups of the European part of the former [[Soviet Union]]) were declining, while from 1991 the death rates started climbing. 

In 1992, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, and continued to do so to a greater or lesser degree until 2013. When this trend is plotted on a line graph starting from the mid-1980s, the lines cross at 1992, hence the name.

Scientists have tried to connect the causative link between the two trends through the [[Alcoholism in Russia|catastrophic growth of alcohol consumption]] that took place in Russia since the end of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent deregulation of the Russia alcohol market.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Korotayev]] A., [[Khaltourina D.]] [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=376&amp;Itemid=1 Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective]. [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/book/russia-and-globalization-identity-security-and-society-era-change Russia and Globalization: Identity, Security, and Society in an Era of Change / Ed. by D. W. Blum. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008. P. 37-78.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been demonstrated that this is connected with the fact that post-Soviet Russia experiences one of the world's highest prevalence of alcohol-related problems, which contributes to high mortality rates in this region. Reduction in alcohol-related problems in Russia could have strong effects on mortality decline. [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] have analyzed the plausibility of application of general principles of alcohol policy to the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Khaltourina D. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=376&amp;Itemid=1 Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective]. [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/book/russia-and-globalization-identity-security-and-society-era-change ''Russia and Globalization: Identity, Security, and Society in an Era of Change'']. Ed. by D. W. Blum. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008. P. 37-78; Khaltourina, D. A., &amp; Korotayev, A. V. [http://ehp.sagepub.com/content/31/3/272.short 'Potential for alcohol policy to decrease the mortality crisis in Russia', Evaluation &amp; the Health Professions, vol. 31, no. 3, Sep 2008. pp. 272–281].&lt;/ref&gt;

They have shown that alcohol policy approaches could be implemented in the same ways as they have been in other countries. In addition, according to Korotayev, there should be special attention to decreasing distilled spirits consumption, illegal alcohol production, nonbeverage alcohol consumption, and enforcement of current governmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Khaltourina D. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=376&amp;Itemid=1 Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective]. [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/book/russia-and-globalization-identity-security-and-society-era-change ''Russia and Globalization: Identity, Security, and Society in an Era of Change'']. Ed. by D. W. Blum. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008. P. 37-78; Khaltourina, D. A., &amp; Korotayev, A. V. [http://ehp.sagepub.com/content/31/3/272.short 'Potential for alcohol policy to decrease the mortality crisis in Russia', Evaluation &amp; the Health Professions, vol. 31, no. 3, Sep 2008. pp. 272–281].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors explaining the Russian Cross include:

* Dramatically low fertility, especially around 2000, when it bottomed out at just above one child per woman, or half of replacement,
* A fall in births during the 1960s, which reduced the number of women of childbearing age in the 1990s,
* A very high birth rate between the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] (1920) and the beginning of Russia's involvement in [[World War II]] (1941), which produced a large cohort of now elderly people to die off during the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s, and
* A fairly sluggish birth rate between 1945 and 1990, which was for the most part at about replacement level, especially after the early 1960s.

The Russian Cross is not confined to Russia, as it has also happened in other countries, most commonly with the fall of the Soviet Union (as in Russia): [[Demographics of Belarus|Belarus]], [[Demographics of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Demographics of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Demographics of Latvia|Latvia]], [[Demographics of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Demographics of Romania|Romania]], [[Demographics of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], [[Khaltourina D.]] [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=376&amp;Itemid=1 Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective]. [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/book/russia-and-globalization-identity-security-and-society-era-change ''Russia and Globalization: Identity, Security, and Society in an Era of Change'']. Ed. by D. W. Blum. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008. P. 37-78; Khaltourina, D. A., &amp; Korotayev, A. V. [http://ehp.sagepub.com/content/31/3/272.short 'Potential for alcohol policy to decrease the mortality crisis in Russia', Evaluation &amp; the Health Professions, vol. 31, no. 3, Sep 2008. pp. 272–281].&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]] fell into a negative natural increase in the 1970s, [[Demographics of Hungary|Hungary]] in the 1980s, and [[Demographics of Japan|Japan]] in the 2000s. (Source: the Wikipedia articles for each country's demographics include vital statistics from which crosses may be ascertained.) This is often worsened by high emigration rates wherein the countries' young populations leave for other countries with stronger economies, such as from Eastern to Western Europe due to free movement within the European Union, or more recently in [[Demographics of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], whose residents have free access to the United States mainland.

'''Safe sex''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] using methods or devices (such as [[condoms]]) to reduce the risk of transmitting or acquiring [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs), especially [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/safesex?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary], Oxford University Press, 2009, Accessed 23 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "Safe sex" is also sometimes referred to as '''safer sex''' or '''protected sex''' to indicate that some safe sex practices do not completely eliminate STI risks. It is also sometimes used to describe methods aimed at preventing pregnancy.

The concept of safe sex emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global [[AIDS epidemic]]. Promoting safe sex is now one of the aims of [[sex education]] and STI prevention, especially reducing new HIV infections. Safe sex is regarded as a [[harm reduction]] strategy aimed at reducing risks of STI transmission.&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;{{cite web| title = Global strategy for the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections: 2006–2015.

Although some safe sex practices (like condoms) can also be used as [[birth control]] (contraception), most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs. Likewise, some safe sex practices, like partner selection and low-risk sex behavior, may not be effective forms of contraception.

==History==
{{Citations missing|section|date=March 2018}}
Although strategies for avoiding STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea have existed for centuries and the term 'safe sex' existed in English as early as the 1930s, the use of the term to refer to STI-risk reduction dates to the mid-1980s in the United States. It emerged in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephey |first1=M. J. |title=A Brief History of Safe Sex |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1866044,00.html |website=TIME Magazine |accessdate=14 September 2018 |language=English |date=11 December 2008 |quote=In the 1540s, an Italian doctor named Gabriele Fallopius — the same man who discovered and subsequently named the Fallopian tubes of the female anatomy — wrote about syphilis, advocating the use of layered linen during intercourse for more "adventurous" (read: promiscuous) men. Legendary lover Casanova wrote about his pitfalls with medieval condoms made of dried sheep gut, referring to them as "dead skins" in his memoir. Even so, condoms made of animal intestine — known as "French letters" in England and la capote anglaise (English riding coats) in France — remained popular for centuries, though always expensive and never easy to obtain, meaning the devices were often reused.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Safe sex |url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/309375.html |website=The Phrase Finder |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year before the HIV virus was isolated and named, the San Francisco chapter of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence published a small pamphlet titled ''Play Fair!'' out of concern over widespread STIs among the city's gay male population. It specifically named illnesses (Kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia) that would later be understood as symptoms of advanced HIV disease (or [[AIDS]]). The pamphlet advocated a range of safe-sex practices, including abstinence, condoms, personal hygiene, use of personal lubricants, and STI testing/treatment. It took a casual, sex-positive approach while also emphasizing personal and social responsibility. In May 1983--the same month HIV was isolated and named in France--the New York City-based HIV/AIDS activists Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen published similar advice in their booklet, ''[[How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach]]''. Neither publication used the term "safe sex" but both included recommendations that are now standard advice for reducing STI (including HIV) risks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Joseph |first1=Sonnabend |title=How to have sex in an epidemic: 30th anniversary |url=https://www.poz.com/blog/how-to-have-sex-in-a |website=POZ |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herson |first1=Michael |title=The history and challenge of HIV prevention |journal=The Lancet |date=2008 |volume=372 |issue=9637 |pages=475-488 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60884-3 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)60884-3 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz 2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berkowitz |first1=Richard |title=Stayin' Alive: The Invention of Safe Sex |date=2003 |publisher=WestView |location=Boulder, CO |isbn=9780813340920|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safe sex as a form of STI risk reduction appeared in journalism as early as 1984, in the British publication 'The Intelligencer': ""The goal is to reach about 50 million people with messages about safe sex and AIDS education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Safe sex |url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/309375.html |website=The Phrase Finder |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''safe sex'' is used by individuals to refer to protection against both [[pregnancy]] and HIV/AIDS or other STI transmissions, the term was born in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is believed that the term ''safe sex'' was used in the professional literature in 1984, in the content of a paper on the psychological effect that HIV/AIDS may have on [[homosexual]] men. The term was related with the need to develop educational programs for the group considered at risk, homosexual men.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} 

A year later, the same term appeared in an article in ''[[The New York Times]].'' This article emphasized that most specialists advised their AIDS patients to practice safe sex. The concept included limiting the number of sexual partners, using prophylactics, avoiding bodily fluid exchange, and resisting the use of [[drug]]s that reduced inhibitions for high-risk sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/cjhp/4/1/109-118-moskowitz.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812073450/http://www.csuchico.edu/cjhp/4/1/109-118-moskowitz.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 August 2006|title=How Do Californians Define Safe Sex?|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 1985, the first safe sex guidelines were established by the 'Coalition for Sexual Responsibilities'.{{Who|date=August 2010}} According to these guidelines, safe sex was practiced by using [[condom]]s also when engaging in [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Although the term ''safe sex'' was primarily used in reference to the sexual activity of homosexual men, in 1986 the concept was spread to the general population. Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner's sexual history and limiting the number of [[sexual partner]]s. The first book on this subject appeared in the same year. The book was entitled "Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS", it had 88 pages and it described both positive and negative approaches to sexual life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sexual behavior could be either safe ([[kiss]]ing, [[hug]]ging, [[massage]], [[Non-penetrative sex|body-to-body rubbing]], [[mutual masturbation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[phone sex]], and use of separate [[sex toy]]s); possibly safe (use of condoms); and unsafe.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

In 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for [[TV commercials]] featuring condoms. During the same year, the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States issued their own "safer sex" guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the [[Holy See|Vatican]] urged [[chastity]] and [[heterosexual]] marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops' guidelines.

A study carried out in 2006 by Californian specialists showed that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects) and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects).&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

The term ''safer sex'' in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The term ''safe sex'' is still in common use in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} 

"Safer sex" is thought to be a more aggressive term which may make it more obvious to individuals that any type of sexual activity carries a certain degree of [[risk]].

The term ''safe love'' has also been used, notably by the French [[Sidaction]] in the promotion of men's underpants incorporating a condom pocket and including the red ribbon symbol in the design, which were sold to support the charity.

==Practices==
[[Image:Kunisada surimono.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[Shunga (art)|shunga]]'' print by [[Kunisada]] depicting female mutual or partnered masturbation.]]
A range of safe-sex practices are commonly recommended by sexual health educators and public health agencies. Many of these practices can reduce (but not completely eliminate risk of transmitting or acquiring STIs.

===Phone sex/cybersex/sexting===
Sexual activities, such as [[phone sex]], [[cybersex]], and [[sexting]], that do not include direct contact with the skin or bodily fluids of sexual partners, carry no STI risks and, thus, are forms of safe sex.&lt;ref name=plannedparenthood&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex/safer-sex-4263.htm | title = Safer Sex ("Safe Sex") | accessdate = 23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-penetrative sex===
[[Image:PeterJohannNepomukGeigerEroticWatercolor04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Watercolor]] of [[Handjob|manual stimulation]] of the penis, [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]], 1840.]]
{{Main article|Non-penetrative sex}}
A range of sex acts called "non-penetrative sex" or "outercourse" can significantly reduce STI risks. Non-penetrative sex includes practices such as kissing, mutual masturbation, rubbing or stroking.&lt;ref name="LaRosa"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Judith LaRosa, Helaine Bader, Susan Garfield| title = New Dimensions In Women's Health| publisher =[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]]|year = 2009|page=91|accessdate = August 31, 2013| isbn = 0763765929 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=2X03PXd4JSoC&amp;pg=PA91|quote=Outercourse is the sharing of sexual intimacy with behaviors such as kissing, petting, and mutual masturbation.

However, non-penetrative sex may not protect against infections that can be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact, such as [[herpes]] and [[HPV|human papilloma virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases)|url=http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/sexually_transmitted_infections.html|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual or partnered masturbation carries some STI risk, especially if there is skin contact or shared bodily fluids with sexual partners, although the risks are significantly lower than many other sexual activities.&lt;ref name=plannedparenthood&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex/safer-sex-4263.htm | title = Safer Sex ("Safe Sex") | accessdate = 23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condoms, dental dams, gloves===
Barriers, such as condoms, dental dams, and medical gloves can prevent contact with body fluids (such as [[blood]], [[vaginal fluid]], [[semen]], rectal mucus), and other means of transmitting STIs (like skin, hair and shared objects) during sexual activity.

[[File:How To Put on a Condom graphic.png|thumb|How to put on an external condom]]
*External [[condom]]s can be used to cover the penis, hands, fingers, or other body parts during sexual penetration or stimulation.&lt;ref name="Corinna" /&gt; They are most frequently made of [[latex]], and can also be made out of synthetic materials including [[polyurethane]] and [[polyisoprene]].
*Internal condoms (also called [[female condom]]s) are inserted into the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] prior to sexual penetration. These condoms are made of either [[polyurethane]] or [[nitrile]]. If external and internal condoms are used at the same time, they may break due to friction between the materials during sexual activity.
*A [[dental dam]] (originally used in dentistry) is a sheet of latex used for protection when engaging in [[oral sex]]. It is typically used as a barrier between the mouth and the [[vulva]] during [[cunnilingus]] or between the mouth and the anus during [[anal–oral sex]].
*[[Medical glove]]s made out of latex, vinyl, [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]], or polyurethane may be used as a makeshift dental dam during oral sex, or can cover hands, fingers, or other body parts during penetration or sexual stimulation, such as [[masturbation]]. &lt;ref name="Corinna"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corinna |first1=Heather |title=S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-to-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties |date=2016 |publisher=Da Capo Lifelong Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0738218847 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moon |first1=Allison |title=Girl Sex 101 |date=2018 |publisher=Lunatic Ink |isbn=978-0983830900 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Condoms, dental dams, and gloves can also be used to cover [[sex toys]] such as [[dildo]]s during sexual stimulation or penetration.&lt;ref name="Corinna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon" /&gt; If a sex toy is to be used in more than one orifice or partner, a condom/dental dam/glove can be used over it and changed when the toy is moved.

Oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubrication]] can break down the structure of latex condoms, dental dams or gloves, reducing their effectiveness for STI protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corinna |first1=Heather |title=S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-to-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties |date=2016 |publisher=Da Capo Lifelong Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0738218847 |page=294 |edition=second |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While use of external condoms can reduce STI risks during sexual activity, they are not 100% effective. One study has suggested condoms might reduce HIV transmission by 85% to 95%; effectiveness beyond 95% was deemed unlikely because of slippage, breakage, and incorrect use.&lt;ref name="Varghese"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varghese |first1=B |last2=Maher |first2=JE |last3=Peterman |first3=TA |last4=Branson |first4=BM |last5=Steketee |first5=RW | year = 2002 | title = Reducing the risk of sexual HIV transmission: quantifying the per-act risk for HIV on the basis of choice of partner, sex act, and condom use | url = http://ww2.aegis.org/files/AskDoc_refs/varghese2002-29-1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–43 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-200201000-00007 | pmid = 11773877 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224853/http://ww2.aegis.org/files/AskDoc_refs/varghese2002-29-1.pdf | archivedate = 24 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said, "In practice, inconsistent use may reduce the overall effectiveness of condoms to as low as 60–70%".&lt;ref name="Varghese"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/sup&gt;

===Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)===
{{Main article|Pre-exposure prophylaxis}}
[[Pre-exposure prophylaxis]] (often abbreviated as ''PrEP'') is the use of prescription drugs by those who do not have HIV to prevent HIV infection. PrEP drugs are taken ''prior'' to HIV exposure to prevent the transmission of the virus, usually between sexual partners. PrEP drugs do not prevent other STI infections or pregnancy.

As of 2018, the most-widely approved form of ''PrEP'' combines two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) in one pill. That drug combination is sold under the brand name Truvada by Gilead Sciences. It is also sold in generic formulations worldwide. Other drugs are also being studied for use as PrEP. 

Different countries have approved different protocols for using the tenofovir/emtricitabine-combination drug as ''PrEP''. That two-drug combination has been shown to prevent HIV infection in different populations when taken daily, intermittently, and on demand. Numerous studies have found the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination to be over 90% effective at preventing HIV transmission between sexual partners. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/ |title=Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) |date=19 September 2016 |website= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment as prevention ===
{{Main article|Treatment as prevention}}
Treatment as Prevention (often abbreviated as ''TasP'') is the practice of testing for and treating HIV infection as a way to prevent further spread of the virus. Those having knowledge of their HIV-positive status can use safe-sex practices to protect themselves and their partners (such as using condoms, sero-sorting partners, or choosing less-risky sexual activities). And, because HIV-positive people with durably suppressed or undetectable amounts of HIV in their blood ''cannot transmit HIV to sexual partners'', sexual activity with HIV-positive partners on effective treatment is a form of safe sex (to prevent HIV infection). This fact has given rise to the concept of "U=U" ("Undetectable = Untransmittable"). &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.preventionaccess.org/ |title=U=U|date=2017|website= |publisher=Prevention Access Campaign|access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of safe sex===
Other methods proven effective at reducing STI risks during sexual activity are:
* [[Immunization]] against certain sexually-transmitted viruses. The most common vaccines protect against [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B]] and [[HPV vaccine|Human papilloma virus (HPV)]], which can cause [[cervical cancer]], [[penile cancer]], [[oral cancer]], and [[genital warts]]. Immunization before initiation of sexual activity increases effectiveness of these vaccines.
* Limiting numbers of sexual partners, particularly casual sexual partners, or restricting sexual activity to those who know and share their STI status, can also reduce STI risks. [[Monogamy]] or [[polyfidelity]], practiced faithfully, is very safe (as far as STIs are concerned) when all partners are non-infected. However, many monogamous people have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases by partners who are [[Adultery|sexually unfaithful]], have used injection drugs, or were infected by previous sexual partners. The same risks apply to polyfidelitous people, who face higher risks depending on how many people are in the polyfidelitous group.
* [[Communication]] with sexual partners about sexual history and STI status, preferred safe sex practices, and acceptable risks for partnered sexual activities.
* Engaging in less-risky sexual activities. In general, solo sexual activities are less risky than partnered activities. Sexual penetration of orifices (mouth, vagina, anus) and sharing body fluids (such as semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and rectal mucus) between sexual partners carry the most risk for STIs. 
* Regular STI testing and treatment, especially by those who are sexually active with more than one casual sexual partner.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kahn | first = J.

==Ineffective methods==
===General===
Most methods of contraception are not effective at preventing the spread of [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]]s. This includes [[birth control pills]], [[vasectomy]], [[tubal ligation]], [[Fertility awareness|periodic abstinence]], [[IUD]]s and many non-barrier methods of pregnancy prevention. However, condoms are highly effective for birth control and STI prevention.

The [[spermicide]] [[Nonoxynol-9]] has been claimed to reduce the likelihood of STI transmission. However, a technical report&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/68510/1/WHO_RHR_03.08.pdf|title=Technical Consultation on Nonoxynol-9|last=|first=|date=October 2001|website=WHO|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[World Health Organization]]  has shown that Nonoxynol-9 is an irritant and can produce tiny tears in mucous membranes, which may increase the risk of transmission by offering [[pathogen]]s more easy points of entry into the system. They reported that Nonoxynol-9 lubricant do not have enough spermicide to increase contraceptive effectiveness cautioned they should not be promoted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] or [[contraceptive sponge]] provides some women with better protection against certain sexually transmitted diseases,&lt;ref name="TechInd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n19_v141/ai_12248743/ |title=Diaphragm and sponge protect against STDs - sexually transmitted diseases |accessdate=5 April 2010 |work=Science News |first=Kathy A. |last=Fackelmann |year=1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404015828/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n19_v141/ai_12248743/ |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not effective for all STIs.

Hormonal methods of preventing pregnancy (such as oral contraceptives [i.e. 'The pill'], depoprogesterone, hormonal IUDs, the vaginal ring, and the patch) offer no protection against STIs. The copper intrauterine device and the hormonal intrauterine device provide an up to 99% protection against pregnancies but no protection against STIs. Women with copper intrauterine device ''may'' be subject to greater risk of infection from bacterial infectious such as [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], although this is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubacher|first=David|date=November 2014|title=Intrauterine devices &amp; infection: Review of the literature |journal=The Indian Journal of Medical Research|volume=140|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S53–S57|pmc=4345753|pmid=25673543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coitus interruptus]] (or "pulling out"), in which the penis is removed from the vagina, [[anus]], or [[mouth]] before [[ejaculation]], may reduce transmission of STIs but still carries significant risk. This is because [[pre-ejaculate]], a fluid that oozes from the penile [[urethra]] before ejaculation, may contain STI pathogens. Additionally, the microbes responsible for some diseases, including [[genital wart]]s and [[syphilis]], can be transmitted through skin-to-skin or mucous membrane contact.

===Anal sex===
Unprotected [[anal sex|anal penetration]] is considered a high-risk sexual activity because the thin tissues of the anus and [[rectum]] can be easily damaged.&lt;ref name="Dean and Delvin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anal sex|first= John |last=Dean |first2=David |last2=Delvin|publisher=Netdoctor.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2010| url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sexandrelationships/analsex.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voeller B.

This includes penetration of the anus by fingers, hands, or sex [[Sex toy|toys]] such as [[dildo]]s. Also, condoms may be more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex, increasing the risk of STI transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Can I get HIV from anal sex? | url = http://aids.about.com/od/technicalquestions/f/oral.htm | accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main risk which individuals are exposed to when performing anal sex is the transmission of [[HIV]]. Other possible infections include [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis B|B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]]; [[Intestinal parasite infection|intestinal parasite infections]] like ''[[Giardia]]''; and bacterial infections such as ''[[Escherichia coli]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/analsex.html|title=Anal Sex|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anal sex should be avoided by couples in which one of the partners has been diagnosed with an STI until the treatment has proven to be effective.

In order to make anal sex safer, the couple must ensure that the anal area is clean and the bowel empty and the partner on whom anal penetration occurs should be able to relax.  Regardless of whether anal penetration occurs by using a finger or the penis, the condom is the best barrier method to prevent transmission of STI. [[Enema|Enemas]] should be not be used as they can increase the risk of HIV infection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carballo-Diéguez|first=Alex|last2=Bauermeister|first2=José A.|last3=Ventuneac|first3=Ana|last4=Dolezal|first4=Curtis|last5=Balan|first5=Ivan|last6=Remien|first6=Robert H.|date=2008-11-01|title=The Use of Rectal Douches among HIV-uninfected and Infected Men who Have Unprotected Receptive Anal Intercourse: Implications for Rectal Microbicides|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-007-9301-0|journal=AIDS and Behavior|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=860–866|doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9301-0|issn=1090-7165|pmc=2953367}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lymphogranuloma venereum]] [[proctitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Vries|first=Henry J.

Since the rectum can be easily damaged, the use of lubricants is highly recommended even when penetration occurs by using the finger. Especially for beginners, using a condom on the finger is both a protection measure against STI and a lubricant source. Most condoms are lubricated and they allow less painful and easier penetration.  Oil-based lubricants damage latex and should not be used with condoms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner |first1=M. |last2=Piedrahita |first2=C. |last3=Glover |first3=L. |last4=Joanis |first4=C. |last5=Spruyt |first5=A. |last6=Foldesy |first6=R. | year = 1993 | title = The impact of lubricants on latex condoms during vaginal intercourse | url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA620.pdf| journal = International Journal of STD and AIDS | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1177/095646249400500108}}&lt;/ref&gt; water-based and silicone-based [[lubricant]]s are available instead.

Anal stimulation with a sex toy requires similar safety measures to anal penetration with a penis, in this case using a condom on the sex toy in a similar way.

It is important that the man washes and cleans his penis after anal intercourse if he intends to penetrate the vagina. Bacteria from the rectum are easily transferred to the vagina, which may cause [[Vaginal infection|vaginal]] and [[Urinary tract infection|urinary tract infections]].&lt;ref name="SHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/anal_sex.htm#aidsanal |title=Anal Sex  - Facts and Safe Sex Information |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404055257/http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/anal_sex.htm#aidsanal |archive-date=4 April 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When anal-oral contact occurs, protection is required since this is a [[risky sexual behavior]] in which illnesses as Hepatitis A or STIs can be easily transmitted, as well as enteric infections. The dental dam or the plastic wrap&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225855360|title=HIVAIDS care &amp; counselling : a multidisciplinary approach|last=Van Dyk |first=Alta C. | date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education South Africa|isbn=9781770251717|edition=4th|location=Cape Town|oclc=225855360|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; are effective protection means whenever anilingus is performed.

==Sex toys==
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|right|thumb|Two [[butt plugs|sex toys intended for anal use]] (note the flared bases)]]
Putting a condom on a [[sex toy]] provides better sexual hygiene and can help to prevent transmission of infections if the sex toy is shared, provided the condom is replaced when used by a different partner. Some sex toys are made of porous materials, and pores retain viruses and bacteria, which makes it necessary to clean sex toys thoroughly, preferably with use of cleaners specifically for sex toys. Glass is non-porous and medical grade glass sex toys more easily sterilized between uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation|work=Kinsey Confidential|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases in which one of the partners is treated for an STI, it is recommended that the couple not use sex toys until the treatment has proved to be effective.

All sex toys have to be properly cleaned after use. The way in which a sex toy is cleaned varies on the type of material it is made of. Some sex toys can be boiled or cleaned in a dishwasher. Most of the sex toys come with advice on the best way to clean and store them and these instructions should be carefully followed.&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1690.aspx?CategoryID=118&amp;SubCategoryID=122 |title=Are sex toys safe? |accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sex toy should be cleaned not only when it is shared with other individuals but also when it is used on different parts of the body (such as mouth, vagina or anus).

A sex toy should regularly be checked for scratches or breaks that can be breeding ground for [[bacteria]]. It is best if the damaged sex toy is replaced by a new undamaged one. Even more [[hygiene]] protection should be considered by pregnant women when using sex toys. Sharing any type of sex toy that may draw [[blood]], like whips or needles, is not recommended, and is not safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1690.aspx?categoryid=118&amp;subcategoryid=122|title=Are sex toys safe? - Health questions - NHS Choices|first=N. H. S.|last=Choices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys "...can easily get lost" as "rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon"; to prevent this serious problem, sex toy users are advised to use sex "...toys with a flared base or a string".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/|title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety|first=Regina|last=Nuzzo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstinence==
[[Sexual abstinence]] reduces STIs and pregnancy risks associated with [[Human sexual activity|sexual contact]], but STIs may also be transmitted through non-sexual means, or by [[rape]]. HIV may be transmitted through contaminated needles used in [[tattoo]]ing, [[body piercing]], or [[Injection (medicine)|injections]]. Medical or dental procedures using contaminated instruments can also spread HIV, while some health-care workers have acquired HIV through occupational exposure to accidental injuries with needles.&lt;!--

{{Nihongo|'''Seirogan'''|'''正露丸''' formerly 征露丸}} is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] marketed in Japan, sold as a treatment of the digestive tract (especially as an [[antidiarrhoeal]]), whose main active ingredient is "wood creosote" (also '''[[Creosote#Wood-tar creosote|wood-tar creosote]]''', or beechwood creosote.&lt;ref name=ahmad&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ahmad|first= Iqbal|last2=Aqil|first2=Farrukh|last3=Owais|first3=Mohammad|title=Modern Phytomedicine: Turning Medicinal Plants Into Drugs|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2007 |page=265 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnaXlZjGc1YC&amp;pg=PA265 |isbn=9783527609536}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The name is nominally a registered trademark of '''{{Nihongo|{{Interlanguage link multi|Taiko Pharmaceutical|ja|3=大幸薬品|vertical-align=sup}}|大幸薬品|''Taikō Yakuhin''}}''' based in [[Suita, Osaka]] which is still the major market-share holder, but the enforceability of the tradename has been voided by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], which ruled ''seirogan'' to be a common generic name. The ruling only recognizes proprietary use of the bugle logo by Taiko,&lt;ref name=nishioka&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishioka|2010}}, pp. 131-; discusses bugle as only recognized trademark; mentions a site that collected 26 different similar looking seirogan brand boxes; on p. 134 is a gallery of 20 different such boxes.&lt;/ref&gt; but not protection of its characteristic packaging. As a result, dozens of extremely similar packaged drugs are being manufactured and sold in the market.&lt;ref name=nishioka/&gt;

== Overview ==
Seirogan is a general-use medicine, mainly to treat the gastro-intestinal system. It contains wood-tar creosote ([[:ja:木クレオソート|木クレオソート]]) as its main active ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |author1=Matsumoto (松本有右)|author2=渡辺謹三,三溝和男|title=正露丸に次ぐ成長の柱「クレベリン」で世界を目指す大幸薬品の勝算|work=Inside Enterprise; Shukan Diamond (online) |publisher=秀和システム |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGwO3Qjd3VYC&amp;pg=PA166 |page=166 |isbn=9784798030708}}.. 整腸薬・下痢止めの成分比較表&lt;/ref&gt; That ingredient in the West may otherwise go by such names as "wood creosote", "beechwood creosote", or "liquid pitch oil", and should be distinguished from industrial "coal-tar creosote". To emphasize the distinction, wood creosote in Japan is sometimes called by such names as {{Nihongo|Nikkyokuhō kureosōto|日局方クレオソート|"Japanese Pharmacopoeia creosote"}} and minor variants thereof.

The wood creosote is blended with two or more {{Nihongo|[[crude medicine]]s|生薬|''shōyaku''}} recognized in {{Nihongo|[[Chinese materia medica]]|漢方薬|''kanpōyaku''}} for their antiseptic and other effects, but the additional ingredients used are different among manufacturers (See under [[#Chemical composition]] for a sampling of formulas). Some quarters (perhaps [[kanpō]] medicine practitioners and others) insist however that "Seirogan is not strictly speaking [[Kampo|kanpō]] medicine", and this point was emphatically printed in a retraction by a certain consumer-watch type book that criticized seirogan but had confused wood creosote with the industrial type&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|author=|title=Re: 週刊金曜日『買ってはいけない』特集より（８月２０日号）【正露丸、ラウンドアップ、マクドナルドハンバーガー】その３|url=http://www.asyura2.com/sora/bd3/msg/623.html|work=★阿修羅♪　Ψ空耳の丘Ψ３ |date=19 September 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040319022641/http://www.asyura2.com/sora/bd3/msg/623.html |archivedate=2004-03-19 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}. The retraction was in the magazine ''Shūkan Kin'yōbi'' issue 8/20/1999, special on ''Katte wa ikenai''; excerpt:"正露丸を「漢方薬」としましたが、漢方薬の成分である生薬は使われているものの、厳密には「漢方薬」ではありません。...  正露丸に使われているクレオソートはコールタールを原料とする日本工業規格クレオソート油ではなく、プナの木などから得られる乾留物を精製・蒸留して作る日本薬局方クレオソートでした。...(「回答企業にお応えします」より)&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[#Misinformed drug risk accusation controversy|#accusation controversy]]).

In the classic form, it is a dark brown round [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]], but in order to mask its distinctive mediciny odor and bitterness, sugar-coated [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] forms have become available as well.

===Trademark===
The Seirogan (正露丸) name was filed for trademark registration by Taiko Pharmaceutical in 1954,&lt;ref name=horitsujiho&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Suehiro|first1=Izutarō|author2=Suehiro Kenkyūjo|journal=Hōritsu jihō|publisher=Nihon Hyōronsha|year=1974|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9hQAQAAIAAJ |quote=判決によると「正露丸」の名で丸薬を指定商品として商品登録していたのは大阪府吹田市内本町、大幸薬品。二十九年に特許庁で認められたため「正露丸」を製造していた約三十社は「正露丸」の名前を使えなくなった。これに対し大阪府和泉市芦部町、和泉薬品工業.. |title=Hōritsu jihō |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but approximately thirty competitors&lt;ref name=horitsujiho/&gt; such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou Co., Ltd.|ja|3=和泉薬品工業株式会社|vertical-align=sup}} objected, leading to a lengthy battle, petitioning the Patent Office, then later litigating in court. The [[Tokyo District Court]] rejected Taiko's claim to proprietary use of the Seirogan name, and the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] upheld that decision&lt;ref name=nishioka/&gt; in 1974. The Supreme Court delivered the opinion that the name seirogan had passed into a common noun, so that use of the Seirogan (正露丸) name by any company was valid, not answerable to the claims of this trademark, and did not constitute an infringement of any intellectually property rights thereof. The court also did not recognize Taiko Pharmaceutical's exclusive right to use the distinctive color scheme and graphic design on the packaged box (and sticker label on the pill bottle), with the exception of the product logo depicting a bugle. (Cf. [[#Taiko's trademark registration and Izumi's lawsuit to revoke trademark]]).&lt;ref name=nishioka/&gt;

As a consequence, there are currently numerous Seirogan products in the market that feature logos other than the bugle but otherwise look remarkably similar:&lt;ref name=nishioka/&gt; Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou ([[calabash]] logo), {{Interlanguage link multi|Kyokuto Co., Ltd.|ja|3=キョクトウ株式会社|vertical-align=sup}} (triangle and bear logo, nicknamed ''Yūtan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kyokuto|title=ゆうたんマークのご紹介|work=Kyokuto website |url=http://www.kyokuto21.com/kyokuto21_01-1.html |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425223138/http://www.kyokuto21.com/kyokuto21_01-1.html |archivedate=2008-04-25 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}, says the mascot name Yūtan is a pun on {{Nihongo|''yūtan''|熊胆|"bear's gall bladder"}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The retailer/drug store chain {{Interlanguage link multi|Fujiyakuhin Co., Ltd.|ja|3=富士薬品|vertical-align=sup}} and wholesaler {{Interlanguage link multi|Fujiyakuhin Co., Ltd.|ja|3=常盤薬品|vertical-align=sup}} also market their own brands.

In 2005, Taiko filed a lawsuit against a competitor, demanding suppression of what it considered copycat merchandise, but again lost the case in court, and the Supreme Court rejected the appeal in 2008 (Cf. [[#Taiko's petition for an injunction against unfair competitive practices]]).

The bugle tune being played in Taiko's commercials for the product is the ex-[[Japanese Imperial Army]] bugle call to announce mealtime, colloquially known as the {{Nihongo|''Shokuji rappa''|食事ラッパ|"Chowtime bugle"}}. The tune used currently by the [[Self Defense Force]] is of a different [[melody]].

==Medical aspects==

=== Uses and effects ===
Seirogan is touted to be effective in the following: 
# Treating and allaying [[stomach aches]], [[diarrhea]], diarrhea due to [[digestion|digestive]] disorders, food poisoning, vomiting, water contamination ([[Montezuma's revenge]]), runny bowels warning of diarrhea, soft stool.
# Regulating [[stomach]] and [[intestines]] condition.

== History ==
[[File:Seirogan advertisement in 1930s.jpg|thumb|250px|Advertisement for Seirogan, 1930s]]
There are several contending theories regarding the origins of the drug, and several names crop up as its inventor.

The [[Japanese Imperial Army]], which experienced considerable setbacks due to unclean water sources during the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] at the end of the 19th century, was working on solutions to combat [[infectious diseases]]. Surgeon-major {{Nihongo|Michitomo Tozuka|戸塚機知}}, an instructor at the Military Medical College, discovered in 1903 that creosote agent was an effective suppressant for the [[typhoid fever]] pathogen. Taiko Pharmaceutical claims the Osaka-based medicine merchant {{Nihongo|Saichi Nakajima|中島佐一}} developed the {{Nihongo|Chūyū Seirogan|忠勇征露丸}} a year earlier in 1902 and initiated sales, which business was eventually handed over to Taiko.

The higher echelons of the Army Medical Corps, including writer [[Mori Ōgai]], favored the German view that [[beriberi]], a disease that caused an even heavier death toll than typhoid, was caused by an undiscovered transmittable pathogens (in contrast, British-trained doctors in the navy correctly saw it as a nutritional disorder). Prompted by their misguided view, the army distributed vast quantities of Seirogan (with their proven antiseptic properties) among the troops to be administered daily throughout the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-5. In an army medical journal of 1901 there is mention of the pill as {{Nihongo|Kureosōto gan|クレオソート丸}}, but in the journals of 1904-5 appears the name {{Nihongo|Seirogan|征露丸 "Conquer Russia pills"}}.&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gold|first=Hal|title=Unit 731: Testimony|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cprBEpxvexgC&amp;pg=PA21|isbn=9780804835657}}, p.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; The name Seirogan was widely used as the academic term by army doctors for about a 4-year span.

But this was in the days when drug use as preventive medicine was not a widely embraced concept, and soldiers resisted swallowing this weird-smelling and unfamiliar pill, even when so instructed.  The top brass decided to invoke the name of [[Emperor Meiji]], telling the men that taking the pill was "according to the wishes of His Imperial Majesty".&lt;ref name=gold/&gt; This subterfuge reportedly greatly improved the soldiers' [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] towards taking the pill, making them less prone to be forced out of action due to stomach aches or diarrhea. The army doctors were however disappointed to find that the pill did not show any of the desired combative effect towards the (non-existent) beriberi microbe. The army insisted on feeding their men pure white rice to boost morale, but that led to vitamin-deficient diet, so that one in three men serving the Russo-Japanese War were afflicted by beriberi, and 27,800 succumbed to it. Meanwhile, the Japanese navy deduced early on that beriberi was a nutritional disorder, and added breads and {{Nihongo|mugimeshi|麦飯}} (wheat or wheat-rice mixture steam-cooked like rice) to their rations, so that none of their servicemen fell ill with beriberi.

While Seirogan proved powerless against beriberi, the [[antidiarrheal]] and toothache-soothing properties of the pill were passed on, in somewhat exaggerated fashion, by repatriated war veterans. Amid the mood of victory in war, Seirogan's name became "the cure-all that defeated Russia" and many drug-makers rushed to manufacture the pill, which became a national medicine unique to Japan.

The reputation for the pill's effectiveness also spread within areas under Japanese control before the end of World War II, and Seirogan is said to be one of the popular items purchased by travelers from [[Taiwan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and other Asian countries.

The pill ceased to be part of regular military issue supplies in 1906, but the military continued to keep itself constantly supplied for use. In 2007, it was part of the supply kit issued to the [[Self Defense Force|SDF]] during the [[United Nations Mission in Nepal|UN Mission in Nepal]].

After the war with Russia, and again after World War II, [[administrative guidance]] was issued against the use of the kanji character {{Nihongo|征|Sei|"conquer"}} as being undesirable from the standpoint of international relations.  So in most cases, the written name of the pill was changed to {{Nihongo|正露丸|"right dew pill"}}. Taiko Pharmaceutical made the change in 1949.&lt;ref name=nagai&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Nagai|first=Sonoko (長井苑子)|last2=Izumi|first2=Takahide (泉孝英)|title=生きつづけるということ: 文学にみる病いと老い|volume=2|publisher=メディカルレビュー社|year=2009|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cpNAQAAIAAJ}}, quote:"「正露丸」は当初、一九〇二年、中島住一によつて「任露丸(露西亜を任伐するの意)」の商品名によつて製造発売されたが、一九四六年大幸薬品が製造発売するようになり、一九四九年「正露丸」と名称変更"&lt;/ref&gt; But one manufacturer {{Nihongo|Nihon Iyakuhin Seizō|日本医薬品製造}} still uses the old written form that reads "conquer".

== Intellectual property rights dispute ==

=== Taiko's trademark registration and Izumi's lawsuit to revoke trademark ===
In 1946,&lt;ref name=nagai/&gt; {{Interlanguage link multi|Taiko Pharmaceutical|ja|3=大幸薬品|vertical-align=sup}} the leading manufacturer of the pill, had obtained through formal negotiation with Saichi Nakajima the right to continue selling his "Chūyū Seirogan" pill. Accordingly, in 1954, Taiko made a claim for the exclusive use of the "Seirogan" name, and filed for trademark registration.

Other manufacturers of the seirogan-type pill objected to this move, led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou Co., Ltd.|ja|3=和泉薬品工業株式会社|vertical-align=sup}}, which had developed its own creosote formula, and had supplied the military with its seirogan throughout World War II despite supply shortages. The group petitioned the [[Japan Patent Office|Patent Office]] in April 1955 to revoke the trademark. It was not until April 1960, that the Patent Office handed down its decision to maintain the registered trademark. So the group filed a suit in the [[Tokyo High Court]], which in September 1971, ruled that "The seirongan is recognized by the nation's populace as a common name for bowels-regulating agents that use creosote as main ingredient, and [the court hereby] rules to void the Patent Office's decision to make it a proprietary trademark". This ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], thus finalizing the decision in March 1974.

However, the Seirogan registered trademark is still retained by Taiko Pharmaceutical (Trademark Registration No. 545984).  It is not clear why the registered trademark remains unexpunged despite the supreme court ruling, but a trademark registration does not vanish automatically, and needs to go through a Patent Office review process. The Patent Office may have surmised that the Court's ruling effectively accomplished the purpose or remedy sought by the petitioners, obviating the need for another review. The Court's opinion made it expressly clear that the name Seirogan had passed into a common noun, which meant that the trademark privileges (proprietary rights) upon it was not protected or enforceable pursuant to Japan's Trademark Act, Article 26, Paragaraph 2.

Thus companies other than Taiko are allowed to sell the drug under the "Seirogan" name, without this constituting an infringement of trademark. Taiko's attempted litigation in 2005-8 (described) also failed to establish its proprietary rights. But the Court's opinion curiously left open a leeway, allowing for possible future reversal depending on the shift in popular convention. Seirogan is one of few pharmaceutical drugs names thus given [[public domain]] status, [[aspirin]] being another immediately called to mind.

=== Taiko's petition for an injunction against unfair competitive practices ===
On November 24, 2005,&lt;ref name=braina&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|author=braina|title=大幸薬品、ひょうたんマーク「正露丸」販売の和泉薬品を提訴|publisher=知財情報局(Braina) |date=2005-11-26 |url=http://news.braina.com/2005/1126/judge_20051126_001____.html |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiko Pharmaceutical filed a suit against Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Osaka District Court|ja|3=大阪地方裁判所|vertical-align=sup}}, claiming the sales of merchandise with similar packaging constituted an act of unfair competitive practice under {{Interlanguage link multi|Unfair Competition Prevention Act (Japan)|ja|3=不正競争防止法|vertical-align=sup}} 2.1.1 or 2.1.2, and was an infringement of its trademark rights (docket number: Heisei 17 (wa）No. 11663).&lt;ref name=kizuna&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Wada|first=Narinori(和田　成則)|title=判例13 「正露丸」事件（有名商標の普通名称化）|publisher=Kizuna International Patent Office|year=2006|url=http://www.wada-pat.jp/hanrei/hanrei-13.htm |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2006,&lt;ref name=braina&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|author=braina|title=ラッパとひょうたんで識別可能、正露丸訴訟で大幸薬品の請求棄却|publisher=知財情報局(Braina)|date=2006-07-28 |url=http://news.braina.com/2006/0728/judge_20060728_001____.html |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Osaka District Court ruled against the plaintiff saying a distinction can be made between the bugle and calabash logos.&lt;ref name=kizuna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.go.jp/hanrei/pdf/20060731093511.pdf 平成１８年７月２７日判決言渡 平成１７年(ワ)第１１６６３号不正競争行為差止等請求事件] (text of the Osaka Court's opinion)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=47news/&gt; Taiko then appealed on August 7, but the [[Osaka High Court]] upheld the decision, and the Supreme Court's second {{Interlanguage link multi|Petty bench (Japan)|ja|3=小法廷|vertical-align=sup}}&lt;ref name=47news&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|author=Kyodo News (共同通信)|title=大幸薬品の敗訴確定　「正露丸」混同せず |url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200807/CN2008070401000727.html |work=47 News|date=2008-07-04 &lt;!-- 19:53 --&gt; |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejected against hearing the case on July 4, 2008,&lt;ref name=47news/&gt; which finalized Taiko's loss in this lawsuit.

But in the opinion read by the court contained this passage: "Whether a certain label is a common name or not is an issue pertaining to perception by users (commercial dealers and consumers at large), so even if a label has been regarded as a common name within a certain period, it may later come to be perceived as denoting a specific product as a matter of the ongoing real situation of its commerce, and it is not impossible for it to regain its {{Nihongo|source designator|出所表示機|''shussho hyōji kinō''}} (i.e., manufacturer specifying) purpose".

== Misinformed drug risk accusation controversy ==
{{Hatnote|This is a much abridged version of the write-up in the Japanese wiki article}}
The primary active ingredient used in seirogan is wood-tar creosote. This was listed merely as "creosote" in the first edition of the {{Nihongo|''[[Japanese Pharmacopoeia]]''|日本薬局方|''Nihon yakkyokuhō''|}}, a Ministry of Health issued guidebook, and remained so for a time, until it was listed more specifically as {{Nihongo|''moku-kureosōto''|[[:ja:木クレオソート|木クレオソート]]|"wood creosote"}} in the fifteenth revised first supplement dated 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Ministry of Health Bulletin No. 316, dated 9/28/2007&lt;/ref&gt; making this the official name.  In addition, "a long-term safety study in rats documented a lack of oncogenicity for wood creosote"&lt;ref&gt;Kuge T, Shibata T, Willett MS, Turck P, Traul KA. Lack of oncogenicity of wood creosote, the principal active ingredient of Seirogan, an herbal antidiarrheal medication, in Sprague-Dawley rats. Int J Toxicol 2001;20:297-305.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second supplement then defined the coal-derivative {{Nihongo|''kureosōto-yu''|[[:ja:クレオソート油|クレオソート油]]|"creosote oil"}} as a separate commodity (containing carcinogenic substances such as [[Benzo(a)pyrene]], a [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|US Dept. of Health and Human Services|1996}} notes a study by Weiner that found incidence of cancer highest in Toyama prefecture where a manufacturer of Seirogan was located, but cautions this cannot be ascertained to be a correlating factor. Besides, Toyama is not the prefecture where the major manufacturer is headquartered.&lt;/ref&gt;). The  wood-tar creosote is commonly called "Nikkyoku creosote" (i.e. Japanese pharmacopoeial creosote) as a means to distinguish from potentially harmful industrial creosote.

These recent naming conventions were prompted by a controversy set off by a consumer alert booklet, {{Nihongo|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Katte wa ikenai|ja|3=買ってはいけない|vertical-align=sup}}''|[[:ja:買ってはいけない|買ってはいけない]]||"Should not buy"}} (pub. 1999) that anthologized a series run in the magazine ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shūkan kin'yōbi|ja|3=週刊金曜日|vertical-align=sup}}''. The booklet accused ''seirogan'' of its dangers, based on the mistaken notion that the wood-tar creosote and the industrial creosote oil were identical commodities.

'''Southern Cross Healthcare Group''', a collection of independent, health-oriented businesses in [[New Zealand]], operates on [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] principles and is New Zealand’s largest non-public [[health care]] organisation. The Group’s businesses include [[health insurance]], private hospitals, travel insurance and pet insurance. The Group encompasses the '''Southern Cross Medical Care Society''' and the '''Southern Cross Health Trust''' and their respective subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southerncross.co.nz/sitecore/content/Southern%20Cross/home/group/about-us|title=About us  - Southern Cross NZ|website=www.southerncross.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
According to Peter A. Smith’s ''The Private Prescription'', which chronicles the history of Southern Cross, the group’s origins can be traced back to the 1950s when the New Zealand [[private healthcare]] sector became concerned that the government contribution towards hospital costs of those opting for private care  was not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southerncross.co.nz/group/about-us/early-history|title=Early history  - Southern Cross NZ|website=www.southerncross.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the New Zealand Private Hospitals’ Association, Dr Jefcoate Harbutt, began to make “serious inquiries about the formation of a New Zealand health insurance organisation”. Dr Harbutt, along with Auckland chartered accountant Don Carnachan and a group of Auckland surgeons led by Dr Warwick Macky, set about establishing the organisation that would eventually become Southern Cross Medical Care Society, which was officially founded in May 1961.

Throughout the 1960s, Southern Cross’ growth was modest, but during 1970s it grew rapidly, putting pressure on private hospitals for more beds, theatre facilities and improved equipment and care. The Society was often approached by private hospitals for loans or redevelopment projects, which prompted the directors to think about whether the Society should be in the private hospitals business or establish an arms-length entity.

In 1977 the directors decided to set up a separate Charitable Trust capable of managing and operating hospitals, which became the Southern Cross Hospital Trust (later renamed Southern Cross Health Trust).

== Southern Cross Medical Care Society ==
The Southern Cross Medical Care Society, trading as '''Southern Cross Health Society''', is a [[Friendly society|Friendly Society]] and New Zealand’s largest health insurer. The Health Society had 850,000 members as at 30 June 2017, according to its 2017 annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southerncross.co.nz/group/annual-reports|title=Southern Cross Health Society 2017 annual report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a 62% market share and more than 17% of New Zealand’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/population_clock.aspx|title=Population clock|language=en-nz|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Society funded more than NZ$830m of healthcare services in the year to 30 June 2017, including 240, 000 elective surgeries, or 73% of the country’s health insurance claims. In the 2017 financial year, for every $1 of premium income, 90 cents was returned to members in claims for healthcare treatment. The Health Society also offers life insurance and corporate wellness programmes.

To better manage the impact of rising claims on the premiums members pay and make the claims process more seamless for members, the Health Society launched the Affiliated Provider (AP) programme in 1998. It contracts surgeons, specialists and facilities to provide members with certain procedures at agreed prices. The Society had more than 1850 Affiliated Providers across 20 specialties in 2017.

== Southern Cross Health Trust ==
The Southern Cross Health Trust is a Charitable Trust and owns: 
* Southern Cross Hospitals Limited
* Southern Cross Benefits Limited (trading as Southern Cross Travel Insurance and Southern Cross Pet Insurance)
Southern Cross Hospitals, established in 1979, is New Zealand’s largest private hospital network, with 19 wholly owned and joint-venture facilities that provided private healthcare services to 78,000 patients in the year to June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southerncross.co.nz/group/annual-reports|title=Southern Cross Health Trust 2017 annual report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes insurance-funded, public-funded and self-paying patients. Nearly 1000 surgeons and anaesthetists are credentialed to practice within Southern Cross Hospitals facilities.

Southern Cross Benefits Limited, established in 1982, operates as a direct-to-consumer travel-insurance business (Southern Cross Travel Insurance) that covered around 445,000 travellers in both New Zealand and Australia in the 2017 financial year.

In 2012 Southern Cross Benefits Limited acquired the pet insurance book of Ellenco Pet Insurance and re-launched the business as Southern Cross Pet Insurance in 2014.  As at 30 June 2017 Southern Cross Pet Insurance insured more than 21,000 cats and dogs.

As a Charitable Trust, the Southern Cross Health Trust reinvests any surpluses it makes and partners with several charities. Its charitable activities include making its hospitals’ facilities, medical supplies and theatre staff available free-of-charge for charitable surgeries; funding a free mobile dental clinic that operates in the upper North Island; and supporting the New Zealand Dental Association, Dove Hospice and cancer support group Sweet Louise.

'''Therapy''' (often abbreviated '''tx''', '''Tx''', or '''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the attempted remediation of a [[health]] problem, usually following a [[diagnosis]]. In the medical field, it is usually [[synonym]]ous with '''treatment''' (also abbreviated '''tx''' or '''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Among [[psychologist]]s and other mental [[health]] [[professional]]s, including [[psychiatrist]]s, psychiatric nurse practitioners, counselors, and clinical social workers, the term may refer specifically to [[psychotherapy]] (sometimes dubbed 'talking therapy'). The English word ''therapy'' comes via Latin ''therapīa'' from {{lang-grc-gre|θεραπεία}} and literally means "curing" or "healing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=therapy&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, ''Therapy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule, each therapy has [[indication (medicine)|indications]] and [[contraindication]]s.

== Semantic field ==
The words '''''care''''', '''''therapy''''', '''''treatment''''', and '''''intervention''''' overlap in a [[semantic field]], and thus they can be [[synonym]]ous depending on [[context (language use)|context]]. Moving rightward through that order, the [[connotation|connotative]] level of [[holism]] decreases and the level of specificity (to [[wikt:concrete#Adjective|concrete]] instances) increases. Thus, in [[health care]] contexts (where its [[word sense|senses]] are always [[mass noun|noncount]]), the word ''care'' tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect or improve someone's health (for example, as in the terms ''[[preventive healthcare|preventive care]]'' and ''[[primary care]]'', which connote ongoing action), although it sometimes implies a narrower idea (for example, in the simplest cases of [[wound care]] or [[post-anesthesia care unit|postanesthesia care]], a few particular steps are sufficient, and the patient's interaction with that provider is soon finished). In contrast, the word ''intervention'' tends to be specific and concrete, and thus the word is often [[count noun|countable]]; for example, one instance of [[cardiac catheterization]] is one [[Medical procedure|intervention]] performed, and [[coronary care unit|coronary care]] (noncount) can require a series of interventions (count). At the extreme, the piling on of such countable interventions amounts to [[interventionism (medicine)|interventionism]], a flawed model of care lacking holistic [[wikt:circumspection#Noun|circumspection]]—merely treating [[wikt:discrete#Adjective|discrete]] problems (in billable increments) rather than maintaining health. ''Therapy'' and ''treatment'', in the middle of the semantic field, can connote either the holism of ''care'' or the discreteness of ''intervention'', with context conveying the intent in each use. Accordingly, they can be used in both noncount and count senses (for example, ''therapy for [[chronic kidney disease]] can involve several [[dialysis]] treatments per week'').

The words ''aceology'' and ''iamatology'' are obscure and obsolete synonyms referring to the study of therapies.

== Types of therapies ==
{{See also|List of therapies}}

=== By chronology, priority, or intensity ===
==== Levels of care ====
Levels of care classify [[health care]] into categories of chronology, priority, or intensity, as follows:
* [[Emergency medicine|Emergency care]] handles [[medical emergency|medical emergencies]] and is a first point of contact or intake for less serious problems, which can be referred to other levels of care as appropriate.
* [[Intensive care medicine|Intensive care]], also called [[critical care medicine|critical care]], is care for extremely ill or injured patients. It thus requires high resource intensity, knowledge, and skill, as well as quick [[decision making]].
* [[Ambulatory care]] is care provided on an [[patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient]] basis. Typically patients can walk into and out of the clinic under their own power (hence "ambulatory"), usually on the same day.
* [[Home care]] is care at home, including care from providers (such as physicians, nurses, and home health aides) making [[house call]]s, care from [[caregiver]]s such as family members, and patient [[self care|self-care]].
* [[Primary care]] is meant to be the main kind of care in general, and ideally a [[medical home]] that unifies care across referred providers.
* [[Secondary care]] is care provided by medical specialists and other health professionals who generally do not have first contact with patients, for example, cardiologists, urologists and dermatologists. A patient reaches secondary care as a next step from primary care, typically by provider referral although sometimes by patient self-initiative.
* [[Tertiary care]] is specialized consultative care, usually for [[patient#Outpatients and inpatients|inpatients]] and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].
* Follow-up care is additional care during or after [[convalescence]]. Aftercare is generally synonymous with follow-up care.
* [[End-of-life care]] is care near the end of one's life. It often includes the following:
** [[Palliative care]] is [[#Supportive therapy|supportive care]], most especially (but not necessarily) near the end of life.
** [[Hospice|Hospice care]] is palliative care very near the end of life when [[cure]] is very unlikely. Its main goal is comfort, both physical and mental.

==== Lines of therapy ====
&lt;!-- Over a dozen pages redirect to this section; if the text in this section header is changed, {{Anchor|Lines of therapy}} must be added to the heading to ensure that those pages continue to redirect to this section. --&gt;
Treatment decisions often follow formal or informal [[algorithm]]ic guidelines. Treatment options can often be ranked or prioritized into '''lines of therapy''': '''first-line therapy''', '''second-line therapy''', '''third-line therapy''', and so on. '''First-line therapy''' (sometimes called '''induction therapy''', '''primary therapy''', or '''front-line therapy''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=346494 National Cancer Institute &gt; Dictionary of Cancer Terms &gt; first-line therapy] Retrieved July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is the first therapy that will be tried. Its priority over other options is usually either: (1) formally recommended on the basis of [[clinical trial]] evidence for its best-available combination of efficacy, safety, and tolerability or (2) chosen based on the clinical experience of the physician. If a first-line therapy either fails to resolve the issue or produces intolerable [[side effect]]s, additional (second-line) therapies may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen, followed by third-line therapies, and so on.

An example of a context in which the formalization of treatment algorithms and the ranking of lines of therapy is very extensive is [[chemotherapy regimens]]. Because of the great difficulty in successfully treating some forms of cancer, one line after another may be tried. In [[oncology]] the count of therapy lines may reach 10 or even 20.

Often multiple therapies may be tried simultaneously ([[combination therapy]] or polytherapy). Thus [[combination chemotherapy]] is also called polychemotherapy, whereas chemotherapy with one agent at a time is called single-agent therapy or monotherapy.

[[Adjuvant therapy]] is therapy given in addition to the primary, main, or initial treatment, but simultaneously (as opposed to second-line therapy). [[Neoadjuvant therapy]] is therapy that is begun before the main therapy. Thus one can consider surgical excision of a tumor as the first-line therapy for a certain type and stage of cancer even though radiotherapy is used before it; the radiotherapy is neoadjuvant (chronologically first but not primary in the sense of the main event). [[Premedication]] is conceptually not far from this, but the words are not interchangeable; cytotoxic drugs to put a tumor "on the ropes" before surgery delivers the "knockout punch"  are called neoadjuvant chemotherapy, not premedication, whereas things like anesthetics or prophylactic antibiotics before dental surgery are called premedication.

[[Step therapy]] or stepladder therapy is a specific type of prioritization by lines of therapy. It is controversial in [[health care in the United States|American health care]] because unlike conventional [[decision-making]] about what constitutes first-line, second-line, and third-line therapy, which in the U.S. reflects safety and efficacy first and cost only according to the patient's wishes, step therapy attempts to mix cost containment by someone other than the patient (third-party payers) into the algorithm. [[Therapy freedom]] and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]] are involved.

=== By intent ===

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="width:100%"
|- valign="top"
! scope="col" | Therapy type
! scope="col" class="unsortable" | Description
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Abortive therapy}} abortive therapy
| A therapy that is intended to stop a medical condition from progressing any further.  A medication taken at the earliest signs of a disease, such as an [[analgesic]] taken at the very first symptoms of a [[migraine headache]] to prevent it from getting worse, is an abortive therapy. Compare [[abortifacient]]s, which abort a pregnancy.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Bridge therapy}} [[bridge therapy]]
| A therapy that [[figurative analogy|figuratively]] provides a bridge to another step or phase, crossing over some immediate chasm (challenge), in contrast with [[destination therapy]], which is the final therapy in cases where clinically appropriate. 
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Consolidation therapy}} consolidation therapy
| A therapy given to consolidate the gains from [[#Lines of therapy|induction therapy]]. In cancer, this means chasing after any malignant cells that may be left.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Curative therapy}} curative therapy
| A therapy with ''curative intent'', that is, one that seeks to [[cure]] the root cause of a disorder.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Definitive therapy}} definitive therapy
| A therapy that may be final, superior to others, [[#Curative therapy|curative]], or all of those.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Destination therapy}} [[destination therapy]]
| A therapy that is the final destination rather than a [[bridge therapy|bridge]] to another therapy. Usually refers to [[ventricular assist device]]s to keep the existing heart going, not just until a [[heart transplantation|heart transplant]] can occur, but for the rest of the patient's life expectancy.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Empiric therapy}} [[empiric therapy]]
| A therapy given on an empiric basis; that is, one given according to a clinician's educated guess despite uncertainty about the illness's causative factors. For example, empiric antibiotic therapy administers a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] immediately on the basis of a good chance (given the history, physical examination findings, and risk factors present) that the illness is bacterial and will respond to that drug (even though the bacterial species or variant is not yet known).
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Gold standard therapy}} gold standard therapy
| A therapy that is [[#Definitive therapy|definitive]], just as a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard diagnostic test]] is a definitive test.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Investigational therapy}} investigational therapy
| An [[experiment]]al therapy. Use of experimental therapies must be ethically justified, because by definition they raise the question of [[standard of care]]. Physicians have autonomy to provide empirical care (such as [[off-label use|off-label]] care) according to their experience and clinical judgment, but the autonomy has limits that preclude [[quackery]]. Thus it may be necessary to design a [[clinical trial]] around the new therapy and to use the therapy only per a formal [[protocol (science)|protocol]]. Sometimes shorthand phrases such as "treated on protocol" imply not just "treated according to a plan" but specifically "treated with investigational therapy".
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Maintenance therapy}} [[maintenance therapy]]
| A therapy taken during [[remission (medicine)|disease remission]] to prevent relapse.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Palliative therapy}} palliative therapy
| See [[#Supportive therapy|supportive therapy]] for connotative distinctions.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Preventive therapy}} preventive therapy&lt;br /&gt;{{nowrap|(prophylactic therapy)}}
| A therapy that is intended to [[preventive healthcare|prevent a medical condition]] from occurring (also called prophylaxis). For example, many [[vaccine]]s prevent infectious diseases.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Salvage therapy}} [[salvage therapy]] (rescue therapy)
| A therapy tried after others have failed; it may be a "last-[[#Lines of therapy|line]]" therapy.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Stepdown therapy}} stepdown therapy
| Therapy that tapers the dosage gradually rather than abruptly cutting it off. For example, a switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics as an infection is brought under control steps down the intensity of therapy.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Supportive therapy}} supportive therapy
| A therapy that does not treat or improve the underlying condition, but instead increases the patient's comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfids.org/about-cfids/supportive-therapy.asp |title=CFIDS |publisher=CFIDS |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213075456/http://www.cfids.org/about-cfids/supportive-therapy.asp |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, supportive care for flu, colds, or gastrointestinal upset can include rest, fluids, and [[over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] pain relievers; those things don't treat the cause, but they do ''treat the symptoms'' and thus provide relief. Supportive therapy may be ''palliative therapy'' ([[palliative care]]). The two terms are sometimes [[synonym]]ous, but ''palliative care'' often [[connotation|connotes]] serious illness and [[end-of-life care]], whereas ''supportive care'' is always connotatively neutral (it may be as simple as mere bedrest for the common cold). Therapy may be categorized as having [[#Curative therapy|curative intent]] (when it is possible to eliminate the disease) or ''palliative intent'' (when eliminating the disease is impossible and the focus shifts to minimizing the distress that it causes). The two are often [[wikt:contradistinguish#Verb|contradistinguished]] (mutually exclusive) in some contexts (such as the [[management of cancer|management of some cancers]]), but they are not inherently mutually exclusive; often a therapy can be both curative and palliative simultaneously. [[Supportive psychotherapy]] aims to support the patient by alleviating the worst of the symptoms, with the expectation that [[#Definitive therapy|definitive therapy]] can follow later if possible.
|- valign="top"
! scope="row" | {{Anchor|Systemic therapy}} systemic therapy
| A therapy that is [[wikt:systemic#Adjective|systemic]]. In the physiological [[word sense|sense]], this means affecting the whole body (rather than being local or locoregional), whether via [[systemic administration]], systemic effect, or both. [[Systemic therapy (psychotherapy)|Systemic therapy in the psychotherapeutic sense]] seeks to address people not only on the individual level but also as people in relationships, dealing with the interactions of groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9359">'''Walter William Marseille''' (born 1901) was a German-American [[psychoanalyst]] and [[graphologist]]. In 1948 he corresponded with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], advocating [[world government]].

==Life==
Walter Marseille was the son of Gustav Marseille, a leader in the progressive education movement. He studied psychology, mathematics, history, and philosophy at the Universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[University of Munich|Munich]].&lt;ref name="KPFA1954"&gt;{{cite book|author=KPFA Radio station|title=KPFA folio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eS3AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2012|year=1954|page=cclxxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 he took a doctorate under [[Martin Heidegger]] at [[Marburg University]]. Further information is given by his friend [[Karl Löwith]]. From 1928 to 1933 Marseille followed the workshops (Arbeitsgemeinschaft) of [[Heinrich Jacoby]] in [[Berlin]]; his address was Dernburgstr. 34, Charlottenburg (Berlin).&lt;ref name=Loewith&gt;Löwith, ''Mein Leben in Deutschland'', p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed to have broken with Heidegger in 1932 over Heidegger's refusal to condemn Nazism.&lt;ref name="KPFA1954"/&gt; Löwith tells us that Marseille left Germany in 1933, went to [[Vienna]] where he married a woman of Jewish origin, and then emigrated to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Loewith/&gt; He trained as a psychoanalyst at the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] and the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]],&lt;ref name="KPFA1954"/&gt; and took [[Ruth Mack Brunswick]] as his training analyst.&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;Marseille correspondence with Einstein, 1948. Marseille also told Einstein that [[Ralph Fox]] of [[Princeton University]] was a good friend, and the mathematician, [[Hans Rademacher]], had been his teacher thirty years earlier in Germany (which would have been at the University of Berlin, or possibly, if after 1922, at Hamburg).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marseille was hired by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] in 1940 to analyse the handwriting of mail received by US Senators during the debate on the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|conscription bill]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophyofscienceportal.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/walter-william-marseilleanalytics-of.html Science: Handwriting as Character], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 25 May 1942&lt;/ref&gt; and developed an index for the cultural rating of handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;The index was used in Rowena Wyant, "Voting via the Senate Mailbag", ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' 5 (1941): 359-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1948 Marseille sent a paper, "A Method to Enforce World Peace", to both [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. A copy of the paper is in the Einstein archives along with correspondence with Einstein about it. See ''Einstein on Peace'' (1960), edited by Otto Nathan. Einstein's four replies in the ensuing discussion were sold by Bloomsbury Auctions in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

84. Einstein (Albert, theoretical physicist, 1879-1955) 4 Typed Letters signed to Dr. Walter W. Marseille, in German, 4pp., 4to, Princeton, 8th April - 16th November 1948, responding to Marseille’s paper “A Method to Enforce World Peace” and their subsequent correspondence on the establishment of world government and the Western world’s relations with Russia, [Letter 1] (You proceed from these premises: The USA wants a supra-national organisation [World Government], the USSR is averse to this because of its aggressive attitude. I believe that this characterisation of the psychological state of affairs is not justified. Now to your proposal. We agree on the following: only World Government can produce security. Where we differ is in the thesis that we must compel Russia to join [a World Government] before it re-arms and can attack others. Better to let Russia see that there is nothing to be achieved by aggression, but there are advantages in joining: Then the Russian regime’s attitude will probably change and they will take part without compulsion. Our differences of opinion are significant as long as it is uncertain whether the USA really wants to bring about a World Government... . Before this situation is resolved, your question should not even be raised, since such a discussion can only make the psychological situation worse) [Letter 2] (Factually your letter is entirely logical. However I cannot associate myself with your point of view, much less with that expressed by Bertrand Russell [who at this point was violently anti-communist]. Your train of thought is like that of a soldier or an engineer, in that you in my opinion unfeasably simplify the psychological reaction, especially insofar as it concerns the Russians. The attitude of the Russians, it seems to me, clearly shows that they are deeply concerned about the military-industrial situation, and that they would be prepared to make considerable concessions if some degree of relaxation was permitted. I am convinced that Roosevelt [Truman] is quite capable of bringing about a peaceful modus vivendi with Russia... ) [Letter 3] (I agree with you in that the resolution of the problem of security on an international basis cannot wait. In view of the resolute refusal of Russia, there seems no other possibility than that the organisation exist without Russia... . The question now arises whether such a ‘Rump’ World Government should compel Russia to join. This would mean war... with regard to this, I am not of your opinion. You argue that Russia’s relative strength will grow in time and thereby worsen the situation for the rest of the world. This last is granted: I am, however, absolutely against it. It is like suicide out of fear of dying. In my view it is much better, both morally and practically, to attempt to bring about a state of affairs in which the Russians, out of pure self-interest, find it preferable to give up their separatist position) [Letter 4] (I propose that you should set out your views of the situation in a letter to the individual Trustees of the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists.

Marseille was the recipient of a well-known letter dated 5 May 1948 in which Bertrand Russell signalled his agreement with the paper. Russell's letter, of which Einstein may have been the first to have been sent a copy, was first published by Marseille in ''The Nation'', 16 Oct. 1954, when he disagreed with Russell's changed views on nuclear disarmament. The letter and its lack of context have been of concern to Russell scholars.&lt;ref&gt;The letter may be read in R.W. Clark, ''The Life of Bertrand Russell'', pp.&amp;nbsp;523&amp;ndash;4; Russell, ''Selected Letters'' (ed. N. Griffin), vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;428–9; ''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (ed. R. Perkins), pp.&amp;nbsp;204&amp;ndash;5; ''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', vol. 28 (ed. A. Bone), p.&amp;nbsp;72; and it is discussed in Ray Monk's biography of Russell, vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;299&amp;ndash;303. Sidney Hook quoted the entire letter in his reply to M.S. Arnoni, "Arnoni vs. Hook", ''The New Leader'', 23 Oct. 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1954 Marseilles was a Berkeley, California psychoanalyst. That year he contributed a series of radio programmes broadcasts attempting a psychoanalytic study of [[Karl Marx]].  He published occasionally on [[nuclear weapons]] policy in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', from 1954 until 1962.

The '''Zimbabwe National Paralympic Committee''' (ZNPC) is responsible for [[Zimbabwe]]'s participation in the [[Paralympic Games]], and for overseeing disability sports in the country. Its mission it to support athletes with disabilities "competing at both the grassroots and elite levels".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimparalympic.org/ ZNPC homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zimbabwe National Paralympic Committee was only officially launched and registered in 2010. Prior to this, "the government provided financial aid during the Paralympic Games, [but] there was no co-ordinated mechanism to maintain athletes' momentum between the Games", and athletes "had to find their own sponsor, coach and manager who would finance the training, travelling and their participation at competitions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimparalympic.org/about-us/history/ "About us: History"], ZNPC&lt;/ref&gt;
