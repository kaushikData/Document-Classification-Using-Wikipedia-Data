      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1511">'''Arthur Saxon Dennett Smith''' ([[Sussex]], 1883–1950) was a Cornish bard, writer and linguist, known by the bardic name '''Caradar'''. He was born in Sussex, England, of Cornish parents and became a collaborator with [[Robert Morton Nance]] and [[Henry Jenner]] on the ''Gerlyver noweth Kernewek ha Sawsnek'' (Cornish-English dictionary). He compiled several grammars to make learning Cornish easier and edited some of the surviving Cornish texts. He also wrote a series of books aimed at teaching Welsh to English speakers. He is buried at [[Amberley, Sussex]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5945">Two main types of ancient Greek philological annotations can be distinguished: signs and explicit notes. The first philological sign (σημεῖον) invented by the first head of the [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandrinian Library]], [[Zenodotus|Zenodotos of Ephesos]], in his edition of Homer has been the [[Obelus|Obelos]] (ὀβελός: -), a short horizontal dash, which Zenodotos used to mark spurious lines. For this reason, the practice of using signs for textual criticism has been called '[[Obelism]]'. [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] invented later the [[asterisk]] (ἀστερίσκος: *) to mark lines, that are duplicated from another place as well as the [[Sigma#Lunate sigma|Lunate Sigma]] (σίγμα: Ϲ) and the [[Sigma#Lunate sigma|antisigma]] (ἀντίσιγμα: Ͻ) for two consecutive and interchangeable lines of the same content. A system of dots also credited to Aristophanes of Byzantium was developed in the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC: a [[hypostigme|low dot]] {{angle bracket|.}} marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a [[stigme mese|middot]] (στιγμή) {{angle bracket|·}} marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a [[stigme teleia|high dot]] {{angle bracket|˙}} marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed [[two dot punctuation]] {{angle bracket|⁚}} to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers. Less often, arrangements of three {{angle bracket|⁝}}, four {{angle bracket|⁞}} and {{angle bracket|⁘}}, and five dots {{angle bracket|⁙}} appeared. 

The number of the philological signs and in some cases their meanings were modified by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchos of Samothrake]] (220–143 BC), sixth head of the Alexandrinian Library. He used critical and exegetical signs in his editions of the Homeric poems. A dotted lunate sigma (σίγμα περιεστιγμένον: Ͼ) was used by him as an editorial sign indicating that the line so marked is at an incorrect position. Similarly, an antisigma, or reversed sigma (Ͻ), may mark a line that is out of place. A dotted antisigma or dotted reversed sigma (ἀντίσιγμα περιεστιγμένον: Ͽ) may indicate a line after which rearrangements should be made, or to variant readings of uncertain priority. The [[Diple (textual symbol)|Diple]] marked lines, whose language or content was perhaps also exegetically noteworthy and pointed to a corresponding explanation in a commentary. The diple periestigmene (διπλῆ περιεστιγμένη) a dotted Diple to point to a verse in which Aristarchos' text differs from that of Zenodotos. He used the obelos added to the asteriskos (*-) where the repeated line is out of place and the ''stigme'' (στιγμή: ·) indicated suspected spuriousness.

Aristarchos' ''semeia'' became the standard philological signs for centuries to follow, also adopted early on by scholars in Rome. Some papyrus fragments contain un-Aristarchian signs whose use was fairly consistent nevertheless. For instance, the so-called ''ancora'', an anchor-shaped diagonal upward and downward pointer often marks places were text had been omitted  or draws attention to text-critical restoration in the top or bottom margin. The [[Hypodiastole]], a curved interpunct was used to disambiguate certain homonyms and showed also that a series of letters should be understood as two separate words. It's companion mark was the [[Tie (typography)#Greek|enotikon]] (ἐνωτικόν: ‿) served to show that a series of letters should be read as a single word. The [[Paragraphos]] marked a division in a text. The [[Coronis (textual symbol)|Coronis]] was used to mark the ends of entire works or major sections in poetic and prose texts.&lt;ref&gt;Brill's Companion to Ancient Greek Scholarship, 2015 (2 Vols.) pp. 549-562 and The ambiguity of signs: critical σημεῖα from Zenodotus to Origen Author: Francesca Schironi &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nicky&gt;{{cite web |last= Nicolas |first= Nick |date=2005 |title=Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation |url= http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.htm |work= Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  |location= University of California, Irvine |access-date= 2014-10-07 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010180952/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html | archivedate= 2014-10-10 | dead-url= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref&gt;Nicolas, Nick.

An '''awkward squad''' is a group of individuals, normally within an existing organisation or structure, who resist or obstruct change, either through incompetence or by deliberate association.

==Origin==
It is commonly accepted that shortly before his death in 1796 [[Robert Burns]] uttered the words "Don't let the awkward squad fire over me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Quotation: Robert Burns on Last Words |encyclopedia=MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/quote_1861500864/Last_Words_Don%27t_let_the_awkward_squad_.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwaeBoa8?url=http://encarta.msn.com/quote_1861500864/Last_Words_Don%27t_let_the_awkward_squad_.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NYT staff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1852/10/13/archives/dying-words-and-thoughts.html |title=Dying words and Thoughts |publisher=New York Times |date=13 October 1852 |accessdate=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the phrase was in use in military slang for a group of recruits who seemed incapable of understanding discipline or not yet sufficiently trained or disciplined to properly carry out their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/1125.html |title=Brewer, E. Cobham. Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable. Awkward Squad |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abuffalosoldier.com/slang.htm |title=Indian Wars Slang: Part 1 |publisher=Abuffalosoldier.com |date= |accessdate=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=338 |last=Curling |first=Henry |title=Frank Beresford: or, Life in the Army |series=Google eBook |year=1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary use==

[[John Clare]], an English peasant poet, wrote with his own spelling and no punctuation. He complained in the 1820s to his editors that people could understand him, and he refused to use "that awkward squad of colon, semi-colon, comma, and full stop", according to the display in the [[John Clare Cottage]], in [[Helpston]].

In Canto 7, stanza 52 of [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'', the Russian general [[Alexander Suvorov|Suvorov]] (or "Suwarrow" as Byron anglicizes it) is described training the 'awkward squad' prior to the battle of Ismail.

[[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], in his 1842 essay on [[Frederic the Great]], used the phrase to describe the army of Frederic's father.

In her 1853 novel ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', [[Charlotte Brontë]] writes of M. Paul Emanuel: "Irritable he was; one heard that, as he apostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his orders." Brontë had also used the phrase four years earlier, in ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]''.

In Chapter 16 of ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (1864–65), [[Charles Dickens]] described the character Sloppy as a "Full-Private Number One in the Awkward Squad of the rank and file of life".

[[Norman Cameron (poet)|Norman Cameron]] used the words to end his 1950 poem ''Forgive me, sire''.

==Trade unionism==
{{main|Awkward squad (trade unionists)}}

The tag of 'awkward squad' has been applied to a group of left-wing [[trade union]]ists in the [[United Kingdom]], marked out by their opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s economic policies.  The group includes [[Bob Crow]], [[Mark Serwotka]], and [[Tony Woodley]]. In a Parliamentary sense, however, it can also apply to the left-wing of the Labour Party, which perennially occupies a bench of the House of Commons which allows its members to heckle and unnerve the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] regularly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28640">In [[linguistics]], '''binding''' is the distribution of [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] elements (pronouns and other [[pro-form]]s). A pronoun (a "bindee") usually has an [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] (a "binder") in context. The goal of binding theory is to identify the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given pronoun or noun and its antecedent (or postcedent), e.g. ''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would help'' vs. ''*He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would help'' (the second sentence is not possible if ''he'' is intended to mean ''John''). 

The idea that there should be a specialized, coherent theory dealing with this sort of phenomena originated in work in [[transformational grammar]] in the 1970s. This work culminated in [[government and binding theory]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Linguistics dictionaries tend to define binding with reference to the government and binding framework. See for instance Crystal (1997:43).&lt;/ref&gt; The binding theory that became established at that time is still considered a reference point, though its validity is no longer accepted. 

Many theories of [[syntax]] now have a subtheory that addresses binding phenomena. These phenomena exist in all languages, although the behavior of binding can vary in interesting and nuanced ways across languages, even across languages that are closely related.

==Some basic examples and questions==
The following sentences illustrate some basic facts of binding. The words that bear the index i should be construed as referring to the same person or thing.&lt;ref&gt;Examples like the ones given here that illustrate aspects of binding can be found in most accounts of binding phenomena. See for instance Radford (2004:85f) and Carnie (2013:153f.).&lt;/ref&gt;

::a. '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is impressed with '''himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading obligatory&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is impressed with '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

::a. *'''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' asked Arthur to help '''herself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible, sentence ungrammatical&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' asked Arthur to help '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' said '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' was tired. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''She&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' said '''Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' was tired. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Fred's&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' friends venerate '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;'''His&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' friends venerate '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;
 
These sentences illustrate some aspects of the distribution of [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] and [[Personal pronoun|personal]] pronouns. In the first pair of sentences, the reflexive pronoun must appear for the indicated reading to be possible. In the second pair, the personal pronoun must appear for the indicated reading to be possible. The third pair shows that at times a personal pronoun must follow its antecedent, and the fourth pair further illustrates the same point, although the acceptability judgement is not as robust. Based on such data, one sees that reflexive and personal pronouns differ in their distribution and that linear order (of a pronoun in relation to its antecedent or postcedent) is a factor influencing where at least some pronouns can appear. A theory of binding should be in a position to predict and explain the differences in distribution seen in sentences like these. It should be in a position to answer questions like: What explains where a reflexive pronoun must appear as opposed to a personal pronoun? When does linear order play a role in determining where pronouns can appear? What other factor (or factors) beyond linear order help predict where pronouns can appear?

==Binding domains==
The following three subsections consider the binding domains that are relevant for the distribution of pronouns and nouns. The discussion follows the outline provided by the traditional binding theory (see below), which divides nominals into three basic categories: reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, personal pronouns, and nouns ([[common noun|common]] and [[Proper noun|proper]]).&lt;ref&gt;The three-way division between reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, personal pronouns, and nouns is discussed, for instance, in Carnie (2013:147ff.). Note, however, that the terminology varies depending on the author.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns===
When one examines the distribution of reflexive and [[Reciprocal pronoun|reciprocal]] pronouns, one sees that there are certain domains that are relevant, a "domain" being a syntactic unit that is [[clause]]-like. Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns often seek their antecedent close by, in a binding domain that is local, e.g.

::a. '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' praises '''himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading obligatory&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' praises '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''The girls&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' like '''each other&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading obligatory&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''The girls&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' like '''them&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

These examples illustrate that there is a domain within which a reflexive or reciprocal pronoun should find its antecedent. The a-sentences are fine because the reflexive or reciprocal pronoun has its antecedent within the clause. The b-sentences, in contrast, do not allow the indicated reading, a fact illustrating that personal pronouns have a distribution that is different from that of reflexive and reciprocal pronouns. A related observation is that a reflexive and reciprocal pronoun often cannot seek its antecedent in a superordinate clause, e.g.

::a. Susan thinks that '''Jill&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' should praise '''herself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading (almost) obligatory&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;'''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' thinks that Jill should praise '''herself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading very unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::a. They asked whether '''the girls&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' like '''each other&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading (almost) obligatory&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;'''They&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' asked whether the girls like '''each other&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading very unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

When the reflexive or reciprocal pronoun attempts to find an antecedent outside of the immediate clause containing it, it fails. In other words, it can hardly seek its antecedent in the superordinate clause. The binding domain that is relevant is the immediate clause containing it.

===Personal pronouns===

Personal pronouns have a distribution that is different from reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, a point that is evident with the first two b-sentences in the previous section. The local binding domain that is decisive for the distribution of reflexive and reciprocal pronouns is also decisive for personal pronouns, but in a different way. Personal pronouns seek their antecedent outside of the local binding domain containing them, e.g.

::a. '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' asked whether Jim mentioned '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt; 
::b. *Fred asked whether '''Jim&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mentioned '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Gina&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' hopes that Wilma will mention '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *Gina hopes that '''Wilma&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' will mention '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

In these cases, the pronoun has to look outside of the embedded clause containing it to the matrix clause to find its antecedent. Hence based on such data, the relevant binding domain appears to be the clause. Further data illustrate, however, that the clause is actually not the relevant domain:

::a. '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' likes the picture of '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

::b. '''Gina&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' has heard the rumor about '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

Since the pronouns appear within the same minimal clause containing their antecedents in these cases, one cannot argue that the relevant binding domain is the clause. The most one can say based on such data is that the domain is "clause-like".

===Nouns===
The distribution of common and proper nouns is unlike that of reflexive, reciprocal, and personal pronouns. The relevant observation in this regard is that a noun is often reluctantly coreferential with another nominal that is within its binding domain or in a superordinate binding domain, e.g.

::a. '''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' admires '''herself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading obligatory&lt;/small&gt;
::b. #'''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' admires '''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible, but special context necessary&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' thinks that '''he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the best. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. #'''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' thinks that '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the best. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible, but special context necessary&lt;/small&gt;

The readings indicated in the a-sentences are natural, whereas the b-sentences are very unusual. Indeed, sentences like these b-sentences were judged to be impossible in the traditional binding theory according to Condition C (see below). Given a contrastive context, however, the b-sentences can work, e.g. ''Susan does not admire Jane, but rather Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; admires Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. One can therefore conclude that nouns are not sensitive to binding domains in the same way that reflexive, reciprocal, and personal pronouns are.

==Linear order==
The following subsections illustrate the extent to which pure linear order impacts the distribution of pronouns. While linear order is clearly important, it is not the only factor influencing where pronouns can appear.

===Linear order is a factor===

A simple hypothesis concerning the distribution of many anaphoric elements, of personal pronouns in particular, is that linear order plays a role. In most cases, a pronoun follows its antecedent, and in many cases, the coreferential reading is impossible if the pronoun precedes its antecedent. The following sentences suggest that pure linear can indeed be important for the distribution of pronouns:

::a.  '''Jim's&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' grade upsets '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;'''His&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' grade upsets '''Jim&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Larry's&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' family avoids '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;'''His&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' family avoids '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::a. We spoke to '''Tina's&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mother about '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;We spoke to '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mother about '''Tina&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

While the coreferential readings indicated in these b-sentences are possible, they are unlikely. The order presented in the a-sentences is strongly preferred. The following, more extensive data sets further illustrate that linear order is important:

::a. '''Sam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mentioned twice that '''he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' was hungry. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mentioned twice that '''Sam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' was hungry. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;
::c. That '''Sam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' was hungry, '''he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mentioned twice. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;
::d. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;That '''he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' was hungry, '''Sam&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' mentioned twice. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::a. You asked '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' twice when '''he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' would study. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;  
::b. *You asked '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' twice when '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' would study. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;
::c. When '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' would study, you asked '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' twice. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt; 
::d. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;When '''he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' would study, you asked '''Fred&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' twice. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

While the acceptability judgements here are nuanced, one can make a strong case that pure linear order is at least in part predictive of when the indicated reading is available. The a- and c-sentences allow the coreferential reading more easily than their b- and d-counterparts.

===Linear order is not the only factor===

While linear order is an important factor influencing the distribution of pronouns, it is not the only factor. The following sentences are similar to the c- and d-sentences in the previous section insofar as an embedded clause is present.

::a. When '''the boys&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' are at home, '''they&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' play video games. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. When '''they&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' are at home, '''the boys&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' play video games. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

::a. If '''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' tries, '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' will succeed. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible &lt;/small&gt;
::b. If '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' tries, '''Susan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' will succeed. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

While there may be a mild preference for the order in the a-sentences here, the indicated reading in the b-sentences is also available. Hence linear order is hardly playing a role in such cases. The relevant difference between these sentences and the c- and d-sentences in the previous section is that the embedded clauses here are [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] clauses, whereas they are [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] clauses above. The following examples involve adjunct phrases:&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mary''- and ''Zelda''-examples given here appear originally in Reinhart's (1983) book on the distribution of anaphors. Note, however, that many of Reinhart's original acceptability judgments were inaccurate, hence the acceptability judgments given here do not match Reinhart's examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

::a. '''Rosa&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' found a scratch in Ben's picture of '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''She&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' found a scratch in Ben's picture of '''Rosa&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt; 
::c. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;In Ben’s picture of '''Rosa&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' found a scratch. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt; 
::d. In Ben’s picture of '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''Rosa&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' found a scratch. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt; 
		
::a. '''Zelda&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' spent her sweetest hours in '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' bed.&lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt; 
::b. *'''She&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' spent her sweetest hours in '''Zelda's&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' bed. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible&lt;/small&gt; 
::c. &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;In '''Zelda’s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' bed, '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' spent her sweetest hours. – &lt;small&gt;Indicated reading very unlikely&lt;/small&gt; 
::d. In '''her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' bed, '''Zelda&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' spent her sweetest hours.  &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

The fact that the c-sentences marginally allow the indicated reading whereas the b-sentences do not at all allow this reading further demonstrates that linear order is important. But in this regard, the d-sentences are telling, since if linear order were the entire story, one would expect the d-sentences to be less acceptable than they are. The conclusion that one can draw from such data is that there are one or more other factors beyond linear order that are impacting the distribution of pronouns.

==Configuration vs. function==
Given that linear order is not the only factor influencing the distribution of pronouns, the question is what other factor or factors might also be playing a role. The traditional binding theory (see below) took [[c-command]] to be the all important factor, but the importance of c-command for syntactic theorizing has been extensively criticized in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Bruening (2014) produces an extensive criticism of the validity of c-command for syntactic theorizing.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary alternative to c-command is functional rank. These two competing concepts (c-command vs. rank) have been debated extensively and they continue to be debated. C-command is a configurational notion; it is defined over concrete syntactic configurations. Syntactic rank, in contrast, is a functional notion that resides in the lexicon; it is defined over the ranking of the arguments of [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s. Subjects are ranked higher than objects, first objects are ranked higher than second objects, and prepositional objects are ranked lowest. The following two subsections briefly consider these competing notions.

===Configuration (c-command)===
C-command is a configurational notion that acknowledges the syntactic configuration as primitive. Basic [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[Object (grammar)|object]] asymmetries, which are numerous in many languages, are explained by the fact that the subject appears outside of the finite verb phrase (VP) constituent, whereas the object appears inside it. Subjects therefore c-command objects, but not vice versa. C-command is defined as follows:

::'''C-command'''
::Node A c-commands node B if every node dominating A also dominates B, and neither A nor B dominates the other.&lt;ref&gt;The definition of c-command is taken from Carnie (2013:127).&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the binary division of the clause (S → NP + VP) associated with most [[phrase structure grammar]]s, this definition sees a typical subject c-commanding everything inside the [[verb phrase]] (VP), whereas everything inside the VP is incapable of c-commanding anything outside of the VP. Some basic binding facts are explained in this manner, e.g.

::a. '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' promoted '''himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading obligatory&lt;/small&gt;

::b. *'''Himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' promoted '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible; sentence ungrammatical
&lt;/small&gt;

Sentence a is fine because the subject ''Larry'' c-commands the object ''himself'', whereas sentence b does not work because the object ''Larry'' does not c-command the subject ''himself''. The assumption has been that within its binding domain, a reflexive pronoun must be c-commanded by its antecedent. While this approach based on c-command makes a correct prediction much of the time, there are other cases where it fails to make the correct prediction, e.g.

::The picture of '''himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' upsets '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

The reading indicated is acceptable in this case, but if c-command were the key notion helping to explain where the reflexive can and must appear, then the reading should be impossible since ''himself'' is not c-commanded by ''Larry''.&lt;ref&gt;The insight that the reflexive pronoun can be embedded inside a subject NP and at the same time be coreferential with the object NP is one of the main insights presented in Pollard and Sag's (1992) account of what has become known as "exempt anaphors", i.e. reflexive pronouns that are not bound by their antecedent.&lt;/ref&gt;

As reflexive and personal pronouns occur in complementary distribution, the notion of c-command can also be used to explain where personal pronouns can appear.  The assumption is that personal pronouns ''cannot'' c-command their antecedent, e.g.

::a. When '''Alice&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' felt tired, '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' lay down. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading easily possible&lt;/small&gt;

::b When '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' felt tired, '''Alice&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' lay down.  &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

In both examples, the personal pronoun ''she'' does not c-command its antecedent ''Alice'', resulting in the grammaticality of both sentences despite reversed linear order.

===Function (rank)===

The alternative to a c-command approach posits a ranking of syntactic functions (SUBJECT &gt; FIRST OBJECT &gt; SECOND OBJECT &gt; PREPOSITIONAL OBJECT).&lt;ref&gt;A number of approaches to binding build on a hierarchy of syntactic functions, although the terminology they employ usually varies. In particular, the HPSG and LFG frameworks posit a basic hierarhcy of syntactic functions. See Pollard and Sag (1994:121), who build on the notion of o-command, and see Bresnan (2001:212), who employs the "rank" terminology used here.&lt;/ref&gt; Subject-object asymmetries are addressed in terms of this ranking. Since subjects are ranked higher than objects, an object can have the subject as its antecedent, but not vice versa. With basic cases, this approach makes the same prediction as the c-command approach. The first two sentences from the previous section are repeated here:

::a. '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' promoted '''himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading obligatory&lt;/small&gt;

::b. *'''Himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' promoted '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading impossible; sentence ungrammatical
&lt;/small&gt;

Since the subject outranks the object, sentence a is predictably acceptable, the subject ''Larry'' outranking the object ''himself''. Sentence b, in contrast, is bad because the subject reflexive pronoun ''himself'' outranks its postcedent ''Larry''. In other words, this approach in terms of rank is assuming that within its binding domain, a reflexive pronoun may not outrank its antecedent (or postcedent). Consider the third example sentence from the previous section in this regard:

::The picture of '''himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' upset '''Larry&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Indicated reading possible&lt;/small&gt;

The approach based on rank does not require a particular configurational relationship to hold between a reflexive pronoun and its antecedent. In other words, it makes no prediction in this case, and hence does not make an incorrect prediction. The reflexive pronoun ''himself'' is embedded within the subject noun phrase, which means that it is not the subject and hence does not outrank the object ''Larry''.

A theory of binding that acknowledges both linear order and rank can at least begin to predict many of the marginal readings.&lt;ref&gt;Langacker's study (1969), which is one of the earliest explorations of binding phenomena, combined two factors to predict binding possibilities. Hence the concept that a combination of factors influences binding data has a long tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; When both linear order and rank combine, acceptability judgments are robust, e.g.

::a.  '''Barbara&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' hopes that '''she&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' will be promoted. &lt;small&gt;– Linear order and rank combine to make the indicated reading easily possible.&lt;/small&gt;
::b.  *'''She&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' hopes that '''Barbara&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' will be promoted. &lt;small&gt;– Linear order and rank combine to make the indicated reading impossible.&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Bill's&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' grade upset '''him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Linear order alone makes the indicated reading possible; rank is not involved.&lt;/small&gt;
::b. &lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;'''His&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' grade upset '''Bill&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. &lt;small&gt;– Linear order alone makes the indicated reading unlikely; rank is not involved.&lt;/small&gt;

This ability to address marginal readings is something that an approach combining linear order and rank can accomplish, whereas an approach that acknowledges only c-command cannot do the same.

==The traditional binding theory: Conditions A, B, and C==
The exploration of binding phenomena got started in the 1970s and interest peaked in the 1980s with [[Government and Binding Theory]], a grammar framework in the tradition of [[generative syntax]] that is still prominent today.&lt;ref&gt;For presentations of the traditional binding theory, see for instance Radford (2004:85ff) and Carnie (2013:147ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of binding that became widespread at that time serves now merely as reference point (since it is no longer believed to be correct). This theory distinguishes between 3 different binding conditions: A, B, and C. The theory classifies nominals according to two features, [±anaphor] and  [±pronominal], which are binary. The binding characteristics of a nominal are determined by the values of these features, either plus or minus. Thus, a nominal that is [-anaphor, -pronominal] is an R-expression (referring expression), such as a [[common noun]] or a [[proper name]]. A nominal that is [-anaphor, +pronominal] is a pronoun, such ''he'' or ''they'', and a nominal that is [+anaphor, -pronominal] is a reflexive pronoun, such as ''himself'' or ''themselves''. Note that the term ''anaphor'' here is being used in a specialized sense; it essentially means "reflexive". This meaning is specific to the Government and Binding framework and has not spread beyond this framework.&lt;ref&gt;Most syntax textbooks on generative grammar use the term in this way. See for instance Carnie (2013:148).&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the classifications according to these two features, three conditions are formulated:

::'''Condition A''' 
::An anaphor (reflexive) must have a local (nearby) antecedent. Thus, ''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; washed himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' obeys Condition A: the antecedent of ''himself'', which is ''John'', is nearby. In contrast, *''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; asked Mary to wash himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is unacceptable, because the reflexive and its antecedent are too far away from each other.

::'''Condition B''' 
::A pronoun can have an antecedent as long as the antecedent is not local or does not c-command the pronoun. Thus ''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; asked Mary to wash him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' obeys Condition B; ''John'' is the antecedent of ''him'', and ''him'' is sufficiently far away. On the other hand, *''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; washed him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is unacceptable.

::'''Condition C'''
::An R-expression cannot have an antecedent that c-commands it. Thus *''He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; asked Mary to wash John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is unacceptable.

While the theory of binding that these three conditions represent is no longer held to be valid, as mentioned above, the associations with the three conditions are so firmly anchored in the study of binding that one often refers to, for example, "Condition A effects" or "Condition B effects" when describing binding phenomena.

'''Bulgarian dialects''' are the regional spoken varieties of the [[Bulgarian language]], a [[South Slavic language]]. Bulgarian [[dialectology]] dates to the 1830s and the pioneering work of [[Neofit Rilski]], ''Bolgarska gramatika'' (published 1835 in [[Kragujevac]], [[Serbia]], then [[Ottoman Empire]]). Other notable researchers in this field include [[Marin Drinov]], [[Konstantin Josef Jireček]], [[Lyubomir Miletich]], [[Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan]], [[Stoyko Stoykov]].

The [[dialects of Macedonian]] were for the most part classified as part of Bulgarian in the older literature.&lt;ref name=foreigners&gt;Mazon, Andre.

Since the second half of the 20th century, foreign authors have mostly adopted the convention of treating these in terms of a separate [[Macedonian language]], following the codification of Macedonian as the literary standard language of Yugoslav Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary linguists still consider Macedonian as a dialect of Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;pg=PA116 ''Who are the Macedonians?''], Hugh Poulton, C.

Большaя Советская Энциклопедия, tom. 37, Moskva 1938, р 743–744&lt;/ref&gt; Together with their closest lexical and grammatical relative they comprise the Eastern South Slavic branch. The present article treats all these dialects together, because of their close structural similarity and the fact that many important dialect boundaries intersect both territories.

The [[Bulgar]] nation absorbed diverse Slavic tribes and not a particular language. The main [[isogloss]] separating the Bulgarian dialects into '''Eastern''' and '''Western''' is the [[Yat#Yat in Bulgarian|yat border]], marking the different mutations of the [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]] yat form (ѣ, *''ě''), pronounced as either [[Open front unrounded vowel|/ʲa/]] or [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|/ɛ/]] to the east (''byal'', but plural ''beli'' in [[Balkan mountains|Balkan]] dialects, "white") and strictly as /ɛ/ to the west of it (''bel'', plural ''beli'') throughout former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=stoykov /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazon, A. Documents, contes et chansons slaves de l’Albanie du sud. Paris, 1936, 462 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Isoglosses shape three groups. Besides the Eastern and Western dialects, the [[Rup dialects|Rup]] group of dialects is distinct, which comrpises the [[Rhodopes]] and everything southwards from Thessaloniki to Istanbul, although it is an Eastern dialect. The official language derives most often from the northeastern group of dialects nominally based on [[Veliko Tarnovo]] dialect. Many Western South Slavic lexical, morphological and phonological isoglosses are present in all Western Bulgarian dialects and rarer in Rup dialects, which peak in [[Torlakian]]. Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian dialects share characteristics far beyond the [[Torlakian]] area and beyond the contested territories of the medieval Bulgarian and Serbian states, which are west of Sofia. So, these political entities are not responsible for the transitional features, but they are basically rooted in other type of evolution, likely in a makeup in the contact area of the two sources of Eastern and Western South Slavic tribes. The transitional dialect from [[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]] shares more similarities with Serbo-Croatian than with Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Речник на трънския говор, {{ISBN|9789549184853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The makeup of the transitional area shows a mix of Eastern and Western South Slavic characteristics found in western Bulgaria, which contact happened in the Balkans assuming the exact location of this area. All isoglosses commonly share gradual borders deep inside the country, but the northeast always don't, which likely means that the contact zone mixed after the settling of the Slavs in the Balkans. In one instance both ''a'' and ''ъ'' for nasal yus are part of Elin Pelin dialect. Probably one of the words that remain the same on one of the largest areas in Bulgaria is that for night ''nosht'', which is at best rare in other Slavic languages, in which along with the Torlaks in Bulgaria ''noch'' means night.

The same diversity of phonetic characteristics of the nosal  big [[yus]] (*ǫ) isoglosses as a root of the words ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/zǫbъ|zab]] [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/mǫžь|maž]], pat, bachva'', etc. featuring other vowels than ''u'' or ''o'', are likely documented only in [[Eastern South Slavic]] and [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] dialects. The official pronunciation of ''a'' was used in [[Ą#Polish|Medieval Polish]] and is now [[:pl: Język połabski#Aita nos ("Ojcze nasz")|used in]] [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]. The modern official Polish this is still inscribed with ''a'', but pronounced in number of varieties such as ''om'' as preserved in the [[Kostur dialect]] or ''e'' as in [[Varna]] dialect. Present and medieval Lechitic dialects are also likely the only documented speech that would match analogously with the ending of the standard Bulgarian verbs in first person in present tense with yus endings ''am'' or ''a'' in singular form (1st conj.- ''cheta'' "I read"; 2 conj.- ''slusham'' "I listen") or in plural form (1st conj.- ''chetem'' "we read"; 2nd conj.- ''slushame'' "we listen").  In eastern Bulgarian dialects in contrast with the other South Slavic languages, standard Ukrainian and Czech, the unstressed vowel ''e'' by [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] turns into ''i'' or ''ie''. The Bulgarian pronouns in third person ''toy, te'' are documented in [[:uk:Наддністрянський говір|some]] Ukrainian dialects.

Bulgarian dialects can be divided into the following dialectal groups and individual dialects:&lt;ref&gt;Per Stoykov.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Casas-Alvero conjecture''' is an open problem about [[polynomial]]s which have factors in common with their [[derivative]]s, proposed by [[Eduardo Casas-Alvero]] in 2001.
==Formal statement==
Let ''f'' be a monic polynomial of degree ''d'' defined over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic zero]].  If ''f'' has a factor in common with each of its derivatives ''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''i'')&lt;/sup&gt;, ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 then the conjecture predicts that ''f'' must be a power of a linear polynomial.  

==Analog in non-zero characteristic==
The conjecture is false over a field of characteristic ''p'': any [[inseparable polynomial]] ''f''(''X''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;) without constant term satisfies the condition since all derivatives are zero.  Another, separable,  counterexample is ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''p''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;

==Special cases==
The conjecture is known to hold in characteristic zero for degrees of the form ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; or 2''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''p'' is prime and ''k'' is a positive integer. Similarly, it is known for degrees of the form 3''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8800;&amp;nbsp;2, for degrees of the form 4''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; where
''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8800;&amp;nbsp;3, 5, 7, and for degrees of the form 5''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8800;&amp;nbsp;2, 3, 7, 11, 131, 193, 599, 3541, 8009. Similar results are available for degrees of the form 6''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and 7''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It has recently been established for ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12, making ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;20 the smallest open degree.

This article is about the phonology of [[Egyptian Arabic]], also known as ''[[Cairo|Cairene]] Arabic'' or ''Masri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ethnolink|arz|Egyptian Arabic}} at ''Ethnologue''&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with the [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]] of Egyptian Arabic as well as the [[phonological development]] of child native speakers of the dialect. To varying degrees, it affects the [[pronunciation]] of [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] by native Egyptian Arabic speakers, as is the case for speakers of all other [[varieties of Arabic]].

*{{note|1|1}} Not all Egyptians can pronounce &lt;span style="background:#FFC9CF;padding:0px 2px;"&gt;{{IPA|[p, v, ʒ]}}&lt;/span&gt;, which are mostly found in names or loanwords, not from Literary Arabic.{{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=22}}
*: {{IPAblink|ʒ}} (which can come from the deaffrication of {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}}) of Egyptianized loanwords tends to merge with {{IPAblink|ʃ}}; for example, {{lang|arz|جراش}} ('garage') is mostly pronounced {{IPA|[ɡɑˈɾɑːʃ]}} even by educated speakers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* {{note|2|2}} A few [[rural]] speakers away from [[Cairo]] pronounce {{IPAblink|ʒ}} instead of {{IPAblink|ɡ}},{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} but doing so in Egyptianized words is ''not'' considered [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestigious]].
* {{note|3|3}} {{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002}} argues that emphatic &lt;span style="background:#CAFF70;padding:0px 2px;"&gt;{{IPA|/ɾˤ, bˤ, mˤ, lˤ/}}&lt;/span&gt; are additional consonants in Egyptian Arabic with marginal status.
* {{note|4|4}} &lt;span style="background:#EEE8AA;padding:0px 2px;"&gt;{{IPA|/dˤ, q/}}&lt;/span&gt; are pronounced only in Literary Arabic loanwords.
*: Non-Egyptianized loanwords with {{IPAslink|q}} may be Egyptianized to {{IPAblink|ʔ}} or if approximated to {{IPAblink|k}} in a word having an open vowel, the front vowel {{IPAslink|æ}} is backed to {{IPAblink|ɑ}}.
*: Literary Arabic words having {{IPA|/dˤ/}}, are normally substituted with {{IPAblink|d}}, with the front vowel {{IPAslink|æ}} in these words being backed to {{IPAblink|ɑ}}.
*: Non-Egyptianized loanwords having [[interdental consonant]]s ({{IPAslink|θ}}, {{IPAslink|ð}}) are always approximated to [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]s ({{IPAblink|s}}, {{IPAblink|z}}).
{{refend}}

Traditionally, the &lt;!--the case isn't restricted to words of Literary Arabic origin--&gt; [[interdental consonant]]s {{IPA|/θ ð ðˤ/}} correspond to the Egyptian Arabic [[alveolar consonant]]s {{IPA|/t d dˤ/}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This is a feature common to some North African Arabic varieties and is attested in ''pre-modern'' words:
* {{IPA|/θ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t/}}: {{IPA|/taʕlab/}} ('fox') from {{IPA|*/θaʕlab/}} {{lang|ar|ثعلب}} (and never {{IPA|/saʕlab/}}). Likewise: {{IPA|/talɡ/}} ('ice') from {{IPA|*/θalɟ/}} {{lang|ar|ثلج}}, {{IPA|/taman/}} ('price') from {{IPA|*/θaman/}} {{lang|ar|ثمن}}, {{IPA|/talaːta/}} ('three') from {{IPA|*/θalaːθa/}} {{lang|ar|ثلاثة}}, {{IPA|/miħraːt/}} ('plough') from {{IPA|*/miħraːθ/}} {{lang|ar|محراث}}, and {{IPA|/ʕatar/}} ('tripped') from {{IPA|/*ʕaθar/}} {{lang|ar|عثر}}.
* {{IPA|/ð/}} &gt; {{IPA|/d/}}: {{IPA|/deːl/}} ('tail') from {{IPA|*/ðajl/}} {{lang|ar|ذيل}} and never {{IPA|/zajl/}}. Likewise {{IPA|/dakar/}} ('male') from {{IPA|*/ðakar/}} {{lang|ar|ذكر}}, {{IPA|/kidib/}} ('lied') from {{IPA|*/kaðib/}} {{lang|ar|كذب}}, and {{IPA|/diːb/}} ('wolf') from {{IPA|*/ðiʔb/}} {{lang|ar|ذئب}}.
* {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/d(ˤ)/}}&lt;!--rarely pronounced when not near /a/--&gt;: {{IPA|/d(ˤ)ufr/}} ('nail') from {{IPA|*/ðˤufr/}} {{lang|ar|ظفر}} and never {{IPA|/zˤufr/}}. Likewise {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/dˤ/}}: {{IPA|/dˤalma/}} ('darkness'), from {{IPA|*/ðˤulma/}} {{lang|ar|ظلمة}}.

However, unlike other North African varieties, in Egyptian Arabic,  the Literary Arabic interdental consonants {{IPA|/θ ð ðˤ/}} may correspond to [[sibilant consonant]]s {{IPA|/s z zˤ/}}.{{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=22}}

* {{IPA|/θ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/s/}}: {{IPA|/sawra/}} ('revolution') as opposed to {{IPA|/θawra/}} {{lang|ar|ثورة}}
* {{IPA|/ð/}} &gt; {{IPA|/z/}}: {{IPA|/ʔizaːʕa/}} ('broadcasting') as opposed to {{IPA|/ʔiðaːʕa/}} {{lang|ar|إذاعة}}
* {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/zˤ/}}: {{IPA|/bazˤr/}} ('clitoris') as opposed to {{IPA|/baðˤr/}} {{lang|ar|بظر}}

Classical Arabic reflex ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ǧīm}}'' {{lang|ar|ج}} {{IPA|*/ɟ/}} is realized as [[velar consonant|velar]] in Cairene Egypt in the same way as it is in some southern Arabic dialects in Yemen.{{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=16}} Thus, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ǧabal}}'' {{lang|ar|جبل}}, ('mountain'), is pronounced, even in Literary Arabic as {{IPA|[ˈɡæbæl]}} rather than {{IPA|/d͡ʒabal/}}.

Other consonants are more marginal. In addition to appearing in native words, {{IPA|/r/}} also appears in loanwords from European languages, such as {{IPA|[bɑɾɑˈʃot]}} ('parachute'), and native words with guttural vowels, such as {{IPA|[ˈbɑʔɑɾi]}} ('my cows'){{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=22}} vs {{IPA|[ˈbæʔæɾi]}} ('cowlike'). Labial emphatics {{IPA|/bˤ/}} and {{IPA|/mˤ/}} also come from loanwords; minimal pairs include {{IPA|/bˤaːbˤa/}} ('patriarch') vs {{IPA|/baːba/}} ('[[Paopi]]').{{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=22}} Classical Arabic *{{IPAslink|q}} became {{IPAblink|ʔ}} in Cairo (a feature shared with [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]] and other forms of [[Levantine Arabic]]),{{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=17}} but {{IPAslink|q}} is retained natively in some dialects to the west of the Nile Delta, outside of [[Alexandria]],{{sfnp|Behnstedt|1985|p=?}} and has been reintroduced as a marginal phoneme from Standard Arabic, particularly relating to certain religious words {{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=17}} and those deriving from the root ''[[ṯāʾ|{{transl|ar|DIN|Ṯ}}]]''-''[[qoph|{{transl|ar|DIN|Q}}]]''-''[[pe (letter)|{{transl|ar|DIN|F}}]]'', relating to [[culture]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. In mildly careful speech, {{IPA|/q/}} is used to distinguish between words that would otherwise be identical.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For example, {{lang|ar|قانون}} may be either {{IPA|[qɑˈnuːn]}} ('law') or {{IPA|[ʔæˈnuːn]}} ('[[kanun (instrument)|kanun]]'); {{lang|ar|قوى}} may be either {{IPA|[ˈqɑwi]}} ('strong') or {{IPA|[ˈʔæwi]}} ('very'), although {{IPA|[ˈʔæwi]}} could be used for both meanings). {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|p}}, and {{IPAslink|ʒ}} also appear in loanwords, such as {{IPA|[ʒæˈkettæ, ˈʒæ(ː)ket]}} ('jacket').

==== Allophones ====
* [[Pharyngeal consonant]]s:
** The sequence {{IPA|/ħ'''h'''/}} is more commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ħ'''ħ''']}}, especially outside of careful speech.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For example, 'opened it'&lt;sup&gt;(feminine)&lt;/sup&gt;' &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|/fæˈtæħ'''h'''æ/}} → {{IPA|[fæˈtæħ'''ħ'''æ]}}.
** The sequence {{IPA|/ʕh/}} is more commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʕ̞ħ]}} (or sometimes {{IPA|[ħħ]}}), especially outside of careful speech.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  For example, {{IPA|/bitaʕha/}} ('hers') → {{IPA|[beˈtæʕ̞ħæ]}} or {{IPA|[beˈtæħħæ]}}.
** The sequence {{IPA|/ʒʃ/}} is more commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʃʃ]}}. For example, {{IPA|/mamantiʒʃ/}}  ('didn't montage') → {{IPA|[mæmænˈteʃ(ʃ)]}}.

==== Assimilation ====
* {{IPAslink|n}} before {{IPAslink|b}}:
** Often, the sequence of {{IPA|/nb/}} assimilates to {{IPA|[mb]}}. 
**: Examples: {{IPA|/zanb/}} ('guilt') → {{IPA|[zæmb]}}; {{IPA|/ʔanˈbuːba/}} ('tube') {{IPA|[ʔæmˈbuːbæ]}}; {{IPA|/ilˈlinbi/}} ('[[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]]') → {{IPA|[elˈlembi]}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An Egyptian popular film called, ''el-Lembi'' ({{lang|arz|اللمبى}}), named after [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], but has no relation to him.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sibilant consonant]]s before {{IPAslink|ʃ}}:
** The sequences {{IPA|/sʃ/}} and {{IPA|/sˤʃ/}} are more commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ss]}}, especially outside of careful speech.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For example, {{IPA|/mabas'''ʃ'''/}} ('didn't kiss') → {{IPA|[mæˈbæ'''s(s)''']}}
** The sequences {{IPA|/zʃ/}} and {{IPA|/zˤʃ/}} are more commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ss]}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For example, {{IPA|/mabazˤʃ/}} ('wasn't corrupt') → {{IPA|[mɑˈbɑs(s)]}}.

; Voicing and devoicing
For some speakers, there is a [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing and devoicing]] [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] for the following consonants:
* Voiced: {{IPAslink|t}} → {{IPAblink|d}}; {{IPAslink|s}} → {{IPAblink|z}}; {{IPAslink|sˤ}} → {{IPAblink|zˤ}}; {{IPAslink|k}} → {{IPAblink|ɡ}}; {{IPAslink|x}} → {{IPAblink|ɣ}}; {{IPAslink|ʃ}} → {{IPAblink|ʒ}}; {{IPAslink|f}} → {{IPAblink|v}};  {{IPAslink|tˤ}} → {{IPAblink|d}}.
* Devoiced: {{IPAslink|d}} → {{IPAblink|t}}; {{IPAslink|z}} → {{IPAblink|s}}; {{IPAslink|zˤ}} → {{IPAblink|sˤ}}; {{IPAslink|ɡ}} → {{IPAblink|k}}; {{IPAslink|ɣ}} → {{IPAblink|x}}; {{IPAslink|ʒ}} → {{IPAblink|ʃ}}; {{IPAslink|v}} → {{IPAblink|f}}.
When the input consonants differ only in voicing, the resultant assimilation will be complete.
** Examples on voicing assimilation: {{IPA|/la'''x'''batˤ/}} ('he/it confused') → {{IPA|[ˈlɑ'''ɣ'''bɑtˤ]}}; {{IPA|/ji'''s'''baʔ/}} ('outrun') → {{IPA|[ˈje'''z'''bæʔ]}}; {{IPA|/ma'''ʃ'''ˈbuːh/}} ('suspected') → {{IPA|[mæ'''ʒ'''ˈbuːh]}}; {{IPA|/la'''f'''zˤ/}} ('utter') → {{IPA|[lɑ'''v'''zˤ]}}; {{IPA|/mi'''t'''ˈdaːjiʔ/}} ('annoyed') → {{IPA|[me'''d'''ˈdæːjeʔ]}}, a complete assimilation.
** Examples of devoicing assimilation: {{IPA|/mo'''ɡ'''ˈtamaʕ/}} ('society') → {{IPA|[mo'''k'''ˈtæmæʕ]}}; {{IPA|/jista'''ɣ'''faɾ/}} ('ask forgiveness [of God]') → {{IPA|[jesˈtɑ'''x'''fɑɾ]}}; {{IPA|/xa'''d'''t/}} ('took') → {{IPA|[xæ'''t'''(t)]}}, a complete assimilation.

The [[Classical Arabic]] phonemes {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} are in the process of splitting into two phonemes each, resulting in the four Egyptian Arabic phonemes {{IPA|/æ æː ɑ ɑː/}}.  The front and back variants alternate in verbal and nominal paradigms in ways that are largely predictable, but the back variants {{IPA|/ɑ ɑː/}} occur unpredictably in some lexical stems, especially those of European-language origin.  This is discussed more below.

Vowels {{IPAblink|e}} and {{IPAblink|o}} are often regarded as allophones of the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} respectively instead of constituting separate vowel phonemes; so they cannot form minimal pairs. For further discussion regarding vowel allophony in Egyptian Arabic, see {{harvnb|Georgiou|2018}}.

{{IPAblink|eː}} and {{IPAblink|oː}} are derived from the [[Classical Arabic]] [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}}, respectively, when occurring in [[closed syllable]]s (i.e. not followed by a vowel).  Note that the diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} also occur in the same environment, due to later deletion of unstressed vowels and resulting contraction, e.g. {{IPA|/mudawla/}} {{IPA|[moˈdæwlæ]}} ('consultation') from Classical {{IPA|*/mudaːwala/}}.{{sfnp|Watson|2002|p=23}} Minimal pairs such as {{IPA|/ʃajla/}} {{IPA|[ˈʃæjlæ]}} ('carrying fem. sg.'  and {{IPA|/ʃeːla/}} {{IPA|[ˈʃeːlæ]}} ('burden') also occur.  Both of these words are derived from {{IPA|*/ʃaːjila/}}; {{IPA|/ʃeːla/}} is the phonologically regular outcome, while {{IPA|/ʃajla/}} is an analogical reformation based on the corresponding participial form {{IPA|/CaCCa/}} of other verbs of the same class.

Egyptian Arabic maintains in all positions the early post-Classical distinctions between short {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}.  Contrast, for example, [[Levantine Arabic]] dialects, which merge {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} into {{IPA|[ə]}} in most positions, and [[Moroccan Arabic]], which merges {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} into {{IPA|[ə]}} in all positions.  In particular, note the different shapes and vowel distinctions between {{IPA|[keˈtæːb]}} ('book') and {{IPA|[ɡoˈmæːl]}} ('beautiful' pl.) vs. {{IPA|[ɡeˈmæːl]}} ('camels') and {{IPA|[exˈtɑːɾ]}} ('he chose'); in most Levantine dialects, all the short vowels in these words are [[elision|elided]], leading to the identical shapes {{IPA|/ktaːb/}}, {{IPA|/ʒmaːl/}}, {{IPA|/xtaːr/}}.

An [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel is automatically inserted after the second of three or more consonants in a cluster to break up such clusters.  The epenthetic vowel is {{IPAblink|e}}, the same as {{IPA|/i/}}, but it remains {{IPAblink|e}} even when {{IPA|/i/}} surfaces as {{IPAblink|i}}, leading to minimal pairs:
*{{IPA|/bintɡamiːla/}} {{IPA|[ˈbent'''e'''ɡæˈmiːlæ]}} ('a beautiful girl')
*{{IPA|/binti ɡamiːla/}} {{IPA|[ˈbenti ɡæˈmiːlæ]}} ('my girl is beautiful')

==== Emphasis spreading ====
Many spoken [[Arabic varieties]] have developed two allophones of the [[Classical Arabic]] vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}}, with fronted allophones {{IPA|[æ æː]}} occurring in most circumstances, but backed allophones {{IPA|[ɑ ɑː]}} occurring in the vicinity of [[emphatic consonant]]s.  This process is known as '''emphasis spreading'''. The exact criteria of both "vicinity" and "emphatic consonant" varies depending on the individual speech variety.  In Egyptian Arabic, the occurrence of {{IPA|[ɑ ɑː]}} is no longer completely predictable, suggesting that these sounds have become [[phoneme|phonemicized]]; but see below for more discussion.

In Egyptian Arabic, the consonants that trigger emphasis spreading include the [[pharyngealized]] consonants {{IPA|/tˤ dˤ sˤ zˤ/}}, the {{lcons|uvular}} {{lcons|stop}} {{IPA|/q/}}, and some instances of {{IPA|/r/}} (see below).  On the other hand, the [[pharyngeal consonant]]s {{IPA|/ħ ʕ/}} do ''not'' trigger emphasis spreading; in the standard Cairene dialect, the {{lcons|velar}} [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/x ɣ/}} also do not, although this is different in many [[Sa'idi Arabic|Saidi]] dialects in which they are {{lcons|uvular}} {{IPA|[χ ʁ]}}.

In general, when emphasis spreading is triggered, the back variants {{IPA|[ɑ ɑː]}} spread both forward and backward throughout the phonological word, including any morphological prefixes, suffixes and [[clitic]]s. Note that this is different from many other Arabic varieties.  For example, in [[Moroccan Arabic]], emphasis spreading usually travels no farther than the first full vowel on either side of the triggering consonant, and in many varieties of [[Levantine Arabic]], emphasis spreading is of indefinite extent but is blocked by the phonemes {{IPA|/j ʃ/}}.  Nevertheless, emphasis spreading is not completely reliable, and there is some free variation, especially in the pronunciation of prefixes and suffixes at some distance from the triggering consonant.

Some instances of {{IPA|/r/}} trigger emphasis spreading, while others do not.  Originally, an {{IPA|/r/}} adjacent to {{IPA|/i/}} was considered non-emphatic, while others were emphatic and triggered emphasis spreading.  Currently, however, this is no more than a rough guideline, as many exceptions have since developed.  This situation has led many linguists to postulate the existence of two phonemes {{IPA|/r rˤ/}}, which both surface as {{IPA|[r~ɾ]}} but where only {{IPA|/rˤ/}} triggers emphasis spreading.  This analysis is not completely ideal in that these two resulting "phonemes" {{IPA|/r rˤ/}} alternate to a large extent (often unpredictably) in related forms derived from the same root.

Currently, to the extent that the emphatic or non-emphatic variant of /r/ can be predicted, it works as follows: If {{IPA|/r/}} is adjacent to a vowel {{IPA|/i(ː)/}}, emphasis-spreading is inhibited; otherwise, it occurs.  The {{IPA|/r/}} is able to "see across" [[derivational morphology|derivational]] but not [[inflectional morphology|inflectional]] morphemes.  As an example, {{IPA|[teˈɡɑːɾɑ]}} ('commerce') and {{IPA|[ˈtekbɑɾ]}} ('you grow' masc.) both have emphasis spreading, since {{IPA|/r/}} occurs adjacent to low {{IPA|/a(ː)/}} but not adjacent to any non-low front vowel.  On the other hand, of the derived forms {{IPA|[teˈɡæːɾi]}} ('commercial') and {{IPA|[tekˈbɑɾi]}} ('you grow' fem.), only the latter has emphasis spreading.  In this case, the derivational suffix {{IPA|/-i/}} ('related to') creates a new [[lexical item]] in the language's vocabulary, and hence the stem is reevaluated for emphasis, with the non-low front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} triggering non-emphatic {{IPA|/r/}}; but the inflectional suffix {{IPA|/-i/}} marking feminine singular does not create a new lexical item, and as a result the emphasis in the stem remains. (For these purposes, past and non-past forms of a verb are considered separate stems; hence alternations can occur like {{IPA|/istamarˤrˤ/}} 'he continued' vs. {{IPA|/jistamirr/}} 'he continues'.)

An emphasis-spreading {{IPA|/r/}} is usually adjacent to a low vowel {{IPA|/a(ː)/}} (which in turn is backed to {{IPA|/ɑ(ː)/}}), but that is not necessary, and {{IPA|/u(ː)/}} also triggers emphasis-spreading: Examples {{IPA|/maʃhuːrˤ/}} ('famous') → {{IPA|[mɑʃˈhuːɾ]}}, {{IPA|/maʃrˤuːʕ/}} ('project') → {{IPA|[mɑʃˈruːʕ]}}, {{IPA|/rˤufajjaʕ/}} ('thin') → {{IPA|[roˈfɑjjɑʕ]}}.

The alternation between {{IPA|[æ(ː)]}} and {{IPA|[ɑ(ː)]}} is almost completely predictable in verbal and nominal paradigms, as well as in the large majority of words derived from Classical Arabic.  It is also irrelevant for the operation of the numerous phonological adjustment rules (e.g. vowel lengthening, shortening and elision) in Egyptian Arabic.  As a result, linguistic descriptions tend to subsume both under an [[Phoneme#Neutralization and archiphonemes|archiphoneme]] {{IPA|/a(ː)/}}.  On the other hand, there are a number of [[lexical item]]s in which "autonomous" {{IPA|[ɑ ɑː]}} tend to occur irrespective of the presence of emphatic consonants.  A few are in Arabic-derived words, e.g. {{IPA|[ˈmɑjjɑ]}} ('water'), but the majority are in words of foreign origin — especially those derived from European languages — where {{IPA|[ɑ ɑː]}} echo the vowel quality of {{IPA|/a/}} in those languages.

Different authors have proposed differing phonemic analyses of this situation:
*Some go ahead and treat all occurrences of {{IPA|[æ(ː) ɑ(ː)]}} as separate phonemes, despite the additional complexity of the resulting morphological descriptions;
*Some treat only "autonomous" occurrences of {{IPA|[ɑ(ː)]}} as phonemes {{IPA|/ɑ(ː)/}}, with all the rest subsumed under {{IPA|/a(ː)/}};
*Some have created new emphatic consonants (e.g. analyzing {{IPA|[ˈmɑjjɑ]}} as {{IPA|/mˤajja/}}, where underlying {{IPA|/mˤ/}} surfaces as {{IPAblink|m}} but triggers the back allophone {{IPAblink|ɑ}});
*Some have ignored the distinction entirely.
The approach followed here is to ignore the distinction in phonemic descriptions, subsuming {{IPA|[æ(ː) ɑ(ː)]}} as allophones of {{IPA|/a(ː)/}}, but where necessary to also include a phonetic explication (i.e. detailed pronunciation) that indicates the exact quality of all vowels.  Generally, these phonetic explications are given for the examples in the section on [[#Phonology|phonology]], and elsewhere whenever autonomous {{IPA|[ɑ(ː)]}} occurs.

===== Vowel shortening =====
All long vowels are shortened when followed by two consonants (including [[geminated]] consonants), and also in unstressed syllables, though they are but sometimes kept long in careful speech pronunciations of loanwords, as in {{IPA|/qaːˈhira/}} ('Cairo') and a few other borrowings from Classical Arabic with similar shapes, such as {{IPA|/zˤaːˈhira/}} ('phenomenon').{{sfnp|Mitchell|1956|p=112}} Long vowel {{IPA|[iː, uː]}}, when shortened collapse with {{IPA|[e, o]}} which are, as well, the shortened form of {{IPA|[eː, oː]}}; as a result, The following three words are only distinguished contextually:
# {{IPA|/ɡibna/}} {{IPA|[ˈɡebnæ]}} ('cheese')
# {{IPA|/ɡiːb/}}+{{IPA|/na/}} → {{IPA|/ɡibna/}} {{IPA|[ˈɡebnæ]}} ('we brought')
# {{IPA|/ɡeːb/}}+{{IPA|/na/}} → {{IPA|/ɡebna/}} {{IPA|[ˈɡebnæ]}} ('our pocket')

===== Vowel lengthening =====
Final short vowels are lengthened when the stress is brought forward onto them as a result of the addition of a suffix.

===== Vowel deletion ([[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]) =====
Unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are deleted (i.e. [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]) when occurring in the context /VC'''V'''CV/, i.e. in an internal syllable with a single consonant on both sides.  This also applies across word boundaries in cases of close syntactic connection.

===== Vowel insertion ([[epenthesis]]) =====
Three or more consonants are never allowed to appear together, including across a word boundary.  When such a situation would occur, an [[epenthetic]] {{IPAblink|e}} is inserted between the second and third consonants.

===== Vowel elision and linking =====
Unlike in most Arabic dialects, Egyptian Arabic has many words that logically begin with a vowel (e.g. {{IPA|/ana/}} 'I'), in addition to words that logically begin with a glottal stop (e.g. {{IPA|/ʔawi/}} 'very', from Classical {{IPA|/qawij(j)/}} 'strong').  When pronounced in isolation, both types of words will be sounded with an initial glottal stop.  However, when following another word, words beginning with a vowel will often follow smoothly after the previous word, while words beginning with a glottal stop will always have the glottal stop sounded, e.g.:
* {{IPA|/il walad (ʔ)aħmar/}} → {{IPA|[el ˈwælæˈdɑħmɑɾ]}} or {{IPA|[el ˈwælæd ˈʔɑħmɑɾ]}} ('the boy is red)
* {{IPA|/inta kibiːr ʔawi/}} → {{IPA|/inta-kbiːr ʔawi/}} {{IPA|[entækˈbiːɾ ˈʔæwi]}} ('you [masc. sg.] are very big')

The phonetic pronunciations indicated above also demonstrate the phenomenon of ''linking'', a normal process in Egyptian Arabic where syllable boundaries are adjusted across word boundaries to ensure that every syllable begins with exactly one consonant.

[[Elision]] of vowels often occurs across word boundaries when a word ending with a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, especially when the two vowels are the same, or when one is {{IPA|/i/}}.
More specifically, elision occurs in the following circumstances:
#When both vowels are the same, one will be elided.
#When final {{IPA|/i/}} is followed by initial {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} is elided.
#When any vowel is followed by initial {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} is elided.

|}

===== Multiple processes =====

Multiple processes often apply simultaneously. An example of both insertion and deletion working together comes from the phrase {{IPA|/il bint kibiːra/}} ('the girl is grown up'):
Example of insertion and deletion together:
*Underlying representation: {{IPA|/il bint kibiːra/}}
*Epenthesis in CCC sequence: {{IPA|*/il bintekibiːra/}}
*Deletion of {{IPA|/i/}} VCVCV: {{IPA|[il bintekbiːra]}}
*Surface realization: {{IPA|[el ˈben.tekˈbiːræ]}}
Compare {{IPA|/il walad kibiːr/}} ('the boy is grown up'), where neither process applies.

Similarly, an example of both deletion and long-vowel shortening appears in the phrase {{IPA|/sˤaːħiba/}} ('friend' fem.):
*Underlying representation: {{IPA|/sˤaːħiba/}}
*Deletion of {{IPA|/i/}} in VCVCV: {{IPA|*/sˤaːħba/}}
*Vowel shortening in VCC: {{IPA|[sˤaħb+a]}}
*Surface realization: {{IPA|[ˈsˤɑħbɑ]}}
Compare with Classical Arabic {{IPA|/sˤaːħiba/}}.

The operation of the various processes can often produce ambiguity:
* {{IPA|/ana ʕaːwiz aːkul/}} → {{IPA|/ana ʕawz-aːkul/}} ('I [masc.] want to eat')
* {{IPA|/ana ʕaːwiza aːkul/}} → {{IPA|/ana ʕawza aːkul/}} → {{IPA|/ana ʕawz-aːkul/}} ('I [fem.] want to eat')
Hence, {{IPA|[ænæ ˈʕawˈzæːkol]}} is ambiguous in regards to grammatical gender.

== Phonotactics ==

=== Syllable structure ===

Egyptian Arabic has the following five syllable types: CV, CVː, CVC, CVːC, and CVCC.

CVː, CVːC, and CVCC are long, or [[Syllable weight|heavy]], syllables. Long syllables bear [[Stress (linguistics)|primary stress]], and there is only one stressed syllable per word.{{sfnp|Ammar|2002|p=154}}
Egyptian Arabic has a strong preference for heavy syllables, and various phonetic adjustments conspire to modify the surface pronunciation of connected speech towards the ideal of consisting entirely of heavy syllables.  Examples can be seen below:
*Shortening of long vowels to avoid superheavy syllables (CVːC.CV → CVC.CV)
*Lengthening of short vowels to avoid light stressed syllables (ˈCV.CV → ˈCVː.CV) or the increasingly rarer cases (ˈCV.CVC → ˈCVː.CVC) or avoiding heavy syllables and converting them into superheavy sullables (CVC → CVːC)
*Elision of short vowels to avoid sequences of light syllables (CV.CV.CV → CVC.CV)
*Insertion of short vowels to avoid three-consonant sequences, which would result in a superheavy syllable (CVCC.CV or CVC.CCV → CVC.CV.CV)
*Movement of syllable boundaries across word boundaries to avoid vowel-initial syllables (CVC VC VC → CV.C-V.C-VC)
*Insertion of a glottal stop when necessary to avoid vowel-initial syllables

An example of these various processes together:
{|class="wikitable"
|+{{IPA|/da illi ana ʕaːwiz-u/}} → {{IPA|/da-ll-ana ʕawz-u/}} ('that's what I want')
! Operation !! Result

|}

In the following and similar analyses, the normal-form pronunciation is given as the phonetic equivalent of the given phonemic form, although the intermediate steps may be given if necessary for clarity.

Other examples include {{IPA|/ana ʕaːwiz aːkul/}} ('I want to eat') → {{IPA|[ænæ ˈʕæwˈzæːkol]}}, {{IPA|/ana ʕaːwiz aːkul-u/}} ('I want to eat it') → {{IPA|[ænæ ˈʕæwˈzæklu]}}, and {{IPA|/humma ʕaːwiz+iːn jaːkul+u-ː/}} ('They want to eat it') → {{IPA|[hommæ ʕæwˈziːn jækˈluː]}}.

== Prosody ==

=== Stress ===
The position of stress is essentially automatic.  The basic rule is that, preceding from right to left in a word (from the end to the beginning of the word), the stress goes on the first encountered syllable of any of these types:

1. A [[heavy syllable]]: that is, a syllable ending in either a long vowel (CVː) or one or two consonants (CVC, CVCC){{clarify|reason=Maktab has two heavy syllables, but the first-encountered heavy syllable (tab) is not stressed; the second-encountered one (mak) is.|date=January 2016}}

2. A non-final light syllable that directly follows a heavy syllable

3. A non-final light syllable that directly follows two light syllables (i.e. ...CVCVˈCVCV...)

4. The first syllable of the word

Because the stress is almost completely predictable, it is not indicated in phonemic transcriptions (but ''is'' given in the corresponding phonetic explication).

== Phonological development ==

=== Phonemic developmental stages ===
{{Harvcoltxt|Omar|1973}} identifies three stages in the phonological acquisition of Egyptian Arabic, ending with completion of the consonant inventory (with the possible exception of {{IPAslink|q}}) at approximately age five.{{sfnp|Omar|1973|p=52}}

*'''Babbling stage: (~6–10 months)'''
The sound inventory found in the [[babbling]] stage does not technically consist of phonemes, but rather vowel- and consonant-''like'' sounds. Therefore, they are not true speech sounds.{{sfnp|Omar|1973|p=35}} Like children acquiring other world languages, Egyptian Arabic infants produce consonant-like sounds approximating {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|ʔ}}, {{IPAslink|h}}, {{IPAslink|ɣ}}, {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, {{IPAslink|m}}, {{IPAslink|w}}, {{IPAslink|j}}.{{sfnp|Omar|1973|p=38}}

*'''Stage I (~1–2 years)'''
At this stage children have acquired the basic {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} vowel triangle, and the consonants {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|m}}, {{IPAslink|w}}, {{IPAslink|j}}, and {{IPAslink|h}}. At this stage {{IPAslink|ʔ}} is only produced word-initially (possibly due to speakers’ tendency to insert a glottal stop on words which begin with a vowel). There is typically no voiced-voiceless contrast and no single-[[Gemination|double]] consonant contrast.{{sfnp|Omar|1973|p=45}}

*'''Stage II (~2–3 years)'''
Newly acquired phonemes are: {{IPAslink|t}}, {{IPAslink|d}}, {{IPAslink|k}}, {{IPAslink|ɡ}}, {{IPAslink|n}}, {{IPAslink|f}}, {{IPAslink|s}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, {{IPAslink|l}}, {{IPAslink|x}}, {{IPAslink|ɣ}}, {{IPAslink|æ}}, {{IPAslink|e}}, {{IPAslink|o}}. A voiced-voiceless contrast is now apparent in stops and fricatives. Consonant clusters appear but are unstable, often being omitted or simplified ([[Phonological development|consonant cluster reduction]]). The newly acquired [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPAslink|l}} is frequently used in place of the [[Alveolar flap|tap]]{{sfnp|Omar|1973|pp=48–49}}/[[Alveolar trill|trill]] {{IPAblink|ɾ}}~{{IPAblink|r}} ([[Lateral consonant|lateralization]]). Example: {{IPA|/madɾasa/}} ('school') → {{IPA|[mædˈlæsæ]}}

*'''Intermediate Stage II-III (~3–5 years)'''
Vowel length distinction, the [[Emphatic consonant|emphatics]] {{IPAslink|sˤ}}, {{IPAslink|zˤ}}, {{IPAslink|tˤ}}, {{IPAslink|dˤ}}; &amp;nbsp; {{IPAslink|ʕ}} (sometimes realized as {{IPAslink|ʔ}}) and {{IPAslink|ʃ}} (often realized as {{IPAblink|s}}) are acquired. A [[Gemination|geminated consonant]] distinction is developing, although children have difficulty with {{IPA|/xx/}} and its voiced pair {{IPA|/ɣɣ/}}.{{sfnp|Saleh|2007|pp=234–240}}

*'''Phonemic Stage III (Adult mastery ~5 years)'''
The tap/trill {{IPAslink|ɾ}}~{{IPAslink|r}} and all diphthongs and clusters are acquired, and geminate consonant distinction is stable. The phoneme {{IPAslink|q}} is rare in Egyptian Arabic and is typically only mastered with formal schooling at around age seven or eight, and is realized acceptably in the dialect as {{IPAblink|k}}.{{sfnp|Omar|1973|p=52}}

=== Cross-linguistic comparison and phonological processes ===
Egyptian Arabic phoneme acquisition has been chiefly compared to that of English. The order of phoneme acquisition is similar for both languages: Exceptions are {{IPAslink|s}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, and {{IPAslink|h}}, which appear earlier in Arabic-speaking children's inventory than in English, perhaps due to the frequency of their occurrence in the children's input.{{sfnp|Amayreh|1998}} Egyptian Arabic differs most from English in terms of age of phoneme acquisition: Vowel distinctions appear at an earlier age in Egyptian Arabic than in English, which could reflect both the smaller inventory and the higher functional value of Arabic vowels: The consonantal system, on the other hand, is completed almost a year later than that of English.{{sfnp|Omar|1973|p=60}} However, the lateral {{IPAslink|l}} is acquired by most Arabic-speaking children by age two, a year earlier than English-speaking children.{{sfnp|Saleh|2007|pp=154–160}} The most difficult phonemes for young Arabic children are emphatic stops, fricatives, and the tap{{sfnp|Amayreh|2000|p=84}}/trill {{IPAslink|ɾ}}~{{IPAslink|r}}. &amp;nbsp; {{IPAslink|x}} and {{IPAslink|ɣ}}, which are relatively rare sounds in other languages, are the most difficult geminate consonants to acquire.{{sfnp|Abou-Elsaad|2009|pp=275–282}}

==== Phonological processes ====
For children under two, [[Phonological development|syllable reduction]] and [[Phonological development|final consonant deletion]] are the most common phonological processes.{{sfnp|Saleh|2007|pp=234–240}} De-emphasis, involving the loss of the secondary articulation for emphatic consonants (e.g., realizing emphatic {{IPAslink|sˤ}} as {{IPAblink|s}}), may reflect the motoric difficulty of emphatic consonants, which are rare in world languages,{{sfnp|Amayreh|2000|p=94}} as well as their relatively low frequency and functional load in Arabic.{{sfnp|Amayreh|2000|p=100}}

The back fricatives {{IPAslink|ħ}} and {{IPAslink|x}} are unusually accurate at an early age and less prone to [[Phonological development|fronting]] than in other languages.{{sfnp|Amayreh|2000|p=87}}

=== Acquisition of syllable structure ===
Most children have mastered all syllable types between the ages of two and three. A preference for three-syllable words is evident (CVːC syllables being the most frequently produced) and production rarely exceeds four syllables. Simplification processes like those detailed above may occur to reduce CVCC syllables to CVːC or CVC syllables; however, when children change the syllable structure, they preserve the prosodic weight of the altered syllable in order to maintain stress relations.{{sfnp|Ammar|2002|pp=154–158}}

'''Estonian Sign Language''' ('''ESL''', {{lang-et|Eesti viipekeel}}) is the national [[sign language]] of [[Estonia]]. In 1998 there were about 4,500 signers out of a deaf population of 2000 and a hearing-impaired population ten times that number. It is widespread in the cities of [[Tallinn]] and [[Pärnu]] among deaf ethnic Estonians; deaf Russians in Tallinn use [[Russian Sign Language]], Russians outside Tallinn tend to use a Russian&amp;ndash;Estonian Sign Language pidgin, or may be bilingual. In its formative stages, Estonian Sign Language was influenced by Russian and [[Finnish Sign Language]]; for example, the ESL sign for 'butterfly' developed from the Finnish sign for 'bird'. There are several dialects, the most archaic of which is the Pärnu variety.

Like other sign languages, ESL is influenced by the local oral language. For instance, some signs are based on [[fingerspelling]] the first letter of an Estonian word, as in the sign for  ''restoran'' 'restaurant'. 

Instruction for parents of deaf children is available in Tallinn. Teaching and research began in 1990 at [[Tartu University]].

In [[graphic design]] and [[printing]], '''FPO''' (pronounced as an [[initialism]]) equates to '''for position only''' or '''for placement only'''. Blank placeholders or temporary low-resolution illustrations are [[Digital watermarking|watermark]]ed or stamped with the acronym FPO to indicate where the final version of an image is to be placed in the final file, film, or plate. FPO images are commonly used while the layout of a print project is being determined, and/or when desired images are still to be scanned or photographed. They preserve the [[pagination]] that will be needed once the final images are added. In web design, FPO placeholder images provide a means for coders to finish building a website without waiting for final photographic assets.

The purpose of stamping or watermarking "FPO" prominently over the image is to prevent the low-res image from being mistakenly kept in the final output. It also prevents the accidental inclusion of copyrighted images if the designers used an image whose use for which they do not have the rights as a placeholder. The watermark makes the image's not-final status egregiously obvious, whereas without the mark it would be subtler and easier to miss. This reduces the risk that production staff will forget to replace it with the final image. Rarely, an FPO image makes it into print, usually because the production staff was overly rushed.

'''Huizhou''' ({{zh|s=徽州话|t=徽州話|p=Huīzhōu-huà}}) or '''Hui''' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:徽|徽]][[wikt:语|语]]|t=[[wikt:徽|徽]][[wikt:語|語]]|p=Huī-yǔ}}), is a group of closely related [[varieties of Chinese]] spoken over a small area in and around the historical region of [[Huizhou (region)|Huizhou]] (for which it is named), in about ten or so mountainous [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|counties]] in southern [[Anhui]], plus a few more in neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangxi]].

Although the Hui area is small compared with other Chinese dialect groups, it displays a very high degree of internal variation. Nearly every county has its own distinct dialect unintelligible to a speaker from a few counties away. For this reason, bilingualism and multilingualism are common among speakers of Hui. It is estimated that there are around 4.6 million speakers of Huizhou varieties.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

In the Ming and Qing dynasties Jianghuai speakers moved into Hui dialect areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some works of literature produced in [[Yangzhou]], such as ''Qingfengzha'', a novel, contain Jianghuai Mandarin. People in Yangzhou identified by the dialect they speak, locals spoke the dialect, as opposed to sojourners, who spoke other varieties like Huizhou or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. This led to the formation of identity based on dialect. Large numbers of merchants from Huizhou lived in Yangzhou and effectively were responsible for keeping the town afloat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Features==
Phonologically speaking, Hui is noted for its massive loss of [[Syllable#Coda|syllable coda]]s, including -i, -u, and [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s:
{| class="wikitable"

Many Hui dialects have [[diphthong]]s with a [[close vowel|higher]] lengthened first part. For example, [[wikt:話|話]] ("speech") is {{IPA|/uːɜ/}} in [[Xiuning County]] (Standard Chinese {{IPA|/xuɑ/}}), [[wikt:園|園]] ("yard") is {{IPA|/yːɛ/}} in [[Xiuning County]] (Standard Chinese {{IPA|/yɛn/}}); [[wikt:結|結]] ("knot") is {{IPA|/tɕiːaʔ/}} in [[Yi County, Anhui|Yi County]] (Standard Chinese {{IPA|/tɕiɛ/}}), [[wikt:約|約]] ("agreement") is {{IPA|/iːuʔ/}} in [[Yi County, Anhui|Yi County]] (Standard Chinese {{IPA|/yɛ/}}). A few areas take this to extremes. For example, Likou in [[Qimen County]] has {{IPA|/fũːmɛ̃/}} for [[wikt:飯|飯]] ("rice") (Standard Chinese {{IPA|/fan/}}), with the {{IPA|/m/}} appearing directly as a result of the lengthened, [[nasalization|nasalized]] {{IPA|/ũː/}}.

Because nasal codas have mostly been lost, Hui reuses the 儿 {{IPA|/-n/}} ending as a [[diminutive]]. For example, in the [[Tunxi dialect]], [[wikt:索|索]] "rope" appears as {{IPA|/soːn/}} from {{IPA|/soʔ/}} + {{IPA|/-n/}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69364">'''Human security''' is an emerging paradigm for understanding global [[social vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] whose proponents challenge the traditional notion of [[national security]] by arguing that the proper referent for security should be at the human rather than national level. Human security reveals a people-centred and multi-disciplinary understanding of security involves a number of research fields, including [[development studies]], [[international relations]], strategic studies, and [[human rights]]{{clarify|date=January 2017}}. The [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s 1994 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref name="UNDP 1994"&gt;United Nations Development Programme (1994): Human Development Report&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a milestone publication in the field of human security, with its argument that insuring "[[freedom from want]]" and "[[freedom from fear]]" for all persons is the best path to tackle the problem of global insecurity.&lt;ref name="ASCC2010"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12782 |title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change |author=America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change, National Research Council |year=2010 |work= |publisher=The National Academies Press|chapter= "Chapter 16.

Critics of the concept argue that its vagueness undermines its effectiveness,&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;Paris, Roland (2001): Human Security - Paradigm Shift or Hot Air? In: ''International Security'', Vol. 26, No. 2. 87-102.[http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~rparis/Paris.2001.IS.Human%20Security.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; that it has become little more than a vehicle for activists wishing to promote certain causes, and that it does not help the research community understand what security means or help decision makers to formulate good policies.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive analysis of all definitions, critiques and counter-critiques, see Tadjbakhsh, Shahrbanou &amp; Chenoy, Anuradha M. '' Human Security: Concepts and Implications'', London: Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, other scholars have argued that the concept of human security should be broadened to encompass military security: 'In other words, if this thing called ‘human security’ has the concept of ‘the human’ embedded at the heart of it, then let us address the question of the human condition directly. Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder edged areas of security such as military security or state security.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Human Security as a Left-Over of Military Security, or as Integral to the Human Condition | title= Human Security and Japan’s Triple Disaster | editor= Paul Bacon and Christopher Hobson | url= https://www.academia.edu/7716521/Human_Security_as_a_Left-Over_of_Military_Security_or_as_Integral_to_the_Human_Condition | publisher= Routledge | location= London | page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for human security to challenge global inequalities, there has to be cooperation between a country’s foreign policy and its approach to global health. However, the interest of the state has continued to overshadow the interest of the people. For instance, Canada's foreign policy, "three Ds", has been criticized for emphasizing defense more than development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spiegel |first1=Jerry M. |last2=Huish |first2=Robert |title=Canadian foreign aid for global health: Human security opportunity lost |journal=Canadian Foreign Policy Journal |date=January 2009 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=60–84 |doi=10.1080/11926422.2009.9673492 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11926422.2009.9673492?journalCode=rcfp20 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |language=en |issn=1192-6422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The emergence of the human security discourse was the product of a convergence of factors at the end of the Cold War. These challenged the dominance of the neorealist paradigm’s focus on states, “mutually assured destruction” and military security and briefly enabled a broader concept of security to emerge. The increasingly rapid pace of globalisation; the failure of liberal state building through the instruments of the Washington Consensus; the reduced threat of nuclear war between the superpowers, the exponential rise in the spread and consolidation of democratisation and international human rights norms opened a space in which both ‘development’ and concepts of ‘security’ could be reconsidered.

At the same time the increasing number of internal violent conflicts in Africa, Asia and Europe (Balkans) resulted in concepts of national and international security failing to reflect the challenges of the post Cold War security environment whilst the failure of neoliberal development models to generate growth, particularly in Africa, or to deal with the consequences of complex new threats (such as HIV and climate change) reinforced the sense that international institutions and states were not organised to address such problems in an integrated way.

The principal possible indicators of movement toward an individualized conception of security lie in the first place in the evolution of international society's consideration of rights of individuals in the face of potential threats from states. The most obvious foci of analysis here are the UN Charter, the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) and its [[International Bill of Human Rights|associated covenants]] (1966), and conventions related to particular crimes (e.g.,genocide) and the rights of particular groups (e.g., women, racial groups, and refugees).&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt;

==Concept==

===UNDP's 1994 definition===
[[Mahbub ul Haq]] first drew global attention to the concept of human security in the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s 1994 ''Human Development Report'' and sought to influence the UN's 1995 [[Commission for Social Development|World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen]]. The UNDP's 1994 [[Human Development Report]]'s definition of human security argues that the scope of global security should be expanded to include ''threats in seven areas'':
[[File:UN Human Development Report 2008.svg|thumb|right|300px|Coloured world map indicating [[Human Development Index]] (as of 2008). [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Countries]] coloured green exhibit high human development, those coloured yellow/orange exhibit medium human development, and those coloured red exhibit low human development.]]
[[File:HDImap current.png|thumb|300px|The 2003 map]]
*'''Economic security''' – Economic security requires an assured basic income for individuals, usually from productive and remunerative work or, as a last resort, from a publicly financed safety net. In this sense, only about a quarter of the world’s people are presently economically secure. While the economic security problem may be more serious in [[developing countries]], concern also arises in developed countries as well. Unemployment problems constitute an important factor underlying political tensions and [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] violence.
*'''Food security''' – Food security requires that all people at all times have both physical and economic access to basic food. According to the [[United Nations]], the overall availability of food is not a problem, rather the problem often is the poor distribution of food and a lack of [[purchasing power]]. In the past, food security problems have been dealt with at both national and global levels. However, their impacts are limited. According to UN, the key is to tackle the problems relating to access to assets, work and assured income (related to economic security).
*'''Health security''' – Health Security aims to guarantee a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were [[infectious disease|infectious]] and [[parasitic disease]]s, whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the [[circulatory system]]. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, "Chronic Diseases" http://www.who.int/topics/chronic_diseases/en/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]], in both developing and industrial countries, threats to health security are usually greater for poor people in rural areas, particularly children. This is due to [[malnutrition]] and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.
*'''Environmental security''' – Environmental security aims to protect people from the short- and long-term ravages of nature, man-made threats in nature, and deterioration of the [[natural environment]]. In developing countries, lack of access to clean [[water resources]] is one of the greatest environmental threats. In industrial countries, one of the major threats is [[air pollution]]. [[Global warming]], caused by the emission of [[greenhouse gases]], is another [[environmental peacebuilding|environmental security issue]].
*'''Personal security''' – Personal security aims to protect people from physical [[violence]], whether from the state or external states, from violent individuals and sub-state actors, from [[domestic abuse]], or from predatory adults. For many people, the greatest source of anxiety is [[crime]], particularly violent crime.
*'''Community security''' – Community security aims to protect people from the loss of traditional [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and values and from sectarian and ethnic violence. Traditional communities, particularly minority [[ethnic group]]s are often threatened. About half of the world’s states have experienced some inter-ethnic strife. The United Nations declared 1993 the Year of Indigenous People to highlight the continuing vulnerability of the 300 million aboriginal people in 70 countries as they face a widening spiral of violence.
*'''Political security''' – Political security is concerned with whether people live in a society that honors their basic human rights. According to a survey conducted by [[Amnesty International]], [[political repression]], systematic torture, ill treatment or [[forced disappearance|disappearance]] was still practised in 110 countries. Human rights violations are most frequent during periods of political unrest. Along with repressing individuals and groups, governments may try to exercise control over ideas and information.

Since then, human security has been receiving more attention from the key global development institutions, such as the [[World Bank]]. Tadjbakhsh, among others, traces the evolution of human security in international organizations, concluding that the concept has been manipulated and transformed considerably since 1994 to fit organizational interests.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tadjbakhsh, [http://www.peacecenter.sciences-po.fr/journal/issue4pdf/issue4_guestEditorial_Tadjbakhsh.pdf "Human Security In International Organizations: Blessing or Scourge?"], ''The Human Security Journal'', Volume 4, Summer 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215124304/http://www.peacecenter.sciences-po.fr/journal/issue4pdf/issue4_guestEditorial_Tadjbakhsh.pdf |date=February 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond===
In an ideal world, each of the UNDP's seven categories of threats (and perhaps others as a broader discussion might prioritize) would receive adequate global attention and resources. Yet attempts to implement this human security agenda have led to the emergence of two major schools of thought on how to best practice human security – ''''''"Freedom from Fear"'''''' and ''''''"Freedom from Want"''''''. While the UNDP 1994 report originally argued that human security requires attention to both ''freedom from fear'' and ''freedom from want,'' divisions have gradually emerged over the proper scope of that protection (e.g. over what [[Wiktionary:threat|threats]] [[individuals]] should be protected from) and over the appropriate mechanisms for responding to these threats.

*'''Freedom from Fear''' – This school seeks to limit the practice of Human Security to protecting individuals from violent conflicts while recognizing that these violent threats are strongly associated with poverty, lack of state capacity and other forms of inequities.&lt;ref name="HSC"&gt;Human Security Centre. “What is Human Security.” Retrieved on 19 April 2008 from http://www.humansecurityreport.info/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24&amp;itemid=59&lt;/ref&gt; This approach argues that limiting the focus to violence is a realistic and manageable approach towards Human Security. Emergency assistance, conflict prevention and resolution, peace-building are the main concerns of this approach. Canada, for example, was a critical player in the efforts to ban landmines and has incorporated the "Freedom from Fear" agenda as a primary component in its own foreign policy. However, whether such “narrow” approach can truly serve its purpose in guaranteeing more fruitful results remains to be an issue. For instance, the conflicts in Darfur are often used in questioning the effectiveness of the "Responsibility to Protect”, a key component of the Freedom from Fear agenda.
*'''Freedom from Want''' – The school advocates a holistic approach in achieving human security and argues that the threat agenda should be broadened to include hunger, disease and natural disasters because they are inseparable concepts in addressing the root of human insecurity&lt;ref name="UNDP 1994"/&gt; and they kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined.&lt;ref name="HSC"/&gt; Different from "Freedom from Fear", it expands the focus beyond violence with emphasis on development and security goals.

Despite their differences, these two approaches to human security can be considered complementary rather than contradictory.&lt;ref name="HSC"/&gt; Expressions to this effect include:

*[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s famous [[Four Freedoms]] speech of 1941, in which "Freedom from Want" is characterized as the third and "Freedom from Fear" is the fourth such fundamental, universal, freedom.
*The Government of Japan considers Freedom from Fear and Freedom from Want to be equal in developing Japan’s foreign policy. Moreover, the UNDP 1994 called for the world’s attention to both agendas.
*[[Surin Pitsuwan]], current Secretary-General of [[ASEAN]] cites theorists such as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Houme to conclude that "human security is the primary purpose of organizing a state in the beginning.".&lt;ref&gt;Pitsuwan, Surin. Regional Cooperation for Human Security. Keynote address to the International Development Studies Conference on Human Security: The Asian Contribution. October 2007. [http://humansecurityconf.polsci.chula.ac.th/Documents/Transcriptions/Keynote%20Speech%20on%20Regional%20Cooperation%20for%20Human%20Security.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to observe that the 1994 Human Development Report states that it is "reviving this concept" and suggests that the authors of the 1994 HDR may be alluding to Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech without literally citing that presentation.

Although "freedom from fear" and "freedom from want" are the most commonly referred to categories of human security practice, an increasing number of alternative ideas continue to emerge on how to best practice human security. Among them:
*'''[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]]'''.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Human Security as a Left-Over of Military Security, or as Integral to the Human Condition | title= Human Security and Japan’s Triple Disaster | editor= Paul Bacon and Christopher Hobson | url= https://www.academia.edu/7716521/Human_Security_as_a_Left-Over_of_Military_Security_or_as_Integral_to_the_Human_Condition| publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; James asks two apparently simple questions: Firstly, why, if 'the human’ as a category by definition encompasses all considerations of governance, the state and the military, does military security continue to be treated as prior, more significant, or even equal to human security. By contrast, "when children play ‘category’ games", he says, "they implicitly understand such issues of ordering". Secondly, why does human security get narrowly defined in terms of liberal notions of 'freedom': freedom from want and freedom from fear. In response to these two questions, he provides the following alternative definition, with human security encompassing military security:
::Human security can be defined as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. It makes sense that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt;{{rp|87}}
*'''G. King and C. Murray'''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Gary and Christopher Murray. Rethinking Human Security. Political Science Quarterly, Vol.116, No.4 #585-610 [http://gking.harvard.edu/files/hs.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; King and Murray try to narrow down the human security definition to one's "expectation of years of life without experiencing the state of generalized poverty". In their definition, the "generalized poverty" means "falling below critical thresholds in any domain of well-being"; and it is in the same article, they give brief review and categories of "Domains of Well-being". This set of definition is similar to "freedom from want" but more concretely focused on some value system.
*'''Caroline Thomas'''.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also in {{Cite journal | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | title = A conceptual framework for human security - working paper no. 2 | journal = Center for Research on Inequality, Human Security and Ethnicity (CRISE), Queen Elizabeth House | publisher = University of Oxford | year = 2002 | url = http://economics.ouls.ox.ac.uk/13003/1/workingpaper2.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regards human security as describing "a condition of existence" which entails basic material needs, human dignity, including meaningful participation in the life of the community, and an active and substantive notion of democracy from the local to the global.
*'''Roland Paris'''.&lt;ref name="Paris"/&gt; He argues that many ways to define "human security" are related with certain set of value and lose the neutral position. So he suggests to take human security as a category of research. As such, he gives a 2*2 matrix to illustrate the security studies field.

In a concept as such, she suggests the "vital core" cover a minimal or basic or fundamental set of functions related to survival, livelihood and dignity; and all institutions should at least and necessarily protect the core from any intervention.

===Relationship with traditional security===

{{see also|Political realism}}

Coined in the early 1990s, the term human security has been used by thinkers who have sought to shift the discourse on security away from its traditional state-centered orientation to the protection and advancement of individuals within societies.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"&gt;S. Neil Macfarlane and Yuen Foong Khong, "Human Security and the UN: A Critical History", ''Foreign Affairs'', http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61773/g-john-ikenberry/human-security-and-the-un-a-critical-history&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcudi, 2006"&gt;Arcudi, Giovanni (2006). [http://www.cairn.info/publications-de-Arcudi-Giovanni--30998.htm “La sécurité entre permanence et changement”], ''Relations Internationales,'' Vol. 1, No. 125, pp. 97-109. ISSN 0335-2013, [http://www.cairn.info/revue-relations-internationales-2006-1-page-97.htm DOI 10.3917/ri.125.0097]&lt;/ref&gt; Human security emerged as a challenge to ideas of traditional security, but human and traditional or [[national security]] are not [[mutually exclusive]] concepts. It has been argued that, without human security, traditional state security cannot be attained and vice versa.&lt;ref name="HSC"/&gt;

[[Image:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|300px|Europe after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648]]
'''Traditional security''' is about a state's ability to defend itself against external threats. Traditional security (often referred to as [[national security]] or [[state security]]) describes the philosophy of international security predominance since the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 and the rise of the [[nation-states]]. While [[international relations theory]] includes many variants of traditional security, from [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] to [[liberalism]], the fundamental trait that these schools share is their focus on the primacy of the [[nation-state]].

The following table contrasts four differences between the two perspectives:

| Traditional security seeks to defend states from external [[aggression]].''[[Walter Lippmann]]'' explained that state security is about a state's ability to deter or defeat an attack.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lippmann, U.S. Foreign Policy (Boston, 1943), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; It makes use of deterrence strategies to maintain the integrity of the state and protect the territory from external threats.
| In addition to protecting the state from external aggression, human security would expand the scope of protection to include a broader range of threats, including environmental pollution, [[infectious diseases]], and economic deprivation.
|-
| Actor(s)
| The state is the sole actor. Decision making power is centralized in the government. Traditional security assumes that a sovereign state is operating in an anarchical international environment, in which there is no world governing body to enforce international rules of conduct.
| The realization of human security involves not only governments, but a broader participation of different actors,&lt;ref name="Jeong"&gt;Jeong Ho-Won (undated): Human Security and Conflict. George Mason University. [http://www.gmu.edu/academic/hsp/Jeong.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; viz. regional and international organizations, non-governmental organizations and local communities.
|-
| Means
| Traditional security relies upon building up national power and military defense. The common forms it takes are armament races, alliances, strategic boundaries etc.
| Human security not only protects, but also empowers people and societies as a means of security. People contribute by identifying and implementing solutions to insecurity.

===Relationship with development===

{{see also|International development|Development economics}}

Human security also challenged and drew from the practice of international [[Development studies|development]].

Traditionally, embracing liberal market economics was considered to be the universal path for [[economic growth]], and thus [[Development studies|development]] for all humanity.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2001"/&gt; Yet, continuing conflict and human rights abuses following the end of the Cold War and the fact that two-thirds of the global population seemed to have gained little from the economic gains of [[globalization]],&lt;ref&gt;see ''Financial Times'', 24 December 1994 and ''New York Times'', 15 July 1996: 55&lt;/ref&gt; led to fundamental questions about the way [[Development studies|development]] was practiced. Accordingly, human development has emerged in the 1990s to challenge the dominant paradigm of liberal economy in the development community. Human development proponents argue that economic growth is insufficient to expand people’s choice or capabilities, areas such as health, education, technology, the environment, and employment should not be neglected.

Human security could be said to further enlarge the scope for examining the causes and consequences of [[underdevelopment]], by seeking to bridge the divide between development and security. Too often, militaries didn’t address or factor in the underlying causes of violence and insecurity while development workers often underplayed the vulnerability of development models to violent conflict . Human security springs from a growing consensus that these two fields need to be more fully integrated in order to enhance security for all.

The paper "Development and Security" by Frances Stewart argues that security and development are deeply interconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Frances (2004). "Development and Security", Centre for Research on Inequality, Human Security, and Ethnicity (CRISE), Working Paper 3, London: University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Human security forms an important part of people’s well-being, and is therefore an objective of development.''&lt;br&gt; An objective of development is “the enlargement of human choices”. Insecurity cuts life short and thwarts the use of human potential, thereby affecting the reaching of this objective.
*''Lack of human security has adverse consequences on economic growth, and therefore development.''&lt;br&gt; Some development costs are obvious. For example, in [[wars]], people who join the army or flee can no longer work productively. Also, destroying infrastructure reduces the productive capacity of the economy.
*''Imbalanced development that involves horizontal inequalities is an important source of conflict.''&lt;br&gt; Therefore, vicious cycles of lack of development which leads to conflict, then to lack of development, can readily emerge. Likewise, virtuous cycles are possible, with high levels of security leading to development, which further promotes security in return.

Further, it could also be said that the practice of human development and human security share three fundamental elements:&lt;ref name=Alkire /&gt;

* First, human security and human development are both '''people-centered'''. They challenge the orthodox approach to security and development i.e. state security and liberal economic growth respectively. Both emphasize people are be the ultimate ends but not means. Both treat human as agents and should be empowered to participate in the course.
* Second, both perspectives are '''multidimensional'''. Both address people’s dignity as well as their material and physical concerns.
* Third, both schools of thought consider '''[[poverty]] and [[social inequality|inequality]] as the root causes of individual vulnerability'''.

Despite these similarities, the relationship with development is one of the most contested areas of human security . "Freedom from fear" advocates, such as Andrew Mack, argue that human security should focus on the achievable goals of decreasing individual vulnerability to violent conflict, rather than broadly defined goals of economic and social development. Others, such as Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, argue that human development and human security are inextricably linked since progress in one enhances the chances of progress in another while failure in one increases risk of failure of another.&lt;ref&gt;Tadjbakhsh &amp; Chenoy, Human Security: ''Concepts and implications'' , London: Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table is adopted from Tadjbakhsh&lt;ref&gt;S Tadjbakhsh, “Human Security”, 'Human Development Insights Issue 17, New York: UNDP HDR Networks&lt;/ref&gt; to help clarify the relationship between these two concepts.

===Relationship with human rights===

{{see also|Human rights}}

Human security is indebted to the [[human rights]] tradition (the ideas of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]]). The development of the human security model can be seen to have drawn upon ideas and concepts fundamental to the [[human rights]] tradition. Both approaches use the individual as the main referent and both argue that a wide range of issues (i.e. [[civil and political rights|civil rights]], cultural identity, [[right to education|access to education]] and [[right to health|healthcare]]) are fundamental to human dignity. A major difference between the two models is in their approach to addressing threats to human dignity and survival. Whilst the [[human rights]] framework takes a legalistic approach, the human security framework, by utilizing a diverse range of actors, adopts flexible and issue-specific approaches, which can operate at local, national or international levels.

The nature of the relationship between human security and [[human rights]] is contested among human security advocates. Some human security advocates argue that the goal of human security should be to build upon and strengthen the existing global human rights legal framework.&lt;ref name="Hampson, 2002"&gt;Hampson, F., ''Madness in the multitude: human security and world disorder,'' Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, other advocates view the [[human rights]] legal framework as part of the global insecurity problem and believe that a human security approach should propel us to move above and beyond this legalistic approach to get at the underlying sources of [[social inequality|inequality]] and violence which are the root causes of insecurity in today's world.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2001"&gt;Thomas, C., (2001) “Global governance, development and human security: exploring the links,” ''Third World Quarterly,'' Vol. 22(2):159-175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with non-governmental organizations===
[[Non-governmental organization|See also: Non-governmental organization]]

The term NGO (Non Government Organisation) cannot be simply defined due to complexities surrounding its structure, environment and complex relations it shares with its internal factions; being its organisational mission, membership and sources of funding, and external factors such as the relationship it shares with actors; detailing the economic, political and societal constructs they may be bound by. A generic understanding of the term may refer to the actions taken in the interests of independent, voluntary contributors which exist independently from governments and corporations, designed to represent and provide a collective voice to individuals regarding issues. These issues cover contributions to the fields and industries of human development, health and nutrition, human rights and education, and environmental concerns; all of which influence and affect human security.

The traditional roles of NGOs may be classified into three components, in accordance with Lewis:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Opoku-Mensah, Paul and Lewis, David and Tvedt, Terje, eds (2007) Reconceptualising NGOs and their roles in development: NGOs, civil society and the international aid system Aalborg University Press, Aalborg, Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;

-	Implementer: refers to the mobilisation of resources in order to aid the provision of goods and services, such as the act of service delivery.

-	Catalyst: refers to the emotional and psychological aspect of the NGOs ability to inspire, facilitate or contribute to spur action or thinking.

-	Partner: refers to the NGOs relationships shared with external actors such as governments, donors or the private sector players through joint activities, or projects with communities, with the purpose to strengthen the relationship between the NGOs and these partners in a mutually beneficial fashion.

The expansion of these roles have culminated in assisting the creation of a society where NGOs serve as important players in the global arena in regards to maintaining human security. Due to this increasing influence and the emergence of growing natural and man-made disasters, NGOs now are contracted by governments in order to adequately respond to crises, as well as assist individual or collectivised groups of citizens in lobbying their interests; thus culminating in the ability to enact, influence and change government agendas. However, NGOs are still largely dependent on certain levels of government funding, hence critics may argue that NGOs pose the ability to potentially damage issues of human security due to this financial dependence. Despite these critiqes, the focus, expertise and infrastructure developed by NGOs through their activities linked with human development and human rights allow them to make unique contributions to human security provision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Sarah. 2002. "The Role of NGOs in Human Security", Working Paper #12, The Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations and The Kennedy School of Government Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the environment===
Comprehensive human security attempts to unify environmental security together with social (societal) security. A great number of intertwined environmental and social components together create the framework for comprehensive human security under the assumption that neither of those two categories is attainable in the long run without synergy between the two.&lt;ref name=Westing&gt;{{cite book|last=Westing|first=Arthur|title=Arthur H. Westing: Pioneer on the Environmental Impact of War|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642313226|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-MauhNN-SAC&amp;dq=Pioneer+on+the+environmental+impact+of+war&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say that the trends in environmental, resource, and population stresses are intensifying and will increasingly determine the quality of human life on our planet and as such are a large determining factor of our social security.&lt;ref name="Pirages, DeGeest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pirages |last2 = DeGeest|first1=Dennis |first2=Theresa Manley|author-link1=Dennis C. Pirages |title=Ecological Security: An Evolutionary Perspective on Globalization|year=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847695010|pages=59–60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFA2CcxvwSkC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur H. Westing posits that the two interdependent branches of comprehensive human security can be broken down into a series of subcomponents to better achieve optimal environmental and social security. 
[[Environmental security]] is composed of two subcomponents: (a) Rational resource utilization, that is resource use that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”&lt;ref name="UN Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Global Issues, Environment|url=https://www.un.org/en/globalissues/environment/|work=he Brundtland Report, “Our Common Future”|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Social security can be simplified to components of (a) Established political safeguards, (b) Economic safeguards, (c) Personal safeguards, and (d) Military safeguards.&lt;ref name=Westing /&gt;

The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) states that a major goal of comprehensive human security is to “transmit practical recommendations to policy-makers on how to strengthen human security through better environmental management and more effective natural resource governance.”&lt;ref name=IISD&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment and Human Security|url=http://www.iisd.org/ecp/es/|publisher=International Institute for Sustainable Development|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overreaching goal being a pervasive global mindset that recognizes the interdependent natures of the natural environment and our collective social security.

===Gender and human security===
Human security focuses on the serious neglect of [[gender]] concerns under the traditional security model. Traditional security’s focus on external military threats to the state has meant that the majority of threats women face have been overlooked. It has recently been argued that these forms of violence are often overlooked because expressions of masculinity in contexts of war have become the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coomaraswamy|first1=Radhika|title=Human Security and Gender Violence|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=October 29 – November 4, 2005|volume=40|issue= 44/45|pages=4729–4736|jstor=4417359}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on the individual, the human security model aims to address the security concerns of both women and men equally. However, as of recent conflicts, it is believed that the majority of war casualties are civilians and that "such a conclusion has sometimes led to the assumptions that women are victimized by war to a greater extent than men, because the majority of adult civilians are women, and when the populations of civilian women and children are added together, they outnumber male combatants. Furthermore, in the post-war context women survivors generally outnumber men and so it is often said that women as a group bear a greater burden for post-war recovery".&lt;ref name="Gender Matters in Global Politics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pankhurst|first1=Donna|editor1-last=Shepherd|editor1-first=Laura J.|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY|isbn=978-0-415-71521-8|pages=159–170|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often victims of [[violence against women|violence]] and conflict: they form the majority of civilian deaths; the majority of refugees; and, are often the victims of cruel and degrading practices, such as rape.&lt;ref name='Haq, 1999'&gt;Haq, K., 'Human Security for Women,' in Tehranian, M. (ed.),''Worlds Apart: Human Security and Global Governance'', London, I.B.Tauris Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}} Women's security is also threatened by unequal access to resources, services and opportunities.&lt;ref name='Haq, 1999'/&gt;{{rp|97–100}} The UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, as of 1995, suggested that the problem is not just a social one, but requires evaluation of the political institutions which uphold unequal system of domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Its Causes and Consequences|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/15YearReviewofVAWMandate.pdf|website=Office Of the High Commissioner|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's rights]] are neglected especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asian regions where customary practices are still prevalent. Although there are different opinions on the issue of customary practices, it infringes upon human security's notion where women and men are innated with equal human rights. Attempts to eradicate such violent customary practices requires political and legal approaches where human security in relation to gender should be brought up as the main source of assertion. Such cruel customary practices as honor killing, burning brides and widows, child marriage are still in existence because of women's vulnerability in economic independence and security. Human security in relationship to gender tries to overthrow such traditional practices that are incompatible to the rights of women. Also human security seeks to empower women, through education, participation and access, as gender equality is seen as a necessary precondition for peace, security and a prosperous society.&lt;ref name='Haq, 1999'/&gt;{{rp|105–107}}

==== Feminist Critiques of Human Security ====
===== Rape As A Weapon of War Theory =====
During times of conflict, certain varieties of masculinity come to be celebrated by the State, and these varieties of behaviors can influence how a population's combatants come to behave, or are expected to behave during crises. These behaviors range from acting aggressively and exemplifying hyper-masculine behaviors, to playing upon the rise of "nationalist or ethnic consciousness" to secure "political support for the cause and to undermine "the Other".&lt;ref name="Gender Matters in Global Politics"/&gt; Overtly militaristic societies have utilized rape and other sexually violent acts to further their gains within the context of war, but also by using such practices of violence as rewards to the (often male) combatants. This tactic undermines the enemy's morale, as they are seen as "unable to protect their women".&lt;ref name="Gender Matters in Global Politics"/&gt;

===== The Category of Human =====
Recent feminist critiques of Human Security often find difficulties with the concept and categorization of "Human". This categorization is made under the influence of certain value systems which are inherently exclusive by their nature. For instance, the liberal definition of "human" is: someone that is independent and capable of making decisions for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Sex and Social Justice|date=24 August 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195112108}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is problematic because it excludes persons who are not independent, such as persons with disabilities, from human security rights. If Human Security was to be entirely inclusive it would need to challenge the current definition of "human" on which it operates and acknowledge that different abilities also require rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marhia|first1=Natasha|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0967010612470293|title=Some humans are more Human than Others: Troubling the 'human' in human security from a critical feminist perspective|journal=Sage|date=February 11, 2013|volume=44|issue=1|pages=19–35|doi=10.1177/0967010612470293|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Eurocentrism =====
The concept of human security has developed out of the precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been critique of Human Security's focus on what is deemed acceptable behaviors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Laura J.|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY|isbn=978-0-415-71521-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human security perspectives view practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation as a threat to human (more specifically women) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional human security outlook, to see it as their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what human security looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.

===Prevent, react, and rebuild===

{{see also|Responsibility to protect}}

Human security seeks to address underlying causes and long-term implications of conflicts instead of simply reacting to problems, as the traditional security approach is often accused of doing. "The basic point of preventive efforts is, of course, to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the need for intervention altogether,"&lt;ref name="ICISS"&gt;ICISS "The Responsibility to Protect: Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty", Ottawa: International Development Research Council, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} while an investment in rehabilitation or rebuilding seeks to ensure that former conflicts do not breed future violence. The concepts of prevention and rebuilding are clearly embraced as the “responsibility to prevent” and well elaborated in "The [[Responsibility to protect]] report of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]]."

==Relationship with Humanitarian Action==

In several senses there is a natural fit between human security concepts and [[humanitarian principles]]. The concern with the protection of people or individuals is a core humanitarian value as well as of human security. In this sense it shares human security’s merging of development and security and the casting of the protection of life as the referent object.

Human security and [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian action]] also shared a similar process of evolution. The rise of the human security discourse in the 1990s paralleled an equally rapid expansion in humanitarian roles and a broadening in the objectives of [[humanitarianism]] that was labeled the ‘new humanitarianism’. Humanitarian assistance, once encompassing a narrow set of emergency based life saving interventions conducted by a small group of relatively independent actors, became ‘an organising principle for intervention in internal conflicts, a tool for peacebuilding and the starting-point for addressing poverty, as well as a palliative in times of conflict and crisis.’ It also merged with development concerns such as the promotion of social justice and societal cohesion.

The human security discourse was also used as a tool to resist aid policies becoming hijacked by narrow security concerns. States, such as the Republic of Ireland, promoted the Human Security concept as a way to ensure a more balanced approach to security and development issues both nationally and within the EU.

Despite the sense of a natural fit between human security concepts and humanitarian principles they have enjoyed a difficult relationship. Human security perspectives have the potential to interfere with the traditionally apolitical nature of humanitarianism in conflict situations, leading to a blurring of the boundaries between politico-military interventions and those designed primarily to reduce suffering.&lt;ref name="Arcudi, 2004"&gt;Arcudi, Giovanni (2004). [http://www.gipri.ch/publications/cahiers/cahier2/ “Forces de police et forces armées, sécurité et défense: où sont les frontières?”], ''Cahier du GIPRI,'' No. 2, pp. 17-64.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense the emphasis on human security has legitimised the idea of armed international intervention as a "moral duty" if states are deemed incapable or unwilling of protecting their citizens. Similarly the adoption of 'holistic' security and development strategies within UN Integrated peacekeeping missions is viewed by some as having the potential to compromise humanitarian principles.

Authors such as White and Cliffe drew attention to the way in which the 'broadening of aid objectives from pure survival support towards rehabilitation, development and/ or peace-building' led to the 'dilution of commitment to core humanitarian principles'. Furthermore, many humanitarian organisations have sought to develop rights-based approaches to assistance strategies which challenge the apolitical approach of traditional humanitarianism. Rights based approaches view poverty and vulnerability as rooted in power relations – specifically, the denial of power, which is itself related to the denial of human rights. Hence rights based approaches to humanitarian action relate the achievement of security for marginalized people to the realization of their human rights and often to broader social change. Multimandate humanitarian organisations that seek more inclusive and participatory forms of citizenship and governance and the achievement of broader social rights outcomes therefore risk enmeshing apolitical humanitarian responses in advocacy programmes that push for broader social changes.

==Practice==

While there are numerous examples of the human security approach in action, two notable global political events with direct ties to the human security agenda include the development of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principles guiding humanitarian intervention and the passage of the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.

===Humanitarian intervention===
{{main|Humanitarian intervention}}

The application of human security is highly relevant within the area of [[humanitarian intervention]], as it focuses on addressing the deep rooted and multi-factorial problems inherent in humanitarian crises, and offers more long term resolutions. In general, the term humanitarian intervention generally applies to when a state uses force against another state in order to alleviate suffering in the latter state (See, [[humanitarian intervention]]).

Under the traditional security paradigm humanitarian intervention is contentious. As discussed above, the traditional security paradigm places emphasis on the notion of states. Hence, the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention that are paramount in the traditional security paradigm make it difficult to justify the intervention of other states in internal disputes. Through the development of clear principles based on the human security concept, there has been a step forward in the development of clear rules of when humanitarian intervention can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.

These principles on humanitarian intervention are the product of a debate pushed by [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]]. He posed a challenge to the international community to find a new approach to [[humanitarian intervention]] that responded to its inherent problems.&lt;ref name="ICISS"/&gt; In 2001, the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) produced the "[[Responsibility to protect]]", a comprehensive report detailing how the “right of humanitarian intervention” could be exercised. It was considered a triumph for the human security approach as it emphasized and gathered much needed attention to some of its main principles:

*The protection of individual welfare is more important than the state. If the security of individuals is threatened internally by the state or externally by other states, state authority can be overridden.
*Addressing the root causes of humanitarian crises (e.g. economic, political or social instability) is a more effective way to solve problems and protect the long-term security of individuals.
*Prevention is the best solution. A collective understanding of the deeper social issues along with a desire to work together is necessary to prevent humanitarian crises, thereby preventing a widespread absence of human security within a population (which may mean investing more in development projects).

The report illustrates the usefulness of the human security approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify humanitarian intervention. In addition, it could also act as a paradigm for identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for humanitarian intervention in the first place. However, human security still faces difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring humanitarian intervention usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects.&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas, N. and Tow, WT. (2002) "The Utility of Human Security: Sovereignty and Humanitarian Intervention SAGE Publications, Vol. 33(2): 177-192"&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, successful examples of the use of human security principles within interventions can be found.

The success of humanitarian intervention in international affairs is varied. As discussed above, humanitarian intervention is a contentious issue. Examples of humanitarian intervention illustrate, that in some cases intervention can lead to disastrous results, as in [[Srebrenica]] and [[Somalia]]. In other cases, a lack of clarity as to the rules of when intervention can occur has resulted in tragic inaction, as was witnessed during the [[Rwandan genocide]]. One example is of a successful humanitarian intervention and also of humanitarian principles being applied is [[East Timor]] which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful humanitarian intervention but also an effective application of human security principles.

===Anti-personnel landmines===
{{main|Ottawa Convention}}
[[File:Ottawa Treaty members.svg|thumb|350px|{{legend|#0078ac|State Parties to the Ottawa Treaty}}]]In contrast to the traditional security discourse which sees security as focused on protecting state interests, human security proponents believe that [[Anti-personnel mine]]s could not be viable weapons of war due to the massive collateral damage they cause, their indiscriminate nature and persistence after conflict. In particular, they argue that Anti-personnel mines differ from most weapons, which have to be aimed and fired since they have the potential to kill and maim long after the warring parties have ceased fighting. The [[United Nations]] has reckoned that landmines are at least ten times more likely to kill or injure a civilian after a conflict than a combatant during hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList74/C2951729922B4364C1256B6600599BF2]&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are also long-lasting. The [[ICBL]] estimates that anti-personnel mines were the cause of 5,751 casualties in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbl.org/lm/2007/es/introduction.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas traditionally, states would justify these negative impacts of mines due to the advantage they give on the battlefield, under the human security lens, this is untenable as the wide-ranging post-conflict impact on the day-to-day experience of individuals outweighs the military advantage.

The [[Ottawa Treaty|Ottawa Convention]], which led to the banning of anti-personnel landmines, is seen as a victory for the Human Security agenda. The Ottawa Convention has proved to be a huge step forward in the 'Freedom from Fear' approach. In Ottawa, the negotiations were moved outside traditional disarmament forums, thus avoiding the entrenched logic of traditional arms control measures.&lt;ref name="Hubert, 2000"&gt;Don Hubert, "The Landmine Treaty: A Case Study in Humanitarian Advocacy" Watson Institute for International Studies, Occasional Paper #42, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}
According to Don Hubert, an advocate of Human Security from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, the main reason for its success was a multilateral focus. While [[INGO]]'s like the UN and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] remain the key players along with [[middle power]] states like Norway and Canada, its actual power and push comes from the involvement of a host of [[civil society]] actors (NGOs) and the general public.&lt;ref name="Hubert, 2000"/&gt; Human Security proponents believe that this treaty has set new standards in humanitarian advocacy and has acted as a landmark in international lawmaking for a more secure world.

Critics of the treaty, however, caution against complacency on its success. Many states, they point out, have neither signed nor ratified this convention. They include China, Russia and the United States who are major contributors to the global weapons trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2007/ |title=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor |publisher=Icbl.org |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, even though there were a diverse group of civil society actors, the real influence on the treaty came from the ones in the 'global north'. Third, cynics may argue that the success of this campaign stems from the fact that these weapons were outdated and of limited military value and this treaty just helped to accelerate a process that would have happened anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Fen Osler Hampson, "Chap.5: Promoting the Safety of Peoples: Banning Anti-Personnel Landmines", from Madness in the Multitude: Human Security and World Disorder, Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Walter Dorn raises several additional criticisms. In particular he asks whether it is in fact as radical a departure in foreign policy terms as is sometimes claimed. Dorn argues that international community has been concerned with issues of human safety since at least the time of the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the 1860s. Stuart Gordon argues that Canada, one of its principal adherents, has in many ways simply recast its traditional Pearsonian foreign policy in the language of human security. 
Dorn also questioned whether the concept was really necessary ‘since all the initiatives in the human security agenda were already advancing before the advent of the concept.’ Finally he suggests that the concept may be counterproductive. In their effort to fortify against ‘virtually limitless UN interventionism’ governments may repress ‘their populations into servility."

Richard Jolly and Deepayan Basu Ray, in their UNDP report, suggest that the key criticisms of human security include: Human security does not have any definite boundaries, therefore anything and everything could be considered a risk to security. This makes the task of policy formulation nearly impossible; Human security, when broadened to include issues like climate change and health, complicates the international machinery for reaching decisions or taking action on the threats identified; Human security risks engaging the military in issues best tackled through non-military means; Human security under the UN risks raising hopes about the UN’s capacity, which it cannot fulfil.

Other authors, such as Roland Paris, argue that human security is not such a fundamental recasting of the security debate in terms of a central struggle ‘between Realist, traditional, state-based, interest-based, approaches and new, Liberal cosmopolitan, de-territorialised, values-based approaches, which focus on individual human needs. ‘ Rather, he suggests that the talk of two radically different ‘paradigms’ has been much exaggerated.

==Formulation of a Human Security Index and an environment for discussing same==

As if to answer the points above, a Human Security Index&lt;ref&gt;David A. Hastings, "Describing the Human Condition – from Human Development to Human Security", GIS-IDEAS 2008 Conference "Towards a Sustainable and Creative Humanosphere", 2008 online &lt;http://wgrass.media.osaka-cu.ac.jp/gisideas08/viewabstract.php?id=299&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was prototyped and released in 2008. Project coordinator D. A. Hastings notes that "if one were challenged to create an index on the condition of people-centric Human Security, such as the authors of the Human Development Index faced in 1990 and expanded qualitatively in 1994, one could now begin to do so – at least for the sake of discussion and resultant improvements." The release document and a United Nations Bangkok Working Paper&lt;ref&gt;David A. Hastings, "From Human Development to Human Security: A Prototype Human Security Index", United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Working Paper WP/09/03, 2009 online &lt;http://www.unescap.org/publications/detail.asp?id=1345&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; publish and discuss the original approach, which is based partly on:
*'''The original [[Human Development Index]] of the [[United Nations Development Programme]]''', made more geographically complete (to 230+ countries) as described in a report issued by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unescap.org/publications/detail.asp?id=1308 |last=Hastings |first=David A. |year=2009 |title=Filling Gaps in the Human Development Index |work=United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Working Paper WP/09/02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The essay on Human Security in the 1994 Human Development Report'''.
*'''An Equitability/Inclusiveness Enhanced Human Development Index''' – in which each of the components of the HDI (education, health, and income) are modified by an indicator of equitability in an attempt to adjust, for example, for the gap between the indicator of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Per Capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity) and the desired measure of financial resources "in the pocket" of a typical person in a country. In that index some countries with relatively equitable ratings compared to their Human Development Index (such as Iceland, the Slovak Republic, and Estonia) do relatively well, whereas some countries with relatively inequitable ratings compared to their HDI (such as Ireland, Greece, and the USA) do less well.
*'''A Social Fabric Index''' which enumerates human security with respect to environment, diversity, peacefulness, freedom from corruption, and info empowerment. This was blended with the Human Development Index to form the prototype Human Security Index.

A 2010 enhancement to the HSI recast the composite index around a trinity of Economic, Environmental, and Social Fabric Indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humansecurityindex.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hsiv2-documentation-report1_1.pdf |last=Hastings |first=David A. |year=2012 |title=The Human Security Index: An Update and a New Release |work=HumanSecurityIndex.org Documentation Report V.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is thus conceptually similar to the [[Triple Bottom Line]] of [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] as described by [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]], as well as to the stated goals of the [[Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm |title=Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress - Home page |publisher=Stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release note of HSI Version 2 also notes efforts to balance local and global context, individual and society concerns, left-right political issues, east-west and north-south cultural and social issues. Current Version 2 of the HSI ingests about 30 datasets and composite indicators, and covers 232 countries and dependencies. It is released at HumanSecurityIndex.org.

Considerable differences in national ratings and standings have been noted between the HSI and indicators such as GDP per capita or the Human Development Index. Several small island countries plus Bhutan, Botswana, and some central-eastern European countries do considerably better in the HSI than they do in GDP per capita or HDI. Conversely, Greece and some Eurozone peers such as Ireland and Spain, several countries in the Gulf, Israel, Equatorial Guinea, the USA and Venezuela do worse in the HSI than in GDP per capita or HDI. Influential factors vary (as is viewed in the data and discussions on the HumanSecurityIndex.org Website), but include diversity and income equality, peacefulness, and governance.

'''Kabyle''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|b|aɪ|l}}, or '''Kabylian''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|b|aɪ|l|i|ən}} (native name: ''Taqbaylit'', {{IPA-tam|θɐqβæjlɪθ||Kab-Taqbaylit.ogg}}), is a  [[Berber language]] spoken by the [[Kabyle people]] in the north and northeast of [[Algeria]]. It is spoken primarily in [[Kabylie]], east of the capital [[Algiers]] and in Algiers itself, but also by various groups near [[Blida]], such as the Beni Salah and Beni Bou Yaqob.&lt;sup&gt;(extinct?)&lt;/sup&gt;

Estimates of the number of speakers range from five million to about seven million speakers worldwide, the majority in Algeria, according to [[INALCO]].

==Classification==
Kabyle is one of the [[Berber languages]], a family within [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]. It is believed to have broken off very early from [[proto-Berber language|proto-Berber]], although after the [[Zenaga language]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;'The Saharan Berber diaspora and the southern frontiers of Vandal and Byzantine North Africa', J. Conant and S. Stevens (eds),North Africa under Byzantium and Early Islam, ca. 500 – ca. 800 (Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine Symposia and Colloquia. Washington, D.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Fentress|author2=Andrew Wilson|editor1-last=Stevens|editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=Conant|editor2-first=Jonathan|title=North Africa under Byzantium and Early Islam|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|isbn=978-0-88402-408-8|page=52|chapter=The Saharan Berber Diaspora and the Southern Frontiers of Byzantine North Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Kabyle Berber is native to [[Kabylie]]. It is present in seven Algerian districts.

Approximately one-third of Algerians are Berber-speakers, clustered mostly near [[Algiers]], in Kabylian and Shawi, but with some communities in the west, east and south of the country.&lt;ref name="laval"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kabyles are the largest Berber group in Algeria, but may not constitute a majority.&lt;ref name="laval" /&gt;

The populations of Béjaïa (Bgayet), [[Bouïra|Bouïra (Tubirett)]] and [[Tizi Ouzou]] (Tizi Wezzu) provinces are in majority Kabyle-speaking. Kabyle is mainly spoken in the provinces of [[Boumerdès]], and as well as in [[Bordj Bou Arréridj]], [[Jijel]], and in [[Algiers]] where it coexists with [[Algerian Arabic]].

Kabyle Berber is also spoken as a native language among the Algerian Kabyle-descended diaspora in European and North American cities (mainly France). It is estimated that half of Kabyles live outside the Kabylian region.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Official status===
After the 2001–02 widespread Kabyle protests known as the [[Black Spring (Algeria)|Black Spring]], the Berber (Amazigh) language (with all its Algerian dialects and varieties) was recognized as a 'national language' in the 2002 Algerian Constitution, but not as an 'official language' until 2016 after a long campaign by activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35515769 |title=Algeria reinstates term limit and recognises Berber language |work=BBC News |date=7 February 2016 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic language is still the only ''de jure'' official language of Algeria. French is not recognized in any legal document of Algeria but enjoys a ''de facto'' position of an official language as it is used in every Algerian official administration or institution, at all levels of the government, sometimes much more than Arabic.

The Berber (Amazigh) language faces an unfavourable environment, despite a public radio (Channel II, which dates back to the [[Algerian War]]), as well as a public TV channel (Channel IV or Tamazight TV). Since private ownership of TV channels is illegal in Algeria, Kabyles have launched a private Kabyle speaking TV channel, called ''Berbère Television'', that broadcasts from Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in France (93).

In 1994, Kabyle pupils and students boycotted Algerian schools for a year, demanding the officialization of Berber, leading to the symbolic creation of the "Haut Commissariat à l'Amazighité" (HCA) in 1995. Berber was subsequently taught as a non-compulsory language in Berber speaking areas. The course being optional, few people attend.

President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika|Bouteflika]] has frequently stated that "Amazigh (the Berber language) will never be an official language, and if it has to be a national language, it must be submitted to a referendum".&lt;ref name="boutefliqa"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-03-19 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, President Bouteflika, stated that "there is no country in the world with two official languages" and "this will never be the case of Algeria".&lt;ref name="benchabane"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Benchabane|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, after four decades of pacific struggle, riots, strikes, and social mobilization, including the Berber spring (1980, riots and strikes in the Kabylie region of Tizi Ouzou, Bouira and Bejaïa, as well as Algiers) and the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] in 2001, President Bouteflika and his government stepped back and submitted to the Kabylie pressure by recognising Amazigh (Berber) as a "national language" without a referendum.

===Dialects===
[[File:Dialectes kabyles.PNG|thumb|right|Geographic distribution of Kabyle dialects&lt;ref&gt;K. Naït-Zerrad, [http://encyclopedieberbere.revues.org/1433 « Kabylie : Dialectologie »], in : Encyclopédie berbère, vol. 26 (Edisud, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many identify two dialects: Greater Kabylie (west) and Lesser Kabylie (east), but the reality is more complex than that, Kabyle dialects constitute a [[dialect continuum]] that can be divided into four main dialects (from west to east):

*Far-western: villages such as Tizi-Ghennif, Boghni and Draa el Mizan.
*Western: villages such as At Menguellat, At Yiraten, At Aïssi, At Yanni, 
*Eastern: 
** Eastern-West: villages such as At Mlikeche, Eastern-center : At Aïdel, At Khiar
** Eastern-East: villages such as At Sliman.
*Far-eastern: villages such as Aokas, Melbou, At Smail. Also known as Tasaḥlit and considered as a separate language by some according to ''[[Ethnologue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kab]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual intelligibility with Far-western is difficult to absent.

====Lexical differences====

At the exception of Far-eastern dialect, much of the vocabulary of Kabyle is common among its dialects though some lexical differences exist, example for the word ''dream'' in english (from west to east): bargu, argu, argu, bureg.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
The phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Kabyle.

===Vowels===
Kabyle has [[Vowel#Vowel systems|three phonemic vowels]]:

|}

{{angbr|e}} is used to write the epenthetic [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|[ə]}} which occurs frequently in Kabyle. Historically it is thought to be the result of a pan-Berber reduction or merger of three other vowels.

The phonetic realization of the vowels, especially {{IPA|/a/}}, is influenced by the character of the surrounding consonants; emphatic consonants invite a more open realization of the vowel, e.g. aẓru = {{IPA|[azˤru]}} 'stone' vs. amud = {{IPA|[æmud]}} 'seed'. Often /a, i, u/ are realized as {{IPA|[æ, ɪ, ʊ]}}.

====Assimilation====
In the Kabyle language there are various accents which are the result of assimilations (these accents are generally divided into western and eastern Kabyle). Some of these assimilations are present among all Kabyle "dialects" and some not. These assimilations are not noted in writing, such as:

*''Axxam n wergaz'' ("the house of the man") is pronounced either « axxam n wergaz », « axxam bb wergaz » or « axxam pp wergaz ». (N+W=BB)
*''D taqcict'' ("it's a girl") is pronounced « tsaqcict ». (D+T=TS)
*Here is a list of some of these assimilations: D/T+T=TS, N+W=BB/PP, I+Y=IG.

[[Gemination]] affects the quality of certain consonants, turning [[semivowel]]s and [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s into [[stop consonant|stop]]s; in particular, geminated ''ɣ'' becomes ''qq'', geminated ''y'' becomes ''gg'', and geminated ''w'' becomes ''bb''.

====Fricatives vs. Stops====
Kabyle is mostly composed of fricatives, phonemes which are originally stops in other Berber languages, but in writing there is no difference between fricatives and stops. Below is a list of fricatives vs. stops and when they are pronounced (note that [[gemination]] turns [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s into [[stop consonant|stops]]).

==Writing system==
{{Main|Berber Latin alphabet}}
[[Image:Panneau de signalisation multilingue à Issers (Algérie).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A trilingual sign in Algeria, written in Arabic, Kabyle (using Tifinagh), and French.]]
The most ancient Berber writings were written in the Libyco-Berber script ([[Tifinagh]]). Such writings have been found in Kabylie (also known as Kabylia) and continue to be discovered by archeologists.

Tifinagh alphabet disappeared in the seventh century, when [[Latin]] became the official and administrative language in North Africa, as in rest of the former Roman empire.

The first French–Kabyle dictionary was compiled by a French [[ethnologist]] in the 18th century. It was written in [[Latin script]] with an [[orthography]] based on that of [[French orthography|French]].

However, the Kabyle language really became a written language again in the beginning of the 19th century. Under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the [[Latin script]]. "''Tamacahutt n wuccen''" by [[Brahim Zellal]] was one of the first Kabyle books written using this alphabet.

After the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the Libyco-Berber script, which is still in use by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. Attempts were made to modernize the writing system by modifying the shape of the letters and by adding vowels, but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature continued to be written in Latin script. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]] and has been adopted as the official script for Berber languages in [[Morocco]].

[[Mouloud Mammeri]] codified a new orthography for the Kabyle language which avoided using French orthography. His script has been adopted by all Berber linguists,{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} the [[INALCO]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} and the Algerian HCA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} It uses diacritics and two letters from the extended Latin alphabet: [[Č]]č [[Ḍ]]ḍ [[Ɛ]]ɛ [[Ǧ]]ǧ [[Ɣ]]ɣ Ḥḥ [[Ṣ]]ṣ [[Ṭ]]ṭ [[Ẓ]]ẓ.

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Kabyle grammar}}

===Nouns===

Kabyle has two [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine and feminine. As in most [[Berber languages]], masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (''a-'', ''i-'', ''u-''), while feminine nouns generally start with ''t-'' and end with a ''-t'', e.g. '''a'''qcic 'boy' vs. '''t'''aqcic'''t''' 'girl'.

Plurals generally are formed by replacing initial ''a-'' with ''i-'', and either suffixing ''-en'' ("regular/external" plurals), changing vowels within the word ("broken/internal" plurals), or both. Examples: &lt;!-- what about feminine nouns? --&gt;
::'''a'''rgaz → '''i'''rgaz'''en''' "men"
::adrar → id'''u'''rar "mountain"
::'''a'''fus → '''i'''fass'''en''' "hands"

As in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]]: ''free state'' and [[construct state]] (or 'annexed state'). The free state is morphologically unmarked. The construct state is derived either by changing initial /a-/ to /u-/, loss of initial vowel in some feminine nouns, addition of a semi-vowel word-initially, or in some cases no change occurs at all:
::''a''drar → '''u'''drar "mountain"
::t'''a'''mdint → t'''e'''mdint "town"
::t'''a'''murt → tmurt "country"
::asif → '''w'''asif "river"
::iles → '''y'''iles "tongue"
::taddart → taddart "village"

As in [[Central Morocco Tamazight]], construct state is used for subjects placed after their verbs, after prepositions, in noun complement constructions, and after certain numerals. Kabyle also places nouns in construct state when they head a [[noun phrase]] containing a co-referential bound pronoun earlier in the utterance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Creissels|2006|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:

*Free: ''Yewwet '''a'''qcic''. "He has beaten a boy". (Verb–object)
*Annexed: ''Yewwet '''we'''qcic''. "The boy has beaten". (Verb–subject)

After a preposition (with the exception of "ar" and "s"), all nouns take their annexed state:

*Free state: '''A'''man (water), Kas n '''wa'''man (a glass of water).

=== Verbs ===

Verbs are conjugated for three tenses : the [[Preterite]] (past), intensive Aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (Ad+Aorist). Unlike other Berber languages, the [[aorist]] alone is rarely used in Kabyle (In the other languages it is used to express the present).

*"Weak verbs" have a preterite form that is the same as their aorist. Examples of weak verbs that follow are conjugated at the first person of the singular:

{| class="wikitable"
!  Verb
!  Preterite
!  ad + aorist
!  Intensive aorist 
|- 
! If (to outdo)
|  ifeɣ
|  ad ifeɣ
|  ttifeɣ
|- 
!  Muqel (to observe)
|  muqleɣ
|  ad muqleɣ
|  ttmuquleɣ
|- 
!  Krez (to plough)
|  kerzeɣ
|  ad kerzeɣ
|  kerrzeɣ
|}

*"Strong verbs" or "irregular verbs":

{| class="wikitable"
!  Verb
!  Preterite
!  ad + aorist
!  Intensive aorist 
|- 
!  Aru (to write)
|  uriɣ
|  ad aruɣ
|  ttaruɣ 
|}

&lt;div style="float:right; margin-left:20px"&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Kabyle subject affixes
!  colspan="2" | Person 
!  sg.
!  pl.
|- 
! colspan="2" | 1
| ... -ɣ
|  n- ...

| ... -n
|- 
|  &lt;small&gt;f&lt;/small&gt;
|  t- ... 
| ... -nt
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Verbs are conjugated for person by adding affixes. These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes). The epenthetic vowel ''e'' may be inserted between the affix and the verb. Verbs are always marked for subject and may also inflect for person of direct and indirect object.

Examples
: « Yuɣ-it. » – "He bought it." (He.bought-it)
: « Yenna-yas. » – "He said to him." (He.said-to.him)
: « Yefka-yas-t. » – "He gave it to him." (He.gave-to.him-it)

Kabyle is a [[Verb framing|satellite-framed]] based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion:
*''d'' orients toward the speaker, and could be translated as "here".
*''n'' orients toward the interlocutor or toward a certain place, and could be translated as "there".

Examples:
* « iruḥ-'''d''' » (he came), « iruḥ-'''n''' » (he went).
* « awi-'''d''' aman» (bring the water), « awi-'''n''' aman » (carry away the water).

Kabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''ur'' attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its [[argument]]s. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by « ''ur'' » before the verb and the particle « ''ara'' » after the verb:
*« Urareɣ » ("I played") → « '''Ur''' urareɣ '''ara''' » ("I did not play")
Other negative words (acemma ... etc.) are used in combination with ''ur'' to express more complex types of negation. This system developed via [[Jespersen's cycle]].

Verb derivation is performed by adding affixes. There are three types of derivation forms : [[Causative]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[Passive tense|Passive]].

*'''Causative''': obtained by prefixing the verb with s- / sse- / ssu- :
::ffeɣ "to go out" → ssuffeɣ "to make to go out"
::kcem "to enter" → ssekcem "to make to enter, to introduce"
::irid "to be washed" → ssired "to wash".
*'''Reflexive''': obtained by prefixing the verb with m- / my(e)- / myu-:
::ẓer "to see" → mẓer "to see each other"
::ṭṭef "to hold" → myuṭṭaf "to hold each other".
*'''Passive''': is obtained by prefixing the verb with ttu- / ttwa- / tt- / mm(e)- / n- / nn-:
::krez "to plough" → ttwakrez "to be ploughed"
::ečč "to eat" → mmečč "to be eaten".
*'''Complex forms''': obtained by combining two or more of the previous prefixes:
::enɣ "to kill" → mmenɣ "to kill each other" → smenɣ "to make to kill each other"
Two prefixes can cancel each other:
::enz "to be sold" → zzenz "to sell" → ttuzenz "to be sold" (ttuzenz = enz !!).

Every verb has a corresponding [[agent noun]]. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with « am- » or with « an- » if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions however).

*Examples:
::ṭṭef "to hold" → anaṭṭaf "holder"
::inig "to travel" → iminig "traveller"
::eks "to graze" → ameksa "shepherd"

Verbal nouns are derived differently from different classes of verbal stems (including 'quality verbs'). Often ''a-'' or ''t(u)-'' is prefixed:
::ffer "to hide" → tuffra "hiding" (stem VI), « Tuffra n tidett ur telhi » – "Hiding the truth is bad".
::ɣeẓẓ "to bite" → aɣẓaẓ
::zdi "to be united" → azday
::ini "to say" → timenna

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns may either occur as standalone words or bound to nouns or verbs.

{| class="wikitable"
!  Person 
!  Singular 
!  Plural 
|- 
! 1st (m)
|  nekk / nekkini
|  nekni
|- 
! 1st (f)
|  nekk / nekkini	
|  nekkenti
|- 
!  2nd (m)
|  kečč / kečči / keččini
|  kunwi / kenwi
|- 
! 2nd (f) 
|  kemm / kemmi / kemmini
|  kunnemti / kennemti
|- 
!  3rd (m)
|  netta / nettan / nettani
|  nutni / nitni
|- 
!  3rd (f)
|  nettat
|  nutenti / nitenti
|}

Example : « Ula d nekk. » – "Me too."

Possessive pronouns are bound to the modified noun.

{| class="wikitable"
!  Person 
!  Singular 
!  Plural 
|- 
! 1st (m)
|  (i)w / inu 
|  nneɣ
|- 
! 1st (f)
|  (i)w / inu 
|  nnteɣ
|-
!  2nd (m)
|  (i)k / inek 
|  nwen
|- 
! 2nd (f) 
|  (i)m / inem	
|  nkent
|- 
!  3rd (m)
|  (i)s / ines	
|  nsen
|- 
!  3rd (f)
|  (i)s / ines	
|  nsent
|}

Example : « Axxam-nneɣ. » – "Our house." (House-our)

There are three demonstratives, [[deixis|near-deictic]] ('this, these'), far-deictic ('that, those') and absence. They may either be suffixed to nouns, or appear in isolation. Examples: « Axxam-a / Axxam-agi» – "This house.", (House-this), «Wagi yelha» – "This is nice." (This is-nice).

===Prepositions===
[[Prepositions]] precede their objects: « ''i medden'' » "to the people", « ''si taddart'' » "from the village". All words preceded by a preposition (except « ''s'' » and « ''ar'' », "towards", "until" ) take the annexed state.

Some prepositions have two forms : one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts, e.g. ''ger'' 'between' → ''gar''.

Some prepositions have a corresponding [[relative pronoun]] (or [[interrogative pronoun|interrogative]]), for example: 
::« '''i''' » "for/to" → « '''iwumi''' » "to whom"
::« Tefka aksum '''i''' wemcic » "she gave meat '''to''' the cat" → « Amcic '''iwumi''' tefka aksum » "The cat '''to whom''' she gave meat"

=== Syntax ===
'''Negation'''

'''Predicative particle 'd''''

The predicative particle 'd' is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle (or any other Amazigh language). "d" is equivalent to both "it is + adjective" and "to be + adjective", but cannot be replaced by the verb "ili" (to be). &lt;!-- explain! --&gt; It is always followed by a noun in free state.

Examples:
*''D taqcict'' 'it's a girl'
*''D nekk'' 'it's me'
*''Nekk d argaz'' 'I'm a man'
*''Idir d anelmad'' 'Idir is a student'
*''Idir yella d anelmad'' 'Idir was a student'

The predicative particle "d" should not be confused with the particle of coordination "d"; indeed, the former is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state.

==Vocabulary==
Kabyle has absorbed quite some Arabic and Latin vocabulary. According to [[Salem Chaker]], about a third of Kabyle vocabulary is of foreign origin; the number of French [[loanword]]s has not been studied yet. These loanwords are sometimes Berberized and sometimes kept in their original form. The Berberized words follow the regular grammar of Kabyle (free and annexed state).

Examples of Berberized Arabic or French words:

:''kitāb'' (Ar.) &gt; ''taktabt'' "book"
:''machine'' (Fr.) &gt; ''tamacint'' "machine"

Many loanwords from Arabic have often a different meaning in Kabyle:

:''al-māl'' "property" (Ar.) &gt; ''lmal'' "domestic animals" (cf. the etymologies of English ''[[wikt:cattle|cattle]]'' and ''[[wikt:fee|fee]]'')

All verbs of Arabic origin follow a Berber conjugation and verbal derivation:

: ''fahim'' (Ar.) &gt; ''fhem'' "to understand" &gt; ''ssefhem'' "to explain".

Only the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, [[Arabic]] is used. They are ''yiwen'' (f. ''yiwet'') "one", ''sin'' (f. ''snat'') "two". The noun being counted follows it in the [[genitive]]: ''sin n yirgazen'' "two men".

'''Kamano''' (Kamano-Kafe) is a [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken in [[Eastern Highlands Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Nomenclature==
The terms 'Kamano' and 'Kamano-Kafe' are both used to refer to the language primarily spoken in [[Henganofi District]], although within the linguistics literature Kamano refers to some varieties within the Kamano-Yagaria group, a dialect chain of [[Eastern Highlands Province]]&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Kevin (1993). "A Preliminary Comparison of Kamano-Yagaria". ''Language and Linguistics in Melanesia'' 24. 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clause Chaining==
Kamano Kafe exhibits a unique form of the clause chaining system often described in Papuan languages. Clause chaining in Papuan languages typically involves one or more medial verbs with limited morphological possibilities being under the scope of a more fully inflected final verb. The medial verbs in these clause chains typically use a switch reference system and various degrees of agreement with final verbs. The Kamano system, unlike other clause chaining systems in New Guinea, has requisite person and number agreement with the subjects of higher clauses &lt;ref&gt;Elliott, John (2017). "Understanding preview-subject clause chains in Kamano Kafe". ''University of Hawai'i at Manoa Working Papers'' &lt;/ref&gt;. A typical example is given below.

The '''Kangjia''' language (in Chinese, 康家语 ''Kāngjiā Yǔ'') is a recently discovered [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language spoken by a Muslim population of around 300 people in [[Jainca County|Jainca]] (Jianzha) County, [[Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[Qinghai]] province of China. As to its taxonomic affiliation, Kangjia seems to be an intermediate between [[Bonan language]] and [[Dongxiang language]] (Santa).

== Phonology ==
Kangjia has 9 vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/289_fulltext.pdf|title=Mongolic Phonology and the Qinghai-Gansu Languages|last=Hans|first=Nugteren|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kotodama''''' or '''''kototama'''''|言霊||lit. "word spirit/soul"}} refers to the [[Japan]]ese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names. English translations include "soul of language", "spirit of language", "power of language", "power word", "[[magic word]]", and "sacred sound". The notion of ''kotodama'' presupposes that sounds can magically affect objects, and that ritual word usages can influence our environment, [[Human body|body]], [[mind]], and [[soul]].

==Basis==
This Japanese [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''kotodama'' combines ''koto'' [[Wikt:言|言]] "word; speech" and ''tama'' [[Wikt:霊|霊]] "spirit; soul" (or [[Wikt:魂|魂]] "soul; spirit; ghost") [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] as ''dama'' in ''[[rendaku]]''. In contrast, the [[unvoiced]] ''kototama'' pronunciation especially refers to {{nihongo|''kototamagaku''|言霊学||"study of ''kotodama''"}}, which was popularized by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]] in the [[Oomoto]] religion. This field takes the Japanese ''[[gojūon]]'' phonology as the mystical basis of words and meanings, in rough analogy to Hebrew [[Kabbalah]].

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''kotodama'' is uncertain, but one explanation correlating words and events links two Japanese words pronounced ''koto'': this {{nihongo2|言}} "word; words; speech" and [[Wikt:事|事]] "situation; circumstances; state of affairs; occurrence; event; incident". These two ''[[kanji]]'' were used interchangeably in the name [[Kotoshironushi]] {{nihongo2|事代主}} or {{nihongo2|言代主}}, an oracular ''[[kami]]'' mentioned in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon shoki]]''. ''Kotodama'' is related with Japanese words such as ''kotoage'' {{nihongo2|言挙}} "words raised up; invoke the magical power of words", ''kotomuke'' {{nihongo2|言向}} "directed words; cause submission though the power of words", and ''jumon'' {{nihongo2|呪文}} "magic spell; magic words; incantation".

==Mythology==
''Kotodama'' is a central concept in [[Japanese mythology]], [[Shinto]], and [[Kokugaku]]. For example, the ''Kojiki'' describes an ''ukei'' (or ''seiyaku'') {{nihongo2|誓約}} "covenant; trial by pledge" between the sibling gods [[Susanoo]] and [[Amaterasu]], "Let each of us swear, and produce children".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Uttering the divine words of the [[Shinto]] [[divination]] ritual known as ''[[ukehi]]''{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} supposedly determines results, and in this case, Amaterasu giving birth to five male deities proved that Susanoo's intentions were pure.

==Martial arts==
''Kototama'' or ''kotodama'' is also fundamental to [[Japanese martial arts]], for instance, in the use of [[kiai]]. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of [[aikido]] and a student of Deguchi, used ''kototama'' as a spiritual basis for his teachings. [[William Gleason (aikidoka)|William Gleason]] says Ueshiba "created aikido based on the ''kototama'' principle," and quotes him that "Aikido is the superlative way to practice the ''kototama''. It is the means by which one realizes his true nature as a god and finds ultimate freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gleason|first1=William|title=The Spiritual Foundations of Aikido|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|isbn=9780892815081|page=55|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S4JRDf6C4iMC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mutsuro Nakazono]], a disciple of Ueshiba, wrote books on the importance of ''kototama'' in aikido, such as ''The Kotoma Principle'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gleason|first1=William|title=The Spiritual Foundations of Aikido|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781620551226|page=194|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C18oDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalences==
While other cultures have parallels to ''kotodama'', such as [[mantra]], [[mana]], and [[logos]], some Japanese people believe the "word spirit" is unique to the Japanese language. One of the classical [[names of Japan]] is {{nihongo|''kototama no sakiwau kuni''|言霊の幸わう国||"the land where the mysterious workings of language bring bliss"}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]|date=2003|edition=5th|quote=the ⌈soul [spirit] of language; the miraculous power of ⌈language [a phrase, a spell].}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ISBN missing|date=November 2017}}{{Page needed|date=November 2017}} a phrase that originated in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5003">[[File:Shaanxi Province local surcharge labels.jpg|200px|thumb|Local postal surcharge labels issued at [[Ankang]] in [[Shaanxi]] Province.]]'''Local postal surcharge labels''' are a class of labels applied widely to [[China|Chinese]] internal mail between January 1987 and February 1999. They have also been called ''Additional Charge Labels'' and  ''Added Charge Labels''.&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;Palmer, Lars. "Added Charge Labels" in ''Journal of Chinese Philately'', Vol.56, No.2, December 2008, pp.20-25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In China, local provincial governments collect and supply the postal services but the charges are set by the national government. Increasing inflation meant that by 1987 the amount charged for postal services was less than the cost of providing those services. Local governments therefore requested an increase in postal rates but this was refused by the national government. The local governments were allowed, however, to levy an additional charge on certain outgoing mail items to defray their costs and in January 1987 the first local postal surcharge label was used in [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt;

== Use ==
The labels quickly became popular and, eventually, labels were issued in 25 different provinces. Around 1500 different labels are known. The rules set for their use were as follows:&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt;
*The charges were to be created and collected locally.
*The charges only applied to items that had already had postage applied above the lowest rate, e.g. parcels and registered letters. 
*The charges were not to apply on international mail.
*The additional charge was to be noted on the item and the sender given a receipt.
*The labels were not to resemble postage stamps. (In practice many did)

Recording the extra charge was done in a variety of ways, including manuscript marks, [[postal chop]] marks, extra postage stamps and printed labels.

Where printed labels were used they were of widely varying designs and could be of one, two or three parts to enable record keeping. Some were multi-coloured, perforated and similar to postage stamps like the label from Ankang shown above, others were crude productions in one colour similar to tickets or store receipts.

Local governments and postal officials successfully seized the opportunity to raise additional funds. Hubei province, for instance, introduced a rule that from 1 January 1993 a charge be made to finance postal development&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;''Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Part 17, China'', 7th edition, 2006, p.216. {{ISBN|0-85259-639-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a label was issued by a postmaster in Susong in support of China's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; As time went on more stamp-like labels were produced and they were often banned by the central government within days of issue.&lt;ref name=gibbons/&gt; Some may well have been purely philatelic issues with no genuine function.

The use of the labels was never popular with the Chinese government and eventually it was banned completely in 1999.

== Classification ==
The wide variety of the labels and their varying use mean that they defy easy philatelic classification. They are not strictly [[local stamp]]s, although locally produced, and not stamps of the central government of China. The charge levied may be seen as a form of local tax on each letter originating in a particular province, in which case they fall into the category of fiscal or [[revenue stamp]]s. Labels produced purely for [[philatelic]] purposes or outside of the rules are [[cinderella stamp]]s.

== Collecting ==
Philatelists prefer to collect these labels on cover as this gives the fullest information about the label and confirms genuine postal use.

No definitive catalogue exists of all the labels used as the Chinese government initially suppressed their display at stamp exhibitions and it is likely that many items remain to be discovered and catalogued.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; Much of what has been published in this area is in Chinese.

Collectors have used postcodes printed on the labels to indicate probable origins and as a method of classification.

'''Medical terminology''' is [[language]] used to precisely describe the [[human body]] including its components, processes, conditions affecting it, and procedures performed upon it. Medical terminology is used in the field of [[medicine]].

Medical terminology has quite regular [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], the same [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es are used to add meanings to different [[Root (linguistics)|roots]]. The root of a term often refers to an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[Medical condition|condition]]. For example, in the disorder [[hypertension]], the prefix "hyper-" means "high" or "over", and the root word "tension" refers to pressure, so the word "hypertension" refers to abnormally high blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology attribution"&gt;{{CC-notice|cc=by4|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24}} {{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J Gordon|last2=Desaix|first2=Peter|last3=Johnson|first3=Eddie|last4=Johnson|first4=Jody E|last5=Korol|first5=Oksana|last6=Kruse|first6=Dean|last7=Poe|first7=Brandon|last8=Wise|first8=James|last9=Womble|first9=Mark D|last10=Young|first10=Kelly A|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology|location=Houston|publisher=OpenStax CNX|id=ID: 14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|isbn=978-1-93-816813-0|date=February 26, 2016|at=1.6.

Anatomical Terminology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regular morphology means that once a reasonable number of [[morphemes]] are learnt it becomes easy to understand very precise terms assembled from these morphemes. A lot of medical language is [[anatomical terminology]], concerning itself with the names of various parts of the body.

==Discussion==
In forming or understanding a [[word root]], one needs a basic comprehension of the terms and the source language. The study of the origin of words is called [[etymology]]. For example, if a word was to be formed to indicate a condition of kidneys, there are two primary roots &amp;ndash; one from Greek (νεφρός ''nephr(os)'') and one from Latin (''ren(es)''). [[Renal failure]] would be a condition of [[kidney]]s, and [[nephritis]] is also a condition, or inflammation, of the kidneys. The suffix ''-itis'' means inflammation, and the entire word conveys the meaning inflammation of the kidney. To continue using these terms, other combinations will be presented for the purpose of examples: The term ''supra-renal'' is a combination of the prefix ''supra-'' (meaning "above"), and the word root for kidney, and the entire word means "situated above the kidneys". The word "[[nephrologist]]" combines the root word for kidney to the suffix ''-ologist'' with the resultant meaning of "one who studies the kidneys".

The formation of plurals should usually be done using the rules of forming the proper plural form in the source language. Greek and Latin each have differing rules to be applied when forming the plural form of the word root. Often such details can be found using a [[medical dictionary]].

== Morphology ==
{{Main article|Morphology (linguistics)|List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes}}
Medical terminology often uses words created using [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. In [[medicine]], their meanings, and their [[etymology]], are informed by the language of origin. Prefixes and suffixes, primarily in Greek—but also in Latin, have a dropable ''-o-''. Medical roots generally go together according to language: Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes. Although it is technically considered acceptable to create hybrid words, it is strongly preferred not to mix different lingual roots. Examples of well-accepted medical words that do mix lingual roots are [[neonatology]] and [[quadriplegia]].

''Prefixes'' do not normally require further modification to be added to a word root because the prefix normally ends in a vowel or vowel sound, although in some cases they may assimilate slightly and an ''in-'' may change to ''im-'' or ''syn-'' to ''sym-''.

''Suffixes'' are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure.

In the process of creating medical terminology, certain [[rules of language]] apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called [[linguistics]].  The word root is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action to the sound of the word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (word root + vowel) called a [[combining form]]. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter ''-o-'', added to the word root. For example if there is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, this would be written as ''gastro-'' and ''enter-'' plus ''-itis'', [[gastroenteritis]].

Suffixes are categorized as either (1) needing the combining form, or (2) not needing the combining form since they start with a vowel.

The '''Memon''' or '''Memoni''' language is the language of [[Memons (Kathiawar)|Memons historically associated with]] [[Kathiawar]], in [[West India]], a [[Memon people|Memon]] subgroup. Many [[Memons]] have settled in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] since the independence in 1947.

==History==
The true origin of the language is still debated among the historians of the regions. However, it is common to believe that Memoni language actually originated as a dialect of [[Sindhi language]]. Within the language itself, there are currently many different dialects, some having more influence of one language, and others having that of others. The language has not been organized greatly, hence, neither having its alphabetical system of reading and writing, nor having its literature and dictionary. This is one of the reasons the disorientation among the speakers themselves for deciding which words are better for what, as there is a wide variety of vocabulary available. Haji Mohammed Husein Abdel Kareem Nagani invented the alphabet of Memon language.&lt;ref&gt; http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/mws-honors-inventor-memon-language-alphabets/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memon community is generally divided into three major subgroups: [[Kathiawadi Memons]], [[Sindhi Memons]] (who speak the [[Sindhi language]]) and [[Kutchi Memons]] (who speak  [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]]) The first category (Memons originating in [[Kathiawar]]) are simply called ''Memons'', and they speak the ''Memon'' language, the subject of this article. These people are mostly [[Muslim]]s (and mostly [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]]), who migrated from [[Sindh]] to Kathiawar several centuries ago. Sindhi and Kutchi languages are spoken by both [[Muslims]] and non-Muslims, in contrast to the Memon language, which is exclusively spoken by Memons of Kathiawadi origin, who are almost entirely Muslim.

In stress, intonation, and everyday speech, Memoni is very similar to Sindhi, but it borrows extensively from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and lately [[English language|English]]. Like most languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]] the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence structure]] of Memoni generally follows [[subject–object–verb]] order.&lt;ref name="Katiya"&gt;[http://www.as-sidq.org/memoni/  Memoni Language Project]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], Memoni has adopted many [[Urdu language|Urdu]] words and phrases. Even between different villages of Kathiawar, variations arose. For example, in [[Ranavav]], the word for [[sugar]] is ''khand'', while in Jodiya, it is ''chinni''.

==Nouns==
The most nouns has a [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine and often have [[Grammatical number|singular and plural]] forms. The Memons borrow vast majorities of the [[nouns]] from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (mixture of [[Urdu language|Urdu]] &amp; Hindi) languages and lately extensive use of English vocabulary.

===Articles and determiner===
There is no equivalent for the definite article ‘the’, and the indefinite article ‘a’ is further inflected as masculine or feminine with its object.&lt;!-- a guess to what was meant--&gt;

==Pronouns==
The [[Subjective (grammar)|subject pronouns]] [[Grammatical person|second person]](s) ‘You’ is expressed two different ways; one is the polite form ‘aaen’ (cognate with ‘avheen’ in standard Sindhi) used for respect generally for a stranger, elderly and well respected persons including parents and relatives and the second ‘tu’ (the same as in standard Sindhi) is informal and used among close friends and when addressing subordinates. The [[Object (grammar)|object]], [[possessive pronouns|possessive]] and [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] pronouns are often [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical gender|masculine and feminine]] and must agree with its object.

See [[b:Urdu:Pronouns|Urdu Pronouns]]

In most [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] languages the [[Grammatical person|third person]] such as, he, she, it and they and the [[demonstrative]] pronouns this, these, that, those same pronouns are used and they are divided into two categories; one for a near object or person and the other for a far object or person.

No significant differences are among the object, [[Possessive pronoun|possessive]] and [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] pronouns. In addition these pronouns are further inflected for masculine and feminine and must agree to the object (noun, pronouns, adjective and adverbs).

==Verbs==
The verbs generally conjugated (in form, according to many factors, including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It also agree with the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject, object, etc.).  The verb generally appears at the end of the sentence.

==Adjectives==
Like English, the position of the adjectives nearly always appears immediately before the noun and they are modified and often inflected for masculine and feminine and must be agree to the noun that follows. The proposition generally comes after a noun or a verb.

==Script==
In the past there was some attempt to write the Memoni dialect using Gujrati and later in Urdu script with little success. Lately some attempt has been made to write Memoni using Roman script.

In [[psychoanalysis]], the '''primal scene''' ({{lang-de|Urszene}}) is the initial witnessing by a child of a [[Human sexual behavior|sex act]], usually between the parents, that [[Psychological trauma|traumatizes]] the [[psychosexual development]] of that child. The scene witnessed may also occur between animals, and be [[Displacement (psychology)|displaced]] onto humans.

The expression "primal scene" refers to the sight of sexual relations between the parents, as observed, constructed, or fantasized by the child and interpreted by the child as a scene of violence. The scene is not understood by the child, remaining enigmatic but at the same time provoking sexual excitement.

==Freud's views==

===Evolution===
The term appeared for the first time in Freud's published work apropos of the "[[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]" case (1918b [1914]), but the notion of a sexual memory experienced too early to have been translated into verbal images, and thus liable to return in the form of conversion symptoms or obsessions, was part of his thinking as early as 1896 [as witnessed in his letter of May 30 of that year to [[Wilhelm Fliess]], where he evokes a "surplus of sexuality" that "impedes translation" (1950a, pp.&amp;nbsp;229–230)]. Here Freud is already close to the model of the trauma and its "[[Afterwardsness|deferred]]" effect. The following year, in his letter to Fliess of May 2, Freud uses the actual term ''Urszene'' for the first time;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 270n&lt;/ref&gt; and gives the approximate age when in his estimation children were liable to "hear things" that they would understand only "subsequently" as six or seven months (SE 1, p.&amp;nbsp;247). The subject of the child's witnessing parental coitus came up as well, albeit in an older child, with the case of "Katharina," in the ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (1895d), and Freud evoked it yet again in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', with the fantasy of the young man who dreamed of watching his parents copulating during his life in the womb (1900a [addition of 1909], pp.&amp;nbsp;399–400).

===Fantasy or reality?===
Freud persistently strove to decide whether the primal scene was a fantasy or something actually witnessed; above all, he placed increasing emphasis on the child's own fantasy interpretation of the scene as violence visited upon the mother by the father. He went so far, in "On the Sexual Theories of Children" (1908c, p.&amp;nbsp;221), as to find a measure of justification for what he called the "sadistic concept of coitus",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that, though the child may exaggerate, the perception of a real repugnance towards sexual intercourse on the part of a mother fearful of another pregnancy may be quite accurate. In the case of "[[Little Hans]]," however, the violence was explained in terms of a prohibition: Hans deemed it analogous to "smashing a window-pane or forcing a way into an enclosed space" (1909b, p.&amp;nbsp;41).

The case history of the Wolf Man gave Freud the opportunity not only to pursue the issue of the reality of the primal scene, but also to propose the idea that it lay at the root of childhood (and later adult) neurosis: the sexual development of the child was "positively splintered up by it" (1918b [1914), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).  In his ''[[Introduction to Psychoanalysis|Introductory Lectures]]'', however, he argued for the universality of the fantasy of the primal scene (like the sexual theories of children): it may be encountered in all neurotics, if not in every human being (Freud, 1915f), and it belongs in the category of "primal" fantasies. It appears, however, not to have the same force for all individuals.  Freud would later assign a central place to the primal scene in his analysis of [[Marie Bonaparte]], although in her case the scene took place between her nanny and a groom (Bonaparte, 1950–53).

Looked upon as an actual event rather than as a pure fantasy reconstructed in a retrospective way (as with [[Carl Jung]]'s ''zurückphantasieren''), the primal scene had a much more marked traumatic impact, and this led Freud to insist on the "reality" of such scenes, thus returning to the debate over event-driven (or "historical") reality versus psychic reality. Beyond the issue of the scene itself, however, it was the whole subject of fantasy that was thus raised (in chapter five of the Wolf Man case-history [1918b, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–60]), discussed in terms that would be picked up by Freud again later in ''Constructions in Analysis'' (1937d).

It was not merely, in Freud's view, that the technique of psychoanalysis demanded that fantasies be treated as realities so as to give their evocation all the force they needed, but also that many "real" scenes were not accessible by way of recollection, but solely by way of dreams. Whether a scene was constructed out of elements observed elsewhere and in a different context (for example, animal coitus transposed to the parents); reconstituted on the basis of clues (such as bloodstained sheets); or indeed observed directly, but at an age when the child still had not the corresponding verbal images at its disposal; did not fundamentally alter the basic facts of the matter: "I intend on this occasion," wrote Freud, "to close the discussion of the reality of the primal scene with a non liquet" (1918b, p.&amp;nbsp;60).

==Kleinian interpretations==

[[Melanie Klein]]'s view of the primal scene differed from Freud's, for where Freud saw an enigmatic perception of violence, she saw the child's projective fantasies. Klein considered that a child's curiosity was first provoked by the primal scene, and that typically the child felt both excited and excluded by the primal scene.&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual relationship between the parents, fantasized as continuous, is also the basis of the "combined-parent figure",&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; mother and father seen as locked in mutual (but excluding) gratification.

Where Klein laid emphasis on the way the infant projected hostile and destructive tendencies onto the primal scene, with the mother pictured therein as just as dangerous for the father as the father is for her, later Kleinians like [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)|John Steiner]] have stressed the creative aspect of the primal scene; and the necessity in analysis of overcoming a [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of its image between a loving couple on the one hand, and a combined parent figure locked in hate.&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 141 and p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==

The primal scene is inseparable from the sexual theories of childhood that it serves to create. This disturbing representation, which at once acknowledges and denies the familiar quality of the parents, excludes the child even as it concerns them, as witness the libidinal excitement the child feels in response. [[Otto Fenichel]] has stressed the traumatic nature of the excess excitement felt by the child, which they are unable to process — what he called the "overwhelming unknown".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 214-5 and p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

The particularity of the primal scene lies in the fact that the subject experiences in a simultaneous and contradictory way the emergence of the unknown within a familiar world, to which they are bound by vital needs, by expectations of pleasure, and by the self-image that it reflects back to them. The lack of common measure between the child's emotional and psychosexual experience and the words that could give an account of the primal scene creates a gulf that the sexual theories of childhood attempt to bridge. A sadistic reading of the scene combines the child's curiosity about both the origin and the end of life in a representation in which death and life are indeed fused.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Intertextual readings==
Ned Lukacher has proposed using the term in literary criticism to refer to a kind of intertextuality in which the ability to interpret one text depends on the meaning of another text. It is "the interpretive impasse that arises when a reader has good reason to believe that the meaning of one text is historically dependent on the meaning of another text or on a previously unnoticed set of criteria, even though there is no conclusive evidential or archival means of establishing the case beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Lukacher, ''Primal Scenes'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 24 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Spkk4Rlmo7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:primal+intitle:scenes&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA24,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
*[[Maynard Solomon]] interprets four recorded dreams of [[Beethoven]] as all being centered on the primal scene, with the composer either as participant or as impotent by-stander.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (1988) p. 65 and p. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reference class forecasting''' or '''comparison class forecasting''' is a method of predicting the future by looking at similar past situations and their outcomes.

Reference class [[forecasting]] predicts the outcome of a planned action based on actual outcomes in a reference class of similar actions to that being forecast. The theories behind reference class forecasting were developed by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]]. The theoretical work helped Kahneman win the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]].

==Overview==

Kahneman and Tversky&lt;ref name="Kahneman and Tversky 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|journal=Econometrica|date=1979|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/prospect_theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahneman and Tversky 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intuitive prediction: Biases and corrective procedures|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a047747.pdf|date=1977|last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos}} Decision Research Technical Report PTR-1042-77-6.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that human judgment is generally optimistic due to overconfidence and insufficient consideration of distributional information about outcomes. Therefore, people tend to underestimate the costs, completion times, and risks of planned actions, whereas they tend to overestimate the benefits of those same actions. Such error is caused by actors taking an "'''inside view'''", where focus is on the constituents of the specific planned action instead of on the actual outcomes of similar ventures that have already been completed.

Kahneman and Tversky concluded that disregard of distributional information, i.e. risk, is perhaps the major source of error in forecasting. On that basis they recommended that forecasters "should therefore make every effort to frame the forecasting problem so as to facilitate utilizing all the distributional information that is available".&lt;ref name="Kahneman and Tversky 1977" /&gt;{{rp|416}}  Using distributional information from previous ventures similar to the one being forecast is called taking an "'''outside view'''".  Reference class forecasting is a method for taking an outside view on planned actions.

Reference class forecasting for a specific project involves the following three steps:
# Identify a reference class of past, similar projects.
# Establish a [[probability distribution]] for the selected reference class for the [[parameter]] that is being forecast.
# Compare the specific project with the reference class distribution, in order to establish the most likely outcome for the specific project.

===Reference class tennis===
The [[reference class problem]], also known as reference class tennis, is the discussion of which reference class to use when forecasting a given situation. Suppose someone were trying to predict how long it would take to write a psychology textbook. Reference class tennis would involve debating whether we should take the average of all books (closest to an outside view), just all textbooks, or just all psychology textbooks (closest to an inside view).&lt;ref name=Conceptually&gt;{{cite news|title=Week 10: Reference Class Forecasting|url=https://conceptually.org/concepts/reference-class-forecasting/|work=[[Conceptually]]|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lw&gt;{{cite news|title=Outside view|url=https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view|work=[[LessWrong Wiki]]|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical use in policy and planning==

Whereas Kahneman and Tversky developed the theories of reference class forecasting, [[Flyvbjerg]] and [[COWI]] (2004) developed the method for its practical use in policy and planning. The first instance of reference class forecasting in practice is described in Flyvbjerg (2006).&lt;ref name="Flyvbjerg2006"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Bent|last1= Flyvbjerg|date=2006|title=From Nobel Prize to Project Management: Getting Risks Right|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=37|issue=3|pp=5-15|arxiv=1302.3642|ssrn=2238013|bibcode=2013arXiv1302.3642F}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a forecast carried out in 2004 by the UK government of the projected capital costs for an extension of [[Edinburgh Trams]]. The promoter's forecast estimated a cost of £255 million. Taking all available distributional information into account, based on a reference class of comparable rail projects, the reference class forecast estimated a cost of £320 million.  A report issued in August 2011 estimated that the final cost of the yet unfinished project would be over £1 billion, for a shorter tram line than the proposed Line 2.&lt;ref name=bbc-loan&gt;{{cite news|title=Council to borrow £231m for Edinburgh trams project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-14594872|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 August 2011|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Edinburgh forecast, reference class forecasting has been applied to numerous other projects in the UK, including the £15 (US$29) billion [[Crossrail]] project in London. After 2004, The Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland have also implemented various types of reference class forecasting.

Before this, in 2001 (updated in 2011), [[AACE International]] (the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering) included Estimate Validation as a distinct step in the recommended practice of Cost Estimating (Estimate Validation is equivalent to Reference class forecasting in that it calls for separate empirical-based evaluations to benchmark the base estimate):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The estimate should be benchmarked or validated against or compared to historical experience and/or past estimates of the enterprise and of competitive enterprises to check its appropriateness, competitiveness, and to identify improvement opportunities...Validation examines the estimate from a different perspective and using different metrics than are used in estimate preparation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160530211731/http://www.aacei.org/tcmfree/tcmframework_webedition.pdf AACE International, "Total Cost Management Framework, Section 7.3, Cost Estimating and Budgeting", 2011. p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the process industries (e.g., oil and gas, chemicals, mining, energy, etc. which tend to dominate AACE's membership), benchmarking (i.e., "outside view") of project cost estimates against the historical costs of completed projects of similar types, including probabilistic information, has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;Merrow, E. and Yarossi, M., "[http://search.proquest.com/openview/42daeef9f8c368ef28f3434d206eeb93/1.pdf Assessing Project Cost and Schedule Risk]", 1990 AACE Transactions. pp H.6.1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rennell-Bellona''', or '''Rennellese''', is a [[Polynesian language]] spoken in the [[Rennell and Bellona Province]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]. A dictionary of the language has been published.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

==Introduction==

===History===
Rennellese, also known as Rennell or Bellonese is only one of the many languages in the Pacific, that is spoken in the [[Central Solomon Islands]]; mainly the Rennell and Bellona Islands (Jonsson, 1999). For a great deal of time the Solomon Islands were occupied by the British, and pidgin English had become the main language spoken in the Rennell and Bellona Islands, until World War II. At that time the Rennell and Bellona Islands were a battlefield during the Battle of Midway, between the Japanese and Americans; just like Hawaii. During the battle the Japanese occupied most of the area using it as a base. After World War II had, both Rennell and Bellona were still being held by allied forces, until finally gaining independence in 1978 (Levinson, 279-280). Both islands have been working to develop their own government, and Rennellese has been recognized as the official language (Monberg, 2012).

===Population===
The Solomon Islands have a population of around 940,000 (in 2016), including 658,000 in the independent state of the Solomon Islands; and only a little over 4000 of these people speak Rennellese. Natives who currently live there refer to themselves as Mungiki for the Bellona Islands and Mugaba for the Rennell Islands, and among the younger generation Avaiki is used to reference both. Ethnic groups in these islands are very widespread and distinct (Ember, 2002). The people of the Rennell and Bellona Islands live in small village communities, with each group having its own culture, and religious practices (Levinson, 284-285). As for government issues, the Solomon Islands as a whole is divided, the islands to the northwest (primarily [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] and [[Buka Island|Buka]]) belonging to Papua New Guinea, while the rest of the Solomons are their own independent government. Even the Rennell and Bellona Islands alone have their own provincial government known as REN-BEL, the recognizes Rennellese/Bellonese as its own language.

===Consonants===
The [[consonant]]s of Rennellese consist of  /H, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, V, NG, GH, NNG/. The letters /P, T, K/ are regular stops, /B, GH, H, S/ are the fricatives, /M, N, NG/ are the nasals, /L/ is the only lateral, and finally /G/ as a pre-nasal (Elbert, 1988).

===Vowels===
The 5 [[vowel]]s in the system are /a, e, i, o, u/.{{clarify|date=May 2014}} {{fix|text=Where in the world is the IPA?}} Rennellese possess /‘/ which is a glottal stop used to lengthen vowel sounds.{{dubious|date=May 2014}} The /‘/ can be written before or after the vowel it is lengthening, similar to an English apostrophe (Elbert 1988).{{fix|text=what does this have to do with vowels?}}

===Syllable Structure===
The typical [[syllable structure]] in Rennellese is (C)V. Rennellese favors vowels when making syllables, and not many consonant clusters (Elbert 1988).

==Grammar==

===Basic word order===
The traditional word order for Rennellese is VSO, but more commonly among younger generations, SVO word order is used. Researchers speculate that this is due to outside influences from the missionaries and World War II (Elbert, 1981). The use of either word order is usually dependent on the person speaking, or whom that person may be speaking with. Both statements and questions may have different ways of being expressed solely based on who the speaker is (Monberg 2011).

Rennellese’s morphology is [[polysynthetic]], meaning it has a near-infinite number of morphemes that can be put into a word. Not only can some words have many morphemes, but the range between the amounts is high as well.

===Reduplication===
Many words in Rennellese use either whole or partial reduplication. Reduplication serves three main purposes in Rennellese: [[pluralization]], making a word more specific or changing the whole word.
*agha, vine; agha-agha, vines

==Vocabulary==

===Indigenous Words===
*’’Au’’ I
*’’buka’' book
*’’‘agiki’' chief
*’’poo’ugi’’ dark
*’’kai’' eat
*’’peti’' fat
*’’penu’' garbage
*’’tongahichi’' friend

===Loan Words===
Due to Rennellese long contact with the English language there are a few [[loan words]] from English still used today.

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
There are many valuable resources that have been created to help maintain the language including a dictionary, and multiple books primarily written by Samuel H. Elbert. Mr. Elbert along with a few other researchers even dedicated an entire website to the people of Rennell and Bellona called Bellona.dk. Rennellese is also the official language of [[Rennell and Bellona Province]]. With an official status in their country, the Rennellese have begun opening schools and other domains for the language to be used. The only problem is that some of these materials are from the 1960s-1990s, and are old and hard to come by.

===Vitality===
Rennellese is classified as a developing language. The number of speakers is only about 4,000 but there is use and [[intergenerational transmission]] of the language, allowing it to grow. Rennellese is used as a [[first language]] by the majority of the people of Rennell and Bellona. It serves many purposes, being used in education, business, and socializing (Ember 2002). In the long term, Rennellese may be able to see further growth if more technological material is made to both preserve and spread the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">In [[police jargon]], a '''roll call''' is a briefing "where supervisors take attendance, inspect [[uniform]] and equipment, inform the oncoming shift of any outstanding incidents that may have occurred, inform officers of suspects to be looking out for, relate any law or procedural changes, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Stering, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although often conducted prior to the start of a shift,&lt;ref&gt;Stering, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; a roll call may be held at the end of a shift as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kappeler &amp; Gaines, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The communication at a roll call is usually top-down, with information disseminated by (or at the direction of) a shift or squad commander.&lt;ref&gt;Kappeler &amp; Gaines, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The roll call is just one of several vehicles for intradepartmental communication in [[law enforcement agencies]]: other modes include command or administrative staff meetings, [[quality circle]]s, and unit meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Kappeler &amp; Gaines, pp. 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roll calls are "usually limited to recent events or items that might be of short-term interest" and so usually "do not allow for the in-depth discussions necessary for [[community policing]] or real problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;Kappeler &amp; Gaines, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department]] reported that [[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[patrol officer]]s at the time "start each day with roll call that lasts approximately 45 minutes to an hour ... A portion of each roll call (usually 20 minutes or less) is devoting to training. Typical roll call training involves the watch commander lecturing to the officers. Many watch commanders simply read the Department's policy on a given topic without any discussion of the practical application of that policy in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Report-of-the-Independent-Commission-on-the-LAPD-re-Rodney-King_Reduced.pdf Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department] (1993), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trajan (2959610060).jpg|thumb|right|A drawing and photographed carving by [[Eric Gill]] of the "Trajan" capitals on the [[Column of Trajan]].]]
'''Roman square capitals''', also called '''''capitalis monumentalis''''', '''inscriptional capitals''', '''elegant capitals''' and '''''capitalis quadrata''''', are an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] form of writing, and the basis for modern [[capital letter]]s.

Square capitals were used to write [[inscription]]s, and less often to supplement everyday handwriting. When written in documents this style is known as '''Latin book hand'''. For everyday writing the Romans used a current cursive hand known as [[Latin cursive]]. Notable examples of square capitals used for inscriptions are found on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], and the [[Arch of Titus]], all in [[Rome]]. Square capitals are characterized by sharp, straight lines, supple curves, thick and thin strokes, angled stressing and incised [[serif]]s. These Roman capitals are also called [[majuscule]]s, as a counterpart to minuscule letters such as [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian minuscule|Carolingian]].

Before the 4th century, square capitals were used to write ''de luxe'' copies of the works of authors categorized as "pagan" by [[early Christianity|Christians]], especially those of [[Virgil]]; the only three surviving [[manuscript]]s using this letter, among them the [[Vergilius Augusteus]], contain works by Virgil. After the 5th century the square capitals fell out of use, except as a display lettering for titles and chapter headings in conjunction with various script hands for body text: for example, [[uncial]]s. 

Square capitals were greatly respected by artisans of the [[Renaissance]] such as [[Geoffroy Tory]] and [[Felice Feliciano]].&lt;ref name=Warde&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warde|first1=Beatrice|author-link=Beatrice Warde|title=The 'Garamond' Types|journal=The Fleuron|date=1926|pages=131–179|url=http://www.garamond.culture.fr/en/page/the_article_by_beatrice_warde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivans Tory"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivans|first1=William M.|title=Geoffroy Tory|journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art|volume=15|pages=79-86|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-3253359|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few centuries later, they were also a major inspiration for artisans of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] such as [[Edward Johnston]] and [[Eric Gill]], and so many signs and engravings created with an intentionally artistic design in the twentieth century are based on them.&lt;ref name="In Defence of the Roman Letter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nash|first1=John|title=In Defence of the Roman Letter|journal=Journal of the Edward Johnston Foundation|url=http://www.ejf.org.uk/Resources/JRNarticle.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Writing &amp; Illuminating &amp; Lettering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Edward|author-link=Edward Johnston|title=Writing &amp; Illuminating &amp; Lettering|date=1906|publisher=Macmillan|quote=The Roman capitals have held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty.

[[Edward Catich]] is noted for the fullest development of the thesis that the inscribed Roman square capitals owed their form, including the serifs, wholly to the use of the flat brush, rather than to the exigencies of the chisel or other stone cutting tools. Although not universally accepted, the brushed-origin thesis had been proposed in the nineteenth century. Catich made a complete study and proposed a convincing [[wiktionary:ductus|''ductus'']] by which the forms were created, using a flat brush and then chisel. He promulgated his views in two works, ''Letters Redrawn from the Trajan Inscription in Rome'' and ''The Origin of the Serif: Brush Writing and Roman Letters''.

During the early era of the [[movable type]] [[printing press]], Roman square capitals became the primary inspiration for the capital letters in early serif [[typeface]]s; [[Roman type]], especially that developed by those associated with [[Aldus Manutius]], came to produce a number of typefaces still used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bringhurst, Robert]] (2008), ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' (version 3.2). Vancouver: Hartley &amp; Marks.  Often referred to simply as "Bringhurst", ''Elements'' is widely respected as the current English-language authority on typographic style.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1989 digital typeface [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]] from [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] is a direct, all-capital adaptation of the Roman square capitals on Trajan's column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.typekit.com/2014/06/12/the-adobe-originals-silver-anniversary-story-stone-slimbach-and-twombly-launch-the-first-originals/|title=The Adobe Originals Silver Anniversary Story: Stone, Slimbach, and Twombly launch the first Originals|first=Tamye|last=Riggs|date=12 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 47 AD, at the request of [[Gaius Julius Callistus]], the emperor's freedman, he drew up a list of 271 prescriptions (''Compositiones''), most of them his own, although he acknowledged his indebtedness to his tutors, to friends, and to the writings of eminent physicians.&lt;ref name="HornblowerSpawforth2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon Hornblower|author2=Antony Spawforth|author3=Esther Eidinow|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TkW_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT352|date=11 September 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-101676-9|pages=352–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain traditional remedies are also included. The work has no pretensions to style, and contains many colloquialisms. The greater part of it was transferred without acknowledgment to the work of [[Marcellus Empiricus]] (c. 410), ''De Medicamentis Empiricis, Physicis, et Rationabilibus'', which is of great value for the correction of the text of Largus.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Largus, Scribonius |volume=16 |page=216 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung Frege 1892.jpg|thumb|right|360px| ''Die Gleichheit fordert das Nachdenken heraus durch Fragen, die sich daran knüpfen und nicht ganz leicht zu beantworten sind''. Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer]]

In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''sense and reference''' was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] in 1892 (in his paper "'''On Sense and Reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),&lt;ref name=A/&gt; reflecting the two ways he believed a [[singular term]] may have [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].

The [[reference]] (or "referent"; ''Bedeutung'') of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (''bedeuten''), its sense (''Sinn'') is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its [[truth value]], its sense is the thought that it expresses.&lt;ref name=A&gt;"On Sense and Reference" ["Über Sinn und Bedeutung"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 31.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name "[[Odysseus]]" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[analytic philosophy]] is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;Jeff Speaks, [https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2011-12/83104/handouts/frege-reference.pdf "Frege's theory of reference"] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]) led to his views on a [[theory of reference]].&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' ('concept script') of 1879 and ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Evans, ''The Varieties of Reference'', Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its ''Bedeutung'', literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', '''M''eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Function and Concept", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Hesperus]]]]
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, The Countess de Brac as Aurora (1741).jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]]] 
Frege introduced the notion of "sense" (German: ''Sinn'') to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If ''the evening star'' has the same reference as ''the morning star'', it follows that ''the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun'' has the same truth value as ''the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun''. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its ''sense''.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.&lt;ref&gt;See Frege's undated letter to [[Philip Jourdain]], published in ''Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence'', ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cumming, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/names/Names Names], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts based on the work of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;“A Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation”, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., ''Structure, Method, and Meaning'', New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; treat sense as an [[intension]], or a function from [[possible world]]s to [[Extension (semantics)|extensions]]. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. [[John McDowell]] supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.&lt;ref&gt;“On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name”, ''Mind'', 86: 159–85, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Devitt&lt;ref&gt;''Designation'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.

==Sense and description==
In his [[theory of descriptions]], [[Bertrand Russell]] held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised [[definite description]]s. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as "The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander," or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, [[Saul Kripke]] argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; proper names are [[rigid designator]]s which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than [[Richard Nixon]], e.g. [[Hubert Humphrey]], might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot ''mean'' the same as a description.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'' p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] in ''The Varieties of Reference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gareth|title=The Varieties of Reference|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|editor=John McDowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John McDowell]] in "The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name|journal=Mind|date=April 1977|volume=86|series=New Series|issue=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction ''does'' have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of ''Bedeutung''==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German ''Bedeutung'' in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by [[Wiley-Blackwell#Blackwell Publishing history|Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Beaney (''The Frege Reader'', Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of ''Bedeutung'' by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on the principle of [[exegetical neutrality]], namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of [[exegesis]], then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung'': A Reply to Dr. Bell', ''Analysis'' 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., "On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung''", ''Analysis'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of ''Bedeutung'', and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of ''Bedeutung'' well,&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher [[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between [[connotation]] and [[denotation]], which originates with [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;See section §5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's [[A System of Logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, a common term like 'white' ''denotes'' all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (''Begriff''). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet [[Earth]], and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept ''planet''. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging ''of'' anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, "A critical elucidation of some points in E. Schroeder's ''Vorlesungen Ueber Die Algebra der Logik'', ''Archiv fur systematische Philosophie'' 1895, pp. 433-456, transl. Geach, in Geach &amp; Black 86-106.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

'''Serosorting''', also known as "serodiscrimination", is the practice of using HIV status as a decision-making point in choosing [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]. Frequently the term is used to describe the behavior of a person who chooses a sexual partner assumed to be of the same HIV [[serostatus]] in order to engage in [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]] with them for a reduced risk of acquiring or transmitting [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/research/resources/other/serosorting.htm |title=Meeting Summary: "Consultation on Serosorting Practices among Men who Have Sex with Men" |date=31 March 2009 |work=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of [[HIV status]] is based on the result of a person's [[HIV test]], with a positive result indicating that a person has HIV, and can potentially transmit the disease to others during any sexual contact involving an exchange of bodily fluids (e.g., unprotected anal or vaginal sex). There are many situations where determining their partner's serostatus outside of clinical settings cannot be done ''with complete certainty'', limiting the efficacy in mitigating the transmission of [[HIV/AIDS]] (or other [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]). As people do not typically engage in sex practices with the expectation of contracting or transmitting HIV, failed attempts at serosorting are a leading cause of the contraction of HIV among partners.

==Terms and etymology==
The word '''''serosorting''''' comes from the Latin word ''serum'', which refers to [[blood serum]]. Sorting refers to choosing partners based on HIV status, which can be determined from blood tests, among other methods. '''[[Serodiscordant]] sex''' refers to sex between an HIV-positive person and an HIV-negative person; typically partners practicing serosorting make an attempt to find someone with a matching HIV test result, otherwise known as a '''seroconcordant''' partner.

==Risks associated with serosorting==

===Failure to accurately determine HIV status===
Failure to accurately determine HIV status may stem from people not being sure of their true HIV status (or not admitting to having [[HIV]])—even a recent negative result from an [[HIV test]] may not be definitive of a person's serostatus, because if they are still within the [[window period]] following a recent infection, the [[antibodies]] that the blood tests measure will not be present yet. In addition, testing negative for [[HIV]] does not guarantee that they are free of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) such as [[Human Papillomavirus|HPV]] or [[hepatitis B]].

However, the largest experiment with serosorting has been conducted in the [[adult film]] industry by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation. The Adult Industry Medical testing program, or AIM, eliminates virtually all possibility of lying{{how|date=November 2013}} and enforces a high frequency of testing for a variety of STDs that can make the transmission of [[HIV]] more likely. All actors in legitimate adult films are tested twice a year for [[herpes]], [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], hepatitis types [[Hepatitis A|A]],&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis B|B]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis C|C]], and HIV—as well as monthly for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Before this program of testing, adult film actors had a very high rate of STDs, but now have only a 20% higher rate of STDs than the general public.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===As a substitution for condom use===
Dr. Matthew Golden of King County Public Health, in Washington, conducted a study with sexually active West Coast men and concluded that the patient population did demonstrate limited protection from HIV by serosorting. In his study, 3.5% of the men that used neither condoms nor serosorting became HIV-positive, as compared to 2.6% of the men that practiced serosorting alone, and 1.5% of the men who reported consistent [[condom]] use without serosorting.

Golden's population differs from AIM's in that [[anal sex]] made up a high proportion of the subjects' sexual habits, their testing intervals were typically longer and less regular, there were no tests for STDs other than HIV, such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] (an important factor considering other STDs may hasten the spread of the virus), and there were no protections against falsely reporting any of the results. Golden's study did not cover the use of serosorting combined with [[condoms]]—which, theoretically, would be more effective than either precaution used separately.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Golden, MR |author2=Stekler, J |author3=Hughes, JP |author4=Wood, RW |year=2008 |title=HIV serosorting in men who have sex with men: is it safe? |journal=[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=212–8 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818455e8 |pmid=18769346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease exchange between seroconcordant people===
Serosorting does not fully protect against all STDs during [[unprotected sex]] between two people infected with HIV. Infection with ''one'' strain of HIV does not preclude later infection with ''another'' strain. There is a great deal of genetic variability within individual HIV populations, because this variability is shuffled and [[mutated]] every time the virus (numbering in the millions) reproduces inside the infected person's body. Modern drug cocktails keep virus and mutation levels low but eventually [[drug resistance]] will develop. Unprotected sex between two individuals positive for HIV still presents the risk of one of them—with a relatively less aggressive strain of the virus—exchanging genetic sequences with their partner's more drug-resistant cousin, and becoming harder to treat.&lt;ref name='pmid 16052079'&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation for serosorting==

===Lower rates of changing each other's serostatus===
Studies have shown that serosorting provides some limited decrease in risk of contracting [[HIV]] among [[Men who have sex with men]] (MSMs) who use it as an HIV risk reduction technique.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Abstract/2005/04001/Sexual_harm_reduction_practices_of.2.aspx | title=Sexual harm reduction practices of HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men: serosorting, strategic positioning, and withdrawal before ejaculation | publisher=[[AIDS (journal)|AIDS]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=S13–S25 | date=April 2005 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Parsons, Jeffrey T |author2=Schrimshaw, Eric W |author3=Wolitski, Richard J |author4=Halkitis, Perry N |author5=Purcell, David W |author6=Hoff, Colleen C |author7=Gómez, Cynthia A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/E198EB3E-2EE3-48D6-BAC2-0C5EF17CE24A.asp |title=Is serosorting working, or even possible? |author=Gus Cairns |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-02 |publisher=[[aidsmap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been seen as controversial in being used to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] without regard to [[safer sex]] practices, as either participants were free of HIV or were already [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s. Although the practice has occurred informally since the [[AIDS pandemic]] began,&lt;ref name="serosortingintro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art40765.html | title=Serosorting | publisher=[[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] | date=Winter 2007 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Siconolfi, Daniel E |author2=Moeller, Robert W }}&lt;/ref&gt; serosorting has become more prevalent with online [[social networking]] sites now facilitating interactions, and even some health professionals citing [[harm reduction]] concepts for [[gay]] men as a measure to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Click Here for HIV Status: Shifting Templates of Sexual Negotiation |journal=Emotion Space &amp; Society |pages=7–14 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.emospa.2010.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New developments===
There has been further evolution on the idea of serosorting since the introduction of home-based rapid result tests. Prior to engaging in unprotected sex the two partners get tested together. If the immediate results are concordant they choose to have unprotected sex; while if the result is discordant condoms are used.

===The appeal of bareback sex===
'''[[Bareback (sex)|Barebacking]]''', or having male-to-male anal sex without using a [[condom]], first became articulated in magazines such as [[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] in 1995–96 as a practice taking place among HIV-positive men, and may be seen as an early articulation of serosorting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention |journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sharon Statement''' is the founding statement of principles for [[Young Americans for Freedom]]. The views expressed in the statement, while not considered "traditional conservative principles" at the time, played a significant role in influencing Republican leaders in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Chafe|first= William|date= 2003|title= A History of Our Time: Readings in Postwar America|url= |location= New York, Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 305|isbn= 9780195151053}} &lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[M.

Buckley, Jr.]]'s estate in [[Sharon, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="waters"&gt;{{cite book |last=Waters |first=Robert |date=2014 |title=American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia |url= |location= |editor1-last=Frohnen |editor1-first=Bruce |editor1-link=Bruce Frohnen |editor2-last=Beer |editor2-first=Jeremy |editor2-link= |editor3-last=Jeffrey |editor3-first=Nelson O. |publisher=Open Road Media |page=  |author-link= |isbn=9781497651579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Background==

In the late 1950s conservative students on college campuses campaigned for policies to combat communism. Many of these students became supporters of Barry Goldwater's 1960 campaign for the GOP vice-presidential nomination. At the Republican National Convention, Goldwater, failing to secure the nomination, challenged attendees saying: "Let’s grow up conservatives. If you want to take the party back, then let’s get to work!"{{cn|date=April 2018}} In response, a meeting was organized at the home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut.&lt;ref name="waters"/&gt;
  
In attendance at the Sharon Conference were about 90 students from 44 universities located in 24 states.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Amongst the attendees were several future conservative leaders including historian [[Lee Edwards]], [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]], Don Lipsett (co-founder [[Philadelphia Society]]),  [[Paul V. Niemeyer|Paul Niemeyer]] (United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit), ''National Review'' publisher [[William A. Rusher]] (''[[National Review]]'' publisher), Allan Ryskind (publisher of ''[[Human Events]]'') and [[M. Stanton Evans]].&lt;ref name="hillyer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spectator.org/38936_young-americans-old-freedoms/|title=Young Americans, Old FreedomsThe American Spectator|website=spectator.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to organize a new organization which was named the [[Young Americans for Freedom]] (YAF). Evans was selected to draft the founding principles of the group, named Sharon Statement after Buckley's residence.&lt;ref name="clymer"/&gt; Evans said he was influenced by the works of conservative thinkers such as [[F. A. Hayek]], [[Russell Kirk]], [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], and [[Whittaker Chambers]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Summary==

The Sharon Statement consists of 400 words. It's an expression of ''National Review'' editor Frank Meyer’s "fusionism," described as a combination of traditional conservatism, libertarianism and anti-communism, the three prevailing variants of conservatism at the time. The inclusion of "God" in the document was controversial. The statement begins with the statement "“foremost among the transcendent values is the individual’s use of his God-given free will." It then proceeds to espouse five core principles which have directed the conservative movement since its adoption:&lt;ref name="waters"/&gt;

# Individual freedom and the right of governing originate with God
# Political freedom is impossible without economic freedom
# Limited government and strict interpretation of the Constitution
# The free market system is preferable over all others
# Communism must be defeated, not contained

Two years later, in 1962, Tom Hayden wrote the [[Port Huron Statement]]. The manifesto for Students for a Democratic Society has been called the left's  response to the Sharon Statement.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In 2010, fifty years after the adoption of the Sharon Statement, the [[Mount Vernon Statement]] was written. The Mount Vernon Statement shares the same sentiment of the Sharon Statement. However where Sharon focuses on the "outworkings of liberty and self-government", Mount Vernon emphasizes a principle from the Declaration of Independence: that human freedom is based on "the laws of nature and nature’s God."{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In a 2010 interview, Evans reflected on the impact of the Sharon Statement attributing the document and the movement it spawned to the fall of the Soviet Union while failing to address the "domestic spending issue" and “cultural issues, educational issues."&lt;ref name="clymer"/&gt;

'''Antônio Pereira de Sousa Caldas''' (November 24, 1762 – March 2, 1814) was a [[Colonial Brazil]]ian poet, priest and orator, patron of the 34th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Life==
Sousa Caldas was born in 1762, to [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] merchant Luís Pereira de Sousa and Ana Maria de Sousa. Since he was a small boy, he had a vocation for [[Literature|Letters]], and, with only 8 years old, he was sent to [[Lisbon]], to live under the care of an uncle. With 16 years old, he ingressed in the [[University of Coimbra]], where he learnt [[Mathematics]] and [[Canon law]].

In 1781, he was arrested by the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]] because of his ideals, influenced by the Enlightenment. Transferred to the convent of [[Rilhafoles]], he was catechized for six months. After the [[catechism]], he became a fully different person, discovering his sacerdotal vocation. However, he did not abandoned his philosophical and satirical poetry, writing the poem ''Ode ao Homem Natural'' in [[1784 in poetry|1784]]. It is attributed to him the satire ''O Reino da Estupidez''.

After graduating in the [[Canon law]] course in 1789, he travelled to [[France]] and [[Genoa]]. In Genoa, he wrote the [[ode]] ''A Criação'' and abandoned the satirical poetry.

In 1801, he returns to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in order to visit his mother, settling permanently in the town. During his final years in Rio, he wrote many letters for his friends, but only five of them exist today.

He died in 1814.

'''Swedish''' ({{lang|sv|svenska}} {{IPA-sv|²svɛnːska||Sv-svenska.ogg}}) is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language spoken [[First language|natively]] by 9.6 million people, predominantly in [[Sweden]] (as the sole official language), and in parts of [[Finland]], where it has equal legal standing with [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. It is largely [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and to some extent with [[Danish language|Danish]], although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker. Both Norwegian and Danish are generally easier for Swedish speakers to read than to listen to because of difference in accent and tone when speaking. Swedish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] living in Scandinavia during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]]. It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages. 

[[Standard Swedish]], spoken by most [[Swedes]], is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century. While distinct regional [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] descending from the older rural [[dialect]]s still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized.

The standard word order is, as in most [[Germanic languages]], [[V2 word order|V2]], which means that the finite verb (V) appears in the second position (2) of a declarative main clause. [[Swedish morphology]] is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few [[inflection]]s. Swedish has two [[grammatical gender|genders]] and is generally seen to have two [[grammatical case]]s – [[nominative]] and [[genitive]] (except for pronouns that, as in English, also are inflected in the object form) – although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case, or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive ''s'', then seen as a [[clitic]]. Swedish has two grammatical numbers – [[plural]] and [[Grammatical number|singular]]. [[Adjective]]s have discrete comparative and superlative forms, and are also inflected according to gender, number and [[definiteness]]. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through [[suffix]]es (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]]. The [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] features both [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and in most dialects [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] qualities. The language has a comparatively large [[vowel]] inventory. Swedish is also notable for the [[voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative]], a highly variable consonant [[phoneme]]. 

Sweden has also had historic use in [[Estonia]], although the current status of the [[Estonian Swedish]] speakers is almost extinct. Instead it is used in the Swedish diaspora most notably in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] with more than 50,000 resident Swedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sverige-norge.se/var-tionde-oslobo-ar-nu-svensk/|title=Var tionde Oslobo är nu svensk|publisher=Sverige-Norge Personalförmedling|language=sv|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Swedish is an [[Indo-European language]] belonging to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] branch of the [[Germanic languages]]. In the established classification, it belongs to the [[East Scandinavian languages]], together with [[Danish language|Danish]], separating it from the [[West Scandinavian languages]], consisting of [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: ''Insular Scandinavian'' (Faroese and Icelandic), and ''Continental Scandinavian'' (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.&lt;ref name="crystal"/&gt;

By many general criteria of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered [[dialect]]s of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between [[Denmark]] and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the [[nationalist]] ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate [[Orthography|orthographies]], dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a [[dialect continuum]] of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of [[Bohuslän]], [[Dalsland]], western [[Värmland]], western [[Dalarna]], [[Härjedalen]], [[Jämtland]], and [[Scania]], could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.&lt;ref name="crystal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crystal|1999|loc=''Scandinavian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Swedish}}

===Old Norse===
{{Main article|Old Norse}}
{{Old Norse language map}}
In the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], evolved into Old Norse. This language underwent more changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects: ''Old West Norse'' (Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland) and ''Old East Norse'' (Denmark and Sweden). The dialects of Old East Norse spoken in Sweden are called ''[[Runic Swedish]]'', while the dialects of Denmark are referred to as ''Runic Danish''. The dialects are described as "runic" because the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which had only 16 letters. Because the number of runes was limited, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the vowel ''u'', which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''ø'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'', also used for ''e''.&lt;ref name=Edlund2010p26-31&gt;Lars-Erik Edlund, "Språkhistorisk översikt" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1200 onwards, the dialects in Denmark began to diverge from those of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, or [[isogloss]]es, ranging from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] in the south to [[Norrland]], [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Österbotten]] and northwestern [[Finland]] in the north.&lt;ref name=Edlund2010p26-31/&gt;

An early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''æi'' to the [[monophthong]] ''é'', as in ''stæinn'' to ''sténn'' "stone". This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dauðr'' into a long open ''ø'' as in ''døðr'' "dead". This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tauþr'' into ''tuþr''. Moreover, the ''øy'' diphthong changed into a long, [[close vowel|close]] ''ø'', as in the Old Norse word for "island". By the end of the period, these innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish-speaking area as well, with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of [[Mälardalen]] where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergman|1984|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Swedish===

{{Main article|Old Swedish}}
Old Swedish (Swedish: ''fornsvenska'') is the term used for the [[medieval]] Swedish language. The start date is usually set to 1225 since this is the year that ''[[Västgötalagen]]'' ("the Västgöta Law") is believed to have been compiled for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;The oldest dated fragments are from 1250 and the oldest complete manuscript is from c. 1280&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the most important documents of the period written in [[Latin script]] and the oldest Swedish [[code of law|law codes]]. Old Swedish is divided into ''äldre fornsvenska'' (1225–1375) and ''yngre fornsvenska'' (1375–1526), "older" and "younger" Old Swedish&lt;ref&gt;Lars-Erik Edlund, "Språkhistorisk översikt" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Christian church]] and various [[Monasticism|monastic]] orders, introducing many [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] loanwords. With the rise of [[Hanseatic league|Hanseatic]] power in the late 13th and early 14th century, [[Middle Low German]] became very influential. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of [[Low German]]-speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported. The League also brought a certain measure of influence from [[Danish language|Danish]] (at the time much more similar than today's language).&lt;ref name=Edlund2010p29,31&gt;Lars-Erik Edlund, "Språkhistorisk översikt" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=29, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Old Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex [[case (linguistics)|case]] structure and also retained the original Germanic three-[[gender (grammar)|gender]] system. [[Noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[pronoun]]s and certain [[Grammatical number|numerals]] were inflected in four cases; besides the extant [[Nominative case|nominative]], there were also the [[Genitive case|genitive]] (later [[possessive case|possessive]]), [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Accusative case|accusative]]. The gender system resembled that of modern [[German language|German]], having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a ''common gender'' with the [[Definiteness|definite suffix]] ''-en'' and the [[definite article]] ''den'', in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents ''-et'' and ''det''. The verb system was also more complex: it included [[subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[mood (grammar)|moods]] and verbs were conjugated according to [[person (grammar)|person]] as well as [[number (grammar)|number]]. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|pp=150–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination "ae" as æ – and sometimes as a' – though it varied between persons and regions. The combination "ao" was similarly rendered a&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, and "oe" became o&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters [[ä]], [[å]] and [[ö]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time the new letters were used in print was in ''Aff dyäffwlsens frästilse'' ("By the Devil's temptation") published by [[Johan Gerson]] in 1495.&lt;ref&gt;Lars-Erik Edlund, "Språkhistorisk översikt" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Swedish===
{{Main article|Modern Swedish}}
[[File:Gustav Vasa Bible 1541.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of [[Gustav Vasa]]'s Bible from 1541, using [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]]. The title translated to English reads: "The Bible / That is / The Holy Scripture / in Swedish. Printed in [[Uppsala]]. 1541".]]

Modern Swedish (Swedish: ''nysvenska'') begins with the advent of the [[printing press]] and the European [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. After assuming power, the new monarch [[Gustav Vasa]] ordered a Swedish translation of the [[Bible]]. The [[New Testament]] was published in 1526, followed by a full [[Bible translation]] in 1541, usually referred to as the ''[[Gustav Vasa Bible]]'', a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were [[Laurentius Andreæ]] and the brothers [[Laurentius Petri|Laurentius]] and [[Olaus Petri]].&lt;ref&gt;Lars-Erik Edlund, "Språkhistorisk översikt" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day, it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a major step towards a more consistent [[Swedish orthography]]. It established the use of the vowels "å", "ä", and "ö", and the spelling "ck" in place of "kk", distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally, given the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nordic Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z17C7s3r_nwC&amp;pg=PA1900 |year=2005 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019706-8 |page=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written.&lt;ref name="Grünbaum2012"&gt;{{cite web |author=Grünbaun, Katharina |url=http://www.sweden.se/upload/Sweden_se/otherlanguages/factsheets/SI/Svenska_spraket.pdf |title=Svenska språket |trans-title=The Swedish language |date=2012 |publisher=Svenska institutet |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025181238/http://www.sweden.se/upload/Sweden_se/otherlanguages/factsheets/SI/Svenska_spraket.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capitalization]] during this time was not standardized. It depended on the authors and their background. Those influenced by [[German language|German]] capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or [[blackletter]] typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bandle |first1=Oskar |last2=Elmevik |first2=Lennart |last3=Widmark |first3=Gun |title=The Nordic Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqkBXIJkkuEC&amp;pg=PA517 |year=2002 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-014876-3 |page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into the [[voiceless alveolar fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and later into {{IPA|[ɧ]}}. There was also the gradual softening of {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[k]}} into {{IPA|[j]}} and the [[voiceless alveolopalatal fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[ɕ]}} before [[front vowel]]s. The [[voiced velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}} was also transformed into the corresponding [[voiced velar plosive|plosive]] {{IPA|[ɡ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:August Strindberg.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|[[August Strindberg]], one of the most influential writers in modern Swedish literature.]]

===Contemporary Swedish===
The period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed ''nusvenska'' (lit., "Now-Swedish") in linguistics, and started in the last decades of the 19th century. It saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written form that approached the spoken one. The growth of a public school system also led to the evolution of so-called ''boksvenska'' (literally, "book Swedish"), especially among the working classes, where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation, particularly in official contexts. With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on [[Swedish literature]]. Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the emerging national language, among them prolific authors like the poet [[Gustaf Fröding]], Nobel laureate [[Selma Lagerlöf]], and radical writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Josephson|2005|loc=chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography finally stabilized and became almost completely uniform, with some minor deviations, by the time of the spelling reform of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociolinguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGl35Q3W5twC&amp;pg=PA1751 |year=2006 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019987-1 |page=1751}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taavitsainen |first1=Irma |last2=Melchers |first2=Gunnel |last3=Pahta |first3=Päivi |title=Writing in Nonstandard English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cQ9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA302|year=2000 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=978-90-272-9903-1 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bandle|first1=Oskar |last2=Braunmuller|first2=Kurt |last3=Jahr|first3=Ernst Hakon|title=The Nordic Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6b7WwBC5tRAC&amp;pg=PA1805|year=2005|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-017149-5|page=1805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very significant change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s, with the so-called ''[[du-reformen]]'', "the you-reform". Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of ''herr'' ("Mr" or "Sir"), ''fru'' ("Mrs" or "Ma'am") or ''fröken'' ("Miss") was considered the only acceptable way to begin conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ''ni''—the standard [[Grammatical person|second person plural]] pronoun)—analogous to the [[French language|French]] ''vous''. (Cf. [[T-V distinction]].) ''Ni'' wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of ''du'', the singular second person pronoun, used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these class distinctions  became less important, and ''du'' became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decree, but rather the result of sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed in just a few years, from the late 1960s to early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalencyklopedin, ''du-tilltal'' and ''ni-tilltal''&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''ni'' as a polite form of address is sometimes encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among older speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Philip|last2=Hinchliffe|first2=Ian|title=Swedish: An Essential Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGasMbSR-8gC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-45800-9|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Swedish is the sole official national language of [[Sweden]], and one of two in [[Finland]] (alongside [[Finnish language|Finnish]]). As of 2006, it was the first or sole native language of 7.5 to 8 million Swedish residents.{{sfn|Parkvall|2009|p=24}} In 2007 around 5.5% (c. 290,000) of the population of [[Finland]] were native speakers of Swedish,&lt;ref name="StatsFinland"&gt;[http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html#structure Population structure]. [[Statistics Finland]] (2007-03-29). Retrieved on 2007-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; partially due to a decline following the Russian annexation of Finland after the [[Finnish War]] 1808–1809.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160058&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Main outlines of Finnish History – thisisFINLAND].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finland Swedish]] minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and [[archipelago]]s of southern and western Finland. In some of these areas, Swedish is the predominant language; in 19 [[municipality|municipalities]], 16 of which are located in [[Åland]], Swedish is the sole official language. Åland county is an autonomous region of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kommunerna.net/sv/kommuner/svensk-tvasprakiga/Sidor/default.aspx|title=Svensk- och tvåspråkiga kommuner|work=kommunerna.net|date=February 2007|accessdate=3 December 2007|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 there were up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland. The largest populations were in the United States (up to 100,000), the UK, Spain and Germany (c. 30,000 each) and a large proportion of the remaining 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Parkvall &amp; Gunvor Flodell, "Sveriges språk ute i världen" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3 million people speak Swedish as a second language, with about 2,410,000 of those in Finland.&lt;ref name=ethnologue/&gt; According to a survey by the [[European Commission]], 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf Europeans and their languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |date=6 January 2016 }}'', Special Eurobarometer 386, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion of speakers of Danish and especially Norwegian are able to understand Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gooskens|first=Charlotte|year=2007|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_JMMD_2007.pdf|title=The Contribution of Linguistic Factors to the Intelligibility of Closely Related Languages|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=28|issue=6|pages=445–467|doi=10.2167/jmmd511.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official status===
[[File:Oikokatu.JPG|thumb|A [[Finnish language|Finnish]]/Swedish street sign in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] ]]
Swedish is officially the main language of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sprakforsvaret.se/sf/fileadmin/PDF/spraklagen_200509.pdf|title=Språklagen|date=1 July 2009|work=Språkförsvaret|language=Swedish|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20090701/20404/|title=Swedish becomes official 'main language'|last=Landes|first=David|date=1 July 2009|work=The Local|publisher=thelocal.se|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish is also one of two official languages of Finland. In Sweden, it has long been used in local and state government, and most of the educational system, but remained only a ''de facto'' primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language, but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pairing-off]] failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/svenskan-blir-inte-officiellt-sprak|title=Svenskan blir inte officiellt språk|work=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=7 December 2005|accessdate=23 June 2006|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the [[Riksdag]], and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/10016/a/100959|title=Värna språken – förslag till språklag|work=[[Government Offices of Sweden]]|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=19 June 2008|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish is the sole official language of [[Åland]] (an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] province under the [[sovereignty]] of [[Finland]]), where the vast majority of the 26,000 inhabitants speak Swedish as a first language. In Finland as a whole, Swedish is one of the two "national" languages, with the same official status as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (spoken by the majority) at the state level and an official language in some [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]].

Swedish is one of the official languages of the [[European Union]], and one of the working languages of the [[Nordic Council]]. Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] speaking Swedish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for interpretation or translation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.norden.org/avtal/sprak/sk/sprak_sprak.asp?lang=|title=Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island, och Norge om nordiska medborgares rätt att använda sitt eget språk i annat nordiskt land|work=[[Nordic Council]]|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=25 April 2007|language=Swedish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418154217/http://www.norden.org/avtal/sprak/sk/sprak_sprak.asp?lang=|archivedate=18 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&amp;lang=6|title=20th anniversary of the Nordic Language Convention|work=Nordic news|date=22 February 2007|accessdate=25 April 2007|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory bodies===
[[File:Estonian archipelago (Saaremaa and Hiiumaa).jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[West Estonian archipelago|Estonian islands]] which formerly housed "''Coastal Swede''" populations]]

The [[Swedish Language Council]] (''Språkrådet'') is the regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the ''[[Académie française]]'' does for [[French language|French]]. However, many organizations and agencies require the use of the council's publication ''Svenska skrivregler'' in official contexts, with it otherwise being regarded as a ''de facto'' orthographic standard. Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council, the [[Swedish Academy]] (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the glossary ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'' (''SAOL'', currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary ''[[Svenska Akademiens Ordbok]]'', in addition to various books on grammar, spelling and manuals of style. Although the dictionaries have a [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] element, they mainly describe current usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gellerstam |first1=Martin |title=Norm och bruk i SAOL|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/24007 |publisher=Nordisk forening for leksikografi i samarbeit med Nordisk språksekretariat |accessdate=2 March 2018 |language=Swedish |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, a special branch of the [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] has official status as the regulatory body for Swedish in Finland. Among its highest priorities is to maintain intelligibility with the language spoken in Sweden. It has published ''Finlandssvensk ordbok'', a dictionary about the differences between Swedish in Finland and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/lexn/article/view/18709/16362|title = Normeringen i Finlandssvensk ordbok|last = af Hällström|first = Charlotta|date = 2002|journal = LexicoNordica 9, 2002, s. 51–62|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language minorities in Estonia and Ukraine===
From the 13th to 20th century, there were [[Estonian Swedes|Swedish-speaking communities in Estonia]], particularly on the islands (e. g., [[Hiiumaa]], [[Vormsi]], [[Ruhnu]]; in Swedish, known as ''Dagö'', ''Ormsö'', ''Runö'', respectively) along the coast of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in [[parliament]], and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the [[Russian Empire]] in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern [[Ukraine]], where they founded a village, ''[[Gammalsvenskby]]'' ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.&lt;ref&gt;The number of registered Swedes in Zmeyovka (the modern Ukrainian name of ''Gammalsvenskby'') in 1994 was 116 according to [[Nationalencyklopedin]], article ''svenskbyborna''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, the small Swedish community was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of [[World War II]], that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.&lt;ref&gt;''Nationalencyklopedin'', ''estlandssvenskar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{Main article|Swedish phonology}}

[[File:Swedish monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|right|The vowel phonemes of Central Standard Swedish&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Engstrand|1999|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Swedish dialects have either 17 or 18 vowel [[phoneme]]s, 9 long and 9 short. As in the other Germanic languages, including English, most long vowels are phonetically paired with one of the short vowels, and the pairs are such that the two vowels are of similar [[vowel quality|quality]], but with the short vowel being slightly lower and slightly centralized. In contrast to e.g. Danish, which has only tense vowels, the short vowels are slightly more lax, but the tense vs. lax contrast is not nearly as pronounced as in English, German or Dutch. In most dialects, the short vowel sound pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}} has merged with the short {{IPA|/e/}} (transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɛ}}}} in the chart below).&lt;ref name=AndersonEngstrand&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersson|2002|pp=271–312}}; {{Harvnb|Engstrand|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 18 consonant phonemes, two of which, {{IPAslink|ɧ}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker. In many dialects, sequences of {{IPA|/r/}} with a dental consonant result in [[retroflex consonant]]s. {{IPA|/r/}} has a [[guttural R|guttural]] or "French R" pronunciation in the [[South Swedish dialects]]; consequently, these dialects lack [[retroflex consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garlén|1988|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed syllable]] carries one of two [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], which gives Swedish much of its characteristic sound. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] is often one of the most noticeable differences between dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garlén|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Swedish grammar}}
Swedish [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s are declined in [[grammatical gender|genders]] as well as [[grammatical number|number]]. Nouns belong to one of two genders – common for the ''en'' form or neuter for the ''ett'' form&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Granberry|1991|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which also determine the declension of [[adjective]]s. For example, the word ''fisk'' ("fish") is a noun of common gender (''en fisk'') and can have the following forms:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! Indefinite form
| ''fisk''
| ''fiskar''
|-
! Definite form
| ''fisken''
| ''fiskarna''
|}

The definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix (''-en'', ''-n'', ''-et'' or ''-t''), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles ''den'', ''det'', and ''de'' are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as [[demonstrative]] [[pronoun]]s or [[Determiner (class)|demonstrative determiners]] when used with [[adverb]]s such as ''här'' ("here") or ''där'' ("there") to form ''den/det här (can also be "denna/detta")'' ("this"), ''de här (can also be "dessa")'' ("these"), ''den/det där'' ("that"), and ''de där'' ("those"). For example, ''den där fisken'' means "that fish" and refers to a specific fish; ''den fisken'' is less definite and means "that fish" in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while ''fisken'' means "the fish". In certain cases, the definite form indicates possession, e. g., ''jag måste tvätta hår'''et''''' ("I must wash ''my'' hair").&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;

[[Adjective]]s are inflected in two declensions – indefinite and definite – and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix (''-t'' or ''-a'') to the common form of the adjective, e. g., ''en grön stol'' (a green chair), ''ett grönt hus'' (a green house), and ''gröna stolar'' ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form, e. g., ''den gröna stolen'' ("the green chair"), ''det gröna huset'' ("the green house"), and ''de gröna stolarna'' ("the green chairs").&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugen|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish [[pronoun]]s are similar to those of English. Besides the two natural genders ''han'' and ''hon'' ("he" and "she"), there are also the two [[grammatical gender]]s ''den'' and ''det'', usually termed [[common gender|common]] and [[neuter gender|neuter]]. Unlike the nouns, pronouns have an additional [[object (linguistics)|object]] form, derived from the old [[dative]] form. ''Hon'', for example, has the following nominative, possessive, and object forms:&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;

:''hon'' – ''hennes'' – ''henne''

Swedish also uses third-person possessive [[reflexive pronoun]]s that refer to the subject in a clause, a trait which is restricted to North Germanic languages:

:''Anna gav Maria sin bok.''; "Anna gave Maria her [Anna's] book." (reflexive)
:''Anna gav Maria hennes bok.''; "Anna gave Maria her [Maria's] book." (not reflexive)

Swedish used to have [[genitive]] that was placed at the end of the head of a noun phrase. In modern Swedish, it has become an [[enclitic]] ''-s'', which attaches to the end of the noun phrase, rather than the noun itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|pp=70, 212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''hästen''; "the horse" – ''hästens'' "the horse's"
:''hästen på den blommande ängens svarta man''; "the horse in the flowering meadow's black mane"

In formal written language, it used to be considered correct to place the genitive ''-s'' after the head of the noun phrase (''hästen''), though this is today considered dated, and different grammatical constructions are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbs are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] according to [[grammatical tense|tense]]. One group of verbs (the ones ending in ''-er'' in present tense) has a special [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form (generally the verb [[word stem|stem]]), but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the [[infinitive]] form. [[perfect (grammar)|Perfect]] and [[present tense|present]] [[participle]]s as adjectival verbs are very common:&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;

:Perfect participle: ''en stekt fisk''; "a fried fish" (steka = to fry)
:Present participle: ''en stinkande fisk''; "a stinking fish" (stinka = to stink)

In contrast to English and many other languages, Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect. Rather, the [[auxiliary verb]] ''har'' ("have"), ''hade'' ("had") is followed by a special form, called [[supine]], used solely for this purpose (although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle):&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;

:Perfect participle: ''målad'', "painted" – supine ''målat'', present perfect ''har målat''; "have painted"
:Perfect participle: ''stekt'', "fried" – supine ''stekt'', present perfect ''har stekt''; "have fried"
:Perfect participle: ''skriven'', "written" – supine ''skrivit'', present perfect ''har skrivit''; "have written"

When building the compound passive voice using the verb ''att bli'', the past participle is used:

:''den blir målad''; "it's being painted"
:''den blev målad''; "it was painted"

There exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding ''-s'', replacing the final ''r'' in the present tense:

:''den målas''; "it's being painted"
:''den målades''; "it was painted"

In a subordinate [[clause]], the auxiliary ''har'' is optional and often omitted, particularly in written Swedish.

:''Jag ser att han (har) stekt fisken''; "I see that he has fried the fish"

[[Subjunctive mood]] is occasionally used for some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs (as for instance: ''vore, månne'') as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of [[Idiom|idiomatic expressions]].&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;

Where other languages may use [[grammatical cases]], Swedish uses numerous [[preposition]]s, similar to those found in [[English language|English]]. As in modern [[German language|German]], prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like ''till fots'' ("on foot", genitive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Swedish is a Germanic language, the [[syntax]] shows similarities to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a [[subject–verb–object]] basic word order, but like German it utilizes [[V2 word order|verb-second word order]] in main clauses, for instance after [[adverbs]] and adverbial phrases, and [[dependent clauses]]. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) [[Prepositional phrase]]s are placed in a [[place–manner–time]] order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bolander|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verb-second (inverted) word order is also used for questions.&lt;ref name="Stensson 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stensson|first1=Leif|title=Swedish Grammar {{!}} Syntax|url=https://www.lysator.liu.se/language/Languages/Swedish/Grammar.html#syntax|publisher=Lysator Society, Linköping University|accessdate=9 March 2018|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
The [[vocabulary]] of Swedish is mainly Germanic, either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German, Middle Low German, and to some extent, English. Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are ''mus'' ("mouse"), ''kung'' ("king"), and ''gås'' ("goose"). A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, often borrowed from [[French language|French]] and, lately, English. Some 1–200 words are also borrowed from [[Scandoromani language|Scandoromani]] or [[Romani language|Romani]], often as slang varieties; a commonly used word from Romani is ''[[:wikt:tjej|tjej]]'' ("girl").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wessén|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of [[French language|French]] words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century. These words have been [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced recognizably to a French-speaker. Most of them are distinguished by a "French accent", characterized by emphasis on the last syllable. For example, ''nivå'' (fr. ''niveau'', "level"), ''fåtölj'' (fr. ''fauteuil'', "armchair") and ''affär'' ("shop; affair"), etc. Cross-borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common, at first from Middle Low German, the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic league]] and later from [[Standard German]]. Some compounds are translations of the elements ([[calque]]s) of German original compounds into Swedish, like ''{{lang|sv|bomull}}'' from German ''{{lang|de|Baumwolle}}'' ("cotton"; literally, ''tree-wool'').&lt;ref&gt;Nationalencyklopedin, ''svenska: språkhistoria''&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many Germanic languages, new words can be formed by compounding, e. g., nouns like ''{{lang|sv|nagellackborttagningsmedel}}'' ("nail polish remover") or verbs like ''{{lang|sv|smyglyssna}}'' ("to eavesdrop").&lt;ref name=CompoundNoun/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smyglyssna |url=http://ordbok.woxikon.se/sv-en/smyglyssna |website=Woxikon |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compound nouns take their [[grammatical gender|gender]] from the [[head (linguistics)|head]], which in Swedish is always the last morpheme.&lt;ref name=CompoundNoun&gt;{{cite web |title=Minor Grammar English-Swedish |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/194349317/Minor-Grammar-English-Swedish |publisher=Scribd |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New words can also be coined by [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] from other established words, such as the [[verbification]] of [[noun]]s by the adding of the [[suffix#Derivational suffixes|suffix]] ''-a'', as in ''{{lang|sv|bil}}'' ("car") and ''{{lang|sv|bila}}'' ("travel (recreationally) by car").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gomer |editor1-first=Eva |editor2-last=Morris-Nygren |editor2-first=Mona |title=Bila |work=Modern Svensk Engelsk Ordbok |date=1976 |publisher=Prisma |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite, making nouns of verbs, is also possible, as in ''{{lang|sv|tänk}}'' ("way of thinking; concept") from ''{{lang|sv|tänka}}'' ("to think").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Språket lever {{!}} tänk|url=https://www.sprakinstitutet.fi/sv/aktuellt/spraket_lever/tank.20235.news|publisher=Institutet för de inhemska språken|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=Swedish|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Main article|Swedish orthography}}
The [[Swedish alphabet]] is a 29-letter [[alphabet]], using the 26-letter [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] plus the three additional letters ''[[Å|Å''/''å]]'', ''[[Ä|Ä''/''ä]]'', and ''[[Ö|Ö''/''ö]]'' constructed in the 16th century by writing "o" and "e" on top of an "a", and an "e" on top of an "o". Though these combinations are historically modified versions of [[A]] and [[O]] according to the English range of usage for the term [[diacritic]], these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application, but rather separate letters, and are independent letters following ''z''. Before the release of the 13th edition of ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'' in April 2006, ''w'' was treated as merely a variant of ''v'' used only in names (such as "Wallenberg") and foreign words ("bowling"), and so was both sorted and pronounced as a ''v''. Other [[diacritic]]s (to use the broader English term usage referenced here) are unusual in Swedish; [[é]] is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing ''e'', especially when the stress changes the meaning (''ide'' vs. ''idé'', "winter lair" vs. "idea") as well as in some names, like ''Kastrén''; occasionally other [[acute accent]]s and, less often, [[grave accent]]s can be seen in names and some foreign words. The letter [[à]] is used to refer to unit cost (a loan from the French), equivalent to the [[at sign]] (@) in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Svenska språknämnden|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German ''[[ü]]'' is treated as a variant of ''[[y]]'' and sometimes retained in foreign names and words, e. g., ''müsli'' ("muesli/granola"). A proper [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style (for instance: "Aïda"). The German convention of writing ''ä'' and ''ö'' as ''ae'' and ''oe'' if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish. Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national [[top-level domain|top-level Internet domain]] and other such domains, Swedish sites are frequently labelled using ''a'' and ''o'', based on visual similarity, though Swedish domains could be registered using the characters å, ä, and ö from 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Domain names with characters like å, ä, ö (IDN)|url=https://www.iis.se/english/domains/se/idn/|publisher=iiS|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Swedish [[orthography]], the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used in a [[Colon (punctuation)#Usage|similar manner as in English]], with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as ''3:e'' for ''tredje'' ("third") and ''S:t'' for ''Sankt'' ("Saint"), and for all types of [[suffix|endings]] that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as ''a:et'' ("the a") and ''CD:n'' ("the CD"), or the genitive form ''USA:s'' ("USA's").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Svenska språknämnden|2000|pp=154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
[[File:R-pronounciation in Swedish language.JPG|thumb|[[Isogloss]] for the pronunciation of "R" (c. 1960), being [[Alveolar trill|alveolar]] north of the boundary and [[guttural R|uvular]] ("French R") south of it. It follows that the R+S combination is pronounced as spelled south of the boundary, while pronounced {{IPAblink|ʂ}} (similar to "sh" in "shark") north of it. This isogloss is the most imperative of all Swedish pronunciation differences.]]
{{Main article|Swedish dialects}}
According to a traditional division of Swedish [[dialect]]s, there are six main groups of dialects:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leinonen|2011}};{{Harvnb|Dahl|2000|pp=117-119}}; Lars-Erik Edlund "Språklig variation i tid och rum" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hur många dialekter finns det i Sverige? Var går gränsen mellan olika dialekter?|url=http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/sprak/dialekter/fragor-och-svar-om-dialekter/faq/2013-10-21-hur-manga-dialekter-finns-det-i-sverige-var-gar-gransen-mellan-olika-dialekter.html|publisher=Institutet för språk och folkminnen|accessdate=2 March 2018|date=3 February 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Norrland dialects]]
* [[Finland Swedish]]
* [[Svealand dialects]]
* [[Modern Gutnish|Gotland dialects]]
* [[Götaland dialects]]
* [[South Swedish dialects]]

The traditional definition of a Swedish [[dialect]] has been a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to [[Old Norse]]. Many of the genuine rural dialects, such as those of [[Orsa, Sweden|Orsa]] in [[Dalarna]] or [[Närpes]] in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Österbotten]], have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features, such as plural forms of verbs or archaic [[case (linguistics)|case]] inflections. These dialects can be near-incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes, and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish. The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual [[parish]]es and are referred to by Swedish linguists as ''sockenmål'' (lit., "parish speech"). They are generally separated into six major groups, with common characteristics of prosody, grammar and vocabulary. One or several examples from each group are given here. Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects, the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Engstrand|2004|p=120}}; {{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of classification, however, is based on a somewhat romanticized [[nationalism|nationalist]] view of ethnicity and language. The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered "genuine" is not generally accepted by modern scholars. No dialects, no matter how remote or obscure, remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language, especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of [[mass media]] and advanced forms of transport. The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from "standard language" to "rural dialect" where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation. All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in [[Dalarna]], [[Norrbotten]] and, to some extent, [[Gotland]] can be considered to be part of a common, mutually intelligible [[dialect continuum]]. This continuum may also include [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegian]] and some [[Danish dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahl|2000|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The samples linked below have been taken from SweDia, a research project on Swedish modern dialects available for download (though with information in Swedish only), with many more samples from 100 different dialects with recordings from four different speakers: older female, older male, younger female and younger male. The dialect groups are those traditionally used by dialectologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Swedish===
[[Standard Swedish]] is the language used by virtually all Swedes and most [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking Finns]]. It is called ''rikssvenska'' or ''standardsvenska'' ("Standard Swedish") in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=standardspråk |url=https://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/standardspr%C3%A5k |publisher=Nationalencyklopedin AB |accessdate=3 March 2018 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland, ''högsvenska'' ("High Swedish") is used for the Finnish variant of standard Swedish and ''rikssvenska'' refers to Swedish as spoken in Sweden in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mattfolk|first1=Leila|title=Do answers to a questionnaire give reliable data?|url=http://www.nordiska.uu.se/ICLaVE2/Kristiansen_w/Mattfolkw.pdf|publisher=Helsinki University|accessdate=3 March 2018|quote=Employees on radio and television do not always follow the same Swedish norm.

In a poll conducted in 2005 by the [[Swedish Retail Institute]] (''[http://www.hui.se/ Handelns Utredningsinstitut]''), the attitudes of Swedes to the use of certain dialects by salesmen revealed that 54% believed that ''rikssvenska'' was the variety they would prefer to hear when speaking with salesmen over the phone, even though dialects such as ''gotländska'' or ''[[skånska]]'' were provided as alternatives in the poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Aronsson |first=Cecilia |url=http://www.di.se/Nyheter/?page=/Avdelningar/Artikel.aspx%3FArticleID%3D2005%5C05%5C03%5C142710%26words%3Drikssvenska%26SectionID%3DEttan%26menusection%3DStartsidan%3BHuvudnyheter |title=Norrländska låter bäst |work=[[Dagens Industri]] |date=3 May 2005 |accessdate=24 August 2007 |quote=Norrländska och rikssvenska är de mest förtroendeingivande dialekterna.

Handelns utredningsinstitut (HUI) har frågat 800 svenskar om hur de uppfattar olika dialekter som de hör i telefonservicesamtal, exempelvis från försäljare eller upplysningscentraler. Undersökningen visar att 54 procent föredrar att motparten pratar rikssvenska, vilket troligen hänger ihop med dess tydlighet. Men även norrländskan plockar höga poäng – 25 procent tycker att det är den mest förtroendeingivande dialekten. Tilltron till norrländska är ännu större hos personer under 29 år, medan stödet för rikssvenska är störst bland personer över 55 år. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152413/http://www.di.se/Nyheter/?page=%2FAvdelningar%2FArtikel.aspx%3FArticleID%3D2005%5C05%5C03%5C142710&amp;words=rikssvenska&amp;SectionID=Ettan&amp;menusection=Startsidan%3BHuvudnyheter |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland Swedish===
{{Main article|Finland Swedish|Åland Swedish}}
Finland was a part of Sweden from the 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to [[Russia]] in 1809. Swedish was the sole administrative language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], [[Southwest Finland]] and [[Uusimaa|Nyland]] where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest of Finland, though, with the same official status as [[Finnish language|Finnish]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990731 Finlands grundlag – Constituiton of Finland "17 §

Rätt till eget språk och egen kultur

Finlands nationalspråk är finska och svenska.

Vars och ens rätt att hos domstol och andra myndigheter i egen sak använda sitt eget språk, antingen finska eller svenska, samt att få expeditioner på detta språk skall tryggas genom lag. Det allmänna skall tillgodose landets finskspråkiga och svenskspråkiga befolknings kulturella och samhälleliga behov enligt lika grunder."&lt;/ref&gt; The country's public broadcaster, [[Yle]], provides two Swedish-language radio stations, [[Yle Vega]] and [[Yle X3M]], as well a TV channel, [[Yle Fem]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://svenska.yle.fi/ Svenska Yle, scroll to the bottom of the page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrant variants===
[[Rinkeby Swedish]] (after [[Rinkeby]], a suburb of northern Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmö]]. These varieties could alternatively be classified as [[sociolect]]s, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after [[Rosengård]] in Malmö), a variant of [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://person.sol.lu.se/PetraBoden/papers/Ey_mannen_wazzup.htm |title=Ey, mannen! Wazzup? / På jakt efter "rosengårdssvenskan" |last=Bodén |first=Petra |publisher=Institutionen för nordiska språk och Institutionen för lingvistik, [[Lunds universitet]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506132803/http://person.sol.lu.se/PetraBoden/papers/Ey_mannen_wazzup.htm |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey made by the Swedish linguist [[Ulla-Britt Kotsinas]] showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kotsinas|1994|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Beautiful Afar''' ({{lang-ru|Прекра́сное Далёко}}) is a so-called "[[winged expression]]" aka [[catchphrase]] or a [[phraseme]] of the [[Russian language]]. It was first used by [[Nikolai Gogol]] in the [[novel]] The "[[Dead Souls]]" first published in 1842. The expression is used as a [[joke]], sometimes [[irony]] indicating the often fictitious place of well-being, where a person who is not burdened with routine, rests, leads a carefree, unladen, and idle lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/encSlov/9/86.htm "Encyclopedic Dictionary of winged words and expressions"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the expression==
The "[[Dead Souls]]" were written by the author while residing mostly abroad, mainly in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], but also in France, Switzerland, and Austria. In one of the lyrical digressions of the novel in the second chapter of the first volume of The "[[Dead Souls]]", the author exclaims: '''"[[Ruthenia|Rus']]! Rus’! It's you that I see, from my wonderful, ''beautiful afar'', I see YOU."''' These lines were written by a writer while living in Italy. By self-admission, Gogol loved Italy and called it 'my dear soul', in a letter to [[Vasily Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]] he writes: ''"If you knew with what joy I abandoned Switzerland and flew to my dear soul - Italy. She is mine! No one in the world will take her from me."''&lt;ref&gt;Romanticism and the City, Larry H Peer, New York : Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text="The Beautiful Afar" from which Gogol paints spiritualized [[Rus' people|Rus']], is primarily Italy, the homeland of the [[Raphael]], whom he worshiped, to whom the "Peter The Great" poem by [[Sergei Shirinsky-Shikhmatov]] was addressed in an appeal to portray Russia in all its splendid grandeur, awakened to creative life and triumphant victory over enemies. |author=''[[Mikhail Weisskopf]]'' |title=''"Gogol's story. Morphology. Ideology. Context"''|source=''Publisher: RadixBooks, 1993; Page 410; {{ISBN|5-86463-004-7}}''|style=overflow:inherit;}}

As an idiomatic expression, ''"The Beautiful Afar"'' was first coined by [[Vissarion Belinsky]], in the argument against Nikolai Gogol himself. Belinsky attacked Gogol with an angry letter dated July 3 (15), 1847, about Gogol's journalistic book ''"Selected Places from Correspondence with Friends"'' published in the same year: {{Quote|text="... for so many years, you have been accustomed to looking at Russia from your "beautiful afar", while it is well-known that nothing is easier than to see objects from afar as we want them to be; as you are living in this beautiful afar, you become completely alien to it, enclosed in yourself..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feb-web.ru/feb/gogol/texts/ps0/ps8/ps8-5002.htm|title=Letter from V Belinsky to N Gogol July 15/3, 1847|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=''[[Vissarion Belinsky]]''}}

'''The Superstar Effect''' or "Tiger Woods effect" refers to the change in performance caused by the presence of a highly ranked player - a [[superstar]] - in a rank-order competition.

== Overview ==
The phenomenon was first described in a study titled "''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''"&lt;ref name="Brown1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jennifer|title=Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=October 2011|volume=119|issue=5|pages=982–1013|doi=10.1086/663306|jstor=663306}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Jennifer Brown, which examined the performance of golfers at events with and without [[Tiger Woods]]. In contradiction to what intuition would suggest (namely that increased rivalry encourages better performance), Brown finds that the presence of a superstar is in fact associated with reduced competitor’s efforts in rank-order tournaments. The explanation she provides is an economic model in which competing is costly - one might hurt themselves, for instance - thus when the chance of winning is very low, the participant is discouraged from performing to her best abilities as it is not worthwhile.

The study uses data from the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|Professional Golfers' Association]] (PGA) that contains round-by-round scores for all players in every tournament from 1999 to 2006 and hole-by-hole results for all events from 2002 to 2006. During this period, golfer Tiger Woods was performing significantly better than any other player with scores in regular and major events being lower than the group mean in all years except 2004.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; His consistent and dominant performance has earned him the title of superstar. Hence, the data is filtered creating a subset of tournaments Tiger Woods was a part of and other players’ performance is compared to when they are competing against Woods to when they are not. The analysis yields that on events when the highly skilled golfers were competing against Tiger Woods, their performance was considerably worse - with scores almost one [[stroke play|stroke]] higher on average - than on events where Tiger Woods was absent. On the other hand, lower-ranked golfers are less or not at all affected by his presence. Brown notes that this could be due to the fact that the stakes are not as high for lower-ranked golfers to start with.

Brown investigates the possibility of other explanations as to why golfers’ performance is poorer but finds that it is neither due to players taking more risks nor is the other players’ performance worse relative to Woods’ due to the fact that better golfers avoid competitions the superstar would be their opponent in. She also disperses the idea that it would be the increased media attention attributed to Woods’ presence that causes other players to produce lower results.

Finally, Brown notes that superstars must in fact be in their ‘super’ stage of career to be able to create an adverse effect: in periods where Tiger Woods was not that successful (in years 2003-2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diaz|first1=Jaime|title=The Truth About Tiger|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/features/index.ssf?%2Ffeatures%2Fgd200501tigerdiaz1.html|website=GolfDigest.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|ref=Diaz|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415073152/http://www.golfdigest.com/features/index.ssf?%2Ffeatures%2Fgd200501tigerdiaz1.html|archivedate=15 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) golfers actually seem to have played better against him.

== Further research ==

Three years after Brown’s study, in 2010, a similar one was conducted in Japan by Ryuichi Tanaka and Kazutoshi Ishino.&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanaka|first1=Ryuichi|last2=Ishino|first2=Kazutoshi|title=Testing the incentive effects in tournaments with a superstar|journal=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies|date=2012|volume=26|issue=3|pages=393–404|url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jjieco:v:26:y:2012:i:3:p:393-404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers look at how the presence of Japan golfer superstar [[Kazuo Ozaki]] affects the game of others and their findings are in accordance with those of the paper on Woods. Their results suggest that when having to compete against Ozaki, players perform worse by about 0.3 strokes on average.

Yet another research, published by Brian C. Hill in 2014,&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Brian|title=The Superstar Effect in 100-Meter Tournaments|journal=International Journal of Sport Finance|date=2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=111–129|url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:jsf:intjsf:v:9:y:2014:i:2:p:111-129}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the same effect in 100-meter tournaments with [[Usain Bolt]] being the superstar on the field. Surprisingly, Hill finds a ''positive'' superstar effect, meaning that runners produce faster running times and the likelihood of setting a personal record is increased. Wanting to explain the results seemingly contradictory to that of Brown’s, Hill points out the simultaneous nature of running competitions (whereas in golf, players get to watch each other) and that a 100-meter race is about 10 seconds which does not leave competitors much time to alter their behaviour because of Bolt.

== Relevance in management ==

The importance of studying the dynamics of rank-order tournaments with heterogeneous competitors reaches beyond the world of sports. Numerous management strategies use competition as an incentive for better productivity,&lt;ref name="Kellogg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caley|first1=Beverly A.|title=Golf Lessons: Competing with superstars adversely affects performance|url=https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/golf_lessons|website=KelloggInsight|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to the superstar effect, if agents are to rival a superstar, they may in fact reduce their efforts.

'''Thomas C. Hauser''' (born 27 February 1946 in [[New York City]], [[United States]]) is an American author.

He made his debut as a writer in 1978 with ''The Execution of [[Charles Horman]]: An American Sacrifice''. Horman's wife, [[Joyce Horman]], and his parents, [[Edmund Horman|Edmund]] and [[Elizabeth Horman]], cooperated with Hauser on the book describing both the fate of Charles and his family's quest to uncover the truth in Chile. It was adapted as [[Costa-Gavras]]'s film ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]''.

In 1981, he published a novel, ''Ashworth &amp; Palmer'', set in a fictional law firm, which was inspired by his experience as an associate at [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]] from 1971 through 1977, following his graduation from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1970.

Hauser also wrote ''[[Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times]]'', a biography of boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name=PW&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-68892-9 Publishers Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was nominated for the [[National Book Award]]. In 1991 he was awarded the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] award for ''Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times''. More recently, Hauser authored ''Muhammad Ali: A Tribute to the Greatest''. 

He is a keen follower of boxing and is a staff writer for the boxing website The Sweet Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/columnists/thomas-hauser |title=Thomas Hauser |publisher=The Sweet Science |date=2011-12-03 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614225340/http://www.thesweetscience.com/columnists/thomas-hauser |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Boxing Scene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hauser|first=Thomas|title=Planet Floyd|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/planet-floyd--91165|publisher=Boxing Scene|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tibor Sekelj''' (14 February 1912 – 20 September 1988), also known as '''''Székely Tibor''''' according to Hungarian orthography, was a Hungarian&lt;ref&gt;In regard to his nationality, Sekelj said that he was a world citizen with Yugoslav citizenship. He never emphasized his Hungarian citizenship although his parents were Hungarians, nor did he consider himself to be either Croatian or Serbian. That said, he lived in Croatia and Serbia for long periods as a Yugoslav (with a Yugoslav passport), though always with a declaration of being a world citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; born [[polyglot]], [[explorer]], author, and 'citizen of the world.' In 1986 he was elected a member of the [[Academy of Esperanto]] and an honorary member of the [[World Esperanto Association]]. Among his novels, travel books and essays, his novella  ''Kumeŭaŭa, la filo de la ĝangalo'' ("Kumewawa, the son of the jungle"), a children's book about the life of Brazilian Indians, was translated into seventeen languages, and in 1987 it was voted best Children's book in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://esperanto.net/literaturo/roman/sekelj.html Information about Esperanto authors.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[European Esperanto Union]] declared 2012 "The Year of Tibor Sekelj" to honor the 100-year anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipernity.com/blog/32858/339249 Universal Congress in Copenhagen and activity of EEU] in the Blog of [[:eo:Zlatko Tišljar|Zlatko Tišljar]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Youth 1912–1939 ===
[[File:Tibor Sekelj loĝlokoj en Eŭropo blank.png|thumb|400px|Consecutive places of residence of Tibor Sekelj in Europe, in youth (1912–1939) and after return from South-America (1954–1988)]]

Sekelj's father was a veterinarian, and as a result the family moved around extensively. Several months after Tibor's birth the family moved to [[Čenej]] (now in [[Serbia]]), where Tibor lived until he was ten years old.  While Hungarian was his "mother tongue", the commonly spoken language was German. Sekelj had at least two sisters and a brother, [[Antonije Sekelj|Antonije]], who later collaborated with him on several books. In 1922, the family settled in [[Kikinda]], part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (now in Serbia), where Tibor learned [[Serbo-Croatian]]. He also studied French and soon was teaching it to his fellow students. Sekelj went on to learn a new language every four years. In 1926 his family moved to [[Nikšić]] (now in [[Montenegro]]), where he took up gym, mountaineering and where he walked the entire length of Montenegro.  In 1929 he entered the [[University of Zagreb]] (in Croatia) and in 1933 was one of the three youngest students to have graduated from the school of law.  During that time Tibor also studied painting, sculpture, [[Esperanto]], filmmaking and journalism.  But the practice of law bored him, and he turned his attention to writing. He began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1937 he started to work in Zagreb as a film screenwriter. In 1982, in Leuven, Belgium, at the World Youth Esperanto Conference, he discussed his [[Sephardic Jewish]] ancestry with [[Neil Blonstein]].

===World traveler===
Starting in 1939, Sekelj was a tireless globetrotter, and while he always returned to Serbia in between his many journeys, his need to explore new horizons melded with an insatiable curiosity about people. His travels and expeditions yielded books that have been translated into over twenty languages.

=== South America 1939–1954 ===
In 1939 he left Zagreb for [[Argentina]] to write an article on Croat exiles for a Zagreb newspaper ''Hrvatski Dnevnik''. Sekelj was on the ship Teresa&lt;ref&gt;Maybe was the last journey of the ship Teresa to South America because of the start of the world war. In 1939 the other ships that accustomed to travel to South America from Rijeka were used then of Italy because of the war in Africa. Deal about "Isarco", "Barbargo" and "Birmania" (all perished during the world war, and Teresa is taken by Brazil)&lt;/ref&gt; on what might have been that ship's last voyage due to the start of World War II. In 1939 the other ships that normally traveled to South America from Rijeka-Fiume were being used by Italy due to the war in Africa. Setting sail from [[Rijeka]] (then Fiume in Italy), he headed for Buenos Aires, with stops in Naples, Genoa (Italy) Santos (Brazil), and Montevideo (Uruguay). Tibor reached Buenos Aires on August 19, 1939. A pacifist by nature, Sekelj had anticipated the outbreak of war and so chose to be far from the fighting.  This difficult decision was due not to a lack of personal courage—Sekelj was known to display almost foolhardy bravery throughout his life—but because this Jewish Hungarian/world citizen was simply unwilling to hew to any ideology tied to military purposes.

Within two years &lt;ref name="Bonaero"&gt;One or two years. He wrote « one » but said « two » during interview to ''Rukovet''. « One year after the arrival in Buenos Aires, I already knew quite a lot the Spanish language for can start collaboration in some organ [...] », Sekelj T., ''Mondo de travivaĵoj'', Edistudio, 1981, p15&lt;/ref&gt; he had honed his knowledge of Spanish and got work as a journalist, publishing a monthly magazine dedicated to travel and exploration.  Sekelj remained in Argentina for the next 15 years, writing and exploring South America.

==== 1939–45: Argentina, Aconcagua ====
In 1944, with no prior mountaineering experience, Sekelj joined a crew on an ascent on [[Aconcagua]], the highest mountain ({{Formatnum:6962}}m) in the South American continent.,&lt;ref name="Akonkagvo"&gt;In 40th years according to measure of Argentinian army one considered that Aconcagua was {{Formatnum:7021}} m high. Sekelj mentions {{Formatnum:6980}}m. Of 1989 one considers that it is {{Formatnum:6962}}m&lt;/ref&gt; led by the Swiss German mountaineer [[Georg Link]]. Sekelj, the Austrian Zechner and the Italian Bertone reached the summit on February 13, 1944. But tragedy loomed: Four of the six men on that climb perished in a snowstorm. This terrible experience inspired Sekelj to write his first book: ''Storm Over Aconcagua'', which recounts the drama in thrilling detail. On a second climb—initiated by the Argentinian Army, which Tibor led—the corpses of the four young men were found and brought home. As a result, Sekelj added a chapter to the second edition of  ''Tempestad sobre el Aconcagua, 1944'' in which he describes that adventure. Then Argentine President Juan [[Juan Perón|Perón]] personally tried to award Sekelj honorary Argentine Citizenship for his actions, along with the Golden Condor the country's highest medal of honor.  Tibor, in his gentle rejection of the offer of citizenship, stated that, while he deeply appreciated the offer, as a Citizen of the World, he could not be bound to any one country.

==== 1946–47: Mato-Grosso ====
Based on the success of his first book, Sekelj's publisher urged him to write a second, unrelated one.  With a budget of two thousand dollars, Sekelj chose to explore uncharted regions of the  [[Brazil]]ian rainforests in [[Mato Grosso]], otherwise known as the River of Death.  In 1946 he undertook first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, which produced a popular book, "Along Native Trails" (Por Tierra De Indios). His partner on this arduous journey was an Argentinian of Russian descent [[Mary Reznik]] (1914–1996). Together they spent nearly a year exploring tribes along the [[Araguaia River|Araguaia]] and [[Rio das Mortes]] Rivers.  Along the way they survived contact with the fearsome [[Xavante people|Xavantes]] Indians, who had killed over a hundred people, in many expeditions before them. They also encountered the ''[[Karajá people|Karajá]]'' and ''[[Javae]]'' Indians on this expedition. Eventually the book ''Por Tierra de Indios'' (1946) chronicling survival in difficult circumstances, amid illness and near-starvation, met with great success, was reprinted repeatedly and translated into many languages.  In 1946 Tibor and Mary married. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948. After that expedition he penned "Where Civilization Ends" (''Donde La Civilizacion Termina'').

In the summer of 1946, Tibor traveled through Patagonia with three companions : Zechner, Mary and Dr Rosa Scolnik. During the following years he audited classes at the University of [[Buenos Aires]] to attend lectures on anthropology, ethnology and archeology, in order to get useful knowledge for his upcoming expeditions.

==== 1948–49: Bolivia, Jivaros ====
In 1948 a failed expedition to find the [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaros]] led Tibor and Mary to Bolivia, where they met with President [[Enrique Hertzog]].  He encouraged them to explore the unknown area of the River [[Itenez]], which abuts with Brazil. During that difficult six-month-long journey they encountered more hardships and hostile Indians, among them the [[Tupari]], a tribe that only a few years before had been practicing [[cannibalism|cannibals]].  In April 1949, President Hertzog of Brazil proposed that Sekelj should oversee a territory spanning one hundred thousand hectares, from the planned 4 millions of hectares meant to house a million European refugees.  Sekelj, rather than having to wait for six months for parliament to render a decision, turned down the offer.  He later regretted the missed opportunity to have a place where Esperanto could become the common language to its populace. In September 1949 Mary gave birth to a son, Diego Reinaldo Sekelj, whom Tibor named after a son of Christopher Columbus.

==== 1949–1951 Venezuela ====
After attending the [[World Congress of Esperanto]] in UK, Tibor spent seven months in Europe. He returned to South America, joining Mary in [[Venezuela]].  For the next seventeen months he wrote newspaper articles, while managing a musical instruments store in [[Maracaibo]].  After going to [[Caracas]] to oversee the creation of a series of historical murals, he began traveling through Central America on his own, as by this time he and Mary and separated. The couple  formally divorced in 1955, and soon after Mary went to the United States, where she remarried. Their son, given her second husband's surname, is {{as of|2011|lc=on}}, Daniel Reinaldo Bernstein, a respected acupuncturist and musician living in New York City.

==== 1951–54: Central America ====
Tibor later wrote about being on the island of [[San Blas Islands|San Blas]] in Panama, where he engaged with the ''[[Kuna people|Kuna]]'' Indians; of an attempt to scale the volcano [[Izalko]] in El Salvador, that was cut short by a volcanic eruption; and of discovering the ruins of an ancient city in [[Honduras]], which many people knew from legends only, and that was built by  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. It was during these treks through [[Guatemala]] and Honduras that Sekelj became ever more immersed in [[archeology]] and [[anthropology]].

Upon Sekelj's arrival in Mexico in 1953, several alpine clubs invited him to take part in their treks. This was not unexpected, given the fact that his book ''« Tempestad sobre el Aconcagua »'' had practically become a manual for mountain climbing.  He climbed [[Popocatépetl]], [[Iztaccihuatl]] and many other volcanoes and mountains, further firming up his expertise in that arena. One of many fascinating explorations at that time was the underground crossing of the river [[San Heronimo]], lying 14-km within the interior of mountain.&lt;ref&gt;« At the beginning of 1953, when I arrived to Mexico, the sport of mountain climbing erupted.  At that time in Mexico city there were a hundred mountaineer clubs with 25 000 members. In absence of any textbook for that sport, the Mexican mountaineers used my book about Aconcagua as a foundation for that sport. In the book I wrote everything that I'd learned on the ground, since the preparation for the expedition, we used the pickaxe, how to set up a tent, until the various kinds of avalanches and the impacts of the [[altitude sickness]].  The book was published in Mexico and every Mexican mountaineer knew it. From that followed that everyone there considered me a mountain climbing master, and the members of every club wanted me to be their guest climber, especially on the most difficult climbs. In this way I climbed Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl and many other volcanoes, mountains and insulating rocks. So, I unwillingly became an expert mountaineer. », Sekelj T., ''Mondo de travivaĵoj'', Edistudio, 1981, p20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent world trips based from Europe 1954–1988===
In 1954 Sekelj returned to his home in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. He was given a warm welcome by the local government and its people, as much for his humanitarian message as for his fascinating travelogues.  Along with his countless newspaper articles, his books were translated into Serbian, Slovenian, Hungarian, Albanian and Esperanto.  He continued to travel and write of his experiences.

====1956–57: India, China, Nepal====
In 1956 he drove through Asia as a [[World Esperanto Association]] (UEA) observer to an upcoming [[UNESCO]] talk held in New Delhi. When his car crashed in [[Tehran]] he continued on by bus and rail. During that journey he met extensively with Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and his daughter, future prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. He also befriended the future president Dr [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]. In the Yugoslav embassy he met with [[Ljubomir Vukotić]], then president of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] When Vukotić met with Indian and Chinese representatives to open an Asian office, Seklelj acted as interpreter, bridging a communication gap between non-hearing people of different languages.  In January 1957, he accompanied Vukotić to China, which at the time was not accepting visitors.  This was followed by a six-month stay  on the invitation of King Mahendra of [[Nepal]], another country that was, at that time, hostile to foreigners.  King [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]] personally thanked Sekelj for founding the first people's university, and for helping to spread the teaching of Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;Group picture before the Statue of Kala Bhairava with Tibor Sekelj, Founding assembly of Esperanto-Group in Kathmandu, 1957, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek [http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/ImageDetail.aspx?p_iBildID=8092775 ÖNB 8092775]&lt;/ref&gt; This friendship is in part the subject of Tibor's book, ''« Nepal opens the door », 1959,'' which he first wrote in Esperanto while in [[Madras]] studying [[yoga]] philosophy.  The book was translated into multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Serbian and Slovenian.  His journey through India, on foot and by bus, led Tibor from village to village, and from temple to temple, culminating in a month-long stay in a cave with three Yogin.

====1958–60: Vinoba Bhave, Japan, Sri Lanka====
After spending six months in Europe Sekelj again flew to India, this time to teach Esperanto to the great Indian Mystic, [[Vinoba Bhave]]. The Hindu scholar mastered Esperanto within a month.  Sekelj remained in India for five months before landing, penniless, in Japan.  In March 1960, he set off on a four-month tour across 30 cities in Japan, always welcome at the home of Esperantists there. Between lecturing and writing newspaper articles, Sekelj earned enough money to buy an airplane ticket to [[Sri Lanka]], and then to [[Israel]] before returning to his home base in Belgrade.

====1961–63: Morocco, "Caravan of Friendship" in Africa====
In 1961, Sekelj accepted the invitation of Moroccan Esperantists and traveled to [[Morocco]], where he joined a caravan of [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] nomads into the Sahara. In March 1962, Tibor set off for  Africa on a ''Karavano de Amikeco'' (Caravan of Friendship), with eight people from four countries in two all-terrain  cars. With a goal of direct communication between people, this yearlong journey reached [[Egypt]], Sudan, [[Ethiopia]], Somalia, [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].  When a second caravan meant for other African countries failed to materialize, Tibor climbed [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the highest peak in Africa. This trip is the theme of his book ''Ĝambo rafiki''. Although he wrote the book in Esperanto, it first appeared in the Slovenian language.

====1965–66: Russia, Japan, Mongolia, Europe====
In 1965, on his way to the  [[World Congress of Esperanto]] in Tokyo, Tibor traveled by train across Russia (Moscow) and Siberia ([[Irkutsk]] and [[Khabarovsk]]) to [[Nahodka]], before landing in  [[Yokohama]] by boat. A month later Tibor crossed Siberia by train, with a side trip to [[Mongolia]]. Given the antipathy to foreigners there, his three-month stay was difficult, despite having a stamped visa and correct documents.  In ensuing years Tibor Sekelj managed to visit every European country, with the exception of Albania and Iceland.

====1970: Australia, New Zealand, New-Guinea====
In 1970, Yugoslav television sent Sekelj to Australia, New Zealand and [[New Guinea]]. During his six-month stay he climbed [[Mount Kosciuszko]]&lt;ref&gt;Tibor Sekelj on the top of the Mount Kosciuszko, 1970 before the peak cross and Esperanto flag in hand, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, [http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/ImageDetail.aspx?p_iBildID=7619469 ÖNB 7619469]&lt;/ref&gt; In New Guinea he met with natives whose lack of previous contact with the civilized world led to tense situations.  But among Sekelj's many skills—and perhaps luck was just another one—was an uncanny ability to escape imminent danger time and again.  Certainly he adapted easily to odd customs (including bizarre food), but if there was a single thing in particular that helped in this regard, it was his communication skills, which transcended even his facility with language.

====1972–1980: North America, Russia, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Ecuador====
In 1972, while at the international congress of ethnologists in Chicago Tibor visited eastern Canada and United States. In 1977, during the same event  in [[Leningrad]], he saw [[Uzbekistan]] and Central Asia. That same year he took part in a festival celebrating the culture of former slaves in Lagos ([[Nigeria]]). In 1978, during an assignment for Yugoslav TV, he returned to South America, where he visited  [[Ecuador]] and the [[Galápagos Islands]].

What amazed many was how this tireless traveler always got funding for his travels.   He famously attributed this ability to the fact that he did the work of seven: Writer; cameraman; assistant; photographer; and buyer and shipper of ethnographic artifacts.   While each of these jobs is usually delegated to others, Sekelj was a one-man crew.  Of course, one could have added 'Ad Man' to that list. Whenever it was possible, Tibor would wrangle advertising contracts from airlines in exchange for discounted tickets.

====Work for Esperanto====
Sekelj devoted much of his life to the defense and promotion of Esperanto. A Committee member of UEA since 1946, he sought for over thirty years—with a brief break while skirmishing with [[Ivo Lapenna]]) over its activity within the [[Instituto por Oficialigo de Esperanto]] (IOE),&lt;ref name="IEO"&gt;Instituto por Oficialigo de Esperanto = Institution for Officialization of Esperanto&lt;/ref&gt; to be part of all the universal Esperanto Congresses. And as a representative of the IDU—the International Committee for Ethnographic Museums—he took part in numerous conferences.  Sekelj's polyglot abilities often assured that he alone could understand all of the multi-national speakers there.

In 1983, he co-founded EVA ([[Esperantist Writers Association]] and was its first president. In 1986 he was elected to be a member of the [[Akademio de Esperanto|Academy of Esperanto]].

He took every opportunity to advocate for Esperanto, particularly in the [[international PEN|international Writers association PEN]]&lt;ref&gt;50th PEN-Congress, Lugano 1987 [[Leon Maurice Anoma Kanie]], [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] writer and ambassador, at table  with the world traveler, investigator and Journalist Tibor Sekelj, defender of recognition of Esperanto as literary language, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, [http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/ImageDetail.aspx?p_iBildID=7920556 ÖNB 7920556]&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[UNESCO]]. In 1985, during the 27th Conference in  [[Sofia]], Sekelj was commissioned by UEA to ensure that  Unesco would draft a [[:eo:Unesko#Rezolucio de 1985 (Sofio)|second resolution]] that would be favorable to Esperanto .

====1972–1988: Director of museum in Subotica====
In 1972, he took a four-year job as head curator of the [[Municipal Museum in Subotica]] (Serbia – [[Vojvodina]]).  In the later 1970s he took advanced studies in museology in [[Zagreb University]] leading to a doctorate (in 1976). His innovative ideas and projects found little support, and Sekelj quit his job almost immediately.  He attended the World Congress of ethnographers in Chicago in the United States and the World congress of museum professionals in [[Copenhagen]]. Upon his election to Secretary of the [[International Committee of Museologists]], he took on various initiatives for new kinds of museums with dioramas.

In 1985, Sekelj met a young woman [[Erzsébet Sekelj]], a librarian, born in 1958, whom he met on a journey through [[Hungary]]. That year she learned Esperanto. Sekelj and Erzsébet married in 1987 in [[Osijek]]. Together they visited three World Congresses of Esperanto. Erzsébet Sekelj participated in the drafting of the vojvodina organ VELO. They jointly wanted to compile an Esperanto-Serbo-Croatian dictionary, which was never completed due to the death of Tibor.&lt;ref&gt;According to disclosures of Erzsébet Sekelj.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibor lived in [[Subotica]] from 1972 until his death, September 20, 1988. He is buried in ''[[Bajsko groblje]]'' (Baja cemetery) in Subotica, with the highest honors from the city of Subotica. On his grave, under bronze bas-relief one can read that inscription in Esperanto: (WRITER, TRAVELER)

1912–1988&lt;br&gt;

== Skills ==
Tibor Sekelj was adroit at a wide range of skills: journalist, explorer, adventurer, mountaineer, writer, drawer, filmmaker, geographer, ethnologist, museologist, polyglot and actor on the political stage, relating to politicians including aforementioned heads of state. His defense and promotion of Esperanto at Unesco and mainly the UEA. The connecting thread in this man's world view was a consistent access to peoples from around the world.

=== Geographer ===
Traveling certainly helped make him a geographer, but he also was forced to become a true cartographer during his travels. In that regard he researched and designed charts of several previously uncharted parts of South America, especially in Bolivia and Brazil. As a result, a river was named after him: [[Rio Tibor]]. He published word maps in Esperanto and edited a professional review ''«Geografia Revuo»'' between 1956 and 1964. In 1950 he became a member of Guatemala society about history and geography and, because of his merits in this area, in 1946 the [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society of United Kingdom]] accepted him as an ''[[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]]''.

=== Journalist ===
He learned about journalism during his student years in Zagreb, where he became a correspondent for Croatian newspapers : one from them, ''Hrvatski Dnevnik'', sent him as his correspondent to [[Argentina]], to do a report on Yugoslav emigrants, which is how he became a traveller. After two years &lt;ref name="Bonaero"/&gt; he learned Spanish enough to self-publish,  [[Buenos Aires]], in Spanish language, monthly organ ''« Rutas »'' (Ways) a magazine dedicated to geography, journeys, tourism, explorations, etc.&lt;ref&gt;According to available information, appeared only three editions, with colour cover and black-white content: the first 15 September 1943 (32 pages), the second 15 October (32 pages), and the double edition 3–4 (probably the last) month later, with only 16 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working as a journalist for an Argentinian newspaper, he decided to  join a planned expedition to [[Aconcagua]], the highest mountain of Americas (more than 7000 m according to contemporary ratings).&lt;ref name="Akonkagvo"/&gt;  For the most part he was able to support himself through writing, contributing to many newspapers, mainly in South America and Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia he contributed to many  small newspapers, so that the younger generation learned about Esperanto through his articles in young people's periodicals. In his 60's he became a television journalist, filming a series of TV-reports for the [[Radio Television of Serbia|Belgrade Television]] about the [[Caravan of Friendship]] (travel through Africa) for the [[Zagreb Television]] about exploring unknown tribes in Australia and [[New Guinea]] and for the [[Novi Sad Television]] about Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. He was also a brilliant journalist for Esperanto. Except contribution to many Esperanto-newspapers and organs he was chief editor during 8 years for the [[Geografia Revuo]], [[E-Gazeto]] (initially IOE-Gazeto) of 1966–1972 (monthly organ – entirely appeared 65 editions) and [[VELO]] during six years (1983–1988 – Vojvodina Esperanto-newspaper).

"Geografia Revuo" appeared between 1956 until 1964,&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph.onb.ac.at/F?func=file&amp;file_name=login&amp;local_base=ESPERANTO *Trovanto]: [http://aleph.onb.ac.at/F/UNMGJA66VYQM1Q74DKDSYGH3HPDCAFSRB96DRHKREKTCEVX9VQ-08977?func=find-b&amp;find_code=WRD&amp;adjacent=N&amp;request=Geografia+Revuo&amp;x=10&amp;y=11 Geografia Revuo]&lt;/ref&gt; each one volume yearly, except in 1959–1960 neither in 1962. The title-pages of exclusively all six volumes are of Sekelj, only in the 4th issue he left the place of the editorial to [[Aafke Haverman]] ''("Aviadile tra Afriko")'' and laid his ''"Kun la Ajnoj de Hokajdo"'' in the central booklet. Looked at as entirety, "Geografia Revuo" is virtually personal periodical of Sekelj with some appendices of friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipernity.com/doc/bernardo/4246246 Geografia Revuo, 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived chiefly on his work as a journalist (writing articles and stories for many various newspapers and organs) and filmmaker. There were 740 translations of his articles in newspapers and organs.&lt;ref&gt;In response to a question by [[Spomenka Štimec]] in [[OKO]] regarding the number of original texts he had written, he was unsure.&lt;/ref&gt; We can say definitely that he was writing for many dozens of newspapers and magazines, mainly in Yugoslavia but also in Hungary, and various countries in South America—not to mention the periodicals in Esperanto.  Of the 7500 speeches he gave, the majority centered around his journeys, although he spoke prolifically on many other topics as well.

He traveled through 90 countries and his books appeared in as many countries and a great many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Tibor mentioned that his books also were translated in Urdu and other Mid-Eastern languages, although that has yet to be proven. Certainly it is possible they were in fact published there, but it was impossible to track them down in those countries' libraries because of the  Arab and Sanskrit scripts .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmmaker===
Tibor's first job after getting his Degree in Zagreb was with a film company, Merkurfilm. The company sent him to learn film production in Prague, where he studied under a famous Czech director [[Otokar Vavra]] where for 6 months Tibor studied film direction.

Once Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia in the 1960s, he began getting TV coverage as a journalist. And because his forays into unknown areas required more than just pictures—they required film—Tibor accepted the challenge. He began using his knowledge as a filmmaker, not only directing himself but also using sound and light, camera work and more on his trips to New Guinea and Australia. For Zagreb television he filmed a series of films about those regions and their natives that became a 10-hour-long travel film series seen across Yugoslavia.  Amazingly, he did everything on those films alone. In the later part of the 1970s he made films about Colombia and Ecuador where he used a professional team of filmmakers from Novi Sad Television, which promoted his travel films.

He himself was the subject of many interviews, chiefly within former Yugoslav televisions. A large majority of that material has been preserved. One example is an in-depth, two-hour interview with TV journalist Hetrich.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Tibor in Serbian organ Rukovet 5/1983 and list of archived materials related to Sekelj of Zagreb television&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mountaineer ===
In Argentina he learned about [[mountaineering]] with barely enough time to prepare before taking part in an expedition to Aconcagua. Still he was able to survive the climb up that treacherous mountain.  Later on, he climbed a number of very dangerous mountains, and on all the continents,  between the mountains of Nepal, Mexico and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Africa, and [[Mount Kosciuszko]] in Australia. His detailed description of the ascent on Aconcagua in a book in Spanish became a sort of textbook for mountaineering in Mexico, and other countries across South America.

=== Ethnologist ===
During his travels he became a collector of native masks, hats and musical instruments, along with spoken native poetry. Concerning the latter he published the book ''[[Elpafu la sagon]]'', that appeared in Serbocroatian and Esperanto. He donated his tangible collection of masks, instruments and hats to [[Ethnographic museum in Zagreb]] and to Municipal museum of [[Subotica]], where most of them were later given to the museum of [[Senta]] (Serbia).&lt;ref&gt;Tibor intended to donate his collection to the city (not at all to the museum, without finding here support for his notions and draft), and his widower and the city even signed contract about that. From that was nothing, so that ultimately part of the collection (entirely 733 objects) the widower donated to the museum in Senta (in the catalogue of the exhibition in Senta one mentions gift of 86 objects).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adventurer ===
Although his goal was never to impress others, the most attractive aspect of Tibor Sekelj's life in the eyes of the public—especially to the non-esperantist—was unarguably his adventurer side. Perhaps it was his ceaseless search to locate the essence of human spirit that led him to remote parts of the earth. Across a span of over forty years he studied, and engaged with, tribes from the rain forests of [[Brazil]] and [[New Guinea]], always learning and annotating the customs, lifestyles and philosophies of then unknown peoples in Asia and Africa. Many times he befriended people otherwise hostile to the white man, and often risking his life in the process. He writes eruditely about this in his book in Esperanto ''"Mondo de travivaĵoj" (The world of experiences ), 1981.''

=== Political militant ===
Among Sekelj's many skills was an ability to create an instant sense of ease between himself and politicians and men in power. Score of heads of state welcomed him into their circle, and in turn he gave them useful advice based on his travels through their territories. During his life he met with various heads of State : From Juan [[Juan Perón|Perón]] (Argentinian president) he received in 1946 an award, the Golden Condor, along with an offer of Argentinian citizenship due to his bravery on Aconcagua. He met with, and became a friend of, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (Indian prime minister) and his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] (future Indian prime minister), and with [[Radhakrishnan]] (future Indian president). Bolivia president [[Enrique Hertzog]] sent him to do research in uncharted regions of Bolivia in 1948, and in 1949 asked him to manage Bolivian territory for European refugees after World War II, offering 100.000 hectares for him to do that. Tibor asked for 4 million, but was told it would take half year for the Bolivian parliament to ratify that. He chose not to wait and left before ratification could take place.  Also he met with King [[Mahendra of Nepal]], who thanked Tibor Sekelj for creating the first people's university there, where he taught Esperanto.

The peak of his political activity was in 1985 when he took over the UEA in order to prepare [[:eo:Unesko#Rezolucio de 1985 (Sofio)|the second resolution]] of [[UNESCO]] on Esperanto. He met with numerous heads of state, ministers and diplomats during his four participations in UNESCO-talks throughout 1984 and 1985. He finally succeeded in convincing the Yugoslavian government to offer that resolution to the Assembly of UNESCO in [[Sofia]], while getting other Esperantists to work on the governments of China, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, San Marino and Costa Rica in order to back the resolution. Over the next months he visited the embassies of seven of those countries, finally succeeding in convincing them that they should work with their governments and accept the resolution. In Sofia he negotiated between the delegations of numerous countries to vote on the resolution, which in the end was accepted.

To all of this we can also add the few months he spent living with the Indian philosopher and political activist [[Vinoba Bhave]], not to mention many, many heads of smaller regions and cities and states across the world.

===Polyglot===
Sekelj learned 25 languages and countless dialects, of which he retained nine at the end of his life: Hungarian, Serbian, German, Esperanto, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese.  Of these he wrote extensively in Spanish, Esperanto and the Serbo-Croatian, He was an interpreter on his travels and as part of his work for [[International Puppet Theatre Festival|PIF]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.carnet.hr/pif-festival/ International Puppet Theatre Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; during acceptances, arrangements etc.

{{Quote|I learned around 25 of languages. Many of them I forgot, because I stopped using them. I still can use some 9 languages, and although that's not enough to get by in the entire world, I can communicate with almost anyone despite that.|Interview with Stipan Milodanoviĉ&lt;ref name="StipMilo"&gt;Radio-interview with Stipan Milodanoviĉ: « Ja sam učio oko 25 jezika. Mnoge sam zaboravio jer ih nisam više koristio. Uspeo sam da zadržim kao svoju trajnu svojinu 9 jezika koje i sada govorim Tih 9 jezika nisu dovoljni za ceo svet, ali jedan dobar deo sveta mogu da obidjem.» http://www.ipernity.com/doc/fulmobojana/7066327/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Esperantist===
After becoming an Esperantist in Zagreb in 1930, Sekelj remained committed to the ideals of the international language throughout his life. His contributions to the language are immense: Sekelj founded ten Esperanto-Associations in South America and Asia and Esperanto-societies in 50 of cities across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Josip Pleadin, ''Bibliografia leksikono de kroatiaj esperantistoj'', page 137 « in 8 lands » (but are not said in that)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What he said to Zlatko Tiŝlar, clarifies his position: "It may be that he sought to change the fabric of culture when he led Esperanto-courses in cities that never had them before.  That said there is little concrete information about the exact places where he taught."&lt;/ref&gt;

For over twenty years Sekelj was a committee member of UEA and he was single-handedly responsible for the second resolution where UNESCO positively addressed Esperanto in 1985. One-third of his books were originally written in Esperanto. He wrote a great many lucid and cogent articles for various Esperanto-newspapers and magazines, and he drafted ''Geografia Revuo, E-Gazeto ''and'' Velo.'' But his intense activity in the name of Esperanto related to his foundation and guide of [[International Institute for Officialization of Esperanto]] (IOE)&lt;ref name="IEO"/&gt; that launched the motto « better practice than 100-hours sermon » like this requiring more open activity of Esperantists. In that sense he especially engaged in diverse travel, organizing bus caravans that traveled across the world, having its greatest impact at the start  of the [[International Puppet Theatre Festival]] (PIF) in Zagreb and later at the foundation for ''[[Internacia Kultura Servo]]'' (International Cultural Service). PIF still exists, [[now in 2011|currently]] after 44 years and still distributes an annual prize "Tibor Sekelj" for the most humanitarian message. His very intensive activity in the name of IOE had a strong effect on the classical neutral Esperanto-movement in the practical application, on the one hand in terms of culture and tourism and on the other to a more elastic conception of impartiality that followed [[TEJO]].

His motto for success: "Three things are essential for success: precisely define your goal, move steadily toward it, and persist until you have reached it."

====Teacher====
He influenced the teaching of Esperanto, and was behind the launching of the first televised course in Esperanto in China. In the 1980s, he wrote textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;''Curso fundamental de esperanto del maestro Tibor Sekelj para los países iberoamericanos'', Mexico 1970, instituted the Youth Esperanto Association of Mexico; ''Kurso de Esperanto – laŭ aŭdvida struktura metodo'' (Course of Esperanto – according to audiovisual structural method) was issued in form of sheets since 1966 (later combined as complete material)&lt;/ref&gt; The authors were [[Antonije Sekelj|A.]] and T. Sekelj and Klas Aleksandar and Novak Koloman did the illustrations. The course existed also in form of transparencies – actually movies – one can project.
He led many Master Esperanto classes wherever he travelled and also took part in the improvement of the «Zagreb method» textbook. Tibor Sekelj gave between 7000 and 8000 speeches, most often with photos of his travels, wrote innumerable articles about Esperanto in the national press and was interviewed hundreds of times for national radios, newspapers and television. He always spoke about Esperanto.

===World view===
Wherever he was, in his lectures and activities he conveyed to his audience his simple philosophy of life: man as an individual is the most precious thing in his own environment, regardless of descent or education. (This is most clearly expressed in his work "Kumeŭaŭa".) Man as a cultural capital is the product of all humanity, because in our daily lives we interact with products invented by diverse people; he illustrated this with a dining table, explaining that each piece of tableware was invented by a different people, each of the foods that had been developed and planted by different people, and now ten cultures are involved in setting a table. Therefore, every man was a respectable person, and what we have today is the result of efforts of all nations, and therefore belongs to all.

=== Artist ===
Aside from being an adept writer, Sekelj studied painting and sculptor while still a student in Zagreb.  When he first landed in Argentina, he survived doing portraits and later he often illustrated his own books.

==== Writer ====
Tibor is perhaps the most well-known original Esperanto-writers among the non-esperantist world, given the number of his translated books from Esperanto. The most successful his work ''Kumewawa – the son of jungle'' has been translated multiple times, while others books have between two and ten translations.  Writing in Esperanto, Spanish and Serbo-Croatian he produced some thirty works of travel writing, novels, stories and poetry.

The most successful of his books is « Kumewawa – the son of jungle » (originally written in Esperanto) translated into 22 languages.  In 1983 the Japanese ministry for education proclaimed in 1983 as one from the 4 best juvenile literature published in Japan. As a result, it appeared in Japanese in 300.000 copies, probably the largest printing from an Esperanto-based document.  In total, over a million copies of Kumewawa were printed throughout the world.

''Tempest above Aconcagua'' was a book that appealed across generations and to all parts of the world. His stories won prizes of [[Belartaj Konkursoj]] &lt;ref&gt;[[:eo:Belartaj Konkursoj de UEA]]&lt;/ref&gt; and his poetry, although sparse, is considered valuable and worth studying.

'''Turkish''' ({{Audio|Turkce.ogg|''Türkçe''}}), also referred to as '''Istanbul Turkish''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tdk.gov.tr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=281 |title="İstanbul Türkçesi" konulu deneme yarışması ödül töreni |website=[[Turkish Language Association]] |language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most widely spoken of the [[Turkic languages]], with around 10–15 million native speakers in [[Southeast Europe]] (mostly in [[East Thrace|East]] and [[Western Thrace]]) and 60–65 million native speakers in [[Western Asia]] (mostly in [[Anatolia]]). Outside [[Turkey]], significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia,{{r|turkic}} [[Northern Cyprus]],{{r|cyprus}} Greece,{{r|greece}} the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia. [[Cyprus]] has requested that the [[European Union]] add Turkish as an official EU language, even though Turkey is not a member state.{{r|cyprus-eu}}

To the west, the influence of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]—the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the [[Ottoman Empire]]—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of [[Atatürk's Reforms]] in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] was replaced with a [[Turkish alphabet|Latin alphabet]].

The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are [[vowel harmony]] and extensive [[agglutination]]. The basic word order of Turkish is [[subject–object–verb]]. Turkish has no [[noun class]]es or [[grammatical gender]]. The language has a strong [[T–V distinction]] and usage of [[honorific]]s. Turkish uses [[Grammatical person|second-person]] [[pronoun]]s that distinguish varying levels of politeness, [[social distance]], age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee. The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect.

{{Main article|Turkic languages}}
[[File:Kyzyl orkhon inscription.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] inscription with the [[Old Turkic alphabet]] (c. 8th century). [[Kyzyl]], Russia]]

About 40% of all speakers of Turkic languages are native Turkish speakers.{{r|katzner}}The characteristic features of Turkish, such as [[vowel harmony]], [[agglutination]], and lack of [[grammatical gender]], are universal within the Turkic family. The Turkic family comprises some 30 living languages spoken across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Siberia.

Turkish is a member of the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz group of languages]], a subgroup of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] family. There is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between Turkish and the other Oghuz Turkic languages, including [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], and [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]].{{r|ucla}}

The Turkic languages were grouped into the now discredited [[Altaic languages|Altaic language group]].

{{see also|Turkish people|Turkic peoples#History}}

The earliest known [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic inscriptions]] are the three monumental [[Orkhon inscriptions]] found in modern [[Mongolia]]. Erected in honour of the prince [[Kul Tigin]] and his brother Emperor [[Bilge Khagan]], these date back to the second Turk Kaghanate.{{r|erdal}} After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the [[Orkhon Valley]] between 1889 and 1893, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language]] written using the [[Old Turkic alphabet]], which has also been referred to as "Turkic runes" or "runiform" due to a superficial similarity to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[runic alphabet]]s.{{r|runiform}}

With the [[Turkic expansion]] during Early Middle Ages (c. 6th–11th centuries), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across [[Central Asia]], covering a vast geographical region stretching from [[Siberia]] and to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] of the [[Oghuz Turks]], in particular, brought their language, [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]]—the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language—into [[Anatolia]] during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Findley"&gt;Findley{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] from the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects'' (Ottoman Turkish: ''Divânü Lügati't-Türk'').&lt;ref name="Soucek"&gt;Soucek{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman Turkish ===
{{Main article|Ottoman Turkish language}}

Following the adoption of [[Islam]] c. 950 by the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Turkish literature]] during the Ottoman period, particularly [[Ottoman poetry|Divan poetry]], was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the [[Ottoman Empire]] period (c. 1299–1922) is termed [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish. The everyday Turkish, known as ''kaba Türkçe'' or "rough Turkish", spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glenny|2001|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language reform and modern Turkish ===
After the foundation of the modern state of [[Turkey]] and the [[#Writing system|script reform]], the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a [[language reform]] to replace [[loanword]]s of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;See Lewis (2002) for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.&lt;/ref&gt; By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.&lt;ref name="TDK History"/&gt;   

Owing to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions. It is considered particularly ironic that Atatürk himself, in [[Nutuk|his lengthy speech]] to the new [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] in 1927, used a style of Ottoman which sounded so alien to later listeners that it had to be "translated" three times into modern Turkish: first in 1963, again in 1986, and most recently in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;See Lewis (2002): 2–3 for the first two translations. For the third see {{cite web |author=Bedi Yazıcı |url=http://www.nutuk.org/ |title=Nutuk: Özgün metin ve çeviri (Atatürk's Speech: original text and translation) |accessdate=2007-09-28 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from English. Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance. However, the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier changes—such as ''{{lang|tr|bölem}}'' to replace ''{{lang|tr|fırka}}'', "political party"—also failed to meet with popular approval (''{{lang|tr|fırka}}'' has been replaced by the French loanword ''{{lang|tr|parti}}''). Some words restored from Old Turkic have taken on specialized meanings; for example ''{{lang|tr|betik}}'' (originally meaning "book") is now used to mean "[[scripting language|script]]" in [[computer science]].&lt;ref name=cokbilgi&gt;{{cite web|title=Öz Türkçeleştirme Çalışmaları|url=http://www.cokbilgi.com/yazi/oz-turkcelestirme-calismalari/|work=Çok Bilgi|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the words derived by TDK coexist with their older counterparts.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This usually happens when a loanword changes its original meaning. For instance, ''{{lang|tr|dert}}'', derived from the Persian ''{{lang|fa-Latn|dard}}'' ({{lang|fa|درد}} "pain"), means "problem" or "trouble" in Turkish; whereas the native Turkish word ''{{lang|tr|ağrı}}'' is used for physical pain. Sometimes the loanword has a slightly different meaning from the native Turkish word, creating a situation similar to the coexistence of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages|Romance]] words in English.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:

== Geographic distribution ==
{{see also|Turkish diaspora}}
Turkish is natively spoken by the [[Turkish people]] in Turkey and by the [[Turkish diaspora]] in some 30 other countries. Turkish language is mutually intelligible with [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and other Turkic languages. In particular, Turkish-speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly (in whole or part) belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]], such as Iraq{{r|iraq}}, Bulgaria, [[Cyprus]], Greece (primarily in [[Western Thrace]]), the [[Republic of Macedonia]], Romania, and Serbia. More than two million Turkish speakers live in Germany; and there are significant Turkish-speaking communities in the United States, France, The Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue Turkish"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|authorlink=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tur|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition.

In Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the [[Turkish Language Association]] (''Türk Dil Kurumu'' or TDK), which was founded in 1932 under the name ''Türk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti'' ("Society for Research on the Turkish Language"). The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the ideology of [[linguistic purism]]: indeed one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin.&lt;ref&gt;The name TDK itself exemplifies this process. The words ''tetkik'' and ''cemiyet'' in the original name are both Arabic loanwords (the final ''-i'' of ''cemiyeti'' being a Turkish possessive suffix); ''kurum'' is a native Turkish word based on the verb ''kurmak'', "set up, found".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, together with the adoption of the new [[Turkish alphabet]] in 1928, shaped the [[#Language reform and modern Turkish|modern Turkish language]] spoken today. TDK became an independent body in 1951, with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August 1983, when it was again made into a governmental body in the [[Constitution of Turkey|constitution of 1982]], following the military [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|coup d'état of 1980]].&lt;ref name="TDK History"&gt;{{cite web|author=Turkish Language Association|authorlink=Turkish Language Association|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF2858DA18F4388CDD|title=Türk Dil Kurumu – Tarihçe (History of the Turkish Language Association)|accessdate=2007-03-18|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070316024438/http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF2858DA18F4388CDD |archivedate = March 16, 2007|deadurl=yes|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one source claims Turkish consonants are larengially specified three-way fortis-lenis (aspirated/neutral/voiced) like Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Petrova |first=Olga |last2=Plapp |first2=Rosemary |last3=Ringen |first3=Catherine |last4=Szentgyörgyi |first4=Szilárd |date=2006 |title=Voice and aspiration: Evidence from Russian, Hungarian, German, Swedish, and Turkish |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a27/5c57dd25134aa7628c46a64ca470cc3a71db.pdf |journal=The Linguistic Review |language=en |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–35 |doi=10.1515/tlr.2006.001 |issn=0167-6318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phoneme that is usually referred to as ''yumuşak g'' ("soft g"), written {{angle bracket|ğ}} in Turkish [[orthography]], represents a vowel sequence or a rather weak bilabial approximant between rounded vowels, a weak palatal approximant between unrounded front vowels, and a vowel sequence elsewhere. It never occurs at the beginning of a word or a syllable, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.&lt;ref name="IPA 19993"&gt;''Handbook of the IPA'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In native Turkic words, the sounds {{IPA|[c]}}, {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, and {{IPA|[l]}} are in [[complementary distribution]] with {{IPA|[k]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, and {{IPA|[ɫ]}}; the former set occurs adjacent to front vowels and the latter adjacent to back vowels. The distribution of these [[phoneme]]s is often unpredictable, however, in foreign borrowings and proper nouns. In such words, {{IPA|[c]}}, {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, and {{IPA|[l]}} often occur with back vowels:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=93–4,6}}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[Turkish language#Writing system|examples]] are given below.

==== Consonant devoicing ====
{{Main article|Final-obstruent devoicing}}

Turkish orthography reflects [[final-obstruent devoicing]], a form of [[consonant mutation]] whereby a voiced obstruent, such as {{IPA|/b d dʒ ɡ/}}, is devoiced to {{IPA|[p t tʃ k]}} at the end of a word or before a consonant, but retains its voicing before a vowel. In loan words, the voiced equivalent of ''/k/'' is ''/g/''; in native words, it is ''/ğ/''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imla.dilimiz.com/TDK/unsuzlerinnitelikleri.HTM|title=Sesler ve ses uyumları "Sounds and Vovel karmony" |accessdate=2013-01-13|publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]]|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Consonant Mutation|url=http://turkishbasics.com/grammar/consonant-mutation.php|website=turkishbasics.com|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is analogous to languages such as [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], but in the case of Turkish, the spelling is usually made to match the sound.  However, in a few cases, such as ''ad'' {{IPA|/at/}} 'name' (dative ''ada''), the underlying form is retained in the spelling (cf. ''at'' {{IPA|/at/}} 'horse', dative ''ata''). Other exceptions are ''od'' 'fire' vs. ''ot'' 'herb', ''sac'' 'sheet metal', ''saç'' 'hair'.  Most loanwords, such as ''kitap'' above, are spelled as pronounced, but a few such as ''hac'' 'hajj', ''şad'' 'happy', and ''yad'' 'strange(r)' also show their underlying forms.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Native nouns of two or more syllables that end in ''/k/'' in dictionary form are nearly all ''//ğ//'' in underlying form.  However, most verbs and monosyllabic nouns are underlyingly ''//k//''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
[[File:Turkish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Vowels of Turkish. From {{Harvcoltxt|Zimmer|Orgun|1999|p=155}}]]
The vowels of the Turkish language are, in their alphabetical order, {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|e}}, {{angle bracket|[[Dotted and dotless I|ı]]}}, {{angle bracket|i}}, {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|ö}}, {{angle bracket|u}}, {{angle bracket|ü}}.&lt;ref&gt;The vowel represented by {{angle bracket|ı}} is also commonly transcribed as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɨ}}}} in linguistic literature.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by how and where they are articulated focusing on three key features: [[Vowel#Backness|front and back]], [[Roundedness|rounded and unrounded]] and [[Vowel#Height|vowel height]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar|last=Goksel|first=Asli|last2=Kerslake|first2=Celia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-11494-2|location=|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vowels are classified [±back], [±round] and [±high].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalilzadeh|first=Amir|date=Winter 2010|title=Vowel Harmony in Turkish|url=|journal=Karadeniz Araştırmaları: Balkan, Kafkas, Doğu Avrupa ve Anadolu İncelemeleri Dergisi|volume=6(24)|pages=141–150|via=Central and Eastern European Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish is an [[agglutinative language]] where a series of suffixes are added to the stem word; vowel harmony is a phonological process which ensures a smooth flow, requiring the least amount of oral movement as possible. Vowel harmony can be viewed as a process of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], whereby following vowels take on the characteristics of the preceding vowel.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish Grammar|last=Underhill|first=Robert|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1976|isbn=0-262-21006-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be useful to think of Turkish vowels as two symmetrical sets: the a-undotted (a, ı, o, u) which are all back vowels, articulated at the back of the mouth; and the e-dotted (e, i, ö, ü) vowels which are articulated at the front of the mouth. The place and manner of articulation of the vowels will determine which pattern of vowel harmony a word will adopt. The pattern of vowels is shown in the table above.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this table is essentially the same as the IPA vowel chart shown above: both table and chart indicate the physical location and quality of each vowel. However, the second table includes additional information on how Turkish harmonies vowels sounds across syllables based on the physical location and quality of the initial syllable.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatical [[affix]]es have "a chameleon-like quality",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1953|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:
* '''twofold (''-e/-a'')''':&lt;ref&gt;For the terms ''twofold'' and ''fourfold'', as well as the superscript notation, see Lewis (1953):21–22. In his more recent works Lewis prefers to omit the superscripts, on the grounds that "there is no need for this once the principle has been grasped" (Lewis [2001]:18).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[locative case]] suffix, for example, is ''-de'' after front vowels and ''-da'' after back vowels. The notation ''-de''² is a convenient shorthand for this pattern.
* '''fourfold (''-i/-ı/-ü/-u'')''': the [[genitive case]] suffix, for example, is ''-in'' or ''-ın'' after unrounded vowels (front or back respectively); and ''-ün'' or ''-un'' after the corresponding rounded vowels. In this case, the shorthand notation ''-in''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is used.

Practically, the twofold pattern (also referred to as the e-type vowel harmony) means that in the environment where the vowel in the word stem is formed in the front of the mouth, the suffix will take the e-form, while if it is formed in the back it will take the a-form. The fourfold pattern (also called the i-type) accounts for rounding as well as for front/back.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The following examples, based on the [[Turkish copula|copula]] ''-dir''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ("[it] is"), illustrate the principles of i-type vowel harmony in practice: ''Türkiye'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''dir''''' ("it is Turkey"),&lt;ref&gt;In modern Turkish orthography, an apostrophe is used to separate proper names from any suffixes.&lt;/ref&gt; ''kapı'''dır''''' ("it is the door"), but ''gün'''dür''''' ("it is the day"), ''palto'''dur''''' ("it is the coat").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Husby|first=Olaf|date=|title=Diagnostic use of nonword repetition for detection of language impairment among Turkish speaking minority children in Norway|url=https://www.academia.edu/3029750/Annotating_and_sharing_language_paradigms_online|journal=Working Papers Department of Language and Communication Studies NTNV|language=en|volume=3/2006|pages=139–149|via=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several exceptions to the vowel harmony rules, which can be categorised as follows:
# A few native root words such as anne (mother), elma (apple) and kardeş (brother). In these cases the suffixes harmonise with the final vowel.
# [[Compound word|Compounds]] such as the bu-gün (today) and baş-kent (capital). In these cases vowels are not required to harmonise between the constituent words.
# [[Loanword]]s often don't harmonise, however, in some cases the suffixes will harmonise with the front vowel even in words that may not have a front vowel in the final syllable. Usually this occurs when the words end in a palatal [l],  for example ''halsiz'' &lt; ''hal'' + ''-siz'' "listless", ''meçhuldür'' &lt; ''meçhul'' + ''-dir'' "it is unknown". However, affixes borrowed from foreign languages do not harmonise, such as -izm (ateizm "atheism"), -en (derived from French -ment as in taxmen "completely), anti- (antidemokratik "antidemocratic").
# A few native suffixes are also invariable (or at least partially so) such as the second vowel in the bound auxiliary -abil, or in the marker -ken as well as in the imperfect suffix -yor. There are also a few derivational suffixes that do not harmonise such as -gen in uçgen (triangle) or altigen (hexagon).&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
Some rural dialects lack some or all of these exceptions mentioned above.

The [[Turkish language#Phonology|road sign in the photograph]] above illustrates several of these features:
* a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: ''Orta+köy'' ("middle village"—a place name)
* a loanword also violating vowel harmony: ''viyadük'' (&lt; French ''viaduc'' "viaduct")
* the possessive suffix'' -i''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; harmonizing with the final vowel (and softening the ''k'' by consonant [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]): ''viyadüğü''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The rules of vowel harmony may vary by regional dialect. The dialect of Turkish spoken in the [[Trabzon]] region of northeastern Turkey follows the reduced vowel harmony of [[Old Anatolian Turkish]], with the additional complication of two missing vowels (ü and ı), thus there is no [[palatal harmony]]. It's likely that ''elün'' meant "your hand" in Old Anatolian. While the 2nd person singular possessive would vary between back and front vowel, -ün or -un, as in  ''elün'' for "your hand" and ''kitabun'' for "your book", the lack of ü vowel in the Trabzon dialect means -un would be used in both of these cases — ''elun'' and ''kitabun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn = 978-3-447-05212-2| last1 = Boeschoten| first1 = Hendrik| last2 = Johanson| first2 = Lars| last3 = Milani| first3 = Vildan| title = Turkic Languages in Contact| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Word-accent ==
{{Details|Turkish phonology#Word-accent}}
Word-accent is usually on the last syllable in most words.&lt;ref name="IPA 19993"/&gt; There are however, several exceptions. Exceptions include certain [[loanword]]s, particularly from Italian and Greek, as well as interjections, certain question words, adverbs (although not adjectives functioning as adverbs), and many proper names. Loanwords are usually accented on the penultimate syllable ({{IPA|[ɫoˈkanta]}} ''lokanta'' "restaurant" or {{IPA|[isˈcele]}} ''iskele'' "quay"). Proper names are usually accented on the penultimate syllable as in {{IPA|[isˈtanbuɫ]}} ''İstanbul'', but sometimes on the antepenultimate, if the word ends in a cretic rhythm (– u x), as in {{IPA|[ˈaŋkaɾa]}} ''Ankara''. (See [[Turkish phonology#Place names]].)

In addition, there are certain suffixes such as ''-le'' "with" and the verbal negative particle ''-me-/-ma-'', which place an accent on the syllable which precedes them, e.g. ''kitáp-la'' "with the book", ''dé-me-mek'' "not to say".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Levi |first=Susannah V. |date=2005 |title=Acoustic correlates of lexical accent in Turkish |journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association |language=en |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=76 |doi=10.1017/S0025100305001921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances (for example, in the second half of compound words or when verbs are preceded by an indefinite object) the accent on a word is suppressed and cannot be heard.

== Syntax ==

=== Sentence groups ===
Turkish has two groups of sentences: verbal and nominal sentences. In the case of a verbal sentence, the predicate is a finite verb, while the predicate in nominal sentence will have either no overt verb or a verb in the form of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''ol'' or ''y'' (variants of "be"). Examples of both are given below:&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar|last=Goksel|first=Asli|last2=Kerslake|first2=Celia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-11494-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|

|Necla
|oğretmen
|Necla is a teacher
|-
|(copula)
|Necla
|ev-de-'''y'''-miş (hyphens delineate suffixes)
|Apparently Necla is at home
|}

==== Negation ====
The two groups of sentences have different ways of forming negation. A nominal sentence can be negated with the addition of the word ''değil,'' for example the sentence above would become ''Necla oğretmen değil'' (Necla is not a teacher). However, the verbal sentence requires the addition of a negative suffix -me to the verb (the suffix comes after the stem but before the tense): ''Necla okula gitmedi'' (Necla did not go to school).&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish Grammar|last=Underhill|first=Robert|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1976|isbn=0-262-21006-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Yes/no questions ====
In the case of a verbal sentence, an interrogative morpheme -mi is added to the end of the sentence and stands alone, for example ''Necla okula gitti mi?'' (Did Necla go to school?). In the case of a nominal sentence, then the -mi comes after the predicate but before the personal ending, so for example ''Necla, siz oğretmen misiniz''? (Necla, are you a teacher? using the formal 2nd person plural).&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

===Word order===
Word order in simple Turkish sentences is generally [[subject–object–verb]], as in Korean and [[Latin]], but unlike English, for verbal sentences and subject-predicate for nominal sentences. However, as Turkish possesses a case-marking system, and most grammatical relations are shown using morphological markers, often the SOV structure has diminished relevance, in fact it may be considered a "pragmatic word order" of language, one that does not rely on word order for grammatical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Sandra|date=April 1978|title=Modern English from a Typological Point of View: Some Implications of the Function of Word Order|url=|journal=Linguistische Berlichte|volume=1978(54)|pages=19–35|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the basic word order in Turkish is firmly SOV, the word order may vary in particular conditions.

==== Immediately preverbal ====

Consider the following simple sentence which demonstrates that the focus in Turkish is on the element that immediately precedes the verb:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Function of Word Order in Turkish Grammar|last=Erguvanlı|first=Eser Emine|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=0-520-09955-9|series=Linguistics Vol. 106|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==== Postpredicate ====

The postpredicate position signifies what is referred to as background information in Turkish- information that is assumed to be known to both the speaker and the listener, or information that is included in the context. Consider the following examples:&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

|-
|
|
|Bana da getir bir kahve (get me one too, a coffee)
|it is understood that it is a coffee that the speaker wants
|}

==== Topic ====

There has been some debate among linguists whether Turkish is a subject-prominent (like English) or [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]] (like Japanese and Korean) language, with recent scholarship implying that it is indeed both subject and topic-prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.turkofoni.org/files/a_typological_approach_to_sentence_structure_in_turkish-yilmaz_kili_arslan_trakya_uni.pdf|title=A Typological Approach to Sentence Structure in Turkish|last=Kiliçasaslan|first=Yılmaz|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has direct implications for word order as it is possible for the subject to be included in the [[Verb phrase|verb-phrase]] in Turkish. There can be S/O inversion in sentences where the topic is of greater importance than the subject.

== Grammar ==
{{main article|Turkish grammar}}

Turkish is an [[agglutinative language]] and frequently uses [[affix]]es, and specifically suffixes, or endings.&lt;ref&gt;This section draws heavily on Lewis (2001) and, to a lesser extent, Lewis (1953). Only the most important references are specifically flagged with footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt; One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on [[#Word formation|Word formation]]). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.&lt;ref&gt;see Lewis (2001) Ch XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;
The only native prefixes are [[alliteration|alliterative]] intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example '''''sım'''sıcak'' ("boiling hot" &lt; ''sıcak'') and '''''mas'''mavi'' ("bright blue" &lt; ''mavi'').&lt;ref&gt;"The prefix, which is accented, is modelled on the first syllable of the simple adjective or adverb but with the substitution of '''m, p, r''', or '''s''' for the last consonant of that syllable." Lewis (2001):55.  The prefix retains the first vowel of the base form and thus exhibits a form of reverse vowel harmony.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words, e.g. ''Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına'', meaning "In the manner of you being one of those that we apparently couldn't manage to convert to Czechoslovakian". While this case is contrived, long words frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: ''Bayramlaşamadıklarımız'' (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; "Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings").&lt;ref&gt;This "splendid word" appeared at the time of ''Bayram'', the festival marking the end of the [[Ramadan|month of fasting]]. Lewis (2001):287.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (''İmlâ Kılavuzu''): ''Dilde birlik, ulusal birliğin vazgeçilemezlerindendir'' ("Unity in language is among the indispensables [dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula] of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of national unity").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilimiz.com/dil/imlakilavuzu/TDK/imlaanasayfa.htm |title=İmlâ Kilavuzu |publisher=Dilimiz.com |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nouns ===
There is no [[definite article]] in Turkish, but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used (see below). Turkish nouns decline by taking case endings. There are six [[Declension|noun cases]] in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand [[#Vowel harmony|superscript notation]]. The [[plural]] marker ''-ler'' ² immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (e.g. ''köylerin'' "of the villages").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

|from the village/tree
|-
|[[Locative case|Locative]]
|''-de'' ²
|''köyde''
|''ağaç'''t'''a''
|in the village/on the tree
|}

The accusative case marker is used only for definite objects; compare ''(bir) ağaç gördük'' "we saw '''a''' tree" with ''ağacı gördük'' "we saw '''the''' tree".&lt;ref&gt;Because it is also used for the indefinite accusative, Lewis uses the term "absolute case" in preference to "nominative". Lewis (2001):28.&lt;/ref&gt; The plural marker ''-ler'' ² is generally not used when a class or category is meant: ''ağaç gördük'' can equally well mean "we saw trees [as we walked through the forest]"—as opposed to ''ağaçları gördük'' "we saw the trees [in question]".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The declension of ''ağaç'' illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] in [[suffix]]es (''ağaç'''t'''an, ağaç'''t'''a'') and [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of final consonants before vowels (''ağa'''c'''ın, ağa'''c'''a, ağa'''c'''ı'').{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Additionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign [[grammatical person|person]]: for example ''-imiz'' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, "our". With the addition of the [[Turkish copula|copula]] (for example ''-im'' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, "I am") complete sentences can be formed. The [[interrogative word|interrogative]] particle ''mi'' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; immediately follows the word being questioned: ''köye mi?'' "[going] to the village?", ''ağaç mı?'' "[is it a] tree?".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

|}

=== Personal pronouns ===

The Turkish [[personal pronoun]]s in the nominative case are ''ben'' (1s), ''sen'' (2s), ''o'' (3s), ''biz'' (1pl), ''siz'' (2pl, or 2h), and ''onlar'' (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: ''benim'' (1s gen.); ''bizim'' (1pl gen.); ''bana'' (1s dat.); ''sana'' (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of ''o'' use the root ''on''. All other pronouns (reflexive ''kendi'' and so on) are declined regularly.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==== Noun phrases (''tamlama'') ====

Two nouns, or groups of nouns, may be joined in either of two ways:

* definite (possessive) compound (''belirtili tamlama''). E.g. ''Türkiye'nin sesi'' "the voice of Turkey (radio station)": the voice belonging to Turkey. Here the relationship is shown by the genitive ending ''-in''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; added to the first noun; the second noun has the third-person suffix of possession ''-(s)i''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.
* indefinite (qualifying) compound (''belirtisiz tamlama''). E.g. ''Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'' "Turkey-Republic&lt;ref&gt;Lewis points out that "an indefinite izafet group can be turned into intelligible (though not necessarily normal) English by the use of a hyphen". Lewis (2001): 42.&lt;/ref&gt; = the Republic of Turkey": not the republic belonging to Turkey, but the Republic that is Turkey. Here the first noun has no ending; but the second noun has the ending ''-(s)i''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;—the same as in definite compounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The following table illustrates these principles.&lt;ref&gt;The examples are taken from Lewis (2001): 41–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds; for clarity these subsidiary compounds are marked with [square brackets]. The suffixes involved in the linking are underlined. Note that if the second noun group already had a possessive suffix (because it is a compound by itself), no further suffix is added.

|}

As the last example shows, the qualifying expression may be a substantival sentence rather than a noun or noun group.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''substantival sentence'' is Lewis's. Lewis(2001:257).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a third way of linking the nouns where both nouns take no suffixes (''takısız tamlama''). However, in this case the first noun acts as an adjective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/YENI%20TURK%20DILI/celal_demir_gramer_isim_tamlamasi_sorunu.pdf |title=Journal of Turkish World Studies (be celal Demir) |format=PDF |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''Demir kapı'' (iron gate), ''elma yanak'' ("apple cheek", i.e. red cheek), ''kömür göz'' ("coal eye", i.e. black eye) :

=== Adjectives ===
Turkish adjectives are not [[declension|declined]]. However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. ''güzel'' ("beautiful") → ''güzeller'' ("(the) beautiful ones / people"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives ''var'' ("existent") and ''yok'' ("[[non-existent]]") are used in many cases where English would use "there is" or "have", ''e.g.'' ''süt yok'' ("there is no milk", ''lit.'' "(the) milk (is) non-existent"); the construction "''noun 1''-GEN ''noun 2''-POSS var/yok" can be translated "''noun 1'' has/doesn't have ''noun 2''"; ''imparatorun elbisesi yok'' "the emperor has no clothes" ("(the) emperor-''of'' clothes-''his'' non-existent"); ''kedimin ayakkabıları yoktu'' ("my cat had no shoes", ''lit.'' "cat-''my''-''of'' shoe-''plur.''-''its'' non-existent-''past tense''").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Verbs ===
{{see also|Turkish copula}}
Turkish verbs indicate [[Grammatical person|person]]. They can be made negative, potential ("can"), or impotential ("cannot"). Furthermore, Turkish verbs show [[Grammatical tense|tense]] ([[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[Future tense|future]], and [[aorist]]), [[Grammatical mood|mood]] ([[Conditional mood|conditional]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Inferential mood|inferential]], [[Necessitative mood|necessitative]], and [[Optative mood|optative]]), and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. Negation is expressed by the [[infix]] ''-me²-'' immediately following the stem.

Almost all Turkish verbs are conjugated in the same way, most notable exception being the [[irregular verbs|irregular]] and [[defective verb]] ''i-'', the [[Turkish copula]] (corresponding to English ''to be''), which can be used in compound forms (the shortened form is called an [[enclitic]]): ''Gelememişti'' = ''Gelememiş idi'' = ''Gelememiş + i- + -di''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Verb tenses ===
(''Note''. For the sake of simplicity the term "tense" is used here throughout, although for some forms "aspect" or "mood" might be more appropriate.) There are 9 simple and 20 compound tenses in Turkish. 9 simple tenses are simple  past (''di'li geçmiş''), inferential past (''miş'li geçmiş''), present continuous, simple present ([[Aorist#Turkish|aorist]]), future, optative, subjunctive, necessitative ("must") and imperative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tr.scribd.com/doc/115291192/TURKISH-GRAMMAR-UPDATED-ACADEMIC-EDITION-YUKSEL-GOKNEL-OCTOBER-2012-signed-pdf Yüksel Göknel:Turkish Grammar]{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three groups of compound forms. Story (''hikaye'') is the witnessed past of the above forms (except command), rumor (''rivayet'') is the unwitnessed past of the above forms (except simple past and command), conditional (''koşul'')  is the conditional form of the first five basic tenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishstudies.net/Makaleler/1934555583_85Kad%c4%b1u%20Spartak_S-1593-1603.pdf |title=Turkish Studies Vol 7/3 |language=Turkish|format=PDF |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example below the  second person singular of the verb ''gitmek'' ("go"), stem ''gid-/git-'', is shown.

|-
|you must go || ''gitmelisin'' || ''gitmeliydin'' || ''gitmeliymişin'' || –
|-
|go! (imperative) || ''git'' || – || – || –
|}

There are also so-called combined verbs, which are created by suffixing certain verb stems (like ''bil'' or ''ver'') to the original stem of a verb. ''Bil'' is the suffix for the sufficiency mood. It is the equivalent of the English auxiliary verbs "able to", "can" or "may". ''Ver'' is the suffix for the swiftness mood, ''kal'' for the perpetuity mood and ''yaz'' for the approach ("almost") mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dersimizedebiyat.com/icerik_detay.asp?icr=63&amp;bs=S%F6zc%FCk%20(%20Kelime%20)%20T%FCrleri%20-%20Fiiller%20(%20Eylemler%20) |title=Dersimiz Edebiyat Online course|language=Turkish |publisher=Dersimizedebiyat.com |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while ''gittin'' means "you went", ''gidebildin'' means "you could go" and ''gidiverdin'' means "you went swiftly". The tenses of the combined verbs are formed the same way as for simple verbs.

==== Attributive verbs (participles) ====

Turkish verbs have [[Attributive verb|attributive forms]], including present,&lt;ref&gt;The conventional translation of the film title ''[[Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam]]'', ''The Man Who Saved the World'', uses the past tense. Semantically, his saving the world takes place though in the (narrative) present.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the English [[present participle]] (with the ending {{italics correction|''-en''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); future ({{italics correction|''-ecek''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); indirect/inferential past ({{italics correction|''-miş''}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;); and [[Aorist#Turkish|aorist]] ({{italics correction|''-er''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or {{italics correction|''-ir''}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). These forms can function as either adjectives or nouns: ''oynamayan çocuklar'' "children who do not play", ''oynamayanlar'' "those who do not play"; ''okur yazar'' "reader-writer = literate", ''okur yazarlar'' "literates".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The most important function of some of these attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the [[relative clause]]s found in most European languages. The subject of the verb in an {{italics correction|''-en''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; form is (possibly implicitly) in the third person (he/she/it/they); this form, when used in a modifying phrase, does not change according to number. The other attributive forms used in these constructions are the future ({{italics correction|''-ecek''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and an older form ({{italics correction|''-dik''}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), which covers both present and past meanings.&lt;ref&gt;See Lewis (2001):163–165, 260–262 for an exhaustive treatment.&lt;/ref&gt; These two forms take "personal endings", which have the same form as the [[Possessive affix#Turkish|possessive suffix]]es but indicate the person and possibly number of the subject of the attributive verb; for example, ''yediğ'''im''''' means "what '''I''' eat", ''yediğ'''in''''' means "what '''you''' eat", and so on. The use of these "personal or relative participles" is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.&lt;ref&gt;For the terms ''personal'' and ''relative'' participle see Lewis (1958):98 and Lewis (2001):163 respectively. Most of the examples are taken from Lewis (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maureen Freely]]'s more succinct and idiomatic translation is ''the days in prison he knew lay ahead''. Note that Pamuk uses the spelling ''hapisane''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From the perspective of Turkish grammar ''yaklaştığını anladığı'' is exactly parallel to ''babasını gördüğüm'' ("whose father I saw"), and could therefore be paraphrased as "whose approaching he understood".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word formation ===
Turkish extensively uses [[agglutination]] to [[Word formation|form new words]] from nouns and verbal stems. The majority of Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar|last=Goksel|first=Asli|last2=Kerslake|first2=Celia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-11494-2|location=|pages=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish obeys certain principles when it comes to suffixation. Most suffixes in Turkish will have more than one form, depending on the vowels and consonants in the root- vowel harmony rules will apply; consonant-initial suffixes will follow the voiced/ voiceless character of the consonant in the final unit of the root; and in the case of vowel-initial suffixes an additional consonant may be inserted if the root ends in a vowel, or the suffix may lose its initial vowel.  There is also a prescribed order of affixation of suffixes- as a rule of thumb, derivative suffixes precede inflectional suffixes which are followed by [[clitic]]s, as can be seen in the example set of words derived from a substantive root below:

New words are also frequently formed by [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]] two existing words into a new one, as in German. Compounds can be of two types- bare and (s)I. The bare compounds, both nouns and adjectives are effectively two words juxtaposed without the addition of suffixes for example the word for girlfriend ''kizarkadaş'' (''kiz+arkadaş'') or black pepper ''karabiber'' (''kara+biber''). A few examples of compound words are given below:

{| class="wikitable"

|primary finger
|-
|''önyargı''
|prejudice
|''ön'' ("before") and ''yargı'' ("splitting; judgement")
|fore-judging
|}
However, the majority of compound words in Turkish are (s)I compounds, which means that the second word will be marked by the 3rd person possessive suffix. A few such examples are given in the table below (note [[vowel harmony]]):

== Writing system ==
{{main article|Turkish alphabet|Turkish Braille}}
[[File:Ataturk-September 20, 1928.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] introducing the new Turkish alphabet to the people of [[Kayseri]]. September 20, 1928. (Cover of the French ''L'Illustration'' magazine)]]

Turkish is written using a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] introduced in 1928 by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] to replace the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]], a version of [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic]] alphabet. The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels—long ''ā, ū'' and ''ī''—and included several redundant consonants, such as variants of ''z'' (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish). The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script was claimed to make it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has [[#Vowel harmony|eight vowels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zimmer|Orgun|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform of the script was an important step in the [[Atatürk's Reforms|cultural reforms]] of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a [[Turkish alphabet#Modern Turkish alphabet|Language Commission]] composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers. The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atatürk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public.&lt;ref name="Dilacar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dilaçar|first=Agop|authorlink=Agop Dilaçar|title=Atatürk ve Yazım|journal=Türk Dili|issn= 1301-465X|volume=35|issue=307|url= http://www.dildernegi.org.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFC3C6D81741DBEB05|accessdate=2007-03-19|year=1977|ref=harv|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coulmas|1989|p=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin alphabet was applied to the Turkish language for educational purposes even before the 20th-century reform. Instances include a 1635 Latin-Albanian dictionary by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also incorporated several sayings in the Turkish language, as an appendix to his work (e.g. ''alma agatsdan irak duschamas''&lt;ref&gt;In modern Turkish spelling: {{lang|tr|elma ağaçtan ırak düşmez}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—"An apple does not fall far from its tree").

Turkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language: the spelling is largely [[Phonemic spelling|phonemic]], with one letter corresponding to each [[phoneme]].&lt;ref name="KerslakeGoksel2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Celia Kerslake|author2=Asli Goksel|title=Turkish: An Essential Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DbJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=11 June 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-04218-0|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the letters are used approximately as in English, the main exceptions being {{angle bracket|c}}, which denotes {{IPA|[dʒ]}} ({{angle bracket|j}} being used for the {{IPA|[ʒ]}} found in Persian and European loans); and the undotted {{angle bracket|ı}}, representing {{IPA|[ɯ]}}. As in German, {{angle bracket|ö}} and {{angle bracket|ü}} represent {{IPA|[ø]}} and {{IPA|[y]}}. The letter {{angle bracket|ğ}}, in principle, denotes {{IPA|[ɣ]}} but has the property of lengthening the preceding vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel. The letters {{angle bracket|ş}} and {{angle bracket|ç}} represent {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, respectively. A [[circumflex]] is written over [[back vowel]]s following {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|g}}, or {{angle bracket|l}} when these consonants represent {{IPA|[c]}}, {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, and {{IPA|[l]}}—almost exclusively in Arabic and Persian [[loanword|loans]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2001):3–7. Note that in these cases the circumflex conveys information about the preceding consonant rather than the vowel over which it is written.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[apostrophe]] is used to separate [[proper nouns]] from inflectional suffixes: e.g. {{lang|tr|İstanbul'da}} "in Istanbul"' (but not from derivational suffixes since 2009 spelling revision by [[Turkish Language Association|TDK]], e.g. {{lang|tr|İstanbullu}} "from/of Istanbul").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters (q, x, w omitted and ç, ş,  ğ, ı, ö, ü added); the complete list is:
:''a, b, c, ç, d, e, f, g, ğ, h, ı, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, ö, p, r, s, ş, t, u, ü, v, y'', and ''z'' (Note that capital of ''i'' is ''İ'' and lowercase ''I'' is ''ı''.)

==  Turkish Whistling Language ==
{{Details|topic=whistling as a language|Whistled language||}}In the Turkish province of [[Giresun Province|Giresun]], the locals in the village of [[Kuşköy]] have communicated using a whistled version of Turkish for over 400 years. The region consists of a series of deep valleys and the unusual mode of communication allows for conversation over distances of up to 5 kilometres. Turkish authorities estimate that there are still around 10,000 people using the whistled language. However, in 2011 [[UNESCO]] found whistling Turkish to be a dying language and included it in its [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage list]]. Since then the local education directorate has introduced it as a course in schools in the region, hoping to revive its use.

A study was conducted by a German scientist of Turkish origin [[Onur Güntürkün]] at Ruhr University, observing 31 "speakers" of ''{{Lang|tr|kuş dili}}'' ("bird's tongue") from Kuşköy, and he found that the whistled language mirrored the lexical and syntactical structure of Turkish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/life/2016/02/17/northern-village-of-kuskoy-still-communicates-with-amazing-turkish-whistling-language|title=Northern village of Kuşköy still communicates with amazing Turkish whistling language|last=|first=|date=February 16, 2016|work=The Daily Sabah|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voice writing''' is a method used for [[court reporting]], [[medical transcription]], and [[closed captioning]].  Using the voice writing method, a court reporter speaks directly into a [[stenomask]] or speech silencer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://talktech.com/stenomask-sylencer/|title=STENOMASK / SYLENCER® – Talk Technologies Inc.|website=talktech.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and voice-dampening materials. As the reporter repeats the testimony into the recorder, the mask prevents the reporter from being heard during testimony. Voice writers record everything that is said by judges, witnesses, attorneys, and other parties to a proceeding, including gestures and emotional reactions, and either provide real-time feed or prepare transcripts afterwards.

In medical transcription, some transcriptionists use voice writing, versus typing, when working out of their own home.  They receive audio files and use a voice recognition program to translate voice to text. No mask is needed, but a good headset with appropriate microphone is necessary.  Sometimes an updated sound card needs to be added in order to have excellent clarity for the voice recognition software.  This can be done easily with a small sound card which is attached to the microphone cord and then inserts into a USB port.  A foot pedal is also used.

A voice writing system consists of a stenomask, an external sound digitizer, a laptop, [[speech recognition]] software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.

A real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.

Voice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology.  The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and "inner" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from "inner voice" to the physiological "spoken voice." Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.

Voice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with
computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nvra.org/historical|title=Importance of NVRA voice writing and its origin.|website=nvra.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice writing method==
The method of court reporting known as voice writing, formerly called "stenomask," was developed by Horace Webb in the World War II era. Prior to inventing voice writing, Webb was a [[Gregg shorthand]] writer. Gregg shorthand is a multi-level process in which the reporter records the proceedings using shorthand, then dictates from his notes into a tape recorder. The dictation process alone requires two hours for every one hour of testimony. After the testimony is transferred to audio tape, a transcriptionist types out an official documentation of the proceedings. Mr. Webb wanted to create a reporting method that allowed court reporters to dictate directly during proceedings, eliminating the shorthand process altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nvra.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=9 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130858/http://www.nvra.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=9 |archive-date=2007-07-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace Webb and two colleagues spent several years designing the stenomask and perfecting the voicewriting method. The court reporter speaks directly into the stenomask – a handheld mask with a voice silencer. The silencer prevents the court reporter from disturbing proceedings while repeating everything that occurs during testimony -– even unspoken answers, gestures and reactions. Unfortunately, the voicewriting method did not catch on until the method was tested by the U.S. Navy and adopted by the military justice school in Newport, Rhode Island. From then on, the stenomask method of court reporting gained widespread acceptance.

Voice writers have long been available to make the record through the use of a stenomask with a voice silencer and analog tapes. Voice writers not only repeat every word stated by the attorneys, witnesses, judges and other parties to a proceeding but also verbally identify the speaker. They even punctuate the text, describe activities as they take place, and, in some cases, mark exhibits.

Now, however, new technologies are available to them. Digital recording offers a clearer, better-defined soundtrack, making transcription easier and even more accurate.

New technology, in the form of speech recognition CAT systems, affords the voice writer the opportunity to have the spoken words instantly turned into text on a laptop computer or computer workstation. As a result, the voice writer is now able to produce real-time text feeds within the courtroom and download them in ASCII format for distribution immediately following a proceeding. The equipment used by real-time voice writers can also interface with all litigation-support software.

==Training==
All court reporters require the same basic academic background, regardless of method. This includes legal and medical language, business law, and English. The skills track is where the methods diverge. A voice writing student can become real-time certifiable well within the 24-month associate degree window. Paralegals and legal secretaries, because they’ve already taken nearly the same set of core academics required by court reporting, can become proficient in three to six months. In under 12 months, a paralegal or legal secretary can become real-time certified.

'''Yaroslav Olexandrovych Halan''' (in Ukrainian: ''Ярослав Олександрович Галан'', party nickname ''Comrade Yaga''; July 27, 1902, [[Dynów]] – October 24, 1949, [[Lviv]]) was a [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian Soviet]] anti-fascist writer, playwright, publicist, member of the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]] since 1924, killed by [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|nationalist insurgents]] in 1949.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Yaroslav Halan was born on July 27, 1902, in [[Dynów]] (now [[Poland]]) in the family of Olexandr Halan, a small post-office official. As a child he lived and studied in [[Przemyśl|Peremyshl]] . He enjoyed a large collection of books collected by his father. Halan was greatly influenced by the creativity of the Ukrainian socialist writer [[Ivan Franko]]. In the school by the critical thoughts Yaroslav had conflicts with the priests who taught [[theology]].

After the beginning of the [[World War I]] his father along with other "unreliable" elements who could sympathize the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] was interned in the [[Thalerhof internment camp|Thalerhof camp]] by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] authorities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://day.kyiv.ua/en/article/culture/yaroslav-halans-symbol-faith|title=Yaroslav Halan's symbol of faith|last=Siundiukov|first=Ihor|date=November 6, 2001|work=Day|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014155554/https://day.kyiv.ua/en/article/culture/yaroslav-halans-symbol-faith|archive-date=October 14, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galitzia]] was [[Battle of Galicia|taken by the Russians]].

During the next [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive|Austrian offensive]] his mother evacuated her family in order to avoid repressions with the [[Great Retreat (Russian)|retreating Russian army]] to [[Rostov-on-Don]], where Yaroslav studied at the gymnasium and played in the local theatre. Living there Halan witnessed the [[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] events. He became familiar with [[Lenin]]’s agitation. Later these events formed the base of his story ''Unforgettable Days''.

While in Rostov-on-Don, he discovered the works of some Russian writers such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Vissarion Belinsky]], [[Anton Chekhov]]. Halan often went to the theatre. Thus his obsession with this art was born, which in the future determined his decision to become a playwright.

=== Student years ===
After the war he returned to Galitzia ([[Peace of Riga|annexed by Poland]]), where in 1922 he graduated from the [[Peremyshl Ukrainian Gymnasium]]. Then he studied in the [[Trieste|Triest]] Higher Trade School in Italy. In 1922 Halan enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1926 he transferred to the [[Jagiellonian University]] of [[Kraków|Krakow]], which he graduated from in 1928 (according to some sources he didn't pass the final exams&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://diasporiana.org.ua/ideologiya/1310-tereshhuk-p-istoriya-odnogo-zradnika-yaroslav-galan/|title=Story of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan)|last=Tereshchuk|first=Petro|publisher=Canadian League for Ukraine's Liberation|year=1962|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526130403/http://diasporiana.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/books/1310/file.pdf|archive-date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). After that Halan started to work as a teacher of the [[Polish language]] and [[Polish Literature|literature]] at a private gymnasium in [[Lutsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hroniky.com/news/view/5469-koleso-istorii-lutska-ukrainska-himnaziia-foto|title=Колесо історії: Луцька українська гімназія (фото)|last=|first=|date=September 17, 2016|work=Хроніки Любарта|access-date=March 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105528/http://www.hroniky.com/news/view/5469-koleso-istorii-lutska-ukrainska-himnaziia-foto|archive-date=March 20, 2018|dead-url=|language=uk-UA|trans-title=Wheel of History: Lutsk Ukrainian Gymnasium (photo)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ten months later he got banned from teaching due to political reasons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://coollib.com/b/151613/read|title=Жизнь замечательных людей.

In his students years he joined the left-wing movement. While being a student of the University of Vienna, Halan became a member of the workers' comunity ''Einheit'' (''Unity'') ruled by the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party of Austria]].  Since 1924 he proactively participated in the underground national liberation movement, which in the [[Western Ukraine|Ukrainian lands]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (except of Glitzia being under [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] influence) was headed by the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]] (CPWU).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/ceup/546|title=Heroes and Villains : Creating National History in Contemporary Ukraine|last=Marples|first=David R.|date=January 23, 2013|publisher=Central European University Press|year=|isbn=9786155211355|series=Hors collection|location=Budapest|pages=125–165|author-link=David R.

Later, while stuying in Krakow, he was elected a deputy chairman of the legal student organization ''Życie'' (''Life'') ruled by the [[Communist Party of Poland]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1960|title=Автобиография Ярослава Галана|trans-title=Yaroslav Halan's Autobiography|url=http://portalus.ru/modules/shkola/rus_readme.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1296132805&amp;archive=006&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=&amp;|journal=Radianske Literaturoznavstvo|language=ru|publisher=Taras Shevchenko Institute of Literature of the NAS of the Ukrainian SSR|volume=1|pages=|issn=2413-6352|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014180049/http://portalus.ru/modules/shkola/rus_readme.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1296132805&amp;archive=006&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=&amp;|archive-date=October 14, 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creativity and political struggle in Poland ===
[[File:Yaroslav Halan with Anna Henyk.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Yaroslav Halan with his first wife Anna Henyk and her relatives in the village Bereziv, 1929]]
In the 1920s, the writer's creative activity also began. In 1927 he finished working on his first significant play ''Don Quixote from Ettenheim''. For the first time he revealed the venality of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] and [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]] parties in his play ''99%'' (1930). The theme of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and condemning the segregation were actualized in the plays ''Cargo'' (1930) and ''Cell'' (1932), calling for united actions and class solidarity of Ukrainian, Jewish and Polish [[Proletariat|proletarians]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ghetto.in.ua/article.php?ID=12&amp;AID=81|title=Ярослав Галан: "Померлi борються..."|last=Manchuk|first=Andriy|date=|year=2002|website=GHETTO|language=Russian|trans-title=Yaroslav Halan: Dead are Figfhting...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319214520/http://ghetto.in.ua/article.php?ID=12&amp;AID=81|archive-date=March 19, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halan's play ''99%'' was staged by the semi-legal ''Lviv Workers’ Theatre''. On the eve of the premiere, Polish authorities launched a campaign of massive arrests against Western Ukrainian communists, sending them to the Lutsk prison. As the theatre's director and one of the key actors were arrested, the premiere was on the verge of failure. Despite risks of being arrested, the workers continued rehearsing, so the play was presented with a delay of only one day. About 600 workers attended the premiere, for them, it was a kind of protest mobilization against repressions and nationalism&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Yaroslav Halan was one of the founders of the Ukrainian proletarian writers’ group ''[[Horno (literary group)|Horno]]''. From 1927 to 1932 along with other communist writers and members of the CPWU he worked at the Lviv-based Ukrainian magazine ''Vikna,'' being a member of its editorial board, until it was closed by the censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CH%5CA%5CHalanYaroslav.htm|title=Halan, Yaroslav|last=|first=|date=|website=''encyclopediaofukraine.com''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142019/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CH%5CA%5CHalanYaroslav.htm|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in the [[Kresy|Polish-controlled]] city of Lviv, Halan frequently had to earn money from translating some novels from [[German language|German]] into Polish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1932 Halan moved to Nyzhniy Bereviz, the native village of his wife located in the [[Eastern Beskids and the Ukrainian Carpathians|Carpathian mountains]], close to [[Kolomyia]], and kept working on his own plays, stories and articles there. In the village he spread communist agitation among peasants, created a cell of the [[International Red Aid]] and the Committee for Famine Relief. Without opportunities to find any job, he lived in the countryside until June 1935, when he was summoned by the CPWU to return to Lviv.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Halan was denied a [[Soviet Union|Soviet citizenship]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.segodnya.ua/oldarchive/c2256713004f33f5c22569b500443db6.html|title=Ярославу Галану удалось выйти из польских застенков|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2000|work=СЕГОДНЯ|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142101/https://www.segodnya.ua/oldarchive/c2256713004f33f5c22569b500443db6.html|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=|issue=238 (739)|language=Russian|trans-title=Yaroslav Halan managed to get out of the Polish dungeons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Yaroslav Halan traveled a lot around [[Prykarpattia]], giving speeches to peasants. He became an experienced propagandist and agitator. Addressing the city workers, Halan explained to them the main points of the [[Marxism|Marxist theory]]. In particular, he had lectures on [[Friedrich Engels]]'s work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' and [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Wage Labour and Capital]]''. Together with the young communist writer [[Olexa Havryliuk]], Halan organized safe houses, wrote leaflets and proclamations, transferred illegal literature to Lviv.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout his political career the writer was repeatedly persecuted, twice imprisoned (for the first time in 1934). Yaroslav Halan was one of the organizers of the [[Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers]] in May 1936.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/967138.html|title=Ярослав Галан: трагедія "зачарованого на Схід"|last=Hrabovskyi|first=Serhiy|date=July 25, 2007|website=|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|language=uk|trans-title=Yaroslav Halan: The Tragedy of the "Enchanted to the East"|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143250/https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/967138.html|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides he took part in the biggest political manifestation on April 16, 1936, in Lviv, that was shot by the Polish police (in total, thirty workers were killed and two hundred injured).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,15892673,Masakra_we_Lwowie.html?disableRedirects=true|title=Masakra we Lwowie|last=Leszczyński|first=Adam|date=May 5, 2014|work=Gazeta Wyborcza|access-date=March 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142147/http://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,15892673,Masakra_we_Lwowie.html?disableRedirects=true|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halan devoted his story ''Golden Arch'' to the memory of fallen comrades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Participation in the Anti-Fascist Congress forced him to escape from Lviv to [[Warsaw]] where helived as an unemplyed until December. Eventually, he found a job at the left-wing newspaper ''Dziennik Popularny'' edited by [[Wanda Wasilewska]]. In 1937, the newspaper was closed by the authorities, and on April 8 Halan being accused of the illegal communist activism was sent to the prison in Warsaw, later transferred to Lviv. Released in December 1937, Halan lived in Lviv under a strict supervision by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Remained unemployed until 1939.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In 1937, his elder brother, a member of the CPWU, died in Lviv. After the [[Communist Party of Poland]] and the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]], as its autonomous organization, were dissolved by the [[Communist International|Comintern]] on trumped-up accusations of spying for Poland in 1938, Halan's first wife Anna Henyk (also a member of the CPWU) who was studying at the [[Kharkiv National Medical University|Kharkiv Medical Institute]], [[USSR]], was arrested by the [[NKVD]] and executed within the [[Great Purge]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lvivcenter.org/en/lia/researches/litlviv/database/anthropos/kondra-yaroslav/quotes-ref|title=Literary Lviv, 1939–1944: Memories|last=Tarnavskyi|first=Ostap|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=Lviv|pages=30–32|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162959/https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/projects/litlviv/database/anthropos/kondra-yaroslav/quotes-ref|archive-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Soviet Lviv ===
After the USSR [[Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, Volhynia and Northern Bukovina|annexed Western Ukraine and Western Belarus]], in September 1939, Yaroslav Halan worked in the newspaper ''Vilna Ukraina'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lvivcenter.org/en/lia/researches/litlviv/database/topos/vilna-ukrayina/1939|title=Vilna Ukrayina Newspaper|last=|first=|date=|website=''lvivcenter.org''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612163506/https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/projects/litlviv/database/topos/vilna-ukrayina/1939|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed the [[Maria Zankovetska Theatre]], wrote more than 100 pamphlets and articles on changes taking place in the reunified lands of Western Ukraine.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«A group of writers such as Yaroslav Halan, [[Petro Kozlaniuk]], [[Stepan Tudor]] and [[Oleksandr Havryliuk|Olexa Havryliuk]] [...] treated the liberation of Western Ukraine [by the Red Army] as a logical conclusion of the policy of the Communist Party, which fought for the reunification of the Ukrainian people. In this, they actively helped the party in word and deed. In return, they have already had experience with Polish prisons and oppression from their fellow countrymen. Now [after it happened] they could breathe a sigh of relief. That is why their smiles were so sincere and celebratory.»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Petro Panch]], ''Lviv, Kopernyka str., 42'', Vitchyzna, 1960, issue No 2, 172&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lvivcenter.org/en/lia/researches/litlviv/database/anthropos/panch-petro/quotes-own|title=Lviv, Kopernyka str., 42|last=Panch|first=Petro|publisher=Vitchyzna|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=|author-link=Petro Panch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162806/https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/projects/litlviv/database/anthropos/panch-petro/quotes-own|archive-date=2018-06-12|issue=2 (172)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1939 Halan went to Kharkiv trying to find his disappeared wife Anna Henyk. Together with the writer [[Yuri Smolych]] he came to the dormitory of the Medical Institute and asked the porter if there is any information about her destiny. The porter only gave him back a suitcase with Anna's belongings and said that she had been arrested by the NKVD, in response to that Halan burst into tears.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%8C_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%96.html?hl=ru&amp;id=ojkNMwEACAAJ|title=Розповідь про неспокій|last=Smolych|first=Yuri|publisher=Radianskyi Pysmennyk|year=1968|isbn=|location=Kyiv|pages=|language=uk|trans-title=Story About Inquietude|author-link=Yuri Smolych}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1941, being a journalist of the newspaper ''Vilna Ukraina,'' he got his first professional vacations in [[Crimea]]. But he didn't managed to rest, because on June 22 [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140955/http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2001/420112.shtml|title=Turning the pages back...

=== War period ===
When the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] began, Halan arrived in Kharkiv and went to the military commissariat having a big desire to become a volunteer of the [[Red Army]] and to go to the frontline but was denied.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

He was evacuated to [[Ufa]]. In September 1941, [[Alexander Fadeyev (writer)|Alexander Fadeyev]] summoned him to [[Moscow]] for working at the Polish-language magazine ''Nowe Horyzonty.'' In the days of the [[Battle of Moscow|Battle for Moscow]], on October 17, he was evacuated to [[Kazan]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

Later the writer arrived in [[Saratov]], where he served as a [[Radio personality|radio host]] at the ''Taras Shevchenko Radio Station''. Then he was a special front-line correspondent of the newspaper ''Sovietskaya Ukraina'', and then ''Radianska Ukraina''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«The majority of his radio-comments have been born spontaneously. He listens to the enemy's radio shows, thinks for a while, then goes to the studio with an open microphone and without any preparations responds, expressing everything what he feels. That was a true radio-battle with all [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s propagandists starting from [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], [[Otto Dietrich|Dietrich]], and others. The opportunity to fight like this – immediately, without paper [and censorship] – demonstrates a high confidence given to him by the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Government]] and the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the CPSU(b)]].»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Vladimir Pavlovich Belyaev|Volodymyr Beliayev]], Literaturna Ukraina, 1962&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1943, in Moscow, he met his future second wife Maria Krotkova, who was an artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In October 1943, the publishing house ''Moscovskiy Bolshevik'' released the collection of 15 Halan's war stories ''Front on Air''. At the end of th year, Halan moved to the [[Third Battle of Kharkov|recently liberated Kharkov]] and worked there on the frontline radio station ''Dnipro''.

During and after the war he was sharply condemning the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalists]] – [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Split in the OUN|banderivtsi]], [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Split in the OUN|melnykivtsi]], [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army|bulbivtsi]] – as [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|accomplices]] of the Nazi occupiers.

=== Post-war times ===

Yaroslav Halan wrote much about Ukrainian nationalists. In his story ''What Has No Name'' he described the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] crimes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«Fourteen-years-old girl can’t calmly look at meat. She trembles if someone is going to cook cutlets in her presence. A few months ago, on Easter Night, armed people came to a peasant house in a village close to the town of [[Sarny]], and stabbed its inhabitants with knives. The girl having the eyes widened of fear was looking at the agony of her parents. The girl with horror in her eyes was looking at the agony of her parents. One of the gangsters put a knife blade to the child’s neck, but at the last moment a new “idea” came to his mind: “Live in glory to [[Stepan Bandera]]! And to avoid you being starved to death we will leave you some food. Guys, slice pork for her!" The "guys" liked such a proposal. In a few minutes a mountain of meat made from the bleeding father and mother grew up in front of the horror-struck girl...»''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ZyhNDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=%D0%AF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%20%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%20%C2%AB%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F%20%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%20%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BC%D1%8F%D1%81%D0%BE%C2%BB&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=С крестом или с ножом|last=Halan|first=Yaroslav|date=August 15, 1962|publisher=State Publisher of Fiction|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=70|language=ru|trans-title=With Cross and Knife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Halan's tragedy ''Under the Golden Eagle'' (1947) the writer harshly criticizes the [[Bizone|American occupation]] administration in [[West Germany|Western Germany]] for its rude attempts to prevent Soviet soldiers [[Internment|interned]] in special camps to return to their homeland. In his play ''Love at Dawn'' (1949, published in 1951) he described the triumph of Socialism in the rural areas of Western Ukraine.

Often he was focused on counteracting the nationalistic propaganda. Nevertheless, Halan complained that these "Augean stables" were not his vocation but it had to be done by someone:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«I understand: the asenisation work is a necessary and useful work, but why only me? Why should I be the only cesspool cleaner? The reader of our periodicals will involuntarily have the thought that there is only "maniac" Halan, who has clung to Ukrainian fascism like a drunk clings to the raft, [while] the vast majority of the writers ignore this issue. It isn't needed to be explained what further conclusions the reader will make from this.»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his last satirical pamphlets Yaroslav Halan criticized the nationalistic and clerical reaction (particularly, the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]] and the anti-Communist doctrine of the [[Holy See]]): ''Their Face'' (1948), ''In the service of Satan'' (1948), ''In the Face of Facts'' (1949), ''Father of Darkness and His Henchmen'' (1949), ''The Vatican Idols Thirst for Blood'' (1949, in Polish), ''Twilight of the Alien Gods'' (1948), ''What Should Not Be Forgotten'' (1947), ''The Vatican Without Mask'' (1949) etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://diasporiana.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/books/16936/file.pdf|title=Morality and reality: the life and times of Andrei Sheptytsḱyi|last=Magocsi|first=Paul R.|last2=|date=|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|others=|year=1989|isbn=|location=Edmonton|pages=|author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014162926/http://diasporiana.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/books/16936/file.pdf|archive-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Holy See|Vatican]] had discovered that Halan is going to publish his new [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] pamphlet ''Father of Darkness and His Henchmen'', in July 1949 the Pope Pius XII [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pqT1DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;lpg=PT16&amp;dq=%22Yaroslav+Halan%22+excommuniated&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0gxr1cdujP&amp;sig=qv2HMbGmd8sMc5AGKzSTgL9ef-Y&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG2f-ttfrZAhVC7RQKHaVRAPYQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20excommuniate&amp;f=false|title=The Man with the Poison Gun: A Cold War Story|last=Plokhy|first=Serhii|date=December 8, 2016|publisher=Oneworld Publications|year=|isbn=9781786070449|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In response to this, Halan wrote a pamphlet ''I Spit on the Pope'', that caused a significant resonance within the Church and among believers. In the pamphlet he ironized on the ''[[Decree against Communism]]'' released by the Vatican on July 1, in which the Holy See had threatened to excommunicate all members of the Communist parties and active supporters of the Communists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«My only consolation is that I am not alone: together with me, the Pope excommunicated at least three hundred million people, and with them I once again in full voice declare: I spit on the Pope!»''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ZyhNDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;ots=4EnJSji_xd&amp;dq=%D0%BF%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%8E%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%83&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=С крестом или с ножом|last=Halan|first=Yaroslav|date=August 15, 1962|publisher=State Publisher of Fiction|year=|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=112|language=ru|trans-title=With Cross or With Knife|chapter=Плюю на папу!|trans-chapter=I Spit of the Pope!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Assassination ==
[[File:Yaroslav_Halan's_Body_After_Murder.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Halan's body after the murder on October 24, 1949.]]
Yaroslav Halan was killed in an assassination on October 24, 1949, in his home office, which was situated at Hvadiyska street in Lviv. He received 11 hits to the head with an axe.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; His blood spilled on the manuscript of his new article ''Greatness of the Liberated Human'' dedicated the tenth anniversary of the [[Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, Volhynia and Northern Bukovina|reunification]] of [[Western Ukraine]] with the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].

The killers – two students of the [[Ukrainian National Forestry University|Lviv Forestry Technical Institute]] Ilariy Lukashevych and Mykhailo Stakhur – committed the assassination after they got the appropriate order by the OUN leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spyinggame.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/the-man-with-the-poison-gun/|title=The Man With The Poison Gun|last=Plokhy|first=Serhii|date=2017-03-02|work=Intelligence Analysis and Reporting|access-date=2018-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014175120/https://spyinggame.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/the-man-with-the-poison-gun/|archive-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the murder Lukashevych gained the writer's confidence, so the students were let into the house. They came to the apartment under the pretext of being discriminated against at the university and seeking his help.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When Lukashevych gave a signal, Stakhur attacked the writer with the axe.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=6OXJCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=halan+stakhur+oun&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1LGBQ_JAdC&amp;sig=KfetxmHilXUR2uJ8C9e0Oof9Y-w&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi68Z632_rZAhUH7BQKHTuWC9MQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=halan%20stakhur%20oun&amp;f=false|title=Stepan Bandera: The Life and Afterlife of a Ukrainian Nationalist : Fascism, Genocide, and Cult|last=Rossolinski|first=Grzegorz|date=2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9783838206844|location=|pages=393|language=en|author-link=Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stakhur got convinced that Halan is dead, they tied up the housekeeper and escaped.

The [[MGB (USSR)|Ministry of the State Security]] (MGB) accused the Ukrainian nationalists of his murder, while the OUN claimed that it was a Soviet provocation in order to start a new wave of repressions against locals.

[[Nikita Khrushchev]], the leader of the Ukrainian SSR at that time, took personal control of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=uv1zv4FZhFUC&amp;pg=PT276&amp;lpg=PT276&amp;dq=%22Yaroslav+Galan%22+church&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wrIDcT6Wdf&amp;sig=6VOAjL1QqfRXzUc6ks_vX4uLrVk&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9p6mMr_rZAhUEWBQKHcRECYkQ6AEIWTAN#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Yaroslav%20Galan%22%20church&amp;f=false|title=Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev|last=Khrushchev|first=Nikita Sergeevich|last2=|first2=|date=2004|publisher=Penn State Press|year=|isbn=0271028610|location=|pages=262|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, the MGB agent [[Bohdan Stashynsky]]i being infiltrated into the OUN underground network managed to find Stakhur, who himself bragged about the assassination of Halan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/01/now-there-was-no-way-back-me-strange-story-bogdan-stashinsky|title="By now, there was no way back for me": the strange story of Bogdan Stashinsky|last=Jacobson|first=Gavin|date=|website=New Statesman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141152/https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/01/now-there-was-no-way-back-me-strange-story-bogdan-stashinsky|archive-date=June 12, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on July 10, and afterwards fully admitted his responsibility for the crime during the trial. According to Stakhur, he did that because of the writer's critical statements on the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] and the Vatican.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

On October 16, 1951, the military tribunal of the [[Carpathian Military District]] sentenced Mikhail Stakhur to death by hanging: the court hall applauded the announcement of the verdict. The verdict was enforced on the same day.

Some contemporary Ukrainian historians and journalists put forward the hypothesis that Halan was killed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, nowadays the fact of the OUN guilt proved with the numerous pieces of evidence is widely recognized by the vast majority of historians.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.2000.ua/v-nomere/aspekty/istorija/priznalsja-zabirajte_arhiv_art.htm|title=Признался!..

The assassination of Halan caused tightening of measures against the nationalist Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which continued terrorist activities against the Soviet power in Western Ukraine. All the leadership of the MGB arrived in Lviv, [[Pavel Sudoplatov]] himself worked there for several months. One of the consequences of the murder of Halan was the elimination of the UPA leader [[Roman Shukhevych]] four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=-WsqDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT349&amp;ots=Nllpys77s6&amp;dq=galan%20sudoplatov&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PT349#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD&amp;f=false|title=Павел Судоплатов.

The writer at his home office where he usually worked. 1947.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«Yaroslav Halan is a talented publicist, was a progressive writer in the past. Nowadays he still is the most advanced one among [local] non-party writers. But he's infected with the Western European bourgeois "spirit". Has little respect for Soviet people. Considers them not civilized enough. But just inwardly. In general terms, he understands the policy of the party, but in his opinion, the party makes great mistakes with regards to peasants in Western Ukraine. Halan places responsibility for these mistakes on the regional committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU(b)]], local institutions of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and the local Soviet authorities. Believes in Moscow. Doesn't want to join the party (he was advised to) due to being an individualist, and also in order to keep his hands, mind, and words free. He thinks if he joins the party, he will lose this [freedom].»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1962, in [[Toronto]], Olexandr Matla, aka Petro Tereschuk, a pro-nationalist historian from the [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian diaspora in Canada]], published the brochure ''History of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan)'', in which he accused Halan of being an informer of both Polish and Soviet intelligence services, and of helping them to oppress nationalists and even some pro-Soviet writers from Western Ukraine such as [[Anton Krushelnytsky]], who moved from Lviv to Kharkiv in the 1930s and was killed during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«[Halan] has used his undeniable publicistic talent to serve the enemy, thereby placing himself outside the Ukrainian people. He has directed his energy and creative mind against his own people and their interests. An outrageous egoist, egocentrist, money lover, slanderer, cynic, provocator, agent of two intelligence services, misanthrope, falsificator, speculator, and an informer are all the characteristics of Yaroslav Halan.»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Petro Tereschuk, History of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan), Canadian League for Ukraine's Liberation, Toronto, 1962.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;''«Yaroslav is an erudite, artist, polemicist, politician and undoubtedly an international-level journalist. I was amazed at his knowledge of the languages: German, French, Italian, Polish, Jewish, Russian. Picking up any newspaper or document he leafs through, reads it and writes something down. I was also surprised by his efficiency in work, interest in everything, an exceptional ability to "seek" and "raise" topics, problems, his persistent work on processing the material.»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''«In 1949 I witnessed an unusual event. On October 2 Yaroslav Halan spoke in Lviv University. It turned out to be his last speech. We condemned him but his presentation surprised me. He spoke as an intelligent person defending Ukrainian culture. It had nothing to do with the series of his pamphlets “I spit on Pope!” Halan turned out to be a totally different man. Several days later he was killed.»''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Yurí''' (Jurí) is, or was, a language previously spoken near a stretch of the [[Caquetá River]] in the Brazilian Amazon, extending slightly into Colombia. A small amount of data was collected on two occasions in the 19th century, in 1853 and 1867. [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (1994:62, after Nimuendajú 1977:62) notes that there is good lexical evidence to support a link with [[Ticuna language|Ticuna]] in a [[Ticuna–Yuri languages|Ticuna–Yurí]] language family, though the data has never been explicitly compared (Hammarström 2010).

It is commonly assumed that the Yuri people and language survive among the uncontacted people or peoples of the [[Rio Puré]] region, now the [[Río Puré National Park]]. Indeed, "Yuri" is often used as a synonym for the only named people in the area, the [[Carabayo people|Carabayo]]. A list of words collected in 1969 from the Carabayo, only recovered in 2013, suggests the language is close to Yuri, though perhaps not a direct descendent.
