'''ADITYA''' is a medium size [[tokamak]] installed at the [[Institute for Plasma Research]] in [[India]]. 

It has a major radius of 0.75 metres and a minor radius of 0.25 metres. The maximum field strength is 1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] produced by 20 toroidal field coils spaced symmetrically in the toroidal direction. It is operated by two power supplies, a capacitor bank and the APPS (ADITYA pulse power supply). 

The typical plasma parameters during capacitor bank discharges are: I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ~30&amp;nbsp;kA, shot duration ~25&amp;nbsp;ms, central electron temperature ~100&amp;nbsp;eV and core plasma density ~10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and the typical parameters of APPS operation is ~100&amp;nbsp;kA plasma current, ~ 100&amp;nbsp;ms duration, central electron temp. ~300&amp;nbsp;eV  and ~3x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; core plasma density. 

Various diagnostics used in ADITYA include electric and magnetic probes, microwave [[interferometry]], [[Thomson scattering]] and [[charge exchange]] [[spectroscopy]].

'''AIXI''' {{IPA-all|'ai̯k͡siː|}} is a theoretical [[mathematical formalism]] for [[artificial general intelligence]].
It combines [[Solomonoff induction]] with [[Decision theory|sequential decision theory]].
AIXI was first proposed by [[Marcus Hutter]] in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcus Hutter |title=A Theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence based on Algorithmic Complexity |arxiv=cs.AI/0004001 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the results below are proved in Hutter's 2005 book ''Universal Artificial Intelligence''.&lt;ref name="uaibook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcus Hutter |title=Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based on Algorithmic Probability |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NP53iZGt4KUC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-22139-5 |doi=10.1007/b138233 |ref=harv |authormask=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIXI is a [[Reinforcement learning|reinforcement learning agent]];
it maximizes the expected total rewards received from the environment.
Intuitively, it simultaneously considers every computable hypothesis.
In each time step, it looks at every possible program and evaluates how many rewards that program generates depending on the next action taken.
The promised rewards are then weighted by the [[Subjective logic|subjective belief]] that this program constitutes the true environment.
This belief is computed from the length of the program: longer programs are considered less likely, in line with [[Occam's razor]]. 
AIXI then selects the action that has the highest expected total reward in the weighted sum of all these programs.

== Definition ==

The AIXI agent interacts sequentially with some (stochastic and unknown to AIXI) environment &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
In step ''t'', the agent outputs an action &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; and
the environment responds with an observation &lt;math&gt;o_t&lt;/math&gt; and a reward &lt;math&gt;r_t&lt;/math&gt; distributed according to the conditional probability
&lt;math&gt;\mu(o_t r_t | a_1 o_1 r_1 ... a_{t-1} o_{t-1} r_{t-1} a_t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then this cycle repeats for ''t + 1''.
The agent tries to maximize cumulative future reward &lt;math&gt;r_t + \ldots + r_m&lt;/math&gt; for a fixed lifetime ''m''.

Given a current time ''t'' and history &lt;math&gt;a_1 o_1 r_1 ... a_{t-1} o_{t-1} r_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
the action AIXI outputs is defined as&lt;ref&gt;[http://hutter1.net/ai/uaibook.htm Universal Artificial Intelligence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\arg \max_{a_t} \sum_{o_t r_t} \ldots \max_{a_m} \sum_{o_m r_m}
  [r_t + \ldots + r_m] \sum_{q:\; U(q, a_1 \ldots a_m) = o_1 r_1 \ldots o_m r_m} 2^{-\textrm{length}(q)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U'' denotes a [[monotone class theorem|monotone]] [[universal Turing machine]], and
''q'' ranges over all programs on the universal machine ''U''.

The parameters to AIXI are the universal Turing machine and the agent's lifetime ''m''.
The latter dependence can be removed by the use of [[discounting]].

== Optimality ==

AIXI's performance is measured by the expected total number of rewards it receives.
AIXI has been proven to be optimal in the following ways.&lt;ref name="uaibook" /&gt;

* [[Pareto optimality]]: there is no other agent that performs at least as well as AIXI in all environments while performing strictly better in at least one environment.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* Balanced Pareto optimality: Like Pareto optimality, but considering a weighted sum of environments.
* Self-optimizing: a policy ''p'' is called self-optimizing for an environment &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; if the performance of ''p'' approaches the theoretical maximum for &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; when the length of the agent's lifetime (not time) goes to infinity. For environment classes where self-optimizing policies exist, AIXI is self-optimizing.

It was later shown by Hutter and Jan Leike that balanced Pareto optimality is subjective and that any policy can be considered Pareto optimal, which they describe as undermining all previous optimality claims for AIXI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Proceedings of the 28th Conference on Learning Theory|last1=Leike|first1=Jan|last2=Hutter|first2=Marcus|title=Bad Universal Priors and Notions of Optimality|date=2015|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Leike15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, AIXI does have limitations. It is restricted to maximizing rewards based on percepts as opposed to external states. It also assumes it interacts with the environment solely through action and percept channels, preventing it from considering the possibility of being damaged or modified. Colloquially, this means that it doesn't consider itself to be contained by the environment it interacts with. It also assumes the environment is computable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soares|first1=Nate|title=Formalizing Two Problems of Realistic World-Models|url=https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf|website=Intelligence.org|accessdate=2015-07-19|ref=MIRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since AIXI is incomputable (see below), it assigns zero probability to its own existence{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

== Computational aspects ==

Like [[Solomonoff induction]], AIXI is [[Undecidable problem|incomputable]].
However, there are computable approximations of it.
One such approximation is AIXI''tl'',
which performs at least as well as the provably best time ''t'' and space ''l'' limited agent.&lt;ref name="uaibook" /&gt;
Another approximation to AIXI with a restricted environment class is MC-AIXI(FAC-CTW),
which has had some success playing simple games such as [[Partially observable system|partially observable]] [[Pac-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Veness |first1=Joel |author2=Kee Siong Ng |last3=Hutter |first3=Marcus |last4=Uther |first4=William  |last5=Silver |first5=David   |eprint=0909.0801 |title=A Monte Carlo AIXI Approximation |year=2009 |class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfsMHtmGDKE Playing Pacman using AIXI Approximation - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission''' ('''ARCADE''') is a program which utilizes [[high-altitude balloon]] instrument package intended to measure the heating of the universe by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang and search for the signal of relic decay or annihilation. In July 2006 a strong residual radio source was found using the radiometer, approximately six times what is predicted by theory. This phenomenon is known as "space roar" and remains an [[List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics|unsolved problem in astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/arcade_balloon.html|title=NASA Balloon Mission Tunes in to a Cosmic Radio Mystery|last=|first=|date=January 7, 2009|website=[[NASA]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ARCADE coverage of all-sky radio map.jpg|thumb|200px|ARCADE viewed about 7% of the sky. The observed region is colored on this all-sky radio map. The plane of our galaxy, the Milky Way, runs across the center.]]

ARCADE has been funded by the NASA's [[Science Mission Directorate]] under the [[Astronomy and Physics Research and Analysis Suborbital Investigation program]]. The program is composed of a team led by [[Alan Kogut]] of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. ARCADE was launched from NASA's [[Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility]] in [[Palestine, Texas]], conducted under the auspices of the [[Balloon Program Office]] at [[Wallops Flight Facility]]. The balloon flew to an altitude of {{Convert|120000|ft|km}}, viewing about 7% of the sky during its observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Francis |last=Reddy |title=NASA Balloon Mission Tunes in to a Cosmic Radio Mystery |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/arcade_balloon.html |publisher= [[NASA]]|date=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument is designed to detect radiation at centimeter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Kogut |date=December 2006 |title=ARCADE: Absolute radiometer for cosmology, astrophysics, and diffuse emission |journal=New Astronomy Reviews |volume=50 |issue=11–12 |pages=925–931 |doi=10.1016/j.newar.2006.09.023 |last2=Fixsen |first2=D |last3=Fixsen |first3=S |last4=Levin |first4=S |last5=Limon |first5=M |last6=Lowe |first6=L |last7=Mirel |first7=P |last8=Seiffert |first8=M |last9=Singal |first9=J |last10=Lubin |first10 =P |last11=Wollack |first11=E  |arxiv=astro-ph/0609373 |bibcode=2006NewAR..50..925K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craft contained seven [[radiometers]] which were cooled to {{Convert|2.7|K}} using [[liquid helium]], with the intent to measure temperature differences as small as 1/1000 of a degree against a background which is only {{Convert|3|K}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcade.gsfc.nasa.gov/instruments.html ARCADE Instrument Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; The optics in the instrument package were placed near the top of the [[dewar flask]] which cooled them in order to prevent the instruments from seeing the walls of the container, thereby simplifying the processing of the observational data. This design choice necessitated the use of [[superfluid]] pumps in order to drench the radiometers in liquid helium. The design also utilized heaters in order to create a cloud of helium gas, in place of using a (relatively warm) window, which also simplified processing of the observational data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcade.gsfc.nasa.gov/stupid_dewar_tricks.html Stupid Dewar Tricks]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Residual emission ==

In 2011, the ARCADE 2 researchers reported, "Correcting for instrumental systematic errors in measurements such as ARCADE 2 is always a primary concern. We emphasize that we detect residual emission at 3 GHz with the ARCADE 2 data, but the result is also independently detected by a combination of low-frequency data and [[Cosmic Background Explorer#History|FIRAS]]."&lt;ref name="Seiffert"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seiffert |first1=M. |last2=Fixsen |first2=D.

'''Anaeroplasmatales''' is an order of [[Mollicutes|mollicute]] bacteria which are generally found in the [[rumen]]s of cattle and sheep. The only family in the order is the family Anaeroplasmataceae.

==Description==
Members of the order Anaeroplasmatales can appear as different shapes at different times in their lifecycles. Cells which are 16–18 hours old tend to be [[Coccus|spherical]]. When the cells are older, they can take on various shapes. Anaeroplasmatales are not motile. Anaeroplasmatales [[anaerobic bacteria|cannot grow]] in the presence of oxygen. They do grow at a temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C on microbiological media, where they form irregular-shaped colonies with a "fried-egg" appearance, similar to other [[mycoplasma]]s.&lt;ref name=Robinson1987/&gt; Anaeroplasmatales are [[gram-negative bacteria|negative]] by [[Gram stain]].&lt;ref name=Robinson1987/&gt;

==History==
The order Anaeroplasmatales was created in 1987 to encompass the family Anaeroplasmataceae which itself was created to hold the anaerobic [[mycoplasma]]s ''[[Anaeroplasma]]'' and ''[[Asteroleplasma]]''.&lt;ref name=Robinson1987&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proposal for an Amended Classification of Anaerobic Mollicutes |vauthors=Robinson IM, Freundt EA |journal=International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology |date = January 1987 |pages=78–81 |volume=37 |number=1 |doi=10.1099/00207713-37-1-78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anuchin Glacier''' ({{Coord|71|17|S|13|31|E|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] draining southward to [[Lake Unter-See]] in the northern part of the [[Gruber Mountains]], [[Queen Maud Land]]. It was discovered, and plotted from air photos, by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]], 1938&amp;ndash;39. It was mapped from air photos and from surveys by the [[Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition]], 1956&amp;ndash;60, and remapped by the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]], 1960&amp;ndash;61, and named after [[Dmitry Nikolayevich Anuchin]], Soviet geographer.

The '''atomic ratio''' is a measure of the [[ratio]] of atoms of one kind (i) to another kind (j). A closely related concept is the '''atomic percent''' (or '''at.%'''), which gives the percentage of one kind of atom relative to the total number of atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemistry|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-141046-5|pages=31|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[molecule|molecular]] equivalents of these concepts are the '''molar fraction''', or '''[[molar percent]]'''.

==Atoms==
Mathematically, the ''atomic percent'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{atomic \ percent} \ (\mathrm{i}) = \frac{N_\mathrm{i}}{N_\mathrm{tot}} \times 100  \ &lt;/math&gt; %
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the number of atoms of interest and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; are the total number of atoms, while the ''atomic ratio'' is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{atomic \ ratio} \ (\mathrm{i:j}) = \mathrm{atomic \ percent} \ (\mathrm{i}) : \mathrm{atomic \ percent} \ (\mathrm{j}) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the ''atomic percent'' of [[hydrogen]] in [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is {{nowrap|at.%&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2/3 x 100 ≈ 66.67%}}, while the ''atomic ratio'' of hydrogen to oxygen is {{nowrap|''A''&lt;sub&gt;H:O&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2:1}}.

==Isotopes==
Another application is in [[radiochemistry]], where this may refer to '''[[isotopic ratio]]s''' or '''[[isotopic abundance]]s'''. Mathematically, the ''isotopic abundance'' is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{isotopic \ abundance} \ (\mathrm{i}) = \frac{N_\mathrm{i}}{N_\mathrm{tot}} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the number of atoms of the isotope of interest and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of atoms, while the ''atomic ratio'' is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{isotopic \ ratio} \ (\mathrm{i:j}) = \mathrm{isotopic \ percent} \ (\mathrm{i}) : \mathrm{isotopic \ percent} \ (\mathrm{j}) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the ''isotopic ratio'' of [[deuterium]] (D) to [[hydrogen]] (H) in [[heavy water]] is roughly {{nowrap|D:H {{=}} 1:7000}} (corresponding to an ''isotopic abundance'' of 0.00014%).

==Doping in laser physics==
In [[laser physics]] however, the ''atomic ratio'' may refer to the '''[[Dopant#Lasing media|doping]] ratio '''or the '''doping fraction'''.

*For example, theoretically, a 100% ''doping ratio'' of '''[[Ytterbium|Yb]]''' '''&lt;big&gt;:&lt;/big&gt;''' [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|'''Y'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] is pure '''Yb'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The ''doping fraction'' equals,

::::::::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm \frac{N_\mathrm{atoms \ of \ dopant}}{N_\mathrm{atoms \ of \ solution \ which \  can \ be \ substituted \ with \ the \ dopant}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana''' is a research and education institute for [[mathematics]] in [[Pune]], [[India]], founded by noted Indian-American mathematician professor [[Shreeram Abhyankar]].
The institute is named after the great ancient Indian Mathematician Bhaskaracharya (Born in 1114 A.D.). Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana is a Pune, India, based institute founded in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bprim.org/more.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213041443/http://www.bprim.org/more.htm |archivedate=2009-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has researchers working in many areas of mathematics, particularly in [[algebra]] and [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bprim.org/people.php#A&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, the Pratishthana has been the nodal center for the ''Regional Mathematics Olympiad'' under the [[NBHM|National Board of Higher Mathematics]]. Pratishthana is noted for its mathematics olympiad training programs for high-school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecentral.com/site/492289 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107132503/http://www.sciencecentral.com/site/492289 |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratishthana publishes the mathematics periodical ''Bona Mathematica'' and has published texts in higher and olympiad mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bprim.org/publication.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010194326/http://www.bprim.org/publication.php |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Recently, in Pratishthana, two projects supported by MHRD have been started. One is on e-learning&lt;ref&gt;http://elearn.bprim.org{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other on the use of free open source software in Mathematics education (FOOSME).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fossme.bprim.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230080107/http://fossme.bprim.org/ |archivedate=2010-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the e-learning project video broadcasting of online Maths lectures is being done. The topics are Ring Theory and Complex Analysis. These lectures are at Undergraduate levels. The FOSSME project is all about exploring FOSS for Maths Education. There were 3 national level workshops held on FOSS for Maths education, Scilab,&lt;ref&gt;scilab.org&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced and LaTeX&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tug.org&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced.

'''Christopher Aikman''' (born 1943) is a Canadian [[astrophysicist]] who spent most of his career (from 1968 to 1997) at the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]] (DAO) in [[Saanich, British Columbia]], Canada.

== Early life and education ==
An early interest in Astronomy led Aikman to join the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] Quebec Centre in 1958, at the age of 15. He received a B.Sc. from [[Bishop's University]] in 1965 and a M.Sc. from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rasc.ca/christopher-aikman|title=Christopher Aikman {{!}} RASC|website=www.rasc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Master's work focused on [[microwave]] observations of [[H II region|H II regions]] and the [[planetary nebula]] [[IC 1295|IC 1795]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/theses/theses30-96.html|title=U of Toronto Astronomy Department Theses 1930-1996|website=www.astro.utoronto.ca|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1968 joined the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His initial research was on the [[spectroscopy]] of chemically peculiar stars, whose surface compositions differ markedly from that of the [[Sun]], with the aim of understanding the origin of their anomalies. From 1991, he conducted a program of tracking [[Near-Earth asteroid|Earth approaching asteroids]] with the historic telescope built by [[John S. Plaskett]], but the project was cancelled in 1997.

He was the Canadian representative on the [[Spaceguard]] Foundation, a group concerned with assessing the [[asteroid]] impact threat to [[Earth]]. An incidental product of this research was the discovery of four asteroids between 1994 and 1998 (as credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]]).&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
In 1983, Aikman won the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Service Award for his significant contributions to RASC Victoria Centre.

[[File:MSIChicago.JPG|thumb|375px| "White City" buildings in Chicago, built for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (1893) widely displayed and inspired the City Beautiful movement, influencing architecture  with such [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] structures as the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] building. ]]

The '''City Beautiful Movement''' was a reform philosophy of [[North America]]n [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]] that flourished during the 1890s and 1900s with the intent of introducing [[beauty|beautification]] and [[monument]]al grandeur in cities. The movement, which was originally associated mainly with [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Detroit]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], promoted beauty not only for its own sake, but also to create moral and [[civic virtue]] among urban populations.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel M. Bluestone, Columbia University, (September 1988).[https://www.jstor.org/pss/990300 Detroit's City Beautiful and the Problem of Commerce] ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'', Vol. XLVII, No. 3, pp. 245-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the philosophy believed that such beautification could promote a harmonious social order that would increase the quality of life, while critics would complain that the movement was overly concerned with aesthetics at the expense of social reform; [[Jane Jacobs]] referred to the movement as an "architectural design cult."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Jacobs|Jacobs, Jane]]. ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (New York: Random House, 1961), p.375; quoted in [[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]]. ''City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World'' New York: Scribner, 1995. p.27. {{ISBN|0-684-81302-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and effect===
The movement began in the United States in response to crowding in [[tenement]] districts, a consequence of high birth rates, increased [[immigration]] and internal migration of rural populations into cities. The movement flourished for several decades, and in addition to the construction of monuments, it also achieved great influence in urban planning that endured throughout the 20th century, particularly in regard to United States [[housing project|public housing]] projects. The "[[Garden city movement|Garden City]]" movement in Britain influenced the contemporary planning of some newer suburbs of [[London]], and there was cross-influence between the two aesthetics, one based in formal garden plans and urbanization schemes and the other, with its "[[semi-detached]] [[villa]]s" evoking a more rural atmosphere.

===Architectural idioms===
The particular architectural style of the movement borrowed mainly from the contemporary [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and  [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architectures, which emphasized the necessity of order, dignity, and harmony.

===World's Columbian Exposition===
The first large-scale elaboration of the City Beautiful occurred during the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 in [[Chicago]]. The planning of the exposition was directed by architect [[Daniel Burnham]], who hired architects from the eastern United States, as well as the [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], to build large-scale Beaux-Arts monuments that were vaguely classical with uniform [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]] height. The exposition displayed a model city of grand scale, known as the "White City", with modern [[transport]] systems and no poverty visible. The exposition is credited with resulting in the large-scale adoption of monumentalism for American architecture for the next 15 years. [[Richmond, Virginia]]'s [[Monument Avenue]] is one expression of this initial phase.

===Louisiana Purchase Exposition===
The popularization begun by the World Columbian Exposition was increased by the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St. Louis in 1904. The commissioner of architects selected Franco-American architect [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]] to be Chief of Design of the fair. In this position, which Masqueray held for three years, he designed the following fair buildings in the prevailing Beaux Arts mode: the Palace of Agriculture; the cascades and colonnades; the Palace of Forestry, Fish, and Game; the Palace of Horticulture; and the Palace of Transportation. All these were widely emulated in civic projects across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Marter, Joan M. The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Vol. 1. pp. 602-03. Oxford UP, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Masqueray resigned soon after the fair opened in 1904, having been invited by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul to Minnesota to design a new cathedral for the city in the fair's Beaux-Arts style. Other celebrated architects of the fair's buildings, notably [[Cass Gilbert]], who designed the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]], originally the fair's Palace of the Fine Arts, similarly employed City Beautiful ideas from the exposition throughout their careers.

===McMillan Plan===
{{main|McMillan Plan}}

An early use of the City Beautiful ideal with the intent of creating social order through beautification was the [[McMillan Plan]], (1902) named for Michigan Senator [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]]. The plan emerged from the [[Senate Park Commission]]'s redesigning of the monumental core of [[Washington, D.C.]] to commemorate the city's centennial and to fulfill unrealized aspects of the city plan of [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] a century earlier.

The Washington planners, who included Burnham, Saint-Gaudens, [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] of [[McKim, Mead, and White]], and [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]], visited many of the great cities of [[Europe]]. They hoped to make Washington monumental and green like the European capitals of the era; they believed that state-organized beautification could lend legitimacy to government during a time of social disturbance in the United States. The essence of the plan surrounded the [[United States Capitol]] with monumental government buildings to replace "notorious [[slum]] communities". At the heart of the design was the creation of the [[National Mall]] and eventually included Burnham's [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]]. The implementation of the plan was interrupted by [[World War I]] but resumed after the war, culminating in the construction of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in 1922.

===Influence in other cities===
{{see also|Group Plan|Olmsted Portland park plan}}

The success of the City Beautiful philosophy in Washington, D.C., is credited with influencing subsequent plans for beautification of many other cities, including [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] ([[The Mall (Cleveland)|The Mall]]), [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] (with the axis along State Street from the Ohio State Capitol building east to the Metropolitan Library and west to the Scioto River), [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]] (the [[Cultural Center Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)|Cultural Center]], [[Belle Isle Park (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] and [[Outer Drive]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usp100detroit.wordpress.com/city-beautiful/|title=City Beautiful|author=|date=10 March 2016|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/history-of-the-mystery/Content?oid=2179308|title=History of the mystery|first=Curt|last=Guyette|date=|website=Detroit Metro Times|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (with the axis from the capitol building through State Street and to the University of Wisconsin campus), [[Montreal]], [[New York City]] (notably the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]]), [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] (the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] museum district between [[Philadelphia City Hall]] and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]), [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] (the [[Schenley Farms]] district in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of parks, museums, and universities), [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] ([[San Antonio River]] development), [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] (manifested by its [[Civic Center, San Francisco, California|Civic Center]]), and the Washington State Capitol Campus in Olympia and the University of Washington's Rainier Vista in Seattle. In [[Wilmington, Delaware]], it inspired the creation of [[Rodney Square]] and the surrounding civic buildings.  In [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[John Russell Pope]] developed a plan for [[Yale University]] that eliminated substandard housing and relocated the urban poor to the peripheries. [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], undertook the installation of parkways and parks under the influence of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]]. ''City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World'' New York: Scribner, 1995. p135. {{ISBN|0-684-81302-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coral Gables]], Florida would be an example of a city consistent with the City Beautiful philosophy.

====Chicago====

Daniel Burnham's [[Burnham Plan of Chicago|1909 Plan of Chicago]] is considered one of principal documents of the City Beautiful movement.  The plan featured a dynamic new civic center, axial streets, and a lush strip of parkland for recreation alongside the city's lakefront.  Of these, only the lakefront park was implemented to any significant degree.

In 1913, the City of Chicago appointed a Commission with a mandate to “make Chicago Beautiful.”  As part of the plan, the Pennsylvania Union Railroad Depot was to be moved to the west side of the City and replaced with a new modern depot.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein &amp; Lehr, The First 120 Years (Amazon), pp 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The West Side Property Owner’s Association was among those who objected.  As reported by the Chicago Tribune, the Association’s attorney, Sidney Adler of Loeb &amp; Adler, said, “As I saw the beautiful picture of the city beautiful we will have fountains in West Madison Street, with poets and poetesses walking along Clinton, and the simple minded residents of the west side, after work is done, will take their gondolas and row on the limpid bosom of the Chicago River idlely strumming guitars.” &lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, May 29, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coral Gables====
{{Main|Coral Gables, Florida}}

Planned out as a suburb of [[Miami, Florida]] in the early 1920s by [[George Edgar Merrick]] during the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] was developed entirely upon the City Beautiful movement, with obelisks, fountains, and monuments seen in street roundabouts, parks, city buildings and around the city. Today, Coral Gables is one of Miami's most expensive suburban communities, long known for its strict zoning regulations which preserve the City Beautiful elements along with its [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]] style, which is prevalent throughout the city. Coral Gables has many parks and a heavy [[tree canopy]] with an [[urban forest]] planted largely in the 1920s.

====Denver====
{{Main|Civic Center, Denver}}

In [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], Mayor [[Robert W. Speer]] endorsed City Beautiful planning, with a plan for a Civic Center, disposed along a grand esplanade that led to the [[Colorado State Capitol]]. The plan was partly realized, on a reduced scale, with the Greek amphitheater, Voorhies Memorial and the Colonnade of Civic Benefactors, completed in 1919. The [[Andrew Carnegie|Andrew Carnegie Foundation]] funded the Denver Public Library (1910), which was designed as a three-story Greek Revival temple with a colossal [[Ionic order|Ionic colonnade]] across its front; inside it featured open shelves, an art gallery and a children's room.  Monuments and vistas were an essential feature of City Beautiful urban planning: in Denver, Paris-trained American sculptor [[Frederick William Macmonnies|Frederick MacMonnies]] was commissioned to design a  monument marking the end of the [[Smoky Hill Trail]]. The bronze Indian guide he envisaged was vetoed by the committee and replaced with an equestrian [[Kit Carson]].

====Harrisburg====

Harrisburg's movement of beautification and improvement was one of the earliest and most successful urban reform movements in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The City Beautiful Movement|last = Wilson|first = William H.|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1989|isbn = 0801837588|location = Baltimore|pages = 126–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began when local minded residents became convinced that their city was unattractive, unhealthy, and filthy, and lacked the appearance and facilities appropriate to its status as Pennsylvania's state capital. The causes of the city's defects were well known: industrialization in the previous half century had left the city poorly planned with unpaved streets and undeveloped water management systems. Residents of Harrisburg suffered disease and illnesses caused by the lack of good filtration systems that could filter the sewage dumped by populations further up the Susquehanna River. A disastrous fire that consumed the state capitol in 1897 had spawned new conversation about the suitability of Harrisburg as a state capital.

The improvement campaign was sparked by a riveting speech of conservationist [[Mira Lloyd Dock]] to the Harrisburg Board of Trade on December 20, 1900. Dock wanted to publicly challenge the horrific conditions in Harrisburg, and set out to gain public sentiment in support of changing them.   
Dock’s speech was titled “The City Beautiful” or “Improvement Work at Home and Abroad”, and this was the starting point for Harrisburg’s city improvements.  Dock’s contemporary and closest ally in her drive for urban beautification was J. Horace McFarland, who was the president of the American Civic Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambliss|first1=Julian|title=Perfecting Space: J. Horace McFarland and the American Civic Association|journal=Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies|date=2010|volume=77|issue=4|pages=486–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With McFarland and Dock working together, they were able to push the process of municipal improvement in Harrisburg by convincing prominent community leaders to donate money, and by gathering the support of the majority of citizens.  In April 1901, the Harrisburg Telegraph, a city newspaper, published a front-page article on the city’s problems, which stressed Dock’s message of beautification and recreation, paved streets, clean water, a city hall, land for parks, and a covered sewer interceptor along the river. The following February 1901, the population voted in favor of a bond issue that funded $1.1 million in new constructions and city planning. These improvements, combined with a new state capitol building in 1906, quickly transformed Harrisburg into a proud modern city by 1915.

====Memphis====
In [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the City Beautiful Commission was officially established by a city ordinance on July 1, 1930, making it the first and oldest beautification commission in the nation. It was the brainchild of the mayor, Mr. [[E. H. Crump]]. The first Commission was appointed and had operating expenses of $1,500. A small office was set up in [[The Nineteenth Century Club]]. Mrs. E. G. Willingham was chosen as chairman and Mrs. William B. Fowler served as vice chairman. In 1935, the Riverside Drive project was dedicated. Costing nearly $1,000,000 (largely WPA funds) the City Beautiful Commission landscaped the bluffs with crape myrtle, redbuds, magnolias, dogwoods and Paul Scarlet roses. White roses were planted at each guardrail post. In 1936, Mrs. William B. Fowler became chairman of the City Beautiful Commission and served for many years. City Beautiful grew under her leadership and soon had to relocate to  larger headquarters. Through the efforts of City Beautiful, Memphis gained the title of cleanest city in Tennessee in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946.  Memphis also received the Ernest T. Trigg “Nation’s Cleanest City” award in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951. During this time, volunteers were organized into Wards and Block Clubs with Ward Chairmen and Block Captains. The City Beautiful staff grew to include 30 inspectors by 1954 who worked through these organizations to identify and improve eyesores. Memphis participated with the {{req|National Clean-Up, Paint-Up, Fix-Up Beautification Bureau|American Coatings Association}} headquartered in Washington, D.C.[http://www.paint.org/about-aca/history/][https://books.google.com/books?id=VifrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT586][https://books.google.com/books?id=1u01AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA56]  In 1978, the Commission was reorganized, eliminating the field inspectors.  In February 1989, the Commission moved to its present location at The Massey House in [[Victorian Village, Memphis]].

====Palos Verdes Estates====
In the 1920s, [[Palos Verdes Estates, California]] was established as a master planned community by noted American landscape architect, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. The community was designed as a "City Beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Gates THE PALOS VERDES RANCH PROJECT: Olmsted Brothers' Design Development For A Picturesque Los Angeles Suburban Community Of The 1920s  Available at http://corbu2.caed.kent.edu/architronic/v6n1/v6n1.03a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Among its earliest structures were the buildings comprising Malaga Cove Plaza which were designed in a [[Mediterranean Revival style]] popular with the City Beautiful movement.

== In Australia ==
Both European and North American cities provided models for the Australian City Beautiful movement. A combination of elements about 1900 also influenced the movement:
* It was thought that Australia, being a country that was relatively newly settled by Europeans, had wasted an opportunity to design cities comprehensively and aesthetically.&lt;ref name="Freestone1"&gt;Freestone R (2000) From city improvement to the city beautiful; chapter 2. In: Hamnett S and Freestone R (eds) The Australian Metropolis: A Planning History. Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Australian cities were seen as lacking beauty and civic pride.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt;
* The lack of architectural features, and extensive street advertising, were also concerns. This was attributed to “materialism, apathy, short-sightedness, political interference and indifference”.&lt;ref name="Freestone2"&gt;Freestone R (2007) Designing Australia’s cities. UNSW Press, Kensington, pp. 45–79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Utopian city plans were another influence on the Australian City Beautiful movement. A better Brisbane, for example, was described by Louis Esson and illustrated by Lloyd Rees with a Parisian influence.&lt;ref name="Freestone2" /&gt;

However, City Beautiful was not solely concerned with aesthetics. The term ‘beautility’ derived from the American city beautiful philosophy, which meant that the beautification of a city must also be functional. Beautility, including the proven economic value of improvements,  influenced Australian town planning.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt;

There were no formal city beautiful organisations that led this movement in Australia; rather it was influenced by communications among professionals and bureaucrats, in particular architect-planners and local government reformers.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt; In the early Federation era some influential Australians were determined that their cities be progressive and competitive. Adelaide was used as an Australian example of the “benefits of comprehensive civic design” with its ring of parklands. Beautification of the city of Hobart, for example, was considered a way to increase the city’s popularity as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt;

===Canberra===
[[Walter Burley Griffin]] incorporated City Beautiful principles for his design for [[Canberra]].&lt;ref name="Freestone1" /&gt; Griffin was influenced by Washington “with grand axes and vistas and a strong central focal point”&lt;ref name="Stelter GA 2000 pp. 98"&gt;Stelter GA (2000) Rethinking the significance of the City Beautiful idea. In; Freestone R, Urban planning in a changing world: The twentieth century experience. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 98–117.&lt;/ref&gt; with specialised centres and, being a landscape architect, used the landscape to complement this layout.&lt;ref&gt;Banks JCG, Bracks CL (2003) Canberra’s urban forest: evolution and planning for future landscapes. Urban [[Forestry]] &amp; Urban Greening 1(3), 151-160.&lt;/ref&gt; John Sulman, however, was Australia's "leading  proponent" of the City Beautiful movement and, in 1921, wrote the book ''An Introduction to Australian City Planning''.&lt;ref name="Stelter GA 2000 pp. 98"/&gt; Both the City Beautiful and the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] philosophies were represented by Sulman’s “geometric or contour controlled” designs of the circulatory road systems in Canberra. The widths of pavements were also reduced and vegetated areas were increased, such as planted road verges.&lt;ref&gt;Ward A (2000) Assessment of Garden City planning principles in the ACT. Environment ACT, Heritage Unit, Canberra. Available at http://www.tams.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/13177/gardencity.pdf (verified 18 May 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melbourne===
Melbourne’s grid plan was considered dull and monotonous by some people, and so the architect William Campbell designed a blueprint for the city. The main principle behind this were diagonal streets, providing sites for new and comprehensive architecture and for special buildings. The designs of Paris and Washington were major inspirations for this plan.&lt;ref name="Freestone2" /&gt;

===City Beautiful in Australia today===
[[World War I]] prolonged the City Beautiful movement in Australia, as more memorials were erected than in any other country. Although City Beautiful, or artistic planning, became a part of comprehensive town planning, the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s largely ended this fashion.&lt;ref name="Freestone2" /&gt; Now, however, in Australia, many streets are tree-lined and streetscapes and skylines are regulated. This was largely a result of the City Beautiful philosophy.

The '''Clausius theorem''' (1855) states that a system exchanging heat with external reservoirs and undergoing a cyclic process, is one that ultimately returns a system to its original state,

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T_{surr}} \leq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the infinitesimal amount of heat absorbed by the system from the reservoir and &lt;math&gt;T_{surr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] of the external reservoir (surroundings) at a particular instant in time. In the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ClausiusTheorem.html '''Clausius theorem'''] at [[Wolfram Research]]&lt;/ref&gt; The reversible case is used to introduce the [[entropy]] state function. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero. In words, the Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Finn, Colin B. P. ''Thermal Physics''. 2nd ed., CRC Press, 1993. &lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, heat spontaneously flows from a hot body to a cooler one, not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Giancoli, Douglas C. ''Physics: Principles with Applications''. 6th ed., Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt; The generalized "inequality of Clausius"&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, R. G. ''Physical Chemistry''. 3rd ed., p. 120, Academic Press, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;dS &gt; \frac{\delta Q}{T_{surr}} &lt;/math&gt;

for an infinitesimal change in entropy ''S'' applies not only to cyclic processes, but to any process that occurs in a closed system. 

==History==

The Clausius theorem is a mathematical explanation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. It was developed by [[Rudolf Clausius]] who intended to explain the relationship between the heat flow in a system and the entropy of the system and its surroundings. Clausius developed this in his efforts to explain entropy and define it quantitatively. In more direct terms, the theorem gives us a way to determine if a cyclical process is reversible or irreversible. The Clausius theorem provides a quantitative formula for understanding the second law.

Clausius was one of the first to work on the idea of entropy and is even responsible for giving it that name. What is now known as the Clausius theorem was first published in 1862 in Clausius' sixth memoir, "On the Application of the Theorem of the Equivalence of Transformations to Interior Work". Clausius sought to show a proportional relationship between entropy and the energy flow by heating (δ''Q'') into a system. In a system, this heat energy can be transformed into work, and work can be transformed into heat through a cyclical process. Clausius writes that "The algebraic sum of all the transformations occurring in a cyclical process can only be less than zero, or, as an extreme case, equal to nothing." In other words, the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with 𝛿''Q'' being energy flow into the system due to heating and ''T'' being absolute temperature of the body when that energy is absorbed, is found to be true for any process that is cyclical and reversible. Clausius then took this a step further and determined that the following relation must be found true for any cyclical process that is possible, reversible or not. This relation is the "Clausius inequality".

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T_{surr}} \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;

Now that this is known, there must be a relation developed between the Clausius inequality and entropy. The amount of entropy S added to the system during the cycle is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S {{=}} \oint \frac{\delta Q}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

It has been determined, as stated in the [[second law of thermodynamics]], that the entropy is a state function: It depends only upon the state that the system is in, and not what path the system took to get there. This is in contrast to the amount of energy added as heat (𝛿''Q'') and as work (𝛿''W''), which may vary depending on the path. In a cyclic process, therefore, the entropy of the system at the beginning of the cycle must equal the entropy at the end of the cycle, &lt;math&gt;\Delta S=0&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of whether the process is reversible or irreversible. In the irreversible case, entropy will be created in the system, and more entropy must be extracted than was added &lt;math&gt;(\Delta S_{surr}&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt; in order to return the system to its original state. In the reversible case, no entropy is created and the amount of entropy added is equal to the amount extracted.

If the amount of energy added by heating can be measured during the process, and the temperature can be measured during the process, the Clausius inequality can be used to determine whether the process is reversible or irreversible by carrying out the integration in the Clausius inequality.

==Proof==

The temperature that enters in the denominator of the integrand in the Clausius inequality is actually the temperature of the external reservoir with which the system exchanges heat. At each instant of the process, the system is in contact with an external reservoir.
 
Because of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in each infinitesimal heat exchange process between the system and the reservoir, the net change in entropy of the "universe", so to say, is &lt;math&gt; dS_{Total}=dS_{Sys} +dS_{Res} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

When the system takes in heat by an infinitesimal amount &lt;math&gt;\delta Q_{1}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;), for the net change in entropy &lt;math&gt;dS_{Total_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; in this step to be positive, the temperature of the "hot" reservoir &lt;math&gt;T_{Hot}&lt;/math&gt; needs to be slightly greater than the temperature of the system at that instant. 
If the temperature of the system is given by &lt;math&gt;T_{1}&lt;/math&gt; at that instant, then &lt;math&gt; dS_{Sys_{1}}=\frac{\delta Q_{1}}{T_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T_{Hot}\geq T_{1}&lt;/math&gt; forces us to have:

:&lt;math&gt; -dS_{Res_{1}} =\frac{\delta Q_{1}}{T_{Hot}}\leq \frac{\delta Q_{1}}{T_{1}} = dS_{Sys_{1}} &lt;/math&gt;

This means the magnitude of the entropy "loss" from the reservoir, &lt;math&gt; |dS_{Res_{1}}|=\frac{\delta Q_{1}}{T_{Hot}} &lt;/math&gt; is less than the magnitude of the entropy gain &lt;math&gt;dS_{Sys_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) by the system:

Similarly, when the system at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{2}&lt;/math&gt; expels heat in magnitude &lt;math&gt;-\delta Q_{2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\delta Q_{2}\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;) into a colder reservoir (at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{Cold}\leq T_{2}&lt;/math&gt;) in an infinitesimal step, then again, for the Second Law of Thermodynamics to hold, we would have, in an exactly similar manner:

:&lt;math display="block"&gt; -dS_{Res_{2}}=\frac{\delta Q_{2}}{T_{Cold}}\geq \frac{\delta Q_{2}}{T_{2}}= dS_{Sys_{2}}  &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the amount of heat 'absorbed' by the system is given by &lt;math&gt;\delta Q_{2}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;), signifying that heat is transferring from the system to the reservoir, with &lt;math&gt;dS_{Sys_{2}}\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The magnitude of the entropy gained by the reservoir, &lt;math&gt; dS_{Res_{2}}=\frac{|\delta Q_{2}|}{T_{cold}}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the magnitude of the entropy loss of the system &lt;math&gt; |dS_{Sys_{2}}|&lt;/math&gt;

Since the total change in entropy for the system is 0 in a cyclic process, if we add all the infinitesimal steps of heat intake and heat expulsion from the reservoir, signified by the previous two equations, with the temperature of the reservoir at each instant given by &lt;math&gt;T_{surr}&lt;/math&gt;, we would have,

:&lt;math&gt; -\oint dS_{Res}= \oint \frac{\delta Q}{T_{surr}}\leq \oint dS_{Sys}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

In particular.

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T_{surr}}\leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we proved the Clausius Theorem.

We summarize the following, (the inequality in the third statement below, being obviously guaranteed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]],which is the basis of our calculation), 

:&lt;math&gt;\oint dS_{Res}\geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\oint dS_{Sys}=0 &lt;/math&gt; (as hypothesized)
:&lt;math&gt;\oint dS_{Total}=\oint dS_{Res}+\oint dS_{Sys}\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] [[Thermodynamic cycle|cyclic]] process, there is no generation of entropy in each of the infinitesimal heat transfer processes, and thus we would have the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{\delta Q_{rev}}{T}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Clausius inequality is a consequence of applying the [[second law of thermodynamics]] at each infinitesimal stage of heat transfer, and is thus in a sense a weaker condition than the Second Law itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5187">The '''contact order''' of a [[protein]] is a measure of the locality of the inter-[[amino acid]] contacts in the protein's [[native state]] [[tertiary structure]]. It is calculated as the average sequence distance between residues that form [[native contact]]s in the folded protein divided by the total length of the protein. Higher contact orders indicate longer [[protein folding|folding times]],&lt;ref name=plaxco&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plaxco|first=Kevin W|author2=Simons, Kim T |author3=Baker, David |title=Contact order, transition state placement and the refolding rates of single domain proteins|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=April 1998|volume=277|issue=4|pages=985–994|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1998.1645|pmid=9545386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonneau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonneau|first=Richard|author2=Ruczinski, Ingo |author3=Tsai, Jerry |author4= Baker, David |title=Contact order and ab initio protein structure prediction|journal=Protein Science|date=August 2002|volume=11|issue=8|pages=1937–1944|doi=10.1110/ps.3790102|pmid=12142448|pmc=2373674}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low contact order has been suggested as a predictor of potential [[downhill folding]], or protein folding that occurs without a [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] barrier.&lt;ref name="Zuo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zuo | first1 = G | last2 = Wang | first2 = J | last3 = Wang | first3 = W | year = 2006 | title = Folding with downhill behavior and low cooperativity of proteins | url = | journal = Proteins | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 165–73 | doi=10.1002/prot.20857| pmid = 16416404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is thought to be due to the lower loss of [[conformational entropy]] associated with the formation of local as opposed to nonlocal contacts.&lt;ref name="Bonneau" /&gt;

Relative contact order (CO) is formally defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;CO={1 \over {L\cdot N}}\sum^{N}\Delta S_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N'' is the total number of contacts, Δ''Si,j'' is the sequence separation, in residues, between contacting residues ''i'' and ''j'', and ''L'' is the total number of residues in the protein.&lt;ref name=plaxco /&gt; The value of contact order typically ranges from 5% to 25% for single-domain proteins, with lower contact order belonging to mainly helical proteins, and higher contact order belonging to proteins with a high beta-sheet content.

[[Protein structure prediction]] methods are more accurate in predicting the structures of proteins with low contact orders. This may be partly because low contact order proteins tend to be small, but is likely to be explained by the smaller number of possible long-range residue-residue interactions to be considered during [[global optimization]] procedures that minimize an [[objective function|energy function]].&lt;ref name="Mount"&gt;Mount DM. (2004). ''Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis'' 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Even successful structure prediction methods such as the [[Rosetta@Home|Rosetta]] method overproduce low-contact-order structure predictions compared to the distributions observed in experimentally determined protein structures.&lt;ref name="Bonneau" /&gt;

The percentage of the natively folded contact order can also be used as a measure of the "nativeness" of folding [[transition state]]s. [[Phi value analysis]] in concert with [[molecular dynamics]] has produced transition-state models whose contact order is close to that of the folded state in proteins that are small and fast-folding.&lt;ref name="Pandit"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pandit | first1 = AD | last2 = Jha | first2 = A | last3 = Freed | first3 = KF | last4 = Sosnick | first4 = TR | year = 2006 | title = Small proteins fold through transition states with native-like topologies | url = | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 361 | issue = 4| pages = 755–70 | doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.041| pmid = 16876194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, contact orders in transition states as well as those in native states are highly correlated with overall folding time.&lt;ref name="Paci"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paci | first1 = E | last2 = Lindorff-Larsen | first2 = K | last3 = Dobson | first3 = CM | last4 = Karplus | first4 = M | last5 = Vendruscolo | first5 = M | year = 2005 | title = Transition state contact orders correlate with protein folding rates | url = | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 352 | issue = 3| pages = 495–500 | doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2005.06.081| pmid = 16120445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their role in structure prediction, contact orders can themselves be predicted based on a [[sequence alignment]], which can be useful in classifying the fold of a novel sequence with some degree of [[homology (biology)|homology]] to known sequences.&lt;ref name="Shi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = Yi | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Jianjun | last3 = Arndt | first3 = David | last4 = Wishart | first4 = David S. | last5 = Lin | first5 = Guohui | year = 2008 | title = Protein contact order prediction from primary sequences | url = | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 255 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-255| pmid = 18513429 | pmc = 2440764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[finance]], '''correlation trading''' is a strategy in which the investor gets exposure to the average [[correlation]] of an index. 

The key to correlation trading is being able to predict when future realized correlation amongst the stocks of a particular index will be greater or less than the "implied" correlation level derived from derivatives on the index and its single stocks.  One observation related to correlation trading is the principle of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]], which implies that the volatility of a portfolio of securities is less than (or equal to) the average volatility of all the securities in that portfolio (based on [[Modern portfolio theory]]). The lower the correlation among the individual securities, the lower the overall volatility of the entire portfolio. This is due to [[Sum_of_normally_distributed_random_variables#Correlated_random_variables|the way in which variances behave when summing correlated random variables]].

To sell correlation, investors can:
* Sell a [[call option]] on the index and buy a portfolio of call options on the individual constituents of the index.  Although typically in  practice, the trader would choose straddles instead of calls to minimize delta risk as its often not feasible to perfectly replicate the index with single stock options.;
* Sell a [[variance swap]] on the index and buy the variance swaps on the individual constituents; this particular kind of [[spread trade]] is called a '''variance dispersion trade'''.
* Sell a [[correlation swap]].

In practice, [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETF's) are sometimes chosen instead of indices.

==History and projects==
The Creation Evidence Museum was founded by Carl Baugh, a [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]], after he came to Glen Rose in 1982 to research claims of [[fossilized]] human footprints alongside [[dinosaur]] footprints in the [[limestone]] banks of the [[Paluxy River]], near [[Dinosaur Valley State Park]]. He claims to have excavated 475 dinosaur footprints and 86 human footprints,&lt;ref name="Roadside America"&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/8196 "Creation Evidence Museum, Glen Rose, Texas"], [[Roadside America]]. Retrieved August 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which form the basis of the Creation Evidence Museum as well as other exhibits.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A283058 "Creationism Alive and Kicking in Glen Rose"], by Greg Beets, August 5, 2005, ''[[Austin Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Democrat"/&gt;  Baugh, who does not have an [[accredited]] degree, remains the director and main speaker for CEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/credentials.html | title=Some Questionable Creationist Credentials | publisher=[[talk.origins]]|date= May 31, 2002 | first=Brett | last=Vickers | accessdate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Baugh and Creation Evidence Museum were featured on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' where Baugh likened human history to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and the show poked fun at his claims about the  hyperbaric biosphere, pterodactyl expeditions, and dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="DailyShow"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=105921&amp;title=Tyrannosaurus-Redux | title=Tyrannosaurus Redux | publisher=[[The Daily Show]] |date=November 14, 2001 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creation Evidence Museum sponsors continuing [[paleontological]] and [[archaeological]] excavations among other research projects, including a hunt for living [[pterodactyls]] in [[Papua New Guinea]],&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/27/local/me-dinosaurs27 "Adam, Eve and T.

One of the museum's projects is a "[[hyperbaric chamber|hyperbaric]] [[biosphere]]", a chamber which the museum hopes will reproduce the atmospheric conditions that these creationists postulate for Earth before the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], and enable them to grow dinosaurs. Baugh says that these conditions made creatures [[Maximum life span|live longer]], and get [[Square-cube law#Biometrics|larger]], smarter and nicer.&lt;ref name="Roadside America"/&gt; He claims that tests under these conditions have tripled the lifespan of fruit-flies, and detoxified copperhead snakes. A much larger version is under construction in the new building.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"/&gt;

In 2008, a descendant of a family that provided many original Paluxy River dinosaur tracks in the 1930s claimed that her grandfather had faked many of them, including the [[Alvis Delk Cretaceous Footprint]].&lt;ref name="tracks"&gt;{{cite news | title=Human footprints beside dinosaur tracks? Let's talk| publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=August 10, 2008 | first=Bud | last=Kennedy |page = B02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zana Douglas, the granddaughter of George Adams, explained that during the 1930s depression her grandfather and other residents of Glen Rose made money by making [[moonshine]] and selling "dinosaur fossils".&lt;ref name="tracks"/&gt; The faux fossils brought $15 to $30 and when the supply ran low, they "just carved more, some with human footprints thrown in."&lt;ref name="tracks"/&gt;

* The "Fossilized Human Finger", a finger where tissues appear to have been [[Fossilized#Replacement and recrystallization|replaced]] by Cretaceous stone. The stone was not found in situ and according to Mark Isaak " looks remarkably similar in size and shape to the cylindrical sandstone infillings of Ophiomoipha or Thalassmoides shrimp burrows commonly found in Cretaceous rocks. Although its general shape is fingerlike, it has none of the fine structure one would expect from a finger."&lt;ref name="Isaak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaak|first1=Mark|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520249264|page=112|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dGFJXLEWogEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22Fossilized+Human+Finger%22,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYp-bs1r3MAhXLpx4KHRxOA-8Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fossilized%20Human%20Finger%22%2C&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "Meister Print", two [[trilobites]] in [[slate]] that appear to be crushed in a [[sandal]] print.

In 1982&amp;ndash;1984, several scientists, including J.R. Cole, L.R. Godfrey, R.J. Hastings, and [[Steven Schafersman]], examined Baugh's purported "mantracks" as well as others provided by creationists in Glen Rose. In the course of the examination "Baugh contradicted his own earlier reports of the locations of key discoveries" and many of the supposed prints "lacked characteristics of human footprints." After a three-year investigation of the tracks and Baugh's specimens, the scientists concluded there was no evidence for any of Baugh's claims or any "dinosaur-man tracks".&lt;ref name="NCSE-Examine"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/cej/5/1/introduction | title=Creation/Evolution | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=Winter 1985|issue=Issue 15 (Volume 5, Number 1) | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism from creationists ==
Young Earth creationist organizations such as [[Answers in Genesis]] and [[Creation Ministries International]] have criticized Baugh's claims saying he "muddied the water for many Christians ... People are being misled."&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt; Don Batten, of [[Creation Ministries International]] wrote: "Some Christians will try to use Baugh's 'evidences' in witnessing and get 'shot down' by someone who is scientifically literate.

'''Crustose''' is a [[Habit (biology)|habit]] of some types of [[algae]] and [[lichens]] in which the plant grows tightly [[appressed]] to a substrate, forming a biological layer of the adhering organism. ''Crustose'' adheres very closely to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]] at all points. ''Crustose'' is found on [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology Lab Manual 1110 |ISBN=9781285111230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of marine [[algae]] of the [[Rhodophyta]], in particular members of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Corallinales]], [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Corallinaceae]], subfamily [[Melobesioideae]] with cell walls containing [[calcium carbonate]] grow to great depths in the intertidal zone, forming crusts on various substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Phycology RELee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substrate can be rocks throughout the intertidal zone, or, as in the case of the Corallinales, reef-building [[coral reef|corals]], and other living organisms including plants, such as [[mangrove]]s and animals such as shelled [[mollusc]]s. The coralline red algae are major members of coral reef communities, cementing the corals together with their crusts. Among the [[brown algae]], the order [[Ralfsiales]] comprises two families of crustose algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lim | first=P.-E. |author2=M. Sakaguchi |author3=T. Hanyuda |author4=K.

==Growth and habitat==

Many [[lichen]]s grow close to the surface of rocks, tree trunks, and other substrata, and are referred to as crustose lichens. Crustose organisms can be detrimental to engineered structures when found on buildings, coastal structures, and ships.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There are different types of Crustose lichens, including endolithic, endophloidic and leprose. Endolithic lichens are immersed in the outer layer of rocks with their bodies above the surface. Endophloidic ones are located in or on plant tissue. Leprose lichens consist of crusts without a layered structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lichen Vocabulary|url=http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustose lichens have learned to adapt to their environment, with the shells helping with adaptation to dry and [[drought]] resistant climates. Crustose lichens have been found in deserts, ice free parts of Antarctica, and in the Alpine and Arctic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/144892/crustose-thallus|accessdate=16 May 2013|title=Crustose thallus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Crustose can come in a variety of colors such as yellow, orange, red, gray and green. These colors tend to be bright and vibrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lichen Biology|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/interesting/lichens/biology/growthforms.shtml|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Crustose is similar to other lichens because they share a similar internal morphology. The lichen's body is formed from filaments of the fungal partner. The density of these filaments determines the layers within the lichen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morphology of Lichens|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenmm.html|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Does God Play Dice: The New Mathematics of Chaos''''' is a non-fiction book about [[chaos theory]] written by British [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]. The book was initially published by [[Blackwell Publishing]] in 1989.

==Summary==
In this book, Stewart explains [[chaos theory]] to an audience presumably unfamiliar with it. As the book progresses the writing changes from simple explanations of chaos theory to in-depth, rigorous mathematical study. Stewart covers mathematical concepts such as [[differential equations]], [[resonance]], [[nonlinear dynamics]], and [[probability]]. The book is illustrated with diagrams and graphs of mathematical concepts and equations when applicable.

The back of the book, and a summary of its content, reads, "The science of chaos is forcing scientists to rethink Einstein's fundamental assumptions regarding the way the universe behaves. Chaos theory has already shown that simple systems, obeying precise laws, can nevertheless act in a random manner. Perhaps God plays dice within a cosmic game of complete law and order. Does God Play Dice? reveals a strange universe in which nothing may be as it seems. Familiar geometric shapes such as circles and ellipses give way to infinitely complex structures known as fractals, the fluttering of a butterfly's wings can change the weather, and the gravitational attraction of a creature in a distant galaxy can change the fate of the solar system."

The title of the book is a reference to a famous quote by [[Albert Einstein]].

'''Edwin Thomas Layton''' (April 7, 1903&amp;nbsp;– April 12, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi?surname=Layton&amp;given=Edwin "California Death Records search Results" ''rootsweb.ancestry.com''] April 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in the [[United States Navy]], who is most noted for his work as an intelligence officer during and before [[World War II]].

==Career==
Edwin Thomas Layton was born on April 7, 1903 in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] as a son of George E. Layton and his wife Mary C.Layton. Layton attended the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and graduated in 1924. Layton spent next five years with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] aboard the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|6}} and destroyer {{USS|Chase|DD-323|6}}.

In 1929, Layton was one of a small number of naval officers selected to go to [[Japan]] for language training.  Significantly, on his voyage to Japan he met another young naval officer, [[Joseph Rochefort|Joseph J. Rochefort]], assigned to the same duty.  Both became intelligence officers, Rochefort specializing in decryption efforts, Layton in using intelligence information in war planning.  Layton and Rochefort, both of whom were in [[Pearl Harbor]], worked closely together in the months before the attack, among other things trying to work out aspects of the larger international context which Washington had decided would be handled by Washington alone, and even more closely after the war began, especially in the month before the [[Battle of Midway]].  They both made signal contributions to that victory.

Layton was assigned to the American Embassy in Tokyo as a naval attaché where he remained for three years.  While in Japan, he met Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] on several occasions.  The last four months he spent in [[Beijing|Peiping]] (Beijing), China, as assistant naval attaché at the American Legation.

His linguistic ability and fluency in Japanese proved to be assets as his career progressed, even more so as World War II began in Europe.

During the 1930s, Layton served two tours of duty in the Navy Department's [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], in 1933 and again in from 1936 to 1937, but he also saw sea duty.  He had a three-year stint in the battleship [[Pennsylvania]] where he received commendations for gunnery excellence. In 1937, he returned to Tokyo for two years as assistant naval attaché at the American Embassy. This was followed by a one-year tour of duty as Commanding Officer of {{USS|Boggs|DD-136|6}} (AG-19).

Exactly one year to the day before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Layton became Combat Intelligence Officer on the staff of Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, which had recently been moved from its base in [[San Diego, California]] to Pearl Harbor&amp;nbsp;— over the objections of Admiral [[James O. Richardson]], whom Kimmel replaced.  Layton was in charge of all intelligence in the Pacific Ocean area.

==Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Midway==
Layton was a champion of using code-breaking information in war planning operations and had strong supporters in both Admiral Kimmel and Admiral Nimitz.

Layton's book describes how Kimmel and his army counterpart at Pearl Harbor, General [[Walter Short|Walter C. Short]], the commanders there, were scapegoats for failures by higher-ups in Washington, D.C.  Layton blames Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner]] in particular for monopolizing naval intelligence in Washington that would have alerted Kimmel and his staff to the imminence of attack and to the fact that Pearl Harbor could be a target of that attack.

Layton's argument is detailed and comprehensive, but in general, he maintains that although Washington was reading the highest level Japanese diplomatic code, [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]], little of this was ever made available to the field commanders, other than to [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] in the Philippines, who failed to act, not only on the Purple data, but even after he knew that Pearl Harbor had been attacked.  The diplomatic information that they were denied not only contained data about the imminence of war, but also included messages sent from Honolulu to Tokyo by [[Takeo Yoshikawa]], the spy sent to observe and report daily on the exact positions of ships in the harbor, using a grid system that was obviously designed for the purpose of targeting torpedoes and bombs.  Those above Turner, including his boss, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Stark]], and even General [[George Marshall|Marshall]], also come in for blame, though some details are still missing from the official record.

Forrest Biard, another naval linguist, one who was in the last group to be sent to Japan for language studies, worked for the Rochefort [[Station HYPO|HYPO]] team as soon as he left Japan in 1941.  HYPO was located in a basement, called "The Dungeon" by team members.  In a speech to the National Cryptologic Museum Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usspennsylvania.com/TheDungeon.htm "Text of Forrest Biard's Speech" ''usspennsylvania.com''] April 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Biard describes Layton as the sixth member of the five-member team ([[Joseph J. Rochefort]], Joe Finnegan, Alva B. Lasswell, Wesley A. Wright, Thomas Dyer) who produced the information that was vital to winning the [[Battle of Midway]], following the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].  He also characterizes Layton:

{{quote|Then there was a person&amp;nbsp;— a very special person&amp;nbsp;— who did not serve in the Dungeon with us but who deserves a very high ranking place in the list of five expanded to make it six. He, luckily, worked above ground in fresh Hawaiian air. He was another human dynamo, sharp, quick thinking, fast acting, intuitive, fast to comprehend, and extremely aggressive. In prior assignments he had been a Tokyo Japanese language student and later a code breaker. And, on December 31, he moved from Admiral Kimmel's staff to continue on as Admiral Nimitz's young intelligence officer. He was (Lieutenant) Commander Edwin T. Layton, Naval Academy Class of 1924. Layton and I found many intelligence interests in common having almost nothing to do with Dungeon work, so I came to know him very well and to appreciate fully his tremendous contributions to our results.

Joe Rochefort and Eddie Layton were close friends of long standing. They had studied the Japanese language together in Tokyo from 1929 to 1932. Here at Pearl Harbor they worked together in complete harmony, forming an almost perfect team. Rochefort gave Layton remarkably clear and reliable estimates and analyses. The quick-witted Layton might then add comments and suggestions or more analysis. After that he had to sell the final product to Admiral Nimitz. Thank Heavens a very hard-pressed Admiral Nimitz quickly learned to trust the Rochefort/Layton duo that brought him this very restricted, highly secret information which some others on his staff at first were prone to put down as guesswork&amp;nbsp;— even as dangerous guesswork.}}

During May 1942, in particular, Layton and the Rochefort team were battling Washington as much as the Japanese – both as to where the next attack would occur and as to when it would occur.  Washington said [[Port Moresby]] or the [[Aleutians]] in mid-June; Rochefort/Layton said Midway, first week in June.  The story of how Rochefort's team prevailed is told in the Rochefort article, and in much greater detail in Layton's book.  Nimitz deserves the highest praise for realizing that their analysis was sounder, something for which Layton deserves a very great deal of credit, and for risking the wrath of his boss in Washington, Admiral King, something for which Nimitz alone deserves a very great deal of credit.  (Selecting Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]] to replace the hospitalized Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.|Halsey]] was also the right move, as was the earlier decision to retain Kimmel's intelligence officers.)

Layton remained on the staff of the Pacific Fleet until February 1945, followed by a three-year tour of duty as Commander of the U.S. Naval Net Depot at Tiburon, California.  During this time, Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz|Nimitz]], as a mark of his recognition of Layton's contributions, invited him to Tokyo Bay when the Japanese formally surrendered on September 2, 1945.

Intelligence work occupied Layton again, in the form of a two-year assignment as the first Director of the Naval Intelligence School in Washington D.C.

==Korean War==
Starting in 1950, Layton spent six months as Intelligence Officer on the staff of the Commandant, Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii. His evaluative skills and keen interpretation of events were vital during the early stages of the conflict. In 1951, for a two-year period, he assumed his old position of Fleet Intelligence Officer on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet.

In 1953, with the war over, he was assigned to the staff of the Joint Chiefs where he was Assistant Director for Intelligence, then Deputy Director. His last duty before retirement was Director of the Naval Intelligence School at the Naval Receiving Station, Washington, D.C.

== Later life ==
Layton retired in 1959.  He went to work for the [[Northrop Corporation]] as Director of Far East Operations in Tokyo, Japan, 1959 to 1963.  He retired from Northrop in 1964 and moved to Carmel, California. Not until the 1980s were many of the documents about Pearl Harbor and Midway declassified.  His book, ''And I Was There: Pearl Harbor and Midway — Breaking the Secrets'' was written with co-authors Roger Pineau and John Costello and was published in 1985, the year after Layton died. As appears in the books' acknowledgments, his wife, Miriam, assisted the publication of the book by not only encouraging the admiral to bring his story to print, but also by giving his collaborators access to his research notes and papers after his death.

In an '''electron spectrometer''', an incoming beam of electrons is bent with electric or magnetic fields. As higher energy electrons will be bent less by the beam, this produces a spatially distributed range of energies.

Electron spectrometers are used on a range of scientific equipment, including [[particle accelerator]]s, [[transmission electron microscope]]s, and [[astronomical satellite]]s.

==Types==
An electrostatic electron spectrometer uses the electric field, which cause electrons to move along field gradients, whereas magnetic devices cause electrons to move at right angles to the field. Magnetic fields will act in a direction perpendicular to the electron propagation, thereby conserving velocity, whereas electrostatic fields will cause electrons to move along the field gradient,&lt;ref name="Zworykin45"/&gt; which may change electron energies if the component of the direction of propagation and field gradients are not perpendicular. Owing to these effects, sector based designs are commonly used in electron spectrometers.

==Construction==
The [[effective potential]] in the solution of motion in a magnetic or electric system with rotational symmetry leads to radial focusing onto a mean radius.&lt;ref name="Zworykin45"&gt;{{cite book | title=Electron optics and the electron microscope|author1=Zworykin,V |author2=Morton, G |author3=Ramberg, E |author4=Hillier J |author5=Vance A | year=1945|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; By superposition of a [[Quadrupole magnetic field|quadrupole field]] axial focusing is possible while weakening the radial focusing, until the [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]] vanishes. By breaking the rotational symmetry a bit and varying the electrostatic potential along the mean path of the [[spherical aberration]] is minimized.

The spectrometer can use entrance and exit slits or use a small source, which only emits into specific angle and a small detector. [[Photoelectron]] spectra from single crystals exhibit a dependency on the emission angle, so that the entrance slit is needed. All the electrons from an isotopic source may be sucked off and focused into a directed beam (much like in an [[electron gun]]), which can then be analyzed. A position sensitive detector can detect the energy along one direction and depending on the additional optics lateral resolution or one angle along the other direction.

Electrostatic spectrometers preserve the [[Spin polarization|spin]], which can be resolved afterwards.

'''''Equine herpesvirus 3''''' (EHV-3) is a [[virus]] of the family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'' that affects [[horse]]s.  It causes a disease known as '''equine coital exanthema'''.  The [[Equine Venereal Disease|disease]] is spread through direct and sexual contact and possibly through flies carrying infected vaginal discharge.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carter, G.R. |author2=Flores, E.F. |author3=Wise, D.J. |year=2006|title=Herpesviridae|work=A Concise Review of Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap11/chapter.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EHV-3 has an [[incubation period]] of as little as two days.&lt;ref name=Fenner_1993&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fenner, Frank J. |author2=Gibbs, E.

Lesions may also be seen on the lips and [[teat]]s.  Usually the only symptom seen is a decreased [[libido]] in stallions.  The lesions heal within two weeks.&lt;ref name=Fenner_1993/&gt;  As with other herpes viruses, the virus remains latent in the host for life.  Carrier animals can sometimes be identified by spots of pigment loss on black skin in the genital region.
EHV-3 is best prevented by taking note of present clinical signs and keeping infected horses isolated and breeding stock from sexual contact with other horses.  Antibiotic ointments should be used on the lesions to prevent secondary bacterial infections and hasten the healing process.  It is also important to use disposable gloves and instruments in veterinary exams as the virus can be spread by using contaminated equipment.

Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause "ripples" in space-time – distortions of space-time itself – which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.&lt;ref name ="renn"/&gt; It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of [[conservation of energy]]), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two [[compact star|compact objects]] such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Over a span of millions of years, [[binary star|binary neutron stars]], and [[binary black hole]]s lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they [[Orbital decay#Gravitational radiation|spiral in]] towards each other. At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld"/&gt; allowing a greater than usual chance for detection. However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors |journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity|Class.

====Indirect observation====
Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system [[PSR B1913+16]], in which one of the stars is a [[pulsar]] that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates. [[Russell Alan Hulse|Russell Hulse]] and [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.|Joseph Taylor]], who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weisberg |first=J.

====Direct observation====
{{main|Gravitational-wave observatory|LIGO}}
[[File:Northern leg of LIGO interferometer on Hanford Reservation.JPG|thumb|Northern arm of the LIGO Hanford [[Gravitational-wave observatory]].]]
Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth. A technique called [[interferometry]] was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.

In the present approach used by LIGO, a [[laser beam]] is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths. Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as "[[Beat (acoustics)|beats]]". Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths. In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4&amp;nbsp;km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time – a tiny fraction of the size of a single [[proton]] – as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere. This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]], [[GEO 600]] and planned [[KAGRA]] and [[INDIGO]] detectors. In practice at least two interferometers would be needed, because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both, allowing the sought-after signal to be distinguished from [[noise]]. This project was eventually founded in 1992 as the [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)]]. The original instruments were upgraded between 2010 and 2015 (to Advanced LIGO), giving an increase of around 10 times their original sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=LIGO Scientific Collaboration - FAQ; section: "Do we expect LIGO's advanced detectors to make a discovery, then?" and "What's so different about LIGO's advanced detectors?" |url=http://ligo.org/science/faq.php |accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIGO operates two [[Gravitational-wave observatory|gravitational-wave observatories]] in unison, located {{convert|3002|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart: the LIGO Livingston Observatory ({{Coord|30|33|46.42|N|90|46|27.27|W}}) in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], and the LIGO Hanford Observatory, on the [[Hanford Site|DOE Hanford Site]] ({{Coord|46|27|18.52|N|119|24|27.56|W|}}) near [[Richland, Washington]]. The tiny shifts in the length of their arms are continually compared and significant patterns which appear to arise synchronously are followed up to determine whether a gravitational wave may have been detected or if some other cause was responsible.

Initial LIGO operations between 2002 and 2010 did not detect any statistically significant events that could be confirmed as gravitational waves. This was followed by a multi-year shut-down while the detectors were replaced by much improved "Advanced LIGO" versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gravitational wave detection a step closer with Advanced LIGO |url=http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles/videos/ligo-hanford-spie-video |publisher=SPIE Newsroom |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In February 2015, the two advanced detectors were brought into engineering mode, in which the instruments are operating fully for the purpose of testing and confirming they are functioning correctly before being used for research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LIGO Hanford's H1 Achieves Two-Hour Full Lock |url=https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/feb_2015_news.html |date=February 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922064706/https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/feb_2015_news.html |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |access-date=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with formal science observations due to begin on 18 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Prospects for Observing and Localizing Gravitational-Wave Transients with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |date=2016 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1 |doi=10.1007/lrr-2016-1 |pmid=28179853 |pmc=5256041 |arxiv=1304.0670 |bibcode=2016LRR....19....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the development and initial observations by LIGO, several "blind injections" of fake gravitational wave signals were introduced to test the ability of the researchers to identify such signals. To protect the efficacy of blind injections, only four LIGO scientists knew when such injections occurred, and that information was revealed only after a signal had been thoroughly analyzed by researchers.&lt;ref name="firstperson" /&gt; On 14 September 2015, while LIGO was running in engineering mode but without any blind data injections, the instrument reported a possible gravitational wave detection. The detected event was given the name GW150914.&lt;ref name="Nature12Jan16" /&gt;

More detailed statistical analysis of the signal, and of 16 days of surrounding data from 12 September to 20 October 2015, identified GW150914 as a real event, with an estimated significance of at least [[Standard deviation|5.1 sigma]]&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"/&gt; or a [[confidence level]] of 99.99994%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/scientists-spot-the-gravity-waves-that-flex-the-universe/ |title=LIGO's First-Ever Detection of Gravitational Waves Opens a New Window on the Universe |author=Sarah Scoles |date=11 February 2016 |work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding wave peaks were seen at Livingston seven milliseconds before they arrived at Hanford.

At the time of the event, the [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo gravitational wave detector]] (near Pisa, Italy) was offline and undergoing an upgrade; had it been online it would likely have been sensitive enough to also detect the signal, which would have greatly improved the positioning of the event.&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt; [[GEO600]] (near [[Hannover]], Germany) was not sensitive enough to detect the signal.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; Consequently, neither of those detectors was able to confirm the signal measured by the LIGO detectors.&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt;

===Astrophysical origin===

The event happened at a [[luminosity distance]] of {{val|440|160|180}} [[megaparsec]]s&lt;ref name="Improved"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1606.01210 |title=An improved analysis of GW150914 using a fully spin-precessing waveform model |journal=Physical Review X |volume=6 |issue=4 |author=The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and The Virgo Collaboration |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.6.041014 |year=2016 |bibcode=2016PhRvX...6d1014A }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|6}} (determined by the amplitude of the signal),&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt; or {{val|1.4|0.6}} billion [[light year]]s, corresponding to a cosmological [[redshift]] of {{val|0.093|0.030|0.036}} (90% [[credible interval]]s). Analysis of the signal along with the inferred redshift suggested that it was produced by the merger of two [[black hole]]s with masses of {{val|35|5|3}} times and {{val|30|3|4}} times the mass of the [[Sun]] (in the source frame), resulting in a post-merger black hole of {{val|62|4|3}} solar masses.&lt;ref name="Improved"/&gt;{{Rp|6}} The [[mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]] of the missing {{val|3.0|0.5}} [[solar mass]]es was radiated away in the form of gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;

During the final 20 milliseconds of the merger, the power of the radiated gravitational waves peaked at about {{Val|3.6|e=49|u=watts}} or 526[[dBm]] – 50 times greater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12152347/Watch-live-Scientists-expected-to-announce-existence-of-Einsteins-gravitational-waves.html |title=Moment scientists reveal major gravitational wave finding |date=11 February 2016 |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the [[observable universe]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS2016-02-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drake"/&gt;

Across the 0.2-second duration of the detectable signal, the relative tangential (orbiting) velocity of the black holes increased from 30% to 60% of the [[speed of light]]. The orbital frequency of 75&amp;nbsp;Hz (half the gravitational wave frequency) means that the objects were orbiting each other at a distance of only 350&amp;nbsp;km by the time they merged. The [[phase (waves)|phase]] changes to the signal's [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] allowed calculation of the objects' orbital frequency, and taken together with the [[amplitude]] and pattern of the signal, allowed calculation of their masses and therefore their extreme final velocities and orbital separation (distance apart) when they merged. That information showed that the objects had to be black holes, as any other kind of known objects with these masses would have been physically larger and therefore merged before that point, or would not have reached such velocities in such a small orbit. The highest observed neutron star mass is two solar masses, with a conservative [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit|upper limit]] for the mass of a stable neutron star of three solar masses, so that a pair of neutron stars would not have had sufficient mass to account for the merger (unless exotic alternatives exist, for example, [[Exotic star#Boson stars|boson stars]]),&lt;ref name="Properties" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; while a black hole-[[neutron star]] pair would have merged sooner, resulting in a final orbital frequency that was not so high.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;

The decay of the waveform after it peaked was consistent with the damped oscillations of a black hole as it relaxed to a final merged configuration.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; Although the inspiral motion of compact binaries can be described well from [[Post-Newtonian expansion|post-Newtonian calculations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gravitational Radiation from Post-Newtonian Sources and Inspiralling Compact Binaries |first=Luc |last=Blanchet |journal=[[Living Reviews in Relativity]] |doi=10.12942/lrr-2014-2 |pmid=28179846 |pmc=5256563 |arxiv=1310.1528 |url=http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2014-2/ |year=2014 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=2 |accessdate=16 February 2016 |bibcode=2014LRR....17....2B}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong gravitational field merger stage can only be solved in full generality by large-scale [[numerical relativity]] simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campanelli |first1=Manuela |last2=Lousto |first2=Carlos |last3=Marronetti |first3=Pedro |last4=Zlochower |first4=Yosef |title=Accurate Evolutions of Orbiting Black-Hole Binaries without Excision |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.111101 |arxiv=gr-qc/0511048 |year=2006 |volume=96 |issue=11 |pmid=16605808 |journal=Phys.

===Location in the sky===
Gravitational wave instruments are whole-sky monitors with little ability to resolve signals spatially. A network of such instruments is needed to locate the source in the sky through [[triangulation]]. With only the two LIGO instruments in observational mode, GW150914's source location could only be confined to an arc on the sky. This was done via analysis of the {{val|6.9|0.5|0.4}} ms time-delay, along with amplitude and phase consistency across both detectors. This analysis produced a credible region of 150 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a probability of 50% or 610 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a probability of 90% located mainly in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]],&lt;ref name="Properties" /&gt;{{rp|7}}{{rp|fig 4}} in the rough direction of (but much farther than) the [[Magellanic Clouds]].&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naeye" /&gt;

For [[88 modern constellations by area|comparison, the area of the constellation]] [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is 594 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="RASCconstellations" /&gt;

===Coincident gamma-ray observation===
The [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] reported that its Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument detected a weak [[gamma-ray burst]] above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%.&lt;ref name="fermi_arxiv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fermi GBM Observations of LIGO Gravitational Wave event GW150914 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=826 |pages=L6 |arxiv=1602.03920 |first1=V. |last1=Connaughton |first2=E. |last2=Burns |first3=A. |last3=Goldstein |first4=M.

If the signal observed by the Fermi GBM was genuinely astrophysical, INTEGRAL would have indicated a clear detection at a significance of 15 sigma above background radiation.&lt;ref name="Integral"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''INTEGRAL'' upper limits on gamma-ray emission associated with the gravitational wave event GW150914 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first1=V. |last1=Savchenko |first2=C. |last2=Ferrigno |first3=S. |last3=Mereghetti |first4=L. |last4=Natalucci |first5=A. |last5=Bazzano |display-authors=etal |volume=820 |issue=2 |pages=L36|date=April 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/820/2/L36 |bibcode=2016ApJ...820L..36S |arxiv=1602.04180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AGILE (satellite)|AGILE]] space telescope also did not detect a gamma-ray counterpart of the event.&lt;ref name="AGILE_4Apr16" /&gt;

A follow-up analysis by an independent group, released in June 2016, developed a different statistical approach to estimate the spectrum of the gamma-ray transient. It concluded that Fermi GBM's data did not show evidence of a gamma ray burst, and was either background radiation or an Earth albedo transient on a 1-second timescale.&lt;ref name=siegel&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Ethan Siegel |last=Siegel |first=Ethan |date=3 June 2016 |title=NASA's Big Mistake: LIGO's Merging Black Holes Were Invisible After All |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/06/03/nasas-big-mistake-ligos-merging-black-holes-were-invisible-after-all/#12ddfea176e3 |newspaper=Forbes |access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greiner&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greiner |first1=J. |author-link1= |last2=Burgess |first2=J.M. |author-link2= |last3=Savchenko |first3=V. |author-link3= |last4=Yu |first4=H.-F. |author-link4= |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=827 |issue=2 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/827/2/L38 |arxiv=1606.00314 |title=On the GBM event seen 0.4 sec after GW 150914 |date=1 June 2016 |page=L38 |bibcode=2016ApJ...827L..38G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal of this follow-up analysis, however, pointed out that the independent group misrepresented the analysis of the original Fermi GBM Team paper and therefore misconstrued the results of the original analysis.

Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. [[Avi Loeb]] has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star's collapse it triggers a gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref name="fermi_woo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woo |first1=Marcus |title=LIGO's black holes may have lived and died inside a huge star |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077783-ligos-black-holes-may-have-lived-and-died-inside-a-huge-star/ |accessdate=17 February 2016 |work=New Scientist |date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loeb"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electromagnetic Counterparts to Black Hole Mergers Detected by LIGO |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first=Abraham |last=Loeb |volume=819 |issue=2 |pages=L21 |date=March 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/819/2/L21 |bibcode=2016ApJ...819L..21L |arxiv=1602.04735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRB on BBH"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gough |first=Evan |url=http://www.universetoday.com/127463/did-a-gamma-ray-burst-accompany-ligos-gravitational-wave-detection/ |title=Did a Gamma Ray Burst Accompany LIGO’s Gravity Wave Detection? |work=Universe Today |date=18 February 2016 |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconstructed source area was targeted by follow-up observations covering [[Radio astronomy|radio]], [[Visible light astronomy|optical]], [[Infrared astronomy|near infra-red]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]], and [[Gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]] wavelengths along with searches for coincident [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="Properties" /&gt; However, because LIGO had not yet started its science run, notice to other telescopes was delayed.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] telescope detected no neutrino candidates within ±500 seconds of GW150914. The [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] detected three neutrino candidates within ±500 seconds of GW150914. One event was found in the southern sky and two in the northern sky. This was consistent with the expectation of background detection levels. None of the candidates were compatible with the 90% confidence area of the merger event.&lt;ref name="LIGO-P1500271"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500271/public/main |title=High-energy Neutrino follow-up search of Gravitational Wave Event GW150914 with ANTARES and IceCube |date=12 February 2016 |access-date= |website= |publisher=LIGO |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165041/https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500271/public/main |archivedate=15 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no neutrinos were detected, the lack of such observations provided a limit on neutrino emission from this type of gravitational wave event.&lt;ref name="LIGO-P1500271"/&gt;

In May 2016, the full collaboration, and in particular [[Ronald Drever]], Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss, received the [[Fundamental Physics Prize|Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]] for the observation of gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/science/ligo-gravitational-wave-breakthrough-prize-yuri-milner.html |title=LIGO Gravitational Wave Researchers to Divide $3 Million |first1=Dennis |last1=Overbye |date=3 May 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever, Thorne, Weiss, and the LIGO discovery team also received the [[Gruber Prize in Cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gruber.yale.edu/prize/2016-gruber-cosmology-prize |title=2016 Gruber Cosmology Prize |website=[[Gruber Foundation]] |access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever, Thorne, and Weiss were also awarded the 2016 [[Shaw Prize]] in Astronomy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&amp;twoid=102 |title=Shaw Laureates 2016 |work=The Shaw Prize Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caltech.edu/news/2016-shaw-prize-awarded-ligo-founders-50845 |title=2016 Shaw Prize Awarded to LIGO Founders |website=[[Caltech]] News |first=Whitney |last=Clavin |date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 [[Kavli Prize]] in Astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-06/b-9sp060116.php |title=Nine scientific pioneers to receive the 2016 Kavli Prizes |date=2 June 2016 |website=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] EurekAlert! |access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish was awarded the 2016 [[Enrico Fermi Prize]] from the [[Italian Physical Society]] (Società Italiana di Fisica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Enrico Fermi Prize |url=http://www.primapagina.sif.it/article/466/il-premio-fermi-2016-alle-onde-gravitazionali |website=[[Italian Physical Society|Società Italiana di Fisica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, LIGO spokesperson [[Gabriela González]] and the LIGO team were awarded the 2017 [[Bruno Rossi Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aas.org/posts/news/2017/01/aas-announces-recipients-2017-prizes-and-awards |title=AAS Announces Recipients of 2017 Prizes and Awards |date=9 January 2017 |website=[[American Astronomical Society]] |access-date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne "for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2017 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |date=3 October 2017 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The observation was heralded as inaugurating a revolutionary era of [[gravitational-wave astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Black Holes, Cosmic Collisions and the Rippling of Spacetime"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/black-holes-cosmic-collisions-and-the-rippling-of-spacetime/ |title=Black Holes, Cosmic Collisions and the Rippling of Spacetime |work=Scientific American |last=Mack |first=Katie |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this detection, astrophysicists and cosmologists were able to make observations based upon [[electromagnetic radiation]] (including visible light, X-rays, microwave, radio waves, gamma rays) and particle-like entities ([[cosmic ray]]s, [[stellar wind]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and so on). These have significant limitations - light and other radiation may not be emitted by many kinds of objects, and can also be obscured or hidden behind other objects. Objects such as galaxies and nebulae can also absorb, re-emit, or modify light generated within or behind them, and [[compact star]]s or [[exotic star]]s may contain material which is dark and radio silent, and as a result there is little evidence of their presence other than through their gravitational interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gravitational wave astronomy |url=http://www.einstein-online.info/elementary/gravWav/gw_astronomy |website=Einstein Online |publisher=[[Max Planck Society]] |year=2016 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gravitational wave astronomy |first1=Jordan B. |last1=Camp |first2=Neil J. |last2=Cornish |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |publication-date=December 2004 |volume=54 |pages=525–577 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181251 |bibcode=2004ARNPS..54..525C|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expectations for detection of future binary merger events===
On 15 June 2016, the [[LIGO]] group announced an observation of another gravitational wave signal, named [[GW151226]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last=Abbott |first=B. P. |date=15 June 2016 |title=GW151226: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a 22-Solar-Mass Binary Black Hole Coalescence |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=116 |issue=24 |pages=241103 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241103 |pmid=27367379 |arxiv=1606.04855 |bibcode=2016PhRvL.116x1103A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advanced LIGO is predicted to detect five more black hole mergers like GW150914 in its next observing campaign, and then 40 binary star mergers each year, in addition to an unknown number of more exotic gravitational wave sources, some of which may not be anticipated by current theory.&lt;ref name="Naeye" /&gt;

Planned upgrades are expected to double the [[signal-to-noise]] ratio, expanding the volume of space in which events like GW150914 can be detected by a factor of ten. Additionally, Advanced Virgo, [[KAGRA]], and a possible third LIGO detector in India will extend the network and significantly improve the position reconstruction and parameter estimation of sources.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;

[[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (LISA) is a proposed space based observation mission to detect gravitational waves. With the proposed sensitivity range of LISA, merging binaries like GW150914 would be detectable about 1000 years before they merge, providing for a class of previously unknown sources for this observatory if they exist within about 10 megaparsecs.&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt; [[LISA Pathfinder]], LISA's technology development mission, was launched in December 2015 and it demonstrated that the LISA mission is feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LISA Pathfinder exceeds expectations |publisher=elisascience.org |url=https://www.elisascience.org/news/top-news/lisa-pathfinder-exceeds-expectations |date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124722/https://www.elisascience.org/news/top-news/lisa-pathfinder-exceeds-expectations |archive-date=3 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A current model predicts LIGO will detect approximately 1000 black hole mergers per year after it reaches full sensitivity planned for 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Lessons for stellar evolution and astrophysics===
The masses of the two pre-merger black holes provide information about [[stellar evolution]]. Both black holes were more massive than previously discovered [[stellar black hole|stellar-mass black holes]], which were inferred from [[X-ray binary]] observations. This implies that the [[stellar wind]]s from their progenitor stars must have been relatively weak, and therefore that the [[metallicity]] (mass fraction of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) must have been less than about half the solar value.&lt;ref name="astrophysics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Astrophysical implications of the binary black-hole merger GW150914 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |date=20 February 2016 |volume=818 |issue=2 |pages=L22 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/818/2/L22 |arxiv=1602.03846 |bibcode=2016ApJ...818L..22A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the pre-merger black holes were present in a [[binary star]] system, as well as the fact that the system was compact enough to merge within the age of the universe, constrains either binary star evolution or [[Stellar dynamics|dynamical formation]] scenarios, depending on how the black hole binary was formed. A significant number of black holes must receive low [[Stellar black hole#Black hole kicks|natal kicks]] (the velocity a black hole gains at its formation in a [[core-collapse supernova]] event), otherwise the black hole forming in a binary star system would be ejected and an event like GW would be prevented.&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt; The survival of such binaries, through common envelope phases of high rotation in massive progenitor stars, may be necessary for their survival.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} The majority of the latest black hole model predictions comply with these added constraints.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The discovery of the GW merger event increases the lower limit on the rate of such events, and rules out certain theoretical models that predicted very low rates of less than 1&amp;nbsp;Gpc&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (one event per cubic gigaparsec per year).&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt; Analysis resulted in lowering the previous upper limit rate on events like GW150914 from ~140&amp;nbsp;Gpc&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to {{val|17|39|13}}&amp;nbsp;Gpc&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="BlackHoleRate" /&gt;

===Impact on future cosmological observation===
Measurement of the waveform and amplitude of the gravitational waves from a black hole merger event makes accurate determination of its distance possible. The accumulation of black hole merger data from cosmologically distant events may help to create more precise models of the history of the expansion of the universe and the nature of the [[dark energy]] that influences it.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/weve-detected-gravitational-waves-so-what-160213.htm |title=We've Detected Gravitational Waves, So What? |last=O'Neill |first=Ian |date=13 February 2016 |website=News.Discovery.com |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC |access-date=20 February 2016 |quote=We will be able to measure the rate the universe is expanding, or how much dark energy there is in the universe to extraordinary precision}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cooper2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/jan/21/are-gravitational-waves-being-redshifted-away-by-the-cosmological-constant |title=Are gravitational waves being 'redshifted' away by the cosmological constant? |last=Cooper |first=Keith |date=21 February 2016 |website=PhysicsWorld.com |publisher=Institute of Physics |access-date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Recombination (cosmology)|earliest universe]] is opaque since the cosmos was so energetic then that most matter was ionized and photons were scattered by free electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_tests_cmb.html |title=Tests of Big Bang: The CMB |publisher=NASA |date=5 December 2014 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this opacity would not affect gravitational waves from that time, so if they occurred at levels strong enough to be detected at this distance, it would allow a window to observe the cosmos beyond the current [[visible universe]]. Gravitational-wave astronomy therefore may some day allow direct observation of the earliest [[chronology of the universe|history of the universe]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-A" /&gt;

===Tests of general relativity===
{{main|Tests of general relativity}}
The inferred fundamental properties, mass and spin, of the post-merger black hole were consistent with those of the two pre-merger black holes, following the predictions of general relativity.&lt;ref name="Pretorius2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CampanelliLousto2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BakerCentrella2006" /&gt; This is the first test of general relativity in the very [[Tests of general relativity#Strong field tests: Binary pulsars|strong-field regime]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Benjamin P.|year=2016|title=Tests of general relativity with GW150914|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/56932/|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=116|issue=221101|pages=221101|arxiv=1602.03841|bibcode=2016PhRvL.116v1101A|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.221101|pmid=27314708|collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration}}&lt;!--|access-date=3 June 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence could be established against the predictions of general relativity.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;

The opportunity was limited in this signal to investigate the more complex general relativity interactions, such as tails produced by interactions between the gravitational wave and curved space-time background. Although a moderately strong signal, it is much smaller than that produced by binary-pulsar systems. In the future stronger signals, in conjunction with more sensitive detectors, could be used to explore the intricate interactions of gravitational waves as well as to improve the constraints on deviations from general relativity.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;

===Speed of gravitational waves and limit on possible mass of graviton===
The speed of gravitational waves ('''''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''''') is predicted by general relativity to be the speed of light ('''''c'''''){{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The extent of any deviation from this relationship can be parameterized in terms of the mass of the hypothetical [[graviton]]. The graviton is the name given to an [[elementary particle]] that would act as the [[force carrier]] for gravity, in [[quantum gravity|quantum theories about gravity]]. It is expected to be massless if, as it appears, gravitation has an infinite range. (This is because the more massive a [[gauge boson]] is, the shorter is the range of the associated force; as with the infinite range of [[electromagnetism]], which is due to the massless [[photon]], the infinite range of gravity implies that any associated force-carrying particle would also be massless.) If the graviton were not massless, gravitational waves would propagate below lightspeed, with lower frequencies ('''''ƒ''''') being slower than higher frequencies, leading to dispersion of the waves from the merger event.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt; No such dispersion was observed.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld" /&gt; The observations of the inspiral slightly improve (lower) the upper limit on the mass of the graviton from Solar System observations to {{val|2.1|e=-58|u=kg}}, corresponding to {{val|1.2|e=-22|u=[[Electronvolt|eV]]/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or a [[Compton wavelength]] ('''''λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''''') of greater than {{10^|13}} km, roughly 1 light-year.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt; Using the lowest observed frequency of 35&amp;nbsp;Hz, this translates to a lower limit on '''''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''''' such that the upper limit on '''1-''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' /''c''''' is ~&amp;nbsp;{{val|4|e=-19}}.{{refn|group=note|1=Based on &lt;math&gt;v_g^2/c^2 = 1-\tfrac{c^2}{\lambda_g^2 f^2}&lt;/math&gt;, obtainable from the "Tests of general relativity ..." paper (p. 13, "Thus, we have...") and the [[Planck–Einstein relation]].&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;}}

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Green to Gold'' (book)}}
'''''Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage''''' is a 2006 book on [[sustainability]] by [[Daniel C. Esty]] and Andrew S. Winston and published by [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bill Birchard|title=Merchants of Virtue: Herman Miller and the Making of a Sustainable Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmXuBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|date=11 October 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-51239-0|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book argues that pollution control and natural resource management have become critical elements of marketplace success and explains how leading-edge companies have folded environmental thinking into their core business strategies.

The '''history of metamaterials''' begins with [[artificial dielectrics]] in [[microwave engineering]] as it developed just after [[History of radar|World War II]]. Yet, there are seminal explorations of artificial materials for manipulating [[electromagnetic wave]]s at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=ramsay&gt;

Hence, the history of metamaterials is essentially a history of developing certain types of manufactured materials, which interact at [[radio frequency]], [[microwave]], and later [[photonics|optical frequencies]].&lt;ref name=Pekka-Ikonen/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicsengineering1/&gt;

As the science of materials has advanced, [[photonics|photonic materials]] have been developed which use the [[photon]] of [[light]] as the fundamental carrier of information. This has led to [[photonic crystal]]s, and at the beginning of the new millennium, the [[proof of principle]] for functioning [[NIMs|metamaterials]] with a negative [[index of refraction]] in the [[microwave|microwave range]] at 10.5 [[Gigahertz]]. This was followed by the first proof of principle for [[metamaterial cloaking]] (shielding an object from view), also in the microwave range, about six years later.&lt;ref name=smith-works/&gt; However, a cloak that can conceal objects across the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] is still decades away. Many [[physics]] and [[engineering]] problems need to be solved.

Nevertheless, [[negative refractive materials]] have led to the development of [[metamaterial antennas]] and [[Metamaterial antennas#Metamaterial microwave lens|metamaterial microwave lens]]es for [[Metamaterial antennas|miniature wireless system antennas]] which are more efficient than their conventional counterparts. Also, metamaterial antennas are now commercially available. Meanwhile, [[subwavelength]] focusing with the [[superlens]] is also a part of present-day metamaterials research.&lt;ref name=smith-works/&gt;

==Early wave studies==
[[File:Onde electromagnetique.svg|thumb|300px|[[Electromagnetic wave]]s are formed by the vibrations of [[electric field]]s and [[magnetic field]]s. These fields are [[perpendicular]] to one another in the direction the wave is traveling. Once formed, this energy travels at the [[speed of light]] until further interaction with matter. The electric field is in a vertical plane and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane. The two types of fields in electromagnetic waves are always in phase with each other.&lt;ref name=anatomyof&gt;Anatomy of an Electromagnetic Wave. Mission Science. NASA. [http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/02_anatomy.html Public domain material copied from NASA website]. Accessdate 2013-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Wave|Classical wave]]s transfer [[energy]] without transporting [[matter]] through the medium (material). For example, waves in a pond do not carry the water molecules from place to place; rather the wave's energy travels through the water, leaving the water molecules in place. Additionally, charged particles, such as [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s create electromagnetic fields when they move, and these fields transport the type of energy known as electromagnetic radiation, or light. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and vice versa—the two are linked. These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.&lt;ref name=anatomyof/&gt;

The "''history of metamaterials''" can have a variety starting points depending on the properties of interest. Related early [[wave|wave studies]] started in 1904 and progressed through more than half of the first part of the twentieth century. This early research included the relationship of the [[phase velocity]] to [[group velocity]] and the relationship of the [[wave vector]] and [[Pointing vector]].&lt;ref name=klar-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodina/&gt;&lt;ref name=PenSmi/&gt;

In 1904 the possibility of negative [[phase velocity]] accompanied by an [[Antiparallel (mathematics)|anti-parallel]]  group velocity were noted by [[Horace Lamb]] (book: ''Hydrodynamics'') and [[Arthur Schuster]] (Book: ''Intro to Optics'').&lt;ref name=slyusarmeta&gt;Slyusar V.I. Metamaterials on antenna solutions.// 7th International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques ICATT’09, Lviv, Ukraine, October 6–9, 2009.  pp. 19–24 [http://www.slyusar.kiev.ua/019_024_ICATT_2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However both thought practical achievement of these phenomena were not possible. In 1945 [[Leonid Mandelstam]] (also "Mandel'shtam") studied the anti-parallel phase and group advance in more detail.&lt;ref name=slyusarmeta/&gt; He is also noted for examining the electromagnetic characteristics of materials demonstrating negative refraction, as well as the first [[left-handed material]] concept.  &lt;!--in his "lecture notes [17, 18] pointed out that waves would refract negatively at an interface boundary between a regular and a backward-wave
medium".&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.compumag.org/jsite/images/stories/newsletter/ICS-07-14-3-Igor.pdf The Anatomy of Negative Refraction]&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt; These studies included negative group velocity. He reported that such phenomena occurs in a [[crystal lattice]]. This may be considered significant because the metamaterial is a man made crystal lattice (structure).&lt;ref name=klar-1&gt;

V.E. Pafomov (1959), and  several years later, the research team V.M. Agranovich and V.L. Ginzburg (1966) reported the repercussions of negative [[permittivity]], negative [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], and negative group velocity in their study of crystals and [[exciton]]s.&lt;ref name=klar-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodina/&gt;

[[Victor Veselago|V.G. Veselago's]] 1967 paper is considered the theoretical work that began metamaterial research.&lt;ref name=slyusarmeta/&gt; However, physical experimentation did not occur until 33 years after the paper's publication due to lack of available materials and lack of sufficient computing power. It was not until the 1990s that materials and computing power became available to artificially produce the necessary structures. Veselago also predicted a number of [[physics|electromagnetic phenomena]] that would be reversed including the [[refractive index]]. In addition, he is credited with coining the term "left handed material" for the present day metamaterial because of the anti-parallel behavior of the [[wave vector]] and other [[electromagnetic field]]s. Moreover, he noted that the material he was studying was a double negative material, as certain metamaterials are named today, because of the ability to simultaneously produce negative values for two important parameters, e.g. permitivity and permeability.  In 1968, his paper was translated and published in English.&lt;ref name=PenSmi&gt;He is often credited with inventing the modern day electromagnetic metamaterials as a result of his seminal 1967/68 report.

==Early electromagnetic media==
[[File:Bose's demnstrated apparatus.gif|thumb|325px|[[Jagadish Chandra Bose|Bose's]] apparatus demonstrated at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1897. A schematic diagram—the [[waveguide|waveguide radiator]] is affixed on top of the [[transmitter]]  at left. In addition, a [[horn antenna|pyramidal electromagnetic horn antenna]] is first used by Bose. This horn antenna acts as a "collecting funnel" for the electromagnetic radiation of interest.]]

In the 19th century [[Maxwell's equations]] united all previous observations, experiments, and [[theories|established propositions]] pertaining to [[electric field|electricity]] and [[magnetic field|magnetism]] into a consistent theory, which is also fundamental to [[optics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Electromagnetism, Maxwell's Equations, and Microwaves| url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Electromagnetism |accessdate=2011-06-20 |publisher= IEEE History Center |year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's work demonstrated that electricity, magnetism and even light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon, namely the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nahin, P.J.|journal=IEEE Spectrum|volume =29|issue =3|year=1992|page=45|doi=10.1109/6.123329|title=Maxwell's grand unification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the concept of using certain  constructed materials as a method for manipulating [[electromagnetic wave]]s dates back to the 19th century. [[Microwave|Microwave theory]] had developed significantly during the latter part of the 19th century with the cylindrical [[parabolic reflector]], [[dielectric lens]], [[microwave absorbers]], the [[cavity radiator]], the [[radiating iris]], and the [[horn antenna|pyramidal electromagnetic horn]].&lt;ref name=ramsay/&gt;
The science involving microwaves also included round, square, and rectangular [[waveguides]] precluding Sir Rayleigh's published work on waveguide operation in 1896. Microwave optics, involving the focusing of microwaves, introduced [[quasi-optical]] components, and a treatment of microwave optics was published in 1897 (by Righi).&lt;ref name=physicsengineering1/&gt;&lt;ref name=JC-Bose-honored&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Emerson| first =D.T.| title =The work of Jagadis Chandra Bose: 100 years of millimeter-wave research |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques |volume=45 |page=2267 |date =December 1997 |doi=10.1109/22.643830 |bibcode=1997ITMTT..45.2267E |issue=12}} A facility of the NSF provides added material to the original paper – [http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/~demerson/bose/bose.pdf The work of Jagadish Chandra Bose: 100 years of milmeter wave research].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JC-Bose-paper&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Bose| first =Jagadis Chunder| authorlink =Jagadish Chandra Bose| title =On the Rotation of Plane of Polarisation of Electric Waves by a Twisted Structure| journal =Proceedings of the Royal Society| volume = 63| pages =146–152| date =1898-01-01| format=PDF download is available by clicking on the link.

===Jagadish Chandra Bose===
[[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] was a scientist involved in original [[microwave|microwave research]] during the 1890s. As officiating professor of physics at [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] he involved himself with laboratory experiments and studies involving [[refraction]], [[diffraction]] and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], as well as [[transmitter]]s, receivers and various microwave components.&lt;ref name=Bose-60Hz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets-lindgren.com/pdf/BriefHistoryOfHornAntennas.pdf Bose's horn operated in the millimetre wave range]. ''IN Compliance''. Magazine article. November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He connected [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s to a sensitive [[galvanometer]], and developed [[crystals]] to be used as a receiver. The crystals operated in the [[shortwave radio]] range. Crystals were also developed to detect both [[light|white]] and [[ultraviolet light]]. These crystals were patented in 1904 for their capability to detect [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Furthermore, it appears that his work also anticipated the existence of [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] and [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] semiconductors by 60 years.&lt;ref name=Bose-60Hz/&gt;

==Early chiral media==
In 1898, Jagadish Chandra Bose conducted the first [[microwave]] experiment on twisted structures. These twisted structures match the geometries that are known as artificial [[chirality|chiral media]] in today's terminology. By this time, he had also researched [[double refraction]] (birefringence) in crystals. Other research included [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of [[electric field|electric field "waves"]] that crystals produce. He discovered this type of polarization in other materials including a class of [[dielectric]]s.&lt;ref name=physicsengineering1&gt;{{cite book

In addition, [[chirality]] as optical activity in a given material is a phenomenon that has been studied since the 19th century. By 1811, a study of [[quartz]] crystals revealed that such [[crystaline solid]]s rotate the polarization of [[polarized light]] denoting optical activity. By 1815, materials other than crystals, such as oil of turpentine were known to exhibit chirality. However, the basic cause was not known. [[Louis Pasteur]] solved the problem (chirality of the molecules) originating a new discipline known as [[stereochemistry]]. At the [[macroscopic]] scale, Lindman applied microwaves to the problem with wire spirals (wire helices) in 1920 and 1922.&lt;ref name=jaggard&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00934418|title=On electromagnetic waves in chiral media|year=1979|last1=Jaggard|first1=D.L.|last2=Mickelson|first2=A.R.|last3=Papas|first3=C.H.|journal=Applied Physics|volume=18|issue=2|page=211|bibcode = 1979ApPhy..18..211J |url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA103051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elezzabi&gt;(see abstract){{cite journal

==20th century artificial dielectrics==
[[File:3-D view of parallel plate lens-b.png|thumb|This "lens" converts the input spherical [[microwave radiation]] into parallel (collimated) lines in a given direction at the exit side of the [[microwave lens]].

Much of the historic research related to [[metamaterial]]s is weighted from the view of [[radiation pattern|antenna beam shaping]] within [[microwave engineering]] just after World War II. Furthermore, metamaterials appear to be historically linked to the body of research pertaining to [[artificial dielectrics]] throughout the late 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s.  The most common use for artificial dielectrics throughout prior decades has been in the [[microwave]] regime for antenna [[Radiation pattern|beam shaping]]. The artificial dielectrics had been proposed as a low cost and lightweight "tool". Research on artificial dielectrics, other than metamaterials, is still ongoing for pertinent parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;ref name=Pekka-Ikonen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eleftheriades-book&gt;

Pioneering works in microwave engineering on artificial dielectrics in microwave were produced by [[Winston E. Kock]], Seymour Cohn, John Brown, and [[Walter Rotman]]. ''Periodic'' artificial structures were proposed by Kock, Rotman, and [[Sergei Schelkunoff]]. There is also an extensive reference list that is focused on the properties of artificial dielectrics in the 1990 book,  '' Field theory of guided waves''  by R.E. Collin.&lt;ref name=Pekka-Ikonen/&gt;&lt;ref name=George-E/&gt;&lt;ref name=WK-Mwave-lens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rmn-MW-lens/&gt;

* Quote from abstract: "''The number of proposals for practical microwave and optical applications benefiting from the properties of [novel materials] is increasing rapidly. However, the utilization of artificial materials in microwave engineering is not a new concept. The purpose of this short report is to revisit some of the most important early contributions that have led to the utilization of artificial dielectrics and magnetics in microwave applications.''"&lt;/ref&gt;
"Magnetic particles made of capacitively loaded loops were also suggested by Sergei Schelkunoff in 1952 (who was a senior colleague of Winston Kock at
Bell Labs at the time). However, Schelkunoff suggested these particles as a means of synthesizing high permeability (and not negative) values
but he recognized that such high permeability artificial dielectrics would be quite dispersive."&lt;ref name=George-E/&gt;

W.E. Kock proposed metallic and wire lenses for antennas. Some of these are the metallic delay lens, parallel-wire lens, and the wire mesh lens. In addition, he conducted analytical studies regarding the response of customized metallic particles to a [[Quasistatic approximation|quasistatic]] electromagnetic radiation. As with the current large group of researchers conveying the behavior of metamaterials, Kock noted behaviors and structure in artificial materials that are similar to metamaterials.&lt;ref name=George-E&gt;

  | quote =Lens antennas for microwave applications are described which produce a focusing effect by physically increasing the path lengths, compared to free space, of radio waves passing through the lens. This is accomplished by means of baffle plates which extend parallel to the magnetic vector, and which are either tilted or bent into serpentine shape so as to force the waves to travel the longer-inclined or serpentine path. The three-dimensional contour of the plate array is shaped to correspond to a convex lens. The advantages over previous metallic lenses are: broader band performance, greater simplicity, and less severe tolerances.

With artificial dielectrics Kock was able to see that any value for permittivity and permeability, arbitrarily large or small, can be achieved, and that this included the possibility of negative values for these parameters.  The optical properties of the medium depended solely on the particles’ geometrical shape and spacing, rather than on their own intrinsic behavior. His work also anticipated the [[split-ring resonator]], a fabricated periodic structure that is a common workhorse for metamaterials.&lt;ref name=UnivSurrey/&gt;

Kock, however, did not investigate the simultaneous occurrence of negative values of ε and μ, which has become one of the first achievements defining modern metamaterials. This was because research in artificial materials was oriented toward other goals, such as creating  plasma media at RF or microwave frequencies related to the overarching needs of  NASA and the space program at that time.&lt;ref name=UnivSurrey&gt;

The word 'photonics' appeared in the late 1960s to describe a research field whose goal was to use light to perform functions that traditionally fell within the typical domain of electronics, such as telecommunications, information processing, among other processes.&lt;ref name=Talton/&gt; The term ''photonics'' more specifically connotes:
* The particle properties of light,
* The potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons,
* The practical application of optics, and
* An analogy to [[electronics]].&lt;ref name=Talton/&gt;

Hence, as photonic materials are used, the photons, rather than electrons, become the fundamental carriers of information. Furthermore, the photon appears to be a more effiecient carrier of information, and materials that can process photonic signals are both in use and in further development. Additionally, developing photonic materials will lead to further miniaturization of components.&lt;ref name=Talton&gt;

In 1987 [[Eli Yablonovitch]] proposed controlling spontaneous emissions and constructing physical zones in periodic dielectrics that forbid certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. These capabilities would be built into three-dimensional periodic dielectric structures (artificial dielectric). He noted that controlling spontaneous emission is desirable for semiconductor processes.&lt;ref name=EYab-87&gt;

==Exceptional phenomena==

===Invention of the metamaterial===
Historically, and conventionally, the function or behavior of materials can be altered through their [[chemistry]]. This has long been known. For example, adding [[lead]] changes the color or hardness of [[glass]]. However, at the end of the 20th century this description was expanded by [[John Pendry]],  a [[physicist]] from [[Imperial College]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/&gt;  In the 1990s he was consulting for a British company, ''Marconi Materials Technology'', as a [[condensed matter physics]] expert. The company manufactured a [[stealth technology]] made of a radiation-absorbing [[carbon]] that was for [[naval vessel]]s. However, the company did not understand the [[physics]] of the material. The company asked Pendry if he could understand how the material worked.&lt;ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/&gt;

Pendry discovered that the [[Physical property|radiation absorption]] property did not come from the [[molecular]] or [[chemical structure]] of the material, i.e. the carbon per se. This property came from the long and thin, physical shape of the [[carbon fiber]]s. He realized rather than conventionally altering a material through its chemistry, as lead does with glass, the behavior of a material can be altered by changing a material’s internal structure on a very fine scale. The very fine scale was less than the [[wavelength]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] that is applied. The theory applies across the electromagnetic spectrum that is in use by today's technologies.

Hence, the Greek word "meta" was attached, and these are called [[metamaterials]].&lt;ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/&gt;

After successfully deducing and realizing the carbon fiber structure, Pendry further proposed that he try to change the [[magnetic properties]] of a non-magnetic material, also by altering its physical structure. The material would not be intrinsically magnetic, nor inherently susceptible to being magnetized. [[Copper wire]] is such a non-magnetic material. He envisioned fabricating a non-magnetic composite material, which could mimic the movements of electrons orbiting atoms. However, the structures are fabricated on a scale that is magnitudes larger than the atom, yet smaller than the radiated wavelength.

He envisioned and [[hypothesize]]d miniature loops of copper wire set in a [[fiberglass]] substrate could mimic the action of electrons but on a larger scale. Furthermore, this [[composite material]] could act like a slab of [[iron]].  In addition, he  deduced that a current run through the loops of wire results in a [[magnetic permeability|magnetic response]].&lt;ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |last2=Grant |first2=Andrew |title=Metamaterial Revolution: The New Science of Making Anything Disappear |magazine=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |date=April 2009 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/apr/10-metamaterial-revolution-new-science-making-anything-disappear |access-date=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This metamaterial idea resulted in variations. Cutting the loops results in a magnetic resonator, which acts like a switch. The switch, in turn, would allow Pendry to determine or alter the magnetic properties of the material simply by choice. At the time, Pendry didn't realize the significance of the two materials he had engineered. By combining the electrical properties of Marconi’s radar-absorbing material with his new man-made magnetic material he had unwittingly placed in his hands a new way to manipulate electromagnetic radiation.  In 1999, Pendry published his new conception of artificially produced magnetic materials in a notable physics journal. This was read by scientists all over the world, and it "stoked their imagination".&lt;ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=u-eff-01&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pendry |first=John B. |author2=A.J.

===Negative refractive index===
In 1967, [[Victor Veselago]] produced an often cited, seminal work on a theoretical material that could produce extraordinary effects that are difficult or impossible to produce in nature. At that time he proposed that a reversal of [[Snell's law]], an [[Superlens|extraordinary lens]], and other exceptional phenomena  can occur within the [[laws of physics]]. This theory lay dormant for a few decades. There were no materials available in nature, or otherwise, that could physically realize Veselago's analysis.&lt;ref name=smith-works/&gt;&lt;ref name=Veselago1&gt;

However, there were certain observations, demonstrations, and implementations that closely preceded this work. [[Permittivity]] of metals, with values that could be stretched from the positive to the negative domain, had been studied extensively. In other words, negative permittivity was a known phenomenon by the time the first metamaterial was produced.  Contemporaries of Kock were involved in this type of research. The concentrated effort was led by the US government for researching interactions between the [[ionosphere]] and the re-entry of NASA space vehicles.

In the 1990s, Pendry et al. developed sequentially repeating  thin wire structures, analogous to [[crystal structures]]. These extended the range of material permittivity. However, a more revolutionary structure developed by Pendry et al. was a structure that could control magnetic interactions ([[magnetic permeability|permeability]]) of the radiated light, albeit only at microwave frequencies. This sequentially repeating, [[Split-ring resonator|split ring]] structure, extended material magnetic parameters into the negative. This lattice or periodic,  "magnetic" structure was constructed from non-magnetic components.

Hence, in electromagnetic domain, a negative value for permittivity and permeability occurring simultaneously was a requirement to produce the first metamaterials. These were beginning steps for proof of principle regarding Veselago's original 1967 proposal.

In 2000, a team of [[UCSD]] researchers produced and demonstrated metamaterials, which exhibited unusual [[Physics|physical properties]] that were never before produced in [[nature]]. These materials obey the [[laws of physics]], but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these ''negative index metamaterials'' were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the [[physical properties]] that govern the behavior of  ordinary optical materials. One of those unusual properties is the capability to reverse, for the first time, the [[Snell's law|Snell's law of refraction]]. Until this May 2000 demonstration by the UCSD team, the material was unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation capabilities allowed these first [[metamaterial]]s to be constructed. Thus, testing the "new" metamaterial began for the effects described by [[Victor Veselago]] 30 years earlier, but only at first in the [[Microwave|microwave frequency]] domain. Reversal of [[group velocity]] was explicitly announced in the related published paper.&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/pubs_smith_group/Smith_PRL_84_4184_(2000).pdf |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.4184 |title=Composite Medium with Simultaneously Negative Permeability and Permittivity |first5=S. |last5=Schultz |first4=S. |last4=Nemat-Nasser |first3=D. |last3=Vier |first2=Willie |year=2000 |last2=Padilla |last1=Smith |first1=D.R. |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=84 |pages=4184–87 |pmid=10990641 |issue=18 |bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.4184S |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oJFbfeAD?url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/pubs_smith_group/Smith_PRL_84_4184_(2000).pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The super lens===
The super lens or superlens is a practical structure based on John Pendry's work describing a perfect lens that can focus all four [[fourier component]]s. Pendry's paper described a theoretical novel lens that could capture images below the diffraction limit by employing the negative refractive index behavior. The super lens is a practical realization of this theory. It is a working lens that can capture images below the diffraction limit while realizing the inefficiencies of real materials. This means that although there are losses, enough of an image is returned that makes this research useful and successful.&lt;ref name=N_Fang&gt;{{cite journal

===Invisibility cloak===
Ulf Leonhardt was born in [[East Germany]],  and presently occupies the theoretical physics chair at the [[University of St. Andrews]] in [[Scotland]], and is considered one the leaders in the science of creating an invisibility cloak. Around 1999, Leonhardt began work on how to build a cloaking device with a few other colleagues. Leonhardt stated that at the time invisibility was not considered fashionable. He then wrote a theoretical study entitled "''Optical Conformal Mapping''". The first sentence sums up the objective: "An invisibility device should guide light around an object as if nothing were there."&lt;ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak/&gt;

In 2005, he sent the paper to three notable [[scientific journals]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[Nature Physics]], and [[Science (journal)|Science]]. Each journal, in turn, rejected the paper. In 2006, [[Physical Review Letters]] rejected the paper for publication, as well. However, according to the PRL assessment, one of the anonymous reviewers noted that (he or she ) had been to two meetings in the previous months with [[John Pendry]]'s group, who were also working on a cloaking device. From the meetings, the reviewer also became aware of a patent that Pendry and his colleagues were supposed to file. Leonhardt was at the time unaware of the Pendry group's work. Because of the Pendry meetings Leonhardt's work was not really considered new physics by the reviewer and, therefore, did not merit publication in Physical Review Letters.&lt;ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak/&gt;

Later in 2006,  ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (the journal) reversed its decision and contacted Leonhardt to publish his paper because it had just received a theoretical study  from Pendry’s team entitled "''Controlling Electromagnetic Fields''". ''Science'' considered both papers strikingly similar and published them both in the same issue of [[Science (journal)|Science Express]] on May 25, 2006. The published papers touched off research efforts by a dozen groups to build cloaking devices at locations around the globe, which would test out the mathematics of both papers.&lt;ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak&gt;

Only months after the submission of notable invisibility cloak theories, a practical device was built and demonstrated by  [[David Schurig]] and [[David R.

However, it demonstrated [[proof of principle]].&lt;ref name=Sci-Am-invisible&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8139">'''Holotomography''' (HT) is a laser technique to measure three-dimensional [[refractive index]] (RI) tomogram of a microscopic sample such as biological cells and tissues. Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.

The principle of HT is very similar to X-ray computed tomography (CT) or [[CT scan]]. CT scan measures multiple 2-D X-ray images of a human body at various illumination angles, and a 3-D tomogram (X-ray absorptivity) is then retrieved via the inverse scattering theory. Both the X-ray CT and laser HT shares the same governing equation – [[Helmholtz equation]],  [[Wave equation|the wave equatio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n for a monochromatic wavelength. HT is also known as optical diffraction tomography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauer|first=V|date=2002|title=New approach to optical diffraction tomography yielding a vector equation of diffraction tomography and a novel tomographic microscope|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0022-2720.2001.00980.x/full|journal=Journal of Microscopy|volume=205|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cell biology ===
HT provides 3D dynamic images of live cells and thin tissues without using exogenous labeling agents such as fluorescence proteins or dyes. HT enables quantitative live cell imaging, and also provides quantitative information such as cell volume, surface area, protein concentration. HT provides following advantages over conventional 3D microscopic techniques.  
# Label-free: Cellular membrane and subcellular organelles can clearly be imaged without using exogenous labeling agents. Thus, there are no issues of phototoxicity, photobleaching, and photodamaging.
# Quantitative imaging capability: HT directly measures cell’s 3D RI maps, which is intrinsic optical properties of materials. Because the measured RI can be translated into the mass density of a cell and using this information, mass of a cell can also be retrieved.
# Precise and fast measurements: HT provides the spatial resolution down to approximately 100&amp;nbsp;nm and the temporal resolution of a few to a hundred frames per second, depending on the numerical apertures of used objective lenses and the speed of an image sensor.
However, 3D RI tomography does not provide molecular specificity. Generally, the measured RI information cannot be directly related to information about molecules or proteins, except for notable cases such as gold nanoparties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Kim|first=Doyeon|date=2016|title=Label-free high-resolution 3-D imaging of gold nanoparticles inside live cells using optical diffraction tomography|biorxiv=097113}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lipid droplets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kyoohyun|date=2016|title=Three-dimensional label-free imaging and quantification of lipid droplets in live hepatocytes|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36815|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that exhibit distinctly high RI values compared to cell cytoplams.

=== Experimental Laboratory ===
HT provide various quantitative imaging capability, providing morphological, biochemical, and mechanical properties of individuals cells. 3D RI tomography directly provides morphological properties including volume, surface area, and [[sphericity]] (roundness) of a cell. Local RI value can be translated into biochemical information or cytoplasmic protein concentration, because the RI of a solution is linearly proportional to its concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baber|first=R.|date=1952|title=Interference microscopy and mass determination|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v169/n4296/abs/169366b0.html|journal=Nature|volume=169|pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, for the case of [[red blood cell]]s, RI value can be converted into hemoglobin concentration. Measurements of dynamic cell membrane fluctuatino, which can also be obtained with a HT instrument, provides information about cellular deformability. Furthermore, these various quantitative parameters can be obtained at the single cell level, allowing correlative analysis between various cellular parameters. HT has been utilized for the study of red blood cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=YongKeun|date=2010|title=Measurement of red blood cell mechanics during morphological changes|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/15/6731.short|journal=PNAS|volume=107|pages=6731}}&lt;/ref&gt; white blood cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Jonghee|date=2015|title=Label-free characterization of white blood cells by measuring 3D refractive index maps|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-3865|journal=Biomedical Optics Express|volume=6|pages=3865}}&lt;/ref&gt; malaria infection,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=YongKeun|date=|title=Refractive index maps and membrane dynamics of human red blood cells parasitized by Plasmodium falciparum|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13730.short|journal=PNAS|volume=105|pages=13730}}&lt;/ref&gt; bebasia infection,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HyunJoo|first=Park|date=2015|title=Characterizations of individual mouse red blood cells parasitized by Babesia microti using 3-D holographic microscopy|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep10827|journal=Scientific Reportshttps|volume=5|pages=10827}}&lt;/ref&gt; blood storage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Hyunjoo|date=2016|title=Measuring cell surface area and deformability of individual human red blood cells over blood storage using quantitative phase imaging|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34257|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=34257}}&lt;/ref&gt; and diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=SangYun|date=2017|title=Refractive index tomograms and dynamic membrane fluctuations of red blood cells from patients with diabetes mellitus|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|pages=1039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first theoretical proposal was presented by Emil Wolf,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Emil|date=1969|title=Three-dimensional structure determination of semi-transparent objects from holographic data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0030401869900522|journal=Optics Communications|volume=1|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first experimental demonstration was shown by Fercher et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fercher|first=A.F.|last2=Bartelt|first2=H.|last3=Becker|first3=H.|last4=Wiltschko|first4=E.|date=1979|title=Image formation by inversion of scattered field data: experiments and computational simulation|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-18-14-2427|journal=Applied Optics|volume=18|pages=2427}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000s, HT techniques had been extensively studied and applied to the field of biology and medicine, by several research groups including [http://web.mit.edu/spectroscopy/ MIT spectroscopy laboratory] (PI: the late [http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/231/feld.html Michael S. Feld]). Both the technical developments and applications of HT have been significantly advanced. During the mid 2010s, first commercial HT companies [http://nanolive.ch/ Nanolive] and [http://www.tomocube.com/ Tomocube] were founded.

The '''International Society for Extracellular Vesicles''' (ISEV) is an international [[scientific organization]] that focuses on the study of [[Exosome (vesicle)|extracellular vesicles]] (EVs),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-08-mitochondrial-derived-vesicles.html |title=Better living through mitochondrial derived vesicles}}&lt;/ref&gt; including exosomes, microvesicles, oncosomes, and other membrane-bound particles that are released from [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Established in 2011, the society is a [[non-profit entity]] and a 501(c)(3) corporation in the [[United States]]. ISEV is governed by an executive committee. The current president of ISEV (2016-2018) is [[Andrew Hill (scientist)|Andrew Hill]]; the founding president (2011-2016) is [[Jan Lötvall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/02/prweb12544475.htm |title=Beckman Coulter Webinar Series Presents Diversity of Extracellular Vesicles and Their Cargo in Cell-to-cell Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society publishes the ''Journal of Extracellular Vesicles'', the only journal devoted to the topic.

== Meetings ==
As part of its mission to promote scientific research and education, ISEV hosts an annual meeting and educational event as well as numerous workshops on defined EV-related topics. ISEV also co-sponsors or endorses related events.

The '''Irish Planning Institute''' ('''IPI''') is an all-island professional body representing professional planners engaged in [[Spatial planning|physical]] and [[environmental planning]] in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. 

The IPI works with both its members and other built environment professionals to promote and improve the quality of planning, to represent the views of the planning profession and to contribute to education and environmental awareness in the wider community.

This is achieved through the hosting of conferences and CPD Events for its members; awarding, recognising and publishing best practice; making submissions on behalf of the planning profession on national policies, governance and other relevant publications and papers; and by representing the values of planning and planning professionals in the general media.

== Activities ==

The Irish Planning Institute is an active member of the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] and has held the Presidency of this organisation. Through this involvement, the Institute not only represents Irish planning interests abroad but also forges important links with sister institutions in Europe. It is also a member of the Global Planners Network.

The IPI inspects and accredits on invitation a number of planning courses in universities and other third level educational institutions across the island of Ireland. The Institute is also a nominating body to [[Seanad Éireann]] and to [[An Bord Pleanála]].

The Irish Planning Institute lobbies central [[Government of Ireland|Government]] on new legislation and on planning policy at national, regional and local levels.  It also from time to time issues statements on current topics of public interest and debate.

The IPI publishes "Pleanáil" which is the only technical publication on planning theory and professional planning practice published in Ireland. 

Through its annual National Planning Conference, the Institute offers a major forum for the debate of planning and related topics.  It also organises the National Planning Awards every two years and a series of CPD events throughout the year to promote best practice and to inform our membership regarding new approaches and policies.

== Membership ==

The Irish Planning Institute has six categories of membership: Fellowship, Corporate, Graduate, Student, Affiliate and Honorary. 

'''Fellowship''' is generally awarded to professionally qualified planners who have considerable professional planning experience and who have made an important contribution to the development of the Institute. 

'''Corporate Membership''', which is the main class of membership, is open to professionally qualified planners those who have reached a standard of knowledge, skill and professional experience necessary to engage in planning in Ireland, in the public sector or in private practice.  This class of membership is also open to qualified professional planners who are full members of the member Institutes of the European Council of Spatial Planners, and to recently qualified planners from other countries, subject to appropriate post-qualification experience, under the provisions of the [[Directive (European Union)|European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications.

'''Graduate Membership''' is available to those who have acquired an IPI accredited planning qualification and, under certain circumstances, those who have been awarded planning qualifications which have not been accredited by the IPI.

Persons engaged in a programme of formal study leading to an IPI accredited planning qualification from a planning school are eligible for '''Student Membership''' of the Institute.

'''Affiliate Membership''' can be awarded to persons who have a professional qualification that is related to planning, who have been engaged in approved research or practice related to planning and who have been engaged in approved research or practice relating to planning, and who have made a special contribution to planning in Ireland.

'''Honorary Membership''' is generally awarded as an honour on an individual whose special interests have been deemed by the Institute to have made an outstanding contribution to planning.

== Governance ==

The Council of the IPI, which is the governing body of the Institute, is directly elected by the Members by postal ballot.

The aims of the Planning Institute are: 

* To raise the standards of planning.
* To articulate professional planning opinion.
* To improve and promote the status of the planning profession.
* To contribute to planning education.
* To encourage environmental awareness in the community.
* To represent Irish planning interests abroad.

There are a number of regional and sectoral branches within the Institute.  The Regional Branches are: the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] Branch, the [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midland]] Branch, the [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West]] Branch, the [[West Region, Ireland|Western]] Branch, the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South Eastern]] Branch, the [[Greater Dublin Area]] Branch and the [[Northern Ireland|Northern]] Branch (covering members in Northern Ireland).  The sectoral Branch is the Private Practice Branch, covering members working in private practice throughout the island of Ireland.

==Methods==
In laser microprobe mass analysis, a highly focused laser beam is pulsed on a micro sample usually with a volume of approximately 1 microliter. The resulting [[ion]]s generated by this laser are then analyzed with [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry]] to give composition, concentration, and in the case of [[organic molecule]]s structural information.

Unlike other methods of microprobe analysis which involve ions or electrons, the LMMS microproble fires an [[ultraviolet]] pulse in order to create ions. As a result, this method is much better at detecting  qualitatively rather than quantitatively.

==Advantages==
LMMS is relatively simple to operate compared to other methods. Furthermore, its strength lies in its ability to analyze [[Organic matter|biological material]]s to detect certain compounds (such as metals or organic materials).

==Sample preparation==
LAMMA is  particular about the sample which is used. The sample must be small and thin. Ionization of too much material results in a large [[microplasma]] whose time spread and ion energy distribution entering the mass spectrometer can result in undesired peak deformation.

'''Mars Zakirovich Rafikov''' ({{lang-ru|Марс Закирович Рафиков}}, 29 September 1933 – 23 July 2000) was a Soviet [[cosmonaut]] who was dismissed from the [[Soviet space program]] for disciplinary reasons.

Senior Lieutenant Rafikov, age 26, was selected as one of the [[List of astronauts by selection#1960|original 20 cosmonauts]] on March 7, 1960 along with [[Yuri Gagarin]].

On March 24, 1962, Rafikov was dismissed from the cosmonaut corps, officially for "a variety of offenses, including womanizing and 'gallivanting' in Moscow restaurants, and so forth".&lt;ref&gt;Asif Siddiqi, "Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge", 2000, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cosmonauts (notably Gagarin) had exhibited similar behavior, but could not be officially disciplined because of their stature and international reputation.  Gherman Titov later suggested, though, that the real reason for his dismissal was because he and his wife had divorced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3264.html#4 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317002445/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3264.html |date=2006-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained in the military, serving as a pilot in the Afghanistan war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/rafikov_mars.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect the image of the space program, efforts were made to cover up the reason for Rafikov's dismissal.  His image, like that of others who were dismissed, was [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|airbrushed out]] of cosmonaut photos. This airbrushing led to speculation about "[[lost cosmonauts]]" even though the actual reasons were often mundane.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030117.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''M–sigma''' (or '''''M''–''σ''''') '''relation''' is an empirical correlation between the stellar [[velocity dispersion]] ''σ'' of a [[galaxy]] [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] and the mass M of the [[supermassive black hole]] at its center.

&lt;/ref&gt; which nowadays has a comparable level of scatter.&lt;ref&gt;Savorgnan, Giulia A. D.; Graham, Alister W. (2015), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.2330S Overmassive black holes in the MBH-σ diagram do not belong to over (dry) merged galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giulia A.D. Savorgnan, et al. (2016), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...817...21S Supermassive Black Holes and Their Host Spheroids. II. The Red and Blue Sequence in the MBH-M*,sph Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''M''–''σ'' relation is generally interpreted as implying some source of mechanical [[feedback]] between the growth of supermassive black holes and the growth of galaxy bulges, although the source of this feedback is still uncertain.

Discovery of the M–σ relation was taken by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies. Prior to about 2000, the main concern had been the simple detection of black holes, while afterward the interest changed to understanding the role of supermassive black holes as a critical component of galaxies. This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in galaxies that are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe.

==Origin==
The tightness of the M–σ relation suggests that some kind of feedback acts to maintain the connection between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, in spite of processes like [[galaxy merger]]s and [[accretion (astronomy)|gas accretion]] that might be expected to increase the scatter over time.
One such mechanism was suggested by [[Joseph Silk]] and [[Martin Rees]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Silk, J. and Rees, M. (1998), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26A...331L...1S  Quasars and galaxy formation], ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', '''331''', L1–L4&lt;/ref&gt; These authors proposed a model in which supermassive black holes first form via collapse of giant 
gas clouds before most of the bulge mass has turned into stars. The black holes created in this way would then accrete and radiate, driving a wind which acts back on the accretion flow.
The flow would stall if the rate of deposition of mechanical energy into the infalling gas was large enough to unbind the protogalaxy in one [[crossing time]]. The Silk and Rees model predicts 
a slope for the M–σ relation of α=5, which is approximately correct. However, the predicted normalization of the relation is too small by about a factor of one thousand. The reason is that there is far more energy released in the formation of a supermassive black hole than is needed to completely unbind the stellar bulge.

A more successful feedback model was first presented by [[Andrew King (astronomer)|Andrew King]] at the [[University of Leicester]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=AKing&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Andrew|title=Black Holes, Galaxy Formation, and the MBH-σ Relation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2003|volume=596|issue=1|pages=L27–L29|doi=10.1086/379143|arxiv = astro-ph/0308342 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...596L..27K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In King's model, feedback occurs through momentum transfer, rather than energy transfer as in the case of Silk &amp; Rees's model.  A "momentum-driven flow" is one in which the gas cooling time is so short that essentially all the energy in the flow is in the form of bulk motion. In such a flow, most of the energy released by the black hole is lost to radiation, and only a few percent is left to affect the gas mechanically. King's model predicts a slope of α=4 for the M–σ relation, and the normalization is exactly correct; it is roughly a factor c/σ ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; times larger than in Silk &amp; Rees's relation.

==Importance==
Before the M–σ relation was discovered in 2000, a large discrepancy existed between black hole masses derived using three techniques.&lt;ref name=MF01&gt;Merritt, D. and Ferrarese, L. (2001), Relationship of Black Holes to Bulges [http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Merritt3/frames.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
''Direct,'' or dynamical, measurements based on the motion of stars or gas near the black hole seemed to give masses that averaged ~1% of the bulge mass (the "Magorrian relation"). Two other techniques—[[reverberation mapping]] in [[active galactic nuclei]], and the [[Soltan argument]], which computes the cosmological density in black holes needed to explain the [[quasar]] light—both gave a mean value of M/M&lt;sub&gt;bulge&lt;/sub&gt; that was a factor ~10 smaller than implied by the Magorrian relation. The M–σ relation resolved this discrepancy by showing that most of the direct black hole masses published prior to 2000 were significantly in error, presumably because the data on which they were based were of insufficient quality to resolve the black hole's dynamical [[sphere of influence (black hole)|sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass in big early-type galaxies is now believed to be approximately 1:200, and increasingly smaller as one moves to less massive galaxies.

A common use of the ''M''–''σ'' relation is to estimate black hole masses in distant galaxies using the easily  measured quantity σ. Black hole masses in thousands of galaxies have been estimated in this way. The M–σ relation is also used to calibrate so-called secondary and tertiary mass estimators, which relate the black hole mass to the strength of emission lines from hot gas in the nucleus or to the velocity dispersion of gas in the bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, B. (2008), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008NewAR..52..240P  The central black hole and relationships with the host galaxy], ''New Astronomy Reviews'', '''52''', 240–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The tightness of the ''M''–''σ'' relation has led to suggestions that ''every'' bulge must contain a supermassive black hole. However, the number of galaxies in which the effect of the black hole's gravity on the motion of stars or gas is unambiguously seen is still quite small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether the lack of black hole detections in many galaxies implies that these galaxies do not contain black holes; or that their masses are significantly below the value implied by the M–σ relation; or that the data are simply too poor to reveal the presence of the black hole.&lt;ref&gt;Valluri, M. et al.

'''Selection bias''' is the [[bias]] introduced by the selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=44087 Dictionary of Cancer Terms → selection bias]. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as the '''selection effect'''. The phrase "selection bias" most often refers to the distortion of a [[statistical]] analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account, then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate.

==Types==

There are many types of possible selection bias, including:

===Sampling bias===

[[Sampling bias]] is systematic error due to a non-[[random sample]] of a population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=10087 Medical Dictionary - 'Sampling Bias'] Retrieved on September 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others, resulting in a [[biased sample]], defined as a [[statistical sample]] of a [[statistical population|population]] (or non-human factors) in which all participants are not equally balanced or objectively represented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Sample+bias TheFreeDictionary → biased sample]. Retrieved on 2009-09-23. Site in turn cites: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly classified as a subtype of selection bias,&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical.webends.com/kw/Selection%20Bias Dictionary of Cancer Terms → Selection Bias]. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes specifically termed ''sample selection bias'',&lt;ref name="ArdsChung1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ards|first1=Sheila|last2=Chung|first2=Chanjin|last3=Myers|first3=Samuel L.|title=The effects of sample selection bias on racial differences in child abuse reporting|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=22|issue=2|year=1998|pages=103–115|pmid= 9504213|doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00131-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CortesMohri2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cortes|first1=Corinna|last2=Mohri|first2=Mehryar|last3=Riley|first3=Michael|last4=Rostamizadeh|first4=Afshin|title=Sample Selection Bias Correction Theory|journal=Algorithmic Learning Theory|volume=5254|year=2008|pages=38–53|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/postscript/bias.pdf|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-87987-9_8|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-87986-2|arxiv=0805.2775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CortesMohri2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cortes|first1=Corinna|last2=Mohri|first2=Mehryar|title=Domain adaptation and sample bias correction theory and algorithm for regression|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=519|year=2014|pages=103–126|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/nsmooth.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2013.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some classify it as a separate type of bias.&lt;ref name="Fadem2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadem|first=Barbara|title=Behavioral Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0IDHvLiWqUC|year=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-8257-9|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tooabstract|article|date=September 2013}}
A distinction of sampling bias (albeit not a universally accepted one) is that it undermines the [[external validity]] of a test (the ability of its results to be generalized to the rest of the population), while selection bias mainly addresses [[internal validity]] for differences or similarities found in the sample at hand. In this sense, errors occurring in the process of gathering the sample or cohort cause sampling bias, while errors in any process thereafter cause selection bias.

Examples of sampling bias include [[self-selection]], pre-screening of trial participants, discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion and migration bias by excluding subjects who have recently moved into or out of the study area.

===Time interval===
* Early termination of a trial at a time when its results support the desired conclusion.
* A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for [[ethical]] reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest [[variance]], even if all variables have a similar [[mean]].

===Exposure===
* ''Susceptibility bias''
** ''Clinical susceptibility bias'', when one disease predisposes for a second disease, and the treatment for the first disease erroneously appears to predispose to the second disease. For example, [[postmenopausal]] syndrome gives a higher likelihood of also developing [[endometrial cancer]], so estrogens given for the postmenopausal syndrome may receive a higher than actual blame for causing endometrial cancer.&lt;ref name=fenstein&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Feinstein AR |author2=Horwitz RI |title=A critique of the statistical evidence associating estrogens with endometrial cancer |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=38 |issue=11 Pt 2 |pages=4001–5 |date=November 1978 |pmid=698947}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Protopathic bias'', when a treatment for the first symptoms of a disease or other outcome appear to cause the outcome. It is a potential bias when there is a lag time from the first symptoms and start of treatment before actual diagnosis.&lt;ref name=fenstein/&gt; It can be mitigated by [[lagging (epidemiology)|lagging]], that is, exclusion of exposures that occurred in a certain time period before diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tamim H |author2=Monfared AA |author3=LeLorier J |title=Application of lag-time into exposure definitions to control for protopathic bias |journal=Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages= 250–8 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17245804 |doi=10.1002/pds.1360}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Indication bias'', a potential mixup between cause and effect when exposure is dependent on indication, e.g. a treatment is given to people in high risk of acquiring a disease, potentially causing a preponderance of treated people among those acquiring the disease. This may cause an erroneous appearance of the treatment being a cause of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew R. Weir |title= Hypertension (Key Diseases) (Acp Key Diseases Series) |publisher=American College of Physicians |location=Philadelphia, Pa |year=2005 |page=159 |isbn=1-930513-58-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data===
* Partitioning (dividing) data with knowledge of the contents of the partitions, and then analyzing them with tests designed for blindly chosen partitions.
*[[Post hoc analysis|Post hoc]] alteration of data inclusion based on arbitrary or subjective reasons, including:
**[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]], when specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion (e.g. citing examples of plane crashes as evidence of airline flight being unsafe, while ignoring the far more common example of flights that complete safely. See: [[Availability heuristic]])
**Rejection of bad data on (1) arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria or (2) discarding "[[outlier]]s" on statistical grounds that fail to take into account important information that could be derived from "wild" observations.&lt;ref name="Kruskal1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruskal|first1=William H.|title=Some Remarks on Wild Observations|journal=Technometrics|volume=2|issue=1|year=1960|pages=1–3|doi=10.1080/00401706.1960.10489875|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/out.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies===
* Selection of which studies to include in a [[meta-analysis]] (see also [[combinatorial meta-analysis]]).
* Performing repeated experiments and reporting only the most favorable results, perhaps relabelling lab records of other experiments as "calibration tests", "instrumentation errors" or "preliminary surveys".
* Presenting the most significant result of a [[data dredging|data dredge]] as if it were a single experiment (which is logically the same as the previous item, but is seen as much less dishonest).

===Attrition===
''Attrition bias'' is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants),&lt;ref name=Juni&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyh406| title = Empirical evidence of attrition bias in clinical trials| journal = International Journal of Epidemiology| volume = 34 |issue=1| pages = 87–88| year = 2005| last1 = Jüni | first1 = P. |last2=Egger |first2=Matthias }}&lt;/ref&gt; discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion. It is closely related to the [[survivorship bias]], where only the subjects that "survived" a process are included in the analysis or the [[failure bias]], where only the subjects that "failed" a process are included. It includes ''dropout'', ''nonresponse'' (lower [[response rate (survey)|response rate]]), ''withdrawal'' and ''protocol deviators''. It gives biased results where it is unequal in regard to exposure and/or outcome. For example, in a test of a dieting program, the researcher may simply reject everyone who drops out of the trial, but most of those who drop out are those for whom it was not working. Different loss of subjects in intervention and comparison group may change the characteristics of these groups and outcomes irrespective of the studied [[health intervention|intervention]].&lt;ref name=Juni/&gt;

===Observer selection===
Data are filtered not only by study design and measurement, but by the necessary precondition that there has to be someone doing a study. In situations where the existence of the observer or the study is correlated with the data, observation selection effects occur, and [[anthropic reasoning]] is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |title=Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-93858-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the past [[impact event]] record of Earth: if large impacts cause mass extinctions and ecological disruptions precluding the evolution of intelligent observers for long periods, no one will observe any evidence of large impacts in the recent past (since they would have prevented intelligent observers from evolving). Hence there is a potential bias in the impact record of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01460.x| pmid = 20626690| title = Anthropic Shadow: Observation Selection Effects and Human Extinction Risks| journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 30| issue = 10| pages = 1495| year = 2010| last1 = Ćirković | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = A. | last3 = Bostrom | first3 = N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomical [[existential risks]] might similarly be underestimated due to selection bias, and an anthropic correction has to be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/438754a| title = Astrophysics: Is a doomsday catastrophe likely?| journal = Nature| volume = 438| issue = 7069| pages = 754| year = 2005| last1 = Tegmark | first1 = M. | last2 = Bostrom | first2 = N. | pmid=16341005| bibcode = 2005Natur.438..754T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
In the general case, selection biases cannot be overcome with statistical analysis of existing data alone, though [[Heckman correction]] may be used in special cases. An assessment of the degree of selection bias can be made by examining correlations between [[exogenous]] (background) variables and a treatment indicator. However, in [[regression analysis|regression]] models, it is correlation between ''unobserved'' determinants of the outcome and ''unobserved'' determinants of selection into the sample which bias estimates, and this correlation between unobservables cannot be directly assessed by the observed determinants of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1912352| jstor = 1912352| title = Sample Selection Bias as a Specification Error| journal = Econometrica| volume = 47| pages = 153| year = 1979| last1 = Heckman | first1 = J. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related issues==
Selection bias is closely related to:
* [[publication bias]] or [[reporting bias]], the distortion produced in community perception or [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] by not publishing uninteresting (usually negative) results, or results which go against the experimenter's prejudices, a sponsor's interests, or community expectations.
* [[confirmation bias]], the distortion produced by experiments that are designed to seek confirmatory evidence instead of trying to disprove the hypothesis.
* exclusion bias, results from applying different criteria to cases and controls in regards to participation eligibility for a study/different variables serving as basis for exclusion.

'''Self-experimentation''' refers to the special case of [[single-subject research]] in which the experimenter conducts the [[experiment]] on themself. Usually this means that a single person is the designer, operator, subject, analyst, and user or reporter of the experiment.

Current champions of self-experimentation include the late [[Seth Roberts]], [[Tim Ferriss]], and a sprawling  community of [[Quantified Self]]

==Psychology==

The self-experimental approach has long and often been applied to practical psychological problems. [[Benjamin Franklin]] recorded his self-experiment of successively devoting his attention for a week to one of thirteen "Virtues", "leaving the other Virtues to their ordinary Chance, only marking every Evening the Faults of the Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin | editor = Frank Woodworth Pine | date=1916 | url=https://excellence-in-literature.com/benjamin-franklin-13-virtues/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Part 2 |url=http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page35.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, the best-known self-experiments are the memory studies of [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], which established many basic characteristics of human memory through tedious experiments involving nonsense syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Ebbinghaus |date=1913 |title=Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie |publisher=NY Teachers College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Self-change: Strategies for solving personal problems'', M. J. Mahoney suggested that self-experimentation be used as a method of psychological treatment, and recommended that clients be taught basic scientific methods, in order that the client become a "personal scientist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Mahoney, M.

With this implant in place, over a three-month period, he conducted a number of experiments, including the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: "Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy", IEE Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185-189, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Shulgin]] devoted his entire career to self experimentation, publishing his results in the widely acclaimed books [[PiHKAL]] and [[TiHKAL]]. Dr. Zee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr Zee Home Page |url=https://www.drzee.org |website=Dr Zee |publisher=Dr Zee |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a self-proclaimed Neo-Shulginist, is also known for a career of self experimentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Dr Zee, the godfather of legal highs: I test everything on myself |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/24/dr-zee-the-godfather-of-legal-highs-i-test-everything-on-myself |accessdate=6 July 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Examples in classic fiction include the tales of ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''. In each case the scientist's unorthodox theories lead to permanent change and ultimately to self-destruction.

Self-experimentation is a common trait amongst [[mad scientist]]s and [[villain|evil genius]]es in more contemporary fiction and is part of the creation story of many [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s, and some [[superhero]]es. For example, the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Lizard (comics)|The Lizard]] lost his arm in a war (other versions vary), and experimented with reptilian DNA to try to grow it back; however, the therapy caused him to mutate into a half-human-half-reptile creature. The [[Fantastic Four]] were created when the Four were testing Reed Richards's new prototype rocket and were exposed to cosmic rays, giving them super powers. Other cases include the [[Man-Bat]], the [[Ultra-Humanite]], the [[Green Goblin]], and the [[Justice League (animated series)|animated Justice League]] version of [[Cheetah (comics)#Other media|Cheetah]].

The deepest example for self-experimentation was shown in [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003), where [[Brian Banner|David Banner]] experimented on himself to improve on his own limits, which is also why [[The Incredible Hulk|his son]] had many different abilities.

'''Soft systems methodology''' ('''SSM''') is an approach to organizational process modeling ([[business process modeling]]) and it can  be used both for general [[problem]] solving and in the management of change. It was developed in [[England]] by academics at the [[University of Lancaster]] Systems Department through a ten-year [[action research]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Checkland, P.B. (2001) Soft Systems Methodology, in J. Rosenhead and J. Mingers (eds), Rational Analysis for a Problematic World Revisited. Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
&lt;!--Content copied directly from published works is generally NOT ACCEPTABLE: See [[Wikipedia:Copyright violations]]--&gt;
The methodology was developed from earlier [[systems engineering]] approaches, primarily by [[Peter Checkland]] and colleagues such as [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]]. The primary use of SSM is in the analysis of complex situations where there are divergent views about the definition of the problem. These situations are "soft problems" such as: How to improve health services delivery? How to manage disaster planning? When should mentally disordered offenders be diverted from custody? What to do about homelessness amongst young people?

In such situations even the actual problem to be addressed may not be easy to agree upon. 
To intervene in such situations the ''soft systems'' approach uses the notion of a "[[system]]" as an interrogative device that will enable debate amongst concerned parties. In its 'classic' form the methodology consists of seven steps, with initial appreciation of the problem situation leading to the modelling of several [[Soft systems methodology#Human Activity System|human activity systems]] that might be thought relevant to the problem situation. By discussions and exploration of these, the decision makers will arrive at accommodations (or, exceptionally, at consensus) over what kind of changes may be systemically desirable and feasible in the situation. Later explanations of the ideas give a more sophisticated view of this systemic method, and give more attention to locating the methodology in respect to its philosophical underpinnings.  It is the earlier classical view which is most widely used in practice.

There are several hundred documented examples of the successful use of SSM in many different fields, ranging from [[ecology]], to business and military logistics. It has been adopted by many organizations and incorporated into other approaches: in the 1990s for example it was the recommended planning tool for the [[UK government]]'s [[SSADM]] [[system development methodology]].

The general applicability of the approach has led to some criticisms that it is functionalist, non-emancipatory or supports the status quo and existing power structures; this is a claim that users would deny, arguing that the methodology itself can be none of these, it is the user of the methodology that may choose to employ it in such a way.

The methodology has been described in several books and many academic articles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

SSM remains the most widely used and practical application of [[systems thinking]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and other systems approaches such as [[critical systems thinking]] have incorporated many of its ideas.

==The 7-stage description==
&lt;!--Content copied directly from published works is generally NOT ACCEPTABLE: See [[Wikipedia:Copyright violations]]--&gt;
7-stage representation of SSM:
#   Enter situation considered problematical
#   Express the problem situation
#   Formulate root definitions of relevant systems of purposeful activity
#   Build conceptual models of the systems named in the root definitions
#   Compare models with real world situations
#   Define possible changes which are both possible and feasible
#   Take action to improve the problem situation

==CATWOE==
&lt;!--Content copied directly from published works is generally NOT ACCEPTABLE: See [[Wikipedia:Copyright violations]]--&gt;
In 1975, David Smyth, a researcher in Checkland's department, observed that SSM was most successful when the Root Definition included certain elements. These elements, captured in the mnemonic CATWOE, identified the people, processes and environment that contribute to a situation, issue or problem that required analyzing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smyth |first=D. S. |last2=Checkland |first2=P. B. |date=1976 |title=Using a systems approach: the structure of root definitions |journal=Journal of applied systems analysis |volume=5 |number=1 |pages=75–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. Business Perspectives help the Business Analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved. There are six elements of CATWOE&lt;ref&gt;

A human activity system can be defined as 'notional system (i.e. not existing in any tangible form) where human beings are undertaking some activities that achieve some purpose' (Patching, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Patching, D. (1990) ''Practical soft systems analysis'', Pitman&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to a high level of overall monitoring of individual [[process control]]lers, which is not necessary for the operation of each controller, but gives the operator an overall plant process view, and allows integration of operation between controllers.   

A more specific use of the term is for a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system or [[SCADA]], which refers to a specific class of system for use in process control, often on fairly small and remote applications such as a [[pipeline transport]], water distribution, or [[wastewater]] utility system station.
==Forms==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a typical Distributed Control System, showing the supervisory level.]]
Supervisory control often takes one of two forms. In one, the controlled machine or process continues autonomously. It is observed from time to time by a human who, when deeming it necessary, intervenes to modify the control algorithm in some way. In the other, the process accepts an instruction, carries it out autonomously, reports the results and awaits further commands. With manual control, the operator interacts directly with a controlled process or task using switches, levers, screws, valves etc., to control actuators. This concept was incorporated in the earliest machines which sought to extend the physical capabilities of man. In contrast, with automatic control, the machine adapts to changing circumstances and makes decisions in pursuit of some goal which can be as simple as switching a heating system on and off to maintain a room temperature within a specified range. Sheridan &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Telerobotics, Automation, and Human Supervisory Control |author=Sheridan, Thomas B.|year=1992 |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge
|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eu41_M2Do9oC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=Z3s4bQwAba&amp;dq=Telerobotics,+automation,+and+human+supervisory+control&amp;sig=cKKGbuVGZCwTM5Bb9K60GWssEGQ#PPP1,M1|page=1 | isbn=978-0-262-19316-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines supervisory control as follows: "in the strictest sense, supervisory control means that one or more human operators are intermittently programming and continually receiving information from a computer that itself closes an autonomous control loop through artificial effectors to the controlled process or task environment."

==Other points==
Robotics applications have traditionally aimed for automatic control. Automatic control requires sensing and responding appropriately to all combinations of circumstances which can present problems of overwhelming complexity. A supervisory control scheme offers the prospect of solving the automation problem incrementally and leaving those problems unsolved to be handled by the human supervisor.

Communications delay does not have the same impact on this control scheme. All time critical feedback occurs at the slave where the delays are negligible. Instability is thus avoided without modifying the feedback loop. Communications delay, in this case, slows the rate at which an operator can assign tasks to the slave and determine whether those tasks have been successfully carried out.

==History==
[[File:Parrish Hall.jpg|thumb|Parrish Hall, named in honor of the first president, [[Edward Parrish]] (1822–1872), contains the admissions, housing, and financial aid offices, along with student housing on the upper floors.]]
The name "Swarthmore" has its roots in early [[Quakers|Quaker]] history. In [[England]], [[Swarthmoor Hall]] near the town of [[Ulverston, England|Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]], (previously in [[Lancashire]]) was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when [[George Fox]], (1624–1691), fresh from his epiphany atop [[Pendle Hill]] in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell of his views. Swarthmoor was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled "The Quakers").

The College was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of the [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Baltimore]] Yearly Meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. [[Edward Parrish]] (1822–1872) was its first president. [[Lucretia Mott]] (1793–1880) and [[Martha Ellicott Tyson]] (1795–1873)&lt;ref name="msa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/educ/exhibits/womenshall/html/tyson.html|title=Maryland Women's Hall of Fame: Martha Ellicott Tyson|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among those Friends, who insisted that the new college of Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hope Bacon (1980), ''"Valiant Friend: The Life of Lucretia Mott"'', page 199, {{ISBN|1-888305-09-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, [[Helen Magill White|Helen Magill]], (1853–1944), was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877, she was the first woman in the [[United States]] to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, ([[PhD|Ph.D.]]); hers was in [[Greek language|Greek]] from [[Boston University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="ArchiveWomens2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|title=Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Faculty » Women's, Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies Program&amp;nbsp;– Boston University|publisher=web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035256/http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|archivedate=2013-10-12|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, the College had a major collegiate [[Swarthmore Garnet Tide football|American football program]] during the formation period of the soon-to-be nationwide sport, (playing [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]], ([[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]), [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During [[World War II]], Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] commission.&lt;ref name="swarthmore-v-122"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2010/02/19/swarthmore-at-war-part-1/|title=Daily Gazette|last=|first=|year=2011|publisher=[[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]]: Swarthmore College|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Köhler]], [[Hans Wallach]] and [[Solomon Asch]] were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left [[Nazi Germany]] because of its discriminatory policies against Jews. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, and also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch, who was Polish-American and had immigrated as a child to the US in 1920, joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his [[Asch conformity experiments|noted conformity experiments]] at Swarthmore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html|title=Asch Experiment|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of new buildings – the Sharples Dining Hall in 1964,  the Worth Health Center in 1965, the Dana/Hallowell Residence Halls in 1967, and the Lang Music Building in 1973.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; They also saw a 1967 review of the college initiated by President Courtney Smith, a 1969 black protest movement, in which African-American students conducted an eight-day [[sit-in]] in the admissions office to demand increased black enrollment, and the establishment of the Black Cultural Center (1970) and the Women's Resource Center (1974).&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/timeline/1969-black-student-protest-movement|title=1969 black student protest movement|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/timeline/1975-alice-paul-05-and-womens-center|title=1975 Alice Paul '05 and the women's center|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Studies program and the Intercultural Center were established in 1992, and in 1993 the Lang Performing Arts Center was opened; the Kohlberg Hall was then established in 1996 and a renovation of the Trotter hall was undertaken in 1997.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; In 1999 the college began purchasing [[renewable energy credit]]s in the form of [[wind power]], and in the 2002–2003 academic year it constructed its first [[green roof]].&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; In 2008, Swarthmore's first mascot, Phineas the Phoenix, made its debut.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt;

==Academics==
[[File:Swarthmore College Observatory.jpg|thumb|Observatory|left]]
Swarthmore's [[Oxbridge]] [[tutorial]]-inspired Honors Program allows students to take double-credit seminars from their third year and often write honors [[Thesis|theses]]. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three ten-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20–30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their final year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded "Highest Honors"; others are either awarded "High Honors" or "Honors"; rarely, a student is denied Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admission to the Honors program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program|title=Honors Program :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncommon for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an [[engineering]] program in which at the completion of four years' work, students are granted a B.S. in Engineering. Other notable programs include minors in [[peace and conflict studies]], [[cognitive science]], and [[Critical theory|interpretation theory]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.har.com/selective-liberal-arts-colleges--information-session-and-visit/event_E0-001-093360433-8|title=Selective Liberal Arts Colleges- Information Session and Visit   - HAR.com|last=Inc.|first=HRIS,|website=Homes And Rentals - HAR.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarthmore has a total undergraduate student enrollment of 1,620 (for the 2016–2017 year) and 187 faculty members (99% with a terminal degree), for a student-faculty ratio of 8:1. The small college offers more than 600 courses a year in over 40 courses of study.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Swarthmore has a reputation as a very academically oriented college, with 66% of students participating in undergraduate research or independent creative projects, and 90% of graduates eventually attending graduate or professional school.

== Endowment and tuition ==
The cost of tuition, student activity fees, room, and board for the 2017–2018 academic year was $65,774 (tuition alone was $50,424).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/student-accounts-office/tuition-room-and-board-fees|title=Tuition, Room, and Board Fees :: Student Accounts Office :: Swarthmore College|last=|first=|date=|website=www.swarthmore.edu|access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred percent of admitted students' demonstrated need is offered by the college. In total, 56% of the student body receives financial aid, and the average financial aid award was $50,361 during the 2017–18 year.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; As a need-blind school, Swarthmore makes admission decisions and financial aid decisions independently.

Swarthmore's endowment at the end of the 2016 fiscal year was $1,746,962,000. Endowment per student was $1,078,371 for the same year, one of the highest rates in the country. Operating revenue for the 2016 fiscal year was $148,086,000, over 50% of which was provided by the endowment.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; Swarthmore ended a $230 million capital campaign on October 6, 2006, when President [[Alfred Bloom|Bloom]] declared the project completed, three months ahead of schedule. The campaign, christened the "Meaning of Swarthmore", had been underway officially since the fall of 2001. 87% of the college's alumni participated in the effort.

At the end of 2007, the Swarthmore Board of Managers approved the decision for the college to eliminate student loans from all financial aid packages. Instead, additional aid scholarships will be granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x16525.xml|title=Swarthmore College :: Financial Aid :: More about Swarthmore's Expanded Financial Aid Program|date=2007-12-08|publisher=Swarthmore.edu|accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Swarthmore_Parrish_Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Parrish Hall from Magill Walk]]
The campus consists of {{convert|425|acre|km2}}, based on a north-south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses [[campus radio]] station [[WSRN-FM]] as well as the weekly student newspaper, ''The Phoenix''.  Many acres are wooded and include trails.

From the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] [[Swarthmore (SEPTA station)|Swarthmore commuter train station]] and the "ville" or borough of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is coterminous with the grounds of the [[Scott Arboretum]], cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33|title=Press Releases from|publisher=Greater Philadelphia Gardens|accessdate=2011-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131755/http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named Swarthmore one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/16 "America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms of Willets, Mertz, Worth, The Lodges, Alice Paul, and David Kemp. To the west are the dorms of Wharton, Dana, Hallowell, and Danawell, along with the Scott Amphitheater, an open wooded outdoor amphitheater, in which graduations and college collections (meetings) are held. The Crum Woods extend westward from the main campus, and many buildings on the forest side of the campus incorporate views of the woods. South of Parrish are Sharples dining hall, the two non-residential fraternities (Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon), and various other buildings. Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, as are the athletic facilities, while the Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/visitordash/campus_map.pdf|title=Visitors|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x4593.xml|title=Libraries|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1923, McCabe library has been a [[Federal Depository Library Program|Federal Depository library]] for selected U.S. Government documents.

===Friends Historical Library===
Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve, and make available archival, manuscript, printed, and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present. Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America. The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library|title=Friends Historical Library :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/|title=Swarthmore Historical Society|website=Swarthmore Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
Two Greek organizations exist on the campus in the form of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]], [[Delta Upsilon]] and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. A third, [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity, maintained a chapter on campus from 1906 to 1991 and continues strong alumni involvement.&lt;ref name="ATPS2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Rand|first=Frank Prentice|title=All The Phi Sigs&amp;nbsp;— A History|year=1993|last2=Watts|last3=Sefton|first2=Ralph|first3=James E.|publisher=Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system, and leading to a 79-year ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html|title=Discrimination in the sorority system|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419163605/http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html|archivedate=2007-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmorephoenix.com/?p=6702 Kappa Alpha Theta Chapter Official at Swarthmore | The Phoenix].

The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. A further non-binding referendum was later distributed, but by then the controversy had cooled: Of the six items on the referendum, only one passed, which asked "Do you support admitting students of all genders to sororities and fraternities?" No action was taken on the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2013/02/26/17685/ StuCo Report: Referendum Not Binding | Daily Gazette]. Daily.swarthmore.edu (2013-02-26).

Swarthmore has a variety of sporting teams with a total of 22 [[NCAA Division III]] varsity intercollegiate sports teams. 40 percent of Swarthmore students play intercollegiate or club sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/friends/ead/6I001physed.xml|title=Swarthmore College Physical Education and Athletics records, 1921–1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity teams include [[badminton]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[lacrosse]], [[soccer]], [[softball]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]] and [[volleyball]]. The [[Swarthmore Garnet Tide football|football team]] was controversially eliminated in 2000, along with [[wrestling]] and, initially, badminton. The Board of Managers cited lack of athletes on campus and difficulty of recruiting as reasons for terminating the programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003-12-04/news/13551 Three years later, athletics shows improvement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705035151/http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003-12-04/news/13551|date=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/daily/specials/sportscut/index.html Athlete recruiting difficulty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609135404/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/daily/specials/sportscut/index.html|date=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarthmore also offers a number of club sport options, including men's and women's [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[ultimate frisbee]], [[volleyball]], [[fencing]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/sports/2013/6/17/GEN_0617135419.aspx|title=Swarthmore College Club Sports and Student Activity Groups 2015–2016|accessdate=13 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104224647/http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/sports/2013/6/17/GEN_0617135419.aspx|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarthmore is a charter member of the [[Centennial Conference]], a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennial.org/information/about|title=The Centennial Conference|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarthmore's varsity women's soccer team has won the Centennial Conference Championship three times (2014, 2017, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.centennial.org/sports/wsoc/History|title=History|date=2018-10-28|work=Centennial Conference|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student safety===
Based on federal campus safety data for 2014, Swarthmore College was the third highest in the nation in "total reports of rape per 1,000 students" on its main campus, with 11 reports of rape per 1,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/06/07/these-colleges-have-the-most-reports-of-rape/|title=These colleges have the most reports of rape|last=Anderson|first=Nick|date=2016-06-07|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
[[File:Ben West birthplace Swarthmore PA obl.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Benjamin West Birthplace|birthplace of Benjamin West]] is on campus.]]
Swarthmore has two main student news publications. The weekly newspaper, ''The Phoenix'', is published nearly every Thursday. Founded in 1881, the paper began putting stories online in 1995. Two thousand copies are distributed across the college campus and to the Borough of Swarthmore. The newspaper is printed by Bartash Printing in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/29066/|title=Swarthmore student newspaper apologizes for op-ed telling students to 'stop whining' – The College Fix|date=2016-09-19|work=The College Fix|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published semiannually at the end of each semester. One is ''Spike'', Swarthmore's humor magazine, founded in 1993. The others are literary magazines, including ''Nacht'', which publishes long-form non-fiction, fiction, poetry, and artwork; ''Small Craft Warnings'', which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; ''Scarlet Letters'', which publishes women's literature; ''Enie'', for Spanish literature; ''OURstory'', for literature relating to diversity issues; ''Bug-Eyed Magazine'', a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature (SWIL); ''Remappings'' (formerly "''CelebrASIAN''"), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; ''Alchemy'', a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; ''Mjumbe'', published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An [[erotica]] magazine, ''!'' (pronounced "bang") was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, ''Untouchables''. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a new photography magazine, ''Pun/ctum'', which features work from students and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library/swarthmore-college-archives-publications|title=Swarthmore College Archives: Publications :: Friends Historical Library :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A cappella===
The [[collegiate a cappella]] groups include Sixteen Feet, the College's oldest group (founded in 1981), as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group (founded in 1983), and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the [[Tri-College Consortium]] and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. Lastly, OffBeat was founded in the fall of 2013 as a co-ed group. The groups, self-run as volunteer clubs with college support, travel to other schools to participate in concerts. Once every semester, all of the school's a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree, which includes visiting groups from other colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/living-swarthmore/swarthmores-student-organizations|title=Swarthmore's Student Organizations :: Living@Swarthmore :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
[[WSRN-FM|WSRN 91.5 FM]] is the college radio station. It has a mix of [[Indie (music)|indie]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[World music|world]], [[jazz]], and [[classical music]], as well as a number of radio [[talk shows]]. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the 1969 black protest movement extensively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-01-24/news/11640.html Crisis of '69] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223094241/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-01-24/news/11640.html|date=December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, WSRN centered its programming on the immensely popular "Hank and Bernie Show", starring undergraduates Hank Hanks and Bernie Bernstein. Hank and Bernie conducted wide-ranging and entertaining interviews of sports stars and cultural icons such as Lou Piniella, Mark Grace, Jake Plummer, Greg Ostertag, Andy Karich and Mark "the Bird" Fidrych, and also engaged the Swarthmore community in discussions on campus issues and current events. Upwards of 90 percent of the Swarthmore community would tune in to the Hank and Bernie Show and many members of the surrounding villages and towns would also listen and call in. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Ralph Lee|date=March 1997|title=If I Had a Song…|url=http://bulletin.swarthmore.edu/bulletin-issue-archive/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_1997_03.pdf|format=pdf|magazine=Swarthmore College Bulletin|location=Swarthmore, PA|publisher=Swarthmore College|volume=XCIV|issn=0888-2126|access-date=September 8, 2016|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/ Cuts to athletic programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222092701/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/|date=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]] on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN's lineup is "Oído al Tambor", which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show's concept was revived by the show "Rayuela", which has been running since September 2009.

===Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association===
Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmorefd.org/ems/|title=Swarthmore Fire &amp; Protective Association :: EMS|website=www.swarthmorefd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire horn is located within the Swarthmore campus and its sound has become a fixture of campus life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/2016/03/11/monthly-swarthmore-history-contest-in-swarthmorean-fire-horn|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students affectionately refer to the noise as the call of the Fire Moose or the Space Whale, although the names themselves are in a constant state of evolution.

===Swarthmore College Computer Society===
Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run volunteer organization independent of the official ITS department of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|title=Swarthmore College Computer Society|website=www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to operating a set of servers that provide e-mail accounts, Unix shell login accounts, server storage space, and webspace to students, professors, alumni, and other student-run organizations, SCCS hosts over 100 mailing lists used by various student groups, and over 130 organizational websites, including the website of the student newspaper, ''The Daily Gazette''. SCCS also provides a computer lab and gaming room, located in Clothier basement beneath Essie Mae's snack bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/about/|title=SCCS – About|website=www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact====
In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a [[Slashdotting]] while hosting a copy of the [[Diebold Memos|Diebold memos]] on behalf of the student group [[Free Culture Swarthmore]], then known as the [[Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons]]. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant [[DMCA]] takedown request received by the college's ITS department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341683/|title=Swarthmore College's response to the DMCA takedown request|last=Konrad|first=Rachel|date=2003-10-27|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCCS was noted in PC Magazine's article "Top 20 Wired Colleges" as one of the reasons for ranking Swarthmore #4 on that list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2073408,00.asp|title=Top 20 Wired Colleges|work=PCMAG|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004–2005 school year, the SCCS Media Lounge served as the early home of War News Radio, a weekly webcast run by Swarthmore students and providing news about the Iraq war, providing resources, space, and technical support for the project in its infancy.

Three SCCS-related papers have been accepted for publication at the USENIX [[Large Installation System Administration Conference|Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference]], one of which was awarded Best Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa07/|title=21st Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference, Dallas, November 11–16, 2007|date=2008-02-05|publisher=Usenix.org|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa02/tech/stepleton.html Work-Augmented Laziness with the Los Task Request System], Thomas Stepleton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11772">Many [[educational institution]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://coldfusion.louisville.edu/webs/a-s/wcrp/reports/reporting_institutions.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; maintain a '''writing center''' that provides students with free assistance on their papers, [[project]]s, [[report]]s, multimodal [[document]]s, [[web page]]s, et cetera from consultants. A key goal of any writing center is helping writers to learn. Typical services include help with the purpose, structure, function of writing, and are geared toward writers of various levels and [[Discipline (academia)|fields of study]]. Formats may include one-on-one tutoring, group tutoring, and workshop settings. Some services include drop-in, appointment, and weekly services. Writing centers attempt to provide non-proscriptive and non-corrective response, instead relying on a fuller explanation of why a piece of writing may fail to fulfill the writer's aims. The goal is to help a writer learn to address the various exigences that they may encounter with the realization that no writing is decontextualized—it always addresses a specific audience.

==Overview==
A writing center usually offers individualized conferencing whereby the writing tutor offers his or her feedback on the piece of writing at hand; a writing tutor's main function is to discuss how the piece of writing might be revised. However, the tutor usually does not proofread nor edit the student's work. Instead, the tutor facilitates the student's attempts to revise his or her own work by conversing with the student about the topic at hand, discussing principles and processes of writing, modeling rhetorical and syntactical moves for the student to apply, and assisting the student in identifying patterns of grammatical error in his or her writing. This is based upon a large body of theory discussed in a later paragraph.

== History ==
Historically, writing centers in American universities began appearing as "writing labs" in the early [[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Stephen|date=September 1984|title=The Idea of a Writing Center|journal=College English|series=5|volume=46|pages=433–446|doi=10.2307/377047|jstor=377047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Boquet and Stephen North point to the origins of the writing laboratory as first a method, not a place, where "the key characteristic of which appears to have been that all work was to be done during class time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boquet|first=Elizabeth|date=February 1999|title="Our Little Secret": A History of Writing Centers, Pre-to-Post Admissions|journal=College Composition and Communication|series=3|volume=50|pages=463–482|jstor=358861 .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to allow the student to compose with the teacher present, able to help with any revisions or questions the student may have. However, as class sizes and universities grew, Writing Centers began to develop as university institutions, often conceived of as an editing service for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Stephen|date=September 1984|title=The Idea of a Writing Center|journal=College English|series=5|volume=46|pages=433–446|doi=10.2307/377047|jstor=377047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions also offer an [[Online Writing Lab]] (OWL), which generally attempts to follow the model of writing center tutoring in an online environment. These environments have been said to be a step toward a new model of writing centers, a model known as [[Multiliteracy]] Centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hamptonpress.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=1-57273-898-7|title=Multiliteracy Centers: Writing Center Work, New Media, and Multimodal Rhetoric|last=Inman|first=James|author2=David Sheridan|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another environment that could fall under this category is a [[Space|physical space]] known as a [[digital studio]].

While some institutions do not have writing centers, a number offer similar support through entities which have a wider remit (scope). These might typically be called Academic Skills Units&lt;ref&gt;http://www.port.ac.uk/departments/studentsupport/ask/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD7wQbBzh4k&lt;/ref&gt; or Learning Development Groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/learn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.hud.ac.uk/uhbs/about/student_info/acu.php&lt;/ref&gt; Writing centers may be part of a writing studies department or stand-alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=1624707|title=Writing program architecture: thirty cases for reference and research|last=Finer|first=Bryna Siegel|last2=White-Farnham|first2=Jamie|date=2017|isbn=9781607326274|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent movement in writing centers has been to provide services for the non-[[Academia|academic community]]. Such services include one-to-one response for out-of-school writers, and workshops on a wide variety of topics. Such writing centers are often identified as community writing centers.

Writing centers are not exclusively a post-secondary phenomenon. Some [[Secondary school|high schools]] have successfully created writing centers similar to the model in [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.richmond.edu/twiki/bin/view/HSWritingCenters/WebHome WebHome &lt; HSWritingCenters &lt; TWiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, writing center directors or writing program administrators (WPAs) are responsible for conducting [[writing center assessment]], and must communicate these results to [[academic administration]] and various [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Chris|date=Fall 2009|title=What Do WPAs Need to Know about Writing Assessment? An Immodest Proposal|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?site=eds&amp;scope=site&amp;jrnl=01964682&amp;AN=47797179&amp;h=cGYiYwEBSY5QpHau98In7Frdy02Q2S8z9yf0hXy3VETz1pZxpF4Xn%2bHMoTEdn4aJHDlleQXv2Zi9DDSkTJX0jw%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNoResults&amp;resultNs=Ehost&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d01964682%26AN%3d47797179|journal=WPA: Writing Program Administration|doi=|pmid=|access-date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment is seen as beneficial for writing centers because it challenges them to assume the professional and [[Ethics|ethical]] behaviors important not just for writing centers but for all higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Isabelle|date=2006|title=Writing center assessment: Why and a little how|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=thompson+writing+center+assessment&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C10|journal=Writing Center Journal|issue=26.1|pages=33–54|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional Variations ==
No longer strictly an American phenomenon, writing centers have spread in other world regions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Birgitta Ramsey, ''Composition Programs and Practices in Sweden: Possibilities for Cross-Fertilization with the United States'', Ph.D. dissertation, [[University of Southern Mississippi]], Hattiesburg, 2008, UMI Number 3326719 (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.eataw.eu/ European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing] (EATAW) is in part concerned with the study and advancement of writing centers in European universities. The [[International Writing Centers Association]] (IWCA) is committed to supporting writing centers from around the world, with current regional associations in [[Europe]] and proposed associations in the [[Middle East]], [[South Africa]], and the [[Far East]].

== Types of Writers Served ==
Writers served by these writing centers may vary depending on the setting. A university writing center may service undergraduate writers at a separate writing center than graduate writers, or combine the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carino|first=Peter|date=1995|title=Early Writing Centers: Toward a History|jstor=43441973|journal=The Writing Center Journal|volume=15|issue=2|pages=103–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A department may choose to have its own writing center for students in that major. Community college writing centers have programs serving enrolled students, GED students, or members from the community. High school writing centers service enrolled students only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham and Harris|date=Jan 2005|title=Improving the Writing Performance of Young Struggling Writers: Theoretical and Programmatic Research From the Center on Accelerating Student Learning|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00224669050390010301|journal=THE JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION|volume=39.1|pages=19–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consultants ==
Depending on the writing center and the target population, consultants may be undergraduate peer consultants, graduate consultants, graduate peer consultants, staff consultants, or faculty consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Stephen M.|date=1994|title=Revisiting "The Idea of a Writing Center"|jstor=43442606|journal=The Writing Center Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=7–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consultants may be working for pay or for college credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Stephen M.|date=1984|title=The Idea of a Writing Center|jstor=377047|journal=College English|volume=46|issue=5|pages=433–446|doi=10.2307/377047}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the writing center offers workshop or group tutoring sessions, staff, experienced undergraduates, or graduates may serve in an unofficial or official TA capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Stephen M.|date=1984|title=The Idea of a Writing Center|jstor=377047|journal=College English|volume=46|issue=5|pages=433–446|doi=10.2307/377047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing center research has examined what effect each type of consultant has upon the writer seeking help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Muriel|date=1995|title=Talking in the Middle: Why Writers Need Writing Tutors|jstor=378348|journal=College English|volume=57|issue=1|pages=27–42|doi=10.2307/378348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing Center Theory ==
Faculty, students, staff, and administrators often viewed writing centers as places for remediation. At their best, however, they are places where all students, including the best ones, can get better, a place (according to Karen Head), "that returns to the ideal of a safe space for active debate and discourse about the best ways to communicate in a variety of modes."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Head, "At the Center: Innovation in Research, Practice, and Service for 21st Century 'Writing Centers'," in: ''Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World'', ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014), pp. 49-51 (49).&lt;/ref&gt;
