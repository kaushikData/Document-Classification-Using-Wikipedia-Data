      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1042">'''Alas''' ({{lang-sah|Алаас}}) is a shallow depression which occurs primarily in [[Yakutia]], which is formed by subsidence of the [[Arctic]] [[permafrost]] due to repeated melting and refreezing. An alas first develops as a shallow lake as melt water fills the depression. The lake eventually dries out and is replaced by grasses and other [[herbaceous]] vegetation.

An alas is different from thermokarst depressions found elsewhere in the Arctic in that the lake is only temporary. Due to the aridity of Yakutia, the lake will dry up once the underlying ice has been depleted.

Alases are often used for pasturage for horses as well as hay-fields.

It uses [[GPS]] to provide performance statistics and is run on a GPS-enabled cell phone. The GPS gives Allsport GPS a precise way of measuring statistics such as pace, speed, time and distance.&lt;ref name="rcrnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcrnews.com/article/20070618/SUB/70618011 |title=REVIEW: Trimble's AllSport GPS Platinum tracks your trip but only so far - RCR Wireless News |publisher=Rcrnews.com |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183438/http://www.rcrnews.com/article/20070618/SUB/70618011 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users can view their route overlaid on a map.  The application is used for fitness training regimes and goal tracking. The workout information uploads to the Allsport GPS website wirelessly. In 2006 Allsport GPS introduced the ability to view workouts in the Trimble Outdoors Google Earth layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allsportgps.com/keyhole.aspx |title=is now TrimbleOutdoors.com - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Allsportgps.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802145643/http://www.allsportgps.com/keyhole.aspx| archivedate=August 2, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Allsport GPS is a part of the Trimble Outdoors product family. It is owned by [[Trimble Navigation]] which was founded in 1978. The Allsport GPS application was bought by Trimble in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/news/release.aspx?id=082806a |title=Trimble News Release |publisher=Trimble.com |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717100825/http://www.trimble.com/news/release.aspx?id=082806a| archivedate= 17 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software continues to be updated periodically. Allsport GPS started out as only available on limited phone models and carriers, but this list has steadily been expanding since then. In 2007 Allsport GPS was released on Blackberry phones.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdasoftwareaccessories.cell-iphone-voip.com/pda/blackberry-gps/blackberry-gps-you-have-a-choice-of-using-internal-or-external-gps-receivers/&lt;/ref&gt; Allsport GPS was released on AT&amp;T phones in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=26284 |title=AT&amp;T- News Room |publisher=Att.com |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
The purpose of Allsport GPS is to support fitness and performance tracking. It is part of a trio of cell phone applications called Trimble Outdoors. It can be used for workouts such as [[running]], [[jogging]], [[mountain biking]], [[road biking]], and [[walking]]. The application is downloaded onto a GPS cell phone. The user then straps the phone onto themselves or onto their bike, or holds the phone for the duration of their workout. During the workout Allsport GPS supplies real time statistics such as calories burned, time, speed and distance. These statistics are updated every ten seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/on-the-run-with-trimble-outdoors-allsport-gps/ |title=On the Run with Trimble Outdoors AllSport GPS – Cell Phones &amp; Mobile Device Technology News &amp; Updates |publisher=Geek.com |date=2007-01-04 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603014342/http://www.geek.com/on-the-run-with-trimble-outdoors-allsport-gps/ |archive-date=2008-06-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After the workout, the data is automatically uploaded wirelessly to the website. The data can then be viewed, as well as a trip calendar showing all workouts over time, and elevation and speed profiles. On the Allsport map function, the workout can be viewed on a map both on the phone and on the website. The route can be made public and shared with others. The user can do a trip search on the website and view other users' shared workouts as well as workouts from ''[[Bicycling Magazine]]''. These routes can be downloaded from the website. The phone application has a race-against-yourself feature that enables the user to compare their times and distances multiple times over the same track.

== Reviews ==
Allsport GPS has been mentioned in print and internet publications such as ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men’s Health Magazine]]''{{citation needed|date=August 2008}} and ''[[The New York Times|The New York Times Online]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/12/04/technology/techspecial2/1205-ACCESS_5.html | work=The New York Times | title=Gifts Ideas That Find Themselves | date=2007-12-04 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 it was named GPS Gadget of the Week by GeoCarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocarta.blogspot.com/2007/03/gps-gadget-of-week-allsport-gps.html |title=GeoCarta: GPS Gadget of the Week: AllSport GPS |publisher=Geocarta.blogspot.com |date=2007-03-17 |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722110525/http://geocarta.blogspot.com/2007/03/gps-gadget-of-week-allsport-gps.html| archivedate= 22 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both  Fred Zahradnik from [http://gps.about.com/od/mobilephonegps/fr/trimbleoutdoors.htm About.com GPS] and ''Laptop Magazine'' gave Allsport GPS 4/5 stars in 2007.&lt;ref name="laptopmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/review/software/trimble-outdoors-allsportgps.aspx |title=Trimble Outdoors AllSportGPS, a review of Trimble Outdoors AllSportGPS |publisher=Laptopmag.com |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722081158/http://www.laptopmag.com/review/software/trimble-outdoors-allsportgps.aspx| archivedate= 22 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basalt Rocks''' ({{lang-tr|Bazalt Kayalıkları}}) are [[volcanic rock]] [[outcrop]]s in the form of [[columnar basalt]] located in [[Sinop Province]], northern Turkey. The area is a registered [[List of natural monuments of Turkey|natural monument of the country]].

It is {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the center of [[Boyabat]] in Sinop Province, and situated in Fındıklık location nearbay Kurusaray village.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

The basalt columns were formed about 3-5 million years ago according to research carried out by geologists from [[General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (Turkey)|Mineral Research and Exploration]] Co. (MTA) and [[Dokuz Eylül University]].

The basalt formations are situated in three neighboring valleys. The  vertically-jointed basalt columns are in [[polygon]]al form as [[rectangular prism|rectangular]], [[pentagonal prism|pentagonal]] and [[hexagonal prism]]s, and are {{convert|30|-|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; It covers an area of {{convert|10.249|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The formation, structure, and the outlook of the basalt rocks are [[List of places with columnar jointed volcanics|rare examples in the world]]. It was declared a protected area of first grade on March 8, 1996 due to its geological and touristic importance. On September 17, 2007, the local administration applied to the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]] for acknowledgement as a natural monument.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; The area was registered a natural monument in 2011.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1259">'''[[Bible Belt]]''' is an informal term for a region in the southeastern and south-central United States in which socially conservative evangelical protestantism is a significant part of the culture.

It is also used more generically for any region of a country that is more conservative and religious than the country as a whole, as in:

== Social geography ==
*[[Bible Belt (Netherlands)]] (Dutch: ''bijbelgordel'' or ''biblebelt''), a strip of land in the Netherlands, which is inhabited mainly by conservative Protestants
*[[Bible Belt (Sweden)]] (Swedish: ''bibelbältet''), an area in southern Sweden around Jönköping, which is more religious than most of Sweden
*[[Bible Belt (Norway)]] (Norwegian: ''bibelbeltet''), the southwestern coastal area of Norway between Aust-Agder and Møre og Romsdal, which is more religious than most of Norway. There is also a "Little Bible Belt"  (''lille bibelbeltet'') in the southeast near the Swedish border, covering Rømskog, Marker and Aremark.

Due to the [[District of Columbia retrocession|return]] of the portion of the District south and west of the [[Potomac River]] to Virginia in 1846, twelve of these markers are now within Virginia.

==Geography==
The District of Columbia (initially, the Territory of Columbia) was originally specified to be a square {{convert|100|sqmi|km2}} in area, with the [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] between the corners of the square running north-south and east-west, and having its southern corner at the southern tip of [[Jones Point]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]], at the confluence of the [[Potomac River]] and [[Hunting Creek]] (later the site of the [[Jones Point Lighthouse]]).&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;{{cite book|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013259695;view=1up;seq=5|last=National Capital Planning Commission|year=1976|title=Boundary markers of the Nation's Capital: a proposal for their preservation &amp; protection : a National Capital Planning Commission Bicentennial report|place=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Capital Planning Commission; For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, [[United States Government Publishing Office|United States Government Printing Office]]|oclc=3772302|accessdate=2016-02-22|via=[[HathiTrust]]}} [https://www.hathitrust.org/digital_library Digital Library].&lt;/ref&gt; The sides of the square are each {{convert|10|mi|km}} long.  The specified orientation results in a diamond shape for the District's original boundaries on most [[map]]s.

The north-south axis of the District's current boundaries extends southward from the District's north corner near [[Maryland Route 410|East-West Highway (Maryland Route 410)]], travels between 17th and 18th Streets, N.W., and continues south across the [[National Mall]] to the far shore of the [[Potomac River]]; the east-west axis is between the present [[Constitution Avenue]] and C Street, N.E. and N.W.&lt;ref&gt;The north-south axis is a straight line connecting the north and south cornerstones of the original District of Columbia. The east-west axis is a straight line connecting the east and west cornerstones of the original District of Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; These axes are not the lines used to define the four geographical quadrants of the District ([[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|N.E.]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|N.W.]], [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|S.E.]], and [[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|S.W.]]), commonly appended to Washington street addresses, which are delimited generally by [[North Capitol Street]], [[East Capitol Street]], [[South Capitol Street]], and the National Mall.  The center of the square is west of the [[President's Park#The Ellipse .28President.27s Park South.29|Ellipse]] and north of the Mall, within the grounds of the headquarters of the [[Organization of American States]].&lt;ref&gt;Coordinates of the center of the square of the original District of Columbia: {{coord|38.89303|-77.0407632|format=dms|type:landmark|name=Center of the square of the original District of Columbia}}. The center of the square of the original District of Columbia is the crossing of the north-south axis line and the east-west axis line.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the District of Columbia [[geographic information system]] (GIS) program completed a project to map the District's boundary using [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and contemporary survey technology at an accuracy of +/- {{convert|5|cm|in|2}} horizontally and +/- {{convert|9|cm|in|2}} vertically. The GIS program's survey found that (listed in the order in which Andrew Ellicott's team performed the initial boundary survey):

* Along the northwest boundary, the stones are outside the existing boundary ranging from {{convert|4.43|ft|m|2}} to {{convert|9.6|ft|m|2}}
* Along the northeast boundary, the stones are inside the existing boundary ranging from {{convert|6.6|ft|m|2}} to {{convert|8.4|ft|m|2}}
* Along the southeast boundary, the stones are outside the existing boundary ranging from  {{convert|12.75|ft|m|2}} to {{convert|18.48|ft|m|2}}

The overall accuracy of the historic survey and the survey using 2011 technology produced remarkably similar results. For example, the distance between Southeast stones numbers 6 and 7 is {{convert|5,280.824|ft|m|4}}, almost exactly one [[mile]] ({{convert|5,280|ft|m|4}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[http://octo.dc.gov/DC/OCTO/ Office of the Chief Technology Officer]|url=https://octo.dc.gov/release/historic-review-district%e2%80%99s-boundary-stones-using-gps-and-modern-survey-technology|title=Historic Review of the District’s Boundary Stones Using GPS and Modern Survey Technology: Accurately mapping the District of Columbia boundary for the DC GIS|publisher=Office of the Chief Technology Officer: Government of the [[District of Columbia]] (DC.gov)|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011190244/https://octo.dc.gov/release/historic-review-district%e2%80%99s-boundary-stones-using-gps-and-modern-survey-technology|archive-date=October 11, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey team then cleared a corridor along the boundary route to facilitate [[surveying]], traveling clockwise from the point and placing [[sandstone]] boundary markers at the four corners and at intervals of approximately one mile.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bedini 1970"/&gt; The markers were [[quarry|quarried]] near [[Aquia Creek]] in Virginia.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt; Most weighed about a half-ton at their emplacement; the four cornerstones were slightly larger.

The side of a boundary marker that faced the federal territory was inscribed "Jurisdiction of the United States" and with the distance in miles and [[Rod (unit)|pole]]s from the previous corner stone. The opposite side was marked with the name of the border state: [[Virginia]] or [[Maryland]].

On January 1, 1793, Andrew Ellicott submitted to the commissioners a report that stated that the boundary survey had been completed and that all of the boundary marker stones had been set in place.  Ellicott's report described the marker stones and contained a map that showed the boundaries and topographical features of the Territory of Columbia,  The map identified the locations within the Territory of the planned City of Washington and its major streets, as well as the location of each boundary marker stone.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&amp;pg=PA57|last=Steward|first=John|year=1898|title=Early Maps and Surveyors of the City of Washington, D.C.|journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society|volume=2|page=57|oclc=40326234|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|last=Ellicott|first=Andrew|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/88694130/|title=Territory of Columbia|work=Maps|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1793|accessdate=2016-10-22|quote=Notes: ...

===Protection===
In 1906, Fred E. Woodward read a paper to the [[Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|Columbia Historical Society]] that described the history, location and conditions of each of the remaining boundary stones, together with photographs of each.  His paper concluded by recommending that the stones be protected by placing small fences around each one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodward|first=Fred E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7PJmNmjRgoC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;|title=A Ramble Along the Boundary Stones of the District of Columbia with a Camera|pages=63–87|work=Records of the Columbia Historical Society|year=1907|volume=10|publisher=Columbia Historical Society|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1909,  Ernest A. Shuster of the [[United States Geological Survey]] wrote an article for the ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic Magazine]]'' that described his visits to the 36 remaining boundary stones and that urged their protection and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=Ernest A., U.S. Geological Survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY9-AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;f=false|title=The Original Boundary Stones of the District of Columbia|work=National Geographic Magazine|editor=Gilbert H. Grosvenor|pages=356–359|volume=20|year=1909|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, various local chapters of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) began to place fences around each of the markers.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;&lt;ref name=DAR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=boundarystones/&gt; The DAR also placed at the exact center of the original federal territory a marker stone that was located about a half of a mile from the [[White House]] and was near the DAR's [[Memorial Continental Hall]].&lt;ref name=DAR1/&gt;

===Historical designations===
One Virginia boundary marker was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976, and another in 1980.  In 1991, the remaining Virginia boundary markers were added to the National Register in response to a [[National Register of Historic Places#Multiple Property Submission|Multiple Property Submission]] that the Virginia DAR had submitted.&lt;ref name=Virginia1&gt;(1) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008205948/https://www.nps.gov/nR/listings/Weekly_Register_List_1991.pdf|archivedate=October 8, 2016|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/Weekly_Register_List_1991.pdf|title=Virginia|work=Weekly List of Listed Properties: 1/28/91 through 2/01/91: United States Department of the Interior: National Park Service: National Register of Historic Places|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|title=Southwest No. 1, Southwest No. 2, Southwest No. 3, Southwest No. 4 and Southwest No. 5 Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702221431/http://nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/VA/Alexandria/state.html|archivedate=July 2, 2011|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/va/Alexandria/state.html|work=VIRGINIA - Alexandria County|publisher=National Register of Historic Places.com|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;br&gt;(3)  {{cite web|title=Southwest No. 5, Southwest No. 6 and Southwest No. 7 Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia and West Cornerstone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724224104/http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/VA/Arlington/state2.html|archivedate=July 21, 2010|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/va/Arlington/state.html|work=VIRGINIA - Arlington County|publisher=National Register of Historic Places.com|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;br&gt;(4) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218110510/http://nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/VA/Falls%2BChurch/state.html|archivedate=December 18, 2010|title=West Cornerstone|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/va/Falls+Church/state.html|work=VIRGINIA - Falls Church County|publisher=National Register of Historic Places.com|accessdate=January 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|last=Hynak|first=Barbara A.

====Preservation efforts====
In 1976, the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] published a report that described the history and condition of each boundary stone.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;  The report recommended that measures be taken to assure the stones' preservation.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt; In 1990 and 1991, a  resurveying team to celebrate the boundary markers' bicentennial located two of the then-missing stones.&lt;ref name=boundarystones/&gt;

In 1995, the [[Northern Virginia]] Boundary Stones Committee, whose establishment the [[Virginia Planning District Commissions|Northern Virginia Regional Commission]] (NVRC) had requested, issued a list of recommendations intended to document and preserve the 14 boundary stones that were located in Virginia. The Committee included representatives of the State of Maryland and of [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties and the cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|author=Northern Virginia Boundary Stones Committee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725094237/http://www.boundarystones.org/read.php?page=novabostco_1995%2Fhtml|archivedate=2011-07-25|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/read.php?page=novabostco_1995.html|title=1994-1995 Findings and Recommendations of the Northern Virginia Boundary Stones Committee|date=September 1995|publisher=boundarystones.org|accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/novabostco_1995.pdf|format=pdf|title=1994-1995 Findings and Recommendations of the Northern Virginia Boundary Stones Committee|date=September 1995|publisher=boundarystones.org|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the NVRC announced that four Virginia local governments, including Arlington and Fairfax counties and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church, had agreed to help fund a project to protect and preserve the boundary stones by providing matching funds to a Transportation Enhancement Grant that the [[District Department of Transportation]] (DDOT) had received from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHA). The announcement stated that the NVRC was working on an agreement with the DDOT, the [[National Park Service]] and the FHA to administer the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novaregion.org/Archive.aspx?ysnExecuteSearch=1&amp;txtKeywords=Preserve+DC+Boundary+Markers&amp;lngArchiveMasterID=0&amp;txtDateRange=&amp;dtiStartDate=08%2F14%2F2008&amp;dtiEndDate=08%2F15%2F2008|title=Northern Virginia Regional Commission Leads Project to Preserve DC Boundary Markers |publisher=Northern Virginia Regional Commission |date=2008-08-14 |work=News Release |accessdate=2011-11-19}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119020528/https://www.novaregion.org/Archive.aspx?ysnExecuteSearch=1&amp;txtKeywords=Preserve+DC+Boundary+Markers&amp;lngArchiveMasterID=0&amp;txtDateRange=&amp;dtiStartDate=08%2F14%2F2008&amp;dtiEndDate=08%2F15%2F2008|date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comment stated: "''Stones laid by Benjamin Banneker in the 1790s are still standing''" ''Actually:'' ''Ellicott, a prominent professional surveyor, hired Benjamin Banneker, an astronomer and mathematician from Maryland, to make the astronomical observations and calculations necessary to establish the south corner of the square at Jones Point in Alexandria. According to legend, "Banneker fixed the position of the first stone by lying on his back to find the exact starting point for the survey ... and plotting six stars as they crossed his spot at a particular time of night." From there, Ellicott's team (minus Banneker, who worked only on the south corner) embarked on a forty mile journey, surveying ten-mile lines first to the northwest, then the northeast, next southeast, and finally southwest back toward the starting point, clearing twenty feet of land on each side of the boundary.'' The comment cited ''http://www.boundarystones.org'' as the source of its information.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the project, in January 2015 a DDOT crew unearthed a stone buried in 1962 that had replaced Southeast No. 8, with the intention of cleaning and restoring the marker.&lt;ref name=restoration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/video/#!/news/local/History-Unearthed--Boundary-Stones-of-D-C-/290142041|last=Sherwood|first=Tom|title=History Unearthed: Boundary Stones of D.C.|publisher=[[WRC-TV|NBC 4 Washington, D.C.]]|format=video|date=January 28, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016, the stone was replaced by a new stone that presumably replicated the appearance of the original stone when the original was new.&lt;ref name=number8&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015145159/http://boundarystones.org/view.php?stone=SE8|archivedate=October 15, 2016|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/view.php?stone=SE8|title=SE8 (with 2016 photograph of new replica stone)|work=Boundary Stones of the District of Columbia|publisher=boundary stones.org|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2319">[[Image:Lincoln Sea map.png|thumb|300px|Map of Cape Columbia and the Lincoln Sea.]]

'''Cape Columbia''' is the northernmost point of land of [[Canada]], located on [[Ellesmere Island]] in the [[Qikiqtaaluk Region]] of [[Nunavut]]. It marks the westernmost coastal point of [[Lincoln Sea]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. It is the world's northernmost point of land outside [[Greenland]] and the distance to the [[North Pole]] is {{convert|769|km|abbr=on}}. 

==Human History==

In 1876, [[Pelham Aldrich]] was the first European to reach Cape Columbia. He was a lieutenant with the [[British Arctic Expedition|expedition (1875-76)]] of British explorer [[George Nares]]. 

=== Peary ===
[[Robert Peary]] chose the Cape as the location for the northernmost depot of his final attempt to reach the Pole (1909), not only for its proximity but because it is located far enough west to be out of the ice current setting down [[Robeson Channel]]. From Cape Columbia his party planned to strike straight north over the ice of the Arctic Sea. His winter camp and ship the ''Roosevelt'' were situated some {{convert|90|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} southeast, at [[Cape Sheridan]] near [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]].

Peary's sledge divisions left the Roosevelt from February 15 to 22, 1909, rendezvoused at Cape Columbia, and on March 1 the expedition left Cape Columbia, heading across the Arctic Ocean for the Pole. The [[84th parallel north|84th parallel]] was crossed on March 18, the 86th on March 23.  Peary returned to land at Cape Columbia again on April 23. Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole has long been subject to doubt. While some polar historians believe that Peary honestly thought he had reached the pole, others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments.

In 2005, King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] stepped down from the throne to make way for his Son [[Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck]] to lead the kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The new king studied in Britain and various universities in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/prince-charming-is-now-king-of-bhutan-profile-to-go-with-celebrations-in-bhutan-as-new-king-is-crowned-lead_100115869.html|title = ‘Prince charming’ is now king of Bhutan|date = 2008-11-06|website = Thaindian News|publisher = IANS|access-date = 2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coronation and Centenary Park was built to honour our new king. Ashi Chimi Yangzom Wangchuck inaugurated the Centenary and Coronation Park on 26 September 2006. It is positioned in the middle of [[Changlimithang]] ground and Wangchu River. It is built on an area of 5.6 acre of land running along the banks of river Wangchu. The park was formed by footpaths made of stones, canopies and benches. There are small swings and slides, a miniature basketball court and a small sand football ground. Not only that the park is filled with gardens of more than sixty species of flower and trees. During the evening the lights are lit up by the [[Thimphu]] Power Corporation of [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashi Chimi Yangzom Wangchuck inaugurates the Coronation Park|url=http://www.bbs.com.bt/Ashi%20Chimi%20Yangzom%20Wangchuck%20inaugurates%20the%20Coronation%20Park.html|publisher=BBS|accessdate=2013-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103051927/http://www.bbs.com.bt/Ashi%20Chimi%20Yangzom%20Wangchuck%20inaugurates%20the%20Coronation%20Park.html|archivedate=2008-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walking Buddha==
A 45 feet tall statue of a [[Buddha]] walking was inaugurated on 13 April 2012 which symbolizing the celebration of the 84th Birth Anniversary of Thailand’s King and also the wedding anniversary of His Majesty the King. It is also believed to have been constructed for the people to pursue happiness. The inauguration was ended by lighting candles and reciting prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walking Buddha at the Centenary Park|url=http://www.bhutanmajestictravel.com/news/2012/walking-buddha-at-the-centenary-park.html|publisher=Bhutan Majestic Travel|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other attractions==

A Centenary Farmers Market located two minutes from the park is the perfect place to shop for groceries and almost any household items for a reasonable prize. There is also a national football stadium locally known as [[Changlimithang Stadium]] where it is served as a multi-propose stadium for football matches, archery matches and to celebrate exceptional occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Changlimithang Stadium]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">'''Dalongdong''' ({{zh|t=大龍峒|p=dàlóngdòng}}), or '''Toalongpong''' ({{zh|t=大龍泵||poj=Tōa-lông-pōng}}; and variants 大浪泵/大隆同), is an old village in historical [[Taipei]] located nears the narrows of the intersection between the [[Keelung River|Keelung]] and [[Tamsui River]]s. The district has since been merged with the newer [[Twatutia]] district in the south during the [[Qing dynasty]] to form [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong District]].

The village, officially created in 1853 (3rd year of the [[Xianfeng Emperor]]), covered the area extending from the Chen Teacher's abode ({{lang|zh|陳悅記祖宅}}) and beyond the area of ''sishisikan'' (四十四坎) and the [[Taipei Confucius Temple]]. During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the villages of Twatutia, Toalongpong, and [[Wanhua District|Bangka]] were combined with the [[Walls of Taipeh|walled city of Taipeh]] (in present-day [[Zhongzheng District]]) and incorporated into present-day Taipei city. Although this district now exists only historically, its name still officially remains in the [[Dalongdong Baoan Temple]] and on bus numbers 303 and 669 of the [[Taipei bus|Taipei bus system]].

==Name==
Although the history of the village likely preceded [[Dutch Formosa]] rule, its existence was first recorded during this time as '''Pourompon''' (from the [[Basay language]]). This gave rise to the names ''Paronpon'' ({{zh|c=巴浪泵|poj=Pa-lông-pōng|labels=yes}}), ''Daronpon'' ({{zh|c=大龍泵|poj=Toā-lông-pōng|labels=no}})&lt;ref&gt;{{holodict|40034|e=大龍泵}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other variants, when the area came under [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynasty rule]]. The name was once again changed ({{zh|c=大隆同|poj=Toā-liông-tông|labels=no}}) in 1802 (7th year of [[Jiaqing Emperor]]), by settlers from [[Tong'an District]] in [[Xiamen]]. It was during this period that the Baoan Temple was first constructed. The name finally settled in its present form ({{zh|t=大龍峒|labels=no}}) during the reign of the [[Daoguang Emperor]] (1820-1850) when further settlement occurred in the area.

'''Environmental data rescue''' is a collection of processes, including [[photography]] and [[Image scanner|scanning]], that stores historical and modern environmental [[data]] in a usable [[File format|format]]. The data is then analyzed and used in [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]]. Historical [[weather]] information helps meteorologists and climatologists understand past trends in weather changes, which helps them forecast and predict future weather.  

One method takes digital photographs of environmental datum stored on paper medium and then ships the images to a facility where they are entered into a [[database]].

Throughout the world, some estimate 700,000 pieces of data are lost every day due to [[ink]]s fading, [[paper]] deteriorating, [[magnetic tape]] [[cross-talk]] etc. A rough estimate of 100 billion parameter values that are still on paper exists, [[microfiche]], [[microfilm]], and magnetic tape that are in a format unusable by computers and scientists alike, which need to be [[digitized]]. This data is stored on a variety of media from paper, microfiche, to older magnetic tapes that are going bad. 

Once data is digitized, it can be used to help a large range of people from [[farmer]]s to [[engineer]]s and in scientific pursuits such as climate studies. 
 
[[National Climatic Data Center]] is the current collection point for this data within the [[National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration]].

Historical Environmental Data are also used as a basis for "Disease Vectorization" where the areal spread of airborne diseases are correlated to historical weather conditions so that in future outbreaks, health care teams can predict the direction and rate of spread of the disease so that remedial actions can begin before the disease reaches the vulnerable population. Historic data are also used in designing structures such as bridges and buildings, assist the 1.8 billion subsistence farmers throughout the world better plan crops alleviating starvation.
The International Environmental Data Rescue Organization, a 501(C)(3) non-profit organization has already participated in the rescue and digitization of one million historic weather observations in Africa and South America:  http://IEDRO.ORG

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8571">The '''Evesham Custom''' is a distinctive form of customary [[leasehold]] tenure used in the [[market garden]]s of [[Evesham]], [[Worcestershire]]. It is the most well-known of a [[Tenant-right|number of former local practises]], such as the [[Custom of Ulster|Ulster Custom]]&lt;ref name=jpaes&gt;''Journal of Proceedings of the Agricultural Economics Society'', v1-10, 122&lt;/ref&gt; and North Lincolnshire Custom.&lt;ref name=currie&gt;Currie, ''The Economic Theory of Agricultural Land Tenure'', p.77&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying principle of such customs was that the tenant could be granted compensation for any improvements they made to the land they leased, since the [[common law]] did not provide any such protection.

==Principles==
[[File:Greenhouses, Bretforton - geograph.org.uk - 52650.jpg|thumb|right|Greenhouses near [[Bretforton]]. The Vale of Evesham is noted for a long history of market gardening.]]
Local customs supplementary to the usual law of leases, such as the Evesham Custom, were seen as having existed over generations in particular areas, being defined as something "to which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary".&lt;ref name=currie/&gt; In the case of Evesham, the custom provided not only a lifetime security of tenure (in a period when market garden leases were generally from year to year, traditionally renewable at [[Michaelmas]]) and allowed certain improvements to be made without the landlord's permission, but also ensured that a tenant could be compensated through a system of personal bargaining.

A tenant of a market garden, or other land, under the Evesham Custom has the right to sell their tenancy if the landlord gives their approval, including the right to nominate the new tenant. The payment (known as the "ingoing")&lt;ref name=badsey&gt;Sparrow, T. [http://badsey.net/past/custom.htm The Evesham Custom], accessed 27-07-16&lt;/ref&gt; made by the incoming tenant includes compensation for any improvements the outgoing tenant has made, such as the planting of fruit trees. The payment also includes a premium for receiving a tenancy offering lifetime security. The entire transaction is made between the outgoing and incoming tenant, with the landlord not involved beyond giving their approval. Furthermore, if the landlord does not accept the new tenant, they are obliged to compensate the outgoing tenant to ensure they did not suffer any financial loss.&lt;ref name=badsey/&gt;

This "added value" had the effect of encouraging tenants to further improve their land, by ensuring that they could still realise the full value of the improvements they made if they ended their tenancy. Through this compensation payment and by giving security of tenure, the Custom also gave tenants confidence to invest in crops, like [[asparagus]], that took several years to reach maturity.&lt;ref name=badsey/&gt;

From the larger landowner's perspective, the Custom removed from the landlord the trouble and expense of making improvements themselves and the need to negotiate the tenancies of many small garden plots. The Custom helped ensure that Evesham developed a flourishing market gardening industry by the late 19th century, with the price of the tenantright under the Custom often exceeding the freehold value of the land itself.&lt;ref name=sidwell&gt;Sidwell, R. "[http://badsey.net/past/sidwell.htm A Short History of Commercial Agriculture in the Vale of Evesham]", ''Vale of Evesham Historical Society Research Papers'', 1969, 2, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Evesham has a long history of market gardening activity, with some evidence that it was first popularised in the mid 17th century by the activities of a local landowner, Francis Bernadi (former Resident for the [[Republic of Genoa]]).&lt;ref name=sidwell/&gt; By the early 19th century there were a number of gardeners and fruit growers in the Vale. The Custom first appeared in this period, though it was initially understood to be of the nature of a [[gentlemen's agreement]] and the landlord had no legal obligation to accept it.&lt;ref name=badsey/&gt; Pressure to formalise the customary rights of Evesham's market gardeners increased after an 1870s legal dispute between the owner of land near [[Evesham Abbey]] and his tenants, and the basic principles of the Custom were first set down by a special committee of the Vale of Evesham Agricultural Society in 1880.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;Robinson, G. ''Late Victorian Agriculture in the Vale of Evesham'', 1976, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although definite records of the Evesham Custom first appear in the early-mid 19th century, some commentators in the past have assumed that the rights originated from "some earlier epoch".&lt;ref name=martin&gt;Martin, J. M. "The Social and Economic Origins of the Vale of Evesham Market Gardening Industry", ''The Agricultural History Review'', v.33 (1985), 46&lt;/ref&gt; The ruralist writer [[H. J. Massingham]], who was familiar with the operation of the Custom, expressed a belief that the tenant rights of Evesham were a direct descendant of those of the "small masters" who from the early mediaeval period practised cultivation in open fields owned by the Abbey.&lt;ref name=massingham&gt;Massingham, H. J. "Cottagers" in ''Distributist Perspectives'', vII, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Massingham commented that after the 1874 agricultural depression, the area's large landlords split their farms up and let smaller parcels of land to labourers who were protected by the survival of ancient customary rights and by the local influence of [[Joseph Arch]].&lt;ref name=massingham/&gt;  J. M. Martin has noted that an "archaic" form of life leasehold was practised in [[Pershore]] by the estates of the [[Duke of Westminster]], where wills of the 18th century spoke of a "tenant right of renewing", and that a similarly archaic form of [[copyhold]] tenure was found in [[Shipston-on-Stour]] on land belonging to the Dean and Chapter of [[Worcester]]. Both had survived in areas where large estates had to manage many small tenancies, as in Evesham, and it is possible that a similar local tradition was the source of the rights enjoyed by the Vale of Evesham's market gardeners.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Another view states that the Custom originated on a single small estate at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and subsequently spread throughout the district.&lt;ref name=robinson108&gt;Robinson, ''Agricultural Change'', 1988, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of recognition was given by the [[Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908]], but the Evesham Custom was eventually given stautory expression in s.68 of the [[Agricultural Holdings Act 1948]], which granted tenant farmers security of tenure for life. There were proposals to abolish it in 1949, which generated protest from fruit growers and market gardeners, and which were not eventually followed through.&lt;ref name=fg&gt;''The Fruit-Grower'', Nov 3 1949, 761&lt;/ref&gt; The rights continued under the [[Agricultural Holdings Act 1986]], but on the introduction of the [[Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995]], it was required to create a special exclusion to ensure the continued working of the Evesham Custom, as otherwise an outgoing tenant would not be able to offer a tenancy to an incomer on equivalent terms and security.&lt;ref name=rodgers67&gt;Rodgers, C. ''Agricultural Law'', Bloomsbury, 2015, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==

Although the number of market gardens in the Vale of Evesham has declined sharply since the mid 20th century, the Evesham Custom is still observed in tenancies. In 1995, at the reading of the Agricultural Tenancies Bill, the local MP [[Michael Spicer]] observed that there were still around 420 tenants potentially affected, and noted that they could expect to realise "ingoing" payments of £200-£300 an acre (at that time, 50% of the land's freehold value).&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1995/feb/06/agricultural-tenancies-bill-lords Agricultural Tenancies Bill]&lt;/ref&gt; As market gardening has further declined it has become more common for landlords to take over the land at the end of tenancies, and by the mid 2000s, there was evidence that solicitors employed by some landlords were attempting to avoid the traditional operation of the Custom by making minimal compensation payments to outgoing tenants.&lt;ref name=mumford&gt;Barnett, G. "Richard delves into threatened Custom", ''Evesham Journal'', 15 Jan 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GPS Drawing,''' also known as '''GPS Art''' and '''Strava Art''', is a method of [[drawing]] where an uses a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) device and follows a pre planned route to create a large-scale picture or text on a map.  Artists usually run or cycle the route though cars, vans, and aeroplanes are used to create larger pieces. 

==Planning==
GPS artists can spend many hours finding a certain image or text hidden in a map or can sometimes simply see an existing image in a map due to [[Pareidolia]].  In many cities and towns the road layout and landscape restricts the routes available so artisst have to find creative ways to show their pictures or characters.  In cities where there is a strong grid pattern an 8-bit style or [[pixelated]] images can be created of almost any object or shape.  Many artists will create paper or digital maps of their route to follow on their journey.

== Artistic Style ==
There are many approaches to GPS Drawing which an artist can choose depending or their means of travel and the landscape around them.

==== Roads, Trails, and Paths Only ====
This style uses only pre existing roads, paths, trails, etc. which can make it more challenging to find a route and plan the artwork.  On the other hand following these paths makes navigation during the journey much easier and the artwork is more likely to reflect the original plan.  This is how the majority of GPS artworks are made.

==== Freehand on Open Ground or in Open Air ====
Freehand GPS drawing is where artist creates a shape on open ground without following existing paths which means the artist has to watch their progress in real time on their GPS device.  Artists can run or cycle over open ground such as parks, fields, and car parks.  Artists in cars and other motor vehicles can draw shapes on large open areas such as deserts, airfields, and beaches.  Almost all artworks created by aircraft and watercraft use this technique as they are not restricted by human and [[physical geography]].  Freehand GPS drawing opens unlimited possibilities but without [[Waypoint|waypoints]] and existing routes it is very easy to loose track of your progress and make mistakes.

==== Pausing the GPS Device ====
By pausing the GPS device and restarting it at different locations an artist is able to draw straight lines across the map though the built environment and over physical barriers.  Though this can create very striking images and open up new possibilities in a city most artists do not use technique.

==== Adding Extra Images ====
Some artists add extra images or lines to the map after they have created the route.  They can do this to simply add [[googly eyes]] to an animal or face or go further add lines and other features which help viewers see what they have drawn.  Other times an artist will show a photo or other image alongside their drawing if it is not clear at first glance what has been drawn.

== Display ==
Most people use a route mapping app or other service to display their drawing online and to share on social media.  Popular apps include Strava, Map My Run, and Garmin.  Many artists also import their route into [[Google Maps]], [[OpenStreetMap|Open Streetmap]], Viweranger, and other map services before capturing the image to display and share.  This gives the artist the option of expanding and cropping the image, orienting it another way, or tilting the map to add perspective.  Some artists use [[False color|false color maps]] then choose contrasting colors for their route to create vivid images.

==Examples and Artists==
The idea was first implemented by artists Hugh Pryor and [[Jeremy Wood]], whose work includes a 13-mile wide fish in [[Oxfordshire]], spiders with legs 21 miles long in [[Port Meadow, Oxford]],&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; and "the world's biggest 'IF'": a pair of letters, "I", which goes from [[Iffley]] in [[Oxford]] to [[Southampton]] and back, and "F" which traverses through the Ifield Road in [[London]] down to [[Iford, East Sussex]], through [[Iford]] and back up through [[Ifold]] in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; The total length is 537&amp;nbsp;km, and the height of the drawing in [[typographic unit]]s is 319,334,400 [[point (typography)|point]]s.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|title=2003: The 3rd Annual Year in Ideas; GPS Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-gps-art.html|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical computer fonts at standard resolutions are between 8 and 12 points.

In early 2014 programmer Joe Rosen released a GPS-A-Sketch GPS sketching app for iOS, through the iTunes App Store.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 2016, musicians [[Shaun Buswell]] &amp; Erik Nyberg travelled around the [[United Kingdom]] drawing a 400+ mile penis across [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theocelot.co.uk/two-musicians-have-drawn-a-giant-wedding-tackle-during-their-uk-tour-using-gps-tracking/|title=Two musicians have drawn a giant “wedding tackle” during their UK tour using GPS tracking|publisher=The Ocelot|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 artist Nathan Rae created a #WeLoveManchester piece as part of the cememorations of the [[Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester Arena Bombing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/strava-map-manchester-heart-runner-14694321|title=The runner who made a 67-mile Strava heart all around Manchester|last=Johnson|first=Helen|date=2018-05-23|work=men|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific GPS artists is the artist known as [https://www.instagram.com/wallygpx/ WalleyGPX] who, as of October 2018, has created over 500 pieces of GPS art.  He uses pencil and paper to plan the routes around his home city of [[Baltimore]] which he then creates by bicycle.

A '''GPS tracking unit''' is a [[GPS device|navigation device]], normally carried by a moving vehicle or person, that uses the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) to track the device’s movements and determine its location. The recorded location data can either be stored within the tracking unit or transmitted to an [[Internet]]-connected device using the [[Cellular Network routing|cellular]] ([[GPRS]] or [[SMS]]), [[radio]], or [[satellite modem]] embedded in the unit. This allows the location to be displayed against a map backdrop either in real time or when analysing the track later, using '''GPS tracking software'''. Data tracking software is available for [[smartphone]]s with GPS capability.&lt;ref name=gcc&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Cycle Computer v3|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=424423|publisher=Axivo Inc|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GPS tracking unit architecture==
A GPS "track me" essentially contains a GPS module that receives the [[GPS signal]] and calculates the coordinates. For data loggers, it contains large memory to store the coordinates. Data pushers additionally contain a GSM/GPRS/CDMA/LTE modem to transmit this information to a central computer either via SMS or [[GPRS]] in form of IP packets. Satellite-based GPS tracking units will operate anywhere on the globe using satellite technology such as [[GlobalStar]] or [[Iridium]] and do not require a cellular connection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lonestartracking.com/index.php/satellite-gps-trackers-work/. Retrieved 08/09/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are three types of GPS trackers, though most [[GPS Phone|GPS-equipped phones]] can work in any of these modes depending on [[mobile application]]s installed:

===Data loggers===
[[File:Royaltek rgm-3800 IMGP9822 OSM.jpg|thumb|Typical GPS logger]]
GPS loggers [[Data logging|log]] the position of the device at regular intervals in its internal memory. GPS loggers may have either a [[memory card]] slot, or internal flash memory card and a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port. Some act as a [[USB flash drive]], which allows [[download]]ing of the track log data for further analysis in a computer. The track list or [[point of interest]] list may be in [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] or other format.

Most [[digital camera]]s save the time a photo was taken. Provided the camera clock was reasonably accurate or used GPS as its time source, this time can be correlated with GPS log data, to provide an accurate location. This can be added to the [[Exif]] metadata in the picture file. [[List of cameras which provide geotagging|Cameras with GPS receiver built in]] can directly produce such a [[geotagged photograph]].

In some [[Private investigator|private investigation]] cases, [[data loggers]] are used to keep track of a target vehicle. The private investigator need not follow the target so closely, and always has a backup source of data.

===Data pushers===
Data pusher is the most common type of GPS tracking unit, used for [[asset tracking]], [[personal tracking]] and [[vehicle tracking]] systems.

Also known as a ''GPS beacon'', this kind of device [[Push technology|pushes]] (i.e. "sends") the position of the device as well as other information like [[speed]] or [[altitude]] at regular intervals, to a determined [[Server (computing)|server]], that can store and instantly analyze the data.

A [[GPS navigation device]] and a mobile phone sit side-by-side in the same box, powered by the same battery. At regular intervals, the phone sends a text message via SMS or GPRS, containing the data from the GPS receiver. Newer GPS-integrated [[smartphone]]s running GPS tracking software can turn the phone into a data pusher (or logger) device. As of 2009, [[open source]] and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] applications are available for common [[Java ME]] enabled phones, [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], Windows Mobile, and Symbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Eriadne.org tracking system|url=http://www.eriadne.org/|accessdate=2010-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109042536/http://www.eriadne.org/|archivedate=2010-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=open-gpstracker A GPS tracking Android App: Build to be extensible and Free|url=http://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traccar Client - free open source Android tracker|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.traccar.client|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most 21st-century GPS trackers provide data "push" technology, enabling sophisticated GPS tracking in business environments, specifically organizations that employ a mobile workforce, such as a commercial fleet. Typical GPS tracking systems used in commercial [[fleet management]] have two core parts: location hardware (or tracking device) and tracking software. This combination is often referred to as an [[Automatic Vehicle Location]] system. The tracking device is most often hardwire installed in the vehicle, connected to the [[CAN-bus]], [[Ignition system]] switch, battery. It allows collection of extra data, which later gets transferred to the [[GPS tracking server]], where it is available for viewing, in most cases via a website accessed over the internet, where fleet activity can be viewed live or historically using digital maps and reports.

GPS tracking systems used in commercial fleets are often configured to transmit location and telemetry input data at a set update rate or when an event (door open/close, auxiliary equipment on/off, [[geofence]] border cross) triggers the unit to transmit data. Live GPS tracking used in commercial fleets generally refers to systems that update regularly at one-minute, two-minute or five-minute intervals while the ignition status is on. Some tracking systems combine timed updates with heading change triggered updates.

GPS tracking solutions such as [[Telematics 2.0]], an [[Internet of Things|IoT]] based [[telematics]] technology for the automotive industry, are being used within mainstream commercial auto insurance.
 
The applications of trackers of this kind include:

'''Personal GPS'''

* [[Law enforcement]]. An arrested suspect out on bail may have to wear a GPS tracker, usually an [[ankle monitor]], as a bail condition. GPS tracking may also be ordered for persons subject to a [[Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|restraining order]].&lt;ref name="wsj27"&gt;{{cite web|title=State budget committee rejects GPS monitoring expansion|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-budget-committee-rejects-gps-monitoring-expansion/article_17f6213e-5584-5d90-9e57-81b4f147a89b.html|work=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=14 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegis27"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 165.94|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/165/94|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=14 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Race control. In some sports, such as [[gliding]], participants are required to carry a tracker. In particular, this allows race officials to know if the participants are cheating, taking unexpected shortcuts, and how far apart they are. This use was illustrated in the movie ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''.
* [[Espionage]]/[[surveillance]]. A tracker on a person or vehicle allows movements to be tracked. This application is used by [[private investigator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Tracking and the Law|url=http://www.salgadoinvestigations.com/blog/gps-trackers/gps-tracking-the-law-uk-only/|website=Salgado Investigations|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* These devices are also used by some parents to track their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Lets Parents Track Kids' Every Move|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5725196|author=Tovia Smith|date=August 29, 2006|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some devices can send text alerts to the parents for every unexpected place visited by the child.
* [https://gpstrack.co.za/product/gpst05gts/ Vehicle tracking]. Some people use GPS Trackers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpstrack.co.za|title=GPS Track {{!}} Live GPS Tracking|website=www.gpstrack.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor activity of their own vehicle, especially in the event of a vehicle being used by a friend or family member.
* GPS personal tracking devices are used in the care of the elderly and vulnerable. Devices allow users to call for assistance and optionally allow designated carers to locate the user's position, typically within 5 to 10 meters. Their use helps promote independent living and social inclusion for the elderly. Devices often incorporate either 1-way or 2-way voice communication. Some devices also allow the user to call several phone numbers using pre-programmed speed dial buttons. Trials using GPS personal tracking devices are also underway in several countries for use with sufferers of early-stage dementia.
* Some [[Internet]] [[Web 2.0]] pioneers have created their own personal web pages that show their position constantly, and in real time, on a map within their website. These usually use data push from a GPS enabled cell phone or a personal GPS tracker.
* Sports: the movements of a rambler, cyclist, etc., can be tracked. Statistics such as instantaneous and average speed, and distance traveled, are logged.&lt;ref name=gcc/&gt;
* Adventure sports: GPS tracking devices such as the [[SPOT Satellite Messenger]] are available that allow the position of a person to be tracked. In particular, this allows rescue personnel to locate the carrier. These devices allow the carrier to send messages, even when out of cellular telephone range.&lt;ref name="LiveViewGPS Tracking"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.liveviewgps.com/how+it+works.html |title=How All Satellite Based GPS Trackers Work |last=Karonis |first=George |work=liveviewgps.com |date=2016-09-24 |accessdate=2017-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring employees. GPS-handled tracking devices with a built-in cellphone are used to monitor employees by various companies, especially those engaged in fieldwork.

====Asset tracking====
* Solar Powered. The advantage of some solar powered units is that they have much more power over their lifetime than battery powered units. This gives them the advantage of reporting their position and status much more often than battery units which need to conserve their energy to extend their life. Some wireless solar-powered units, such as the [[RailRider]] can report more than 20,000 times per year and work indefinitely on solar power, eliminating the need to change batteries.
* Battery powered. Asset tracking devices often conserve battery life by reporting in less frequently than vehicle-powered counterparts. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gotrack.com/types-gps-trackers. Retrieved 01/27/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Animal control. When put on a wildlife animal (e.g. in a collar), it allows scientists to study its activities and migration patterns. Vaginal implant transmitters mark the location where pregnant females give birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apt.allenpress.com/aptonline/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=1042-7260&amp;volume=037&amp;issue=03&amp;page=0301|title=Apt Online - Evaluation Of Vaginal Implant Transmitters In Elk (Cervus Elaphus Nelsoni)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GPS Wildlife Tracking|Animal tracking collars]] may also be put on domestic animals, to locate them in case they get lost.

====Aircraft trackers====
Aircraft can be tracked either by [[ADS-B]] (primarily airliners and General Aviation aircraft with ADS-B-out enabled [[Transponder_(aviation)|transponder]]), or by [[FLARM]] data packets picked up by a network of ground stations (primarily used by General Aviation aircraft, gliders and UAVs), both of which are data pushers. ADS-B is to be superseded by ADS-C, a data puller.

===Data pullers===
GPS data pullers are also known as ''GPS transponders''. Unlike data pushers that send the position of the devices at regular intervals ([[push technology]]), these devices are always on, and can be queried as often as required ([[pull technology]]). This technology is not in widespread use, but an example of this kind of device is a computer connected to the [[Internet]] and running [[gpsd]].

These can often be used in the case where the location of the tracker will only need to be known occasionally e.g. placed in property that may be stolen, or that does not have a constant source of energy to send data on a regular basis, like freights or containers.

Data Pullers are coming into more common usage in the form of devices containing a GPS receiver and a cell phone which, when sent a special [[SMS]] message reply to the message with their location.

===Covert GPS trackers===
Covert GPS trackers contain the same electronics as regular GPS trackers but are constructed in such a way as to appear to be an everyday object. One use for covert GPS trackers is for power tool protection, these devices can be concealed within power tool boxes and traced if theft occurs.

[[File:Vyncs OBD-GPS-Tracker-Device.png|thumb|An OBD GPS Tracker being inserted into the OBD-II port of a car.]]

===Vehicle OBD GPS trackers===
OBD GPS trackers plug into the onboard diagnostic (OBD) port of a light or medium duty vehicle. Usually, an OBD GPS tracker draws power from the OBD port itself and contains a built-in antenna along with a GPS module in order to receive the GPS signal. In addition, OBD trackers communicate with the different vehicle subsystems for receiving vehicle diagnostic and fuel consumption related data. A cellular OBD GPS tracker directly communicates with the cell tower in order to send the location and other vehicle performance data to the server over a cellular wireless network. Users can view the information using standalone software or web browser from a desktop/laptop computer or using smartphone apps. A comparative discussion on OBD GPS trackers and generic GPS trackers can be found at [http://www.vyncs.com/Vyncs/BlogPost.aspx?id=3 here].

== United States law ==
In the United States, the use of GPS trackers by government authorities is limited by the [[4th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], so police, for example, usually require a [[search warrant]] in most circumstances. While police have placed GPS trackers in vehicles without warrant, this usage was questioned in court in early 2009.&lt;ref name="warrantless-gps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215800542|title=Court Asked To Disallow Warrantless GPS Tracking |last=Claburn| first=Thomas| date=March 4, 2009| work=InformationWeek |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State of mennessee PUBLIC CHAPTER NO. 169 HOUSE BILL NO. 457|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41663.pdf|work=fas.org|publisher=State of Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use by private citizens is regulated in some states, such as California, where California Penal Code Section 637.7 states: &lt;br/&gt;
(a) No person or entity in this state shall use an electronic tracking device to determine the location or movement of a person. &lt;br/&gt;
(b) This section shall not apply when the registered owner, lesser, or lessee of a vehicle has consented to the use of the electronic tracking device with respect to that vehicle.&lt;br/&gt; 
(c) This section shall not apply to the lawful use of an electronic tracking device by a law enforcement agency.&lt;br/&gt; 
(d) As used in this section, "electronic tracking device" means any device attached to a vehicle or other movable thing that reveals its location or movement by transmission of electronic signals.&lt;br/&gt; 
(e) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor.&lt;br/&gt;
(f) A violation of this section by a person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation licensed under Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code shall constitute grounds for revocation of the license issued to that person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation, pursuant to the provisions that provide for the revocation of the license as set forth in Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code  Section 637.7 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/637.7.html|website=law.onecle.com|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that 637.7 pertains to all electronic tracking devices, and does not differentiate between those that rely on GPS technology or not. As the laws catch up with the times, it is plausible that all 50 states will eventually enact laws similar to those of California. {{Original research inline|date=May 2009}}

Other laws, like the [[common law]] [[invasion of privacy]] [[tort]] as well as state criminal [[wiretapping]] statutes (for example, the wiretapping statute of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]], which is extremely restrictive) potentially cover the use of GPS tracking devices by private citizens without consent of the individual being so tracked. Privacy can also be a problem when people use the devices to track the activities of a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2009-02-11-Valentinecheating_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip | work=USA Today | title=Cheatin' hearts pump up economy on Valentine's Day | first=Wendy | last=Koch | date=2009-02-12 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPS tracking devices have also been put on religious statues in order to track the whereabouts of the statue if stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2008-12-10-gps-nativity_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=GPS, hidden cameras watching over Baby Jesus | first=Marisol | last=Bello | date=2008-12-12 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, debate ensued about a Georgia proposal to outlaw hidden GPS tracking, with an exception for [[law enforcement officer]]s but not for [[private investigator]]s. See Georgia HB 16 - Electronic tracking device; location of person without consent (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/search/hb16.htm|title=Legis.ga.gov|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215124148/http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/search/hb16.htm|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/18588494/detail.html |title=Georgia Bill Would Ban Hidden GPS Tracking Devices |date=January 29, 2009 |publisher=[[WSB-TV]] |accessdate=2011-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515024004/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/18588494/detail.html |archivedate=2011-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act}}

== United Kingdom law ==
The law in the UK has not specifically addressed the use of GPS trackers, but several laws may affect the use of this technology as a surveillance tool.

'''Data Protection Act 1998'''

It is quite clear that if client instructions (written or digitally transmitted) that identify a person and a vehicle are combined with a tracker, the information gathered by the tracker becomes personal data as defined by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]. The document “What is personal data? – A quick reference guide”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is personal data? – A quick  reference guide|url=http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Detailed_specialist_guides/determining_what_is_personal_data_quick_reference_guide.ashx|website=ICO.ORG.UK|publisher=Information Commissioners Office|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) makes clear that data  identifying a living individual is personal data. If a living individual can be identified from the data, with or without additional information that may become available, is personal data.

'''Identifiability'''

An individual is ''identified'' if distinguished from other members of a group. In most cases an individual’s name, together with some other information, will be sufficient to identify them, but a person can be identified even if their name is not known. Start by looking at the means available to identify an individual and the extent to which such means are readily available to you.

'''Does the data ‘relate to’ the identifiable living individual, whether in personal or family life, business or profession?'''

Relates to' means: Data which identifies an individual, even without an associated name, may be personal data which is processed to learn or record something about that individual, or the processing of information that affects the individual. Therefore, data may ‘relate to’ an individual in several different ways.

'''Is the data ‘obviously about’ a particular individual? '''

Data ‘obviously about’ an individual will include his medical history, criminal record, record of his work, or his achievements in a sporting activity. Data that is not ‘obviously about’ a particular individual may include information about his activities. Data such as personal bank statements or itemized telephone bills will be personal data about the individual operating the account or contracting for telephone services. Where data is not ‘obviously about’ an identifiable individual it may be helpful to consider whether the data is being processed, or could easily be processed, to learn, record or decide something about an identifiable individual. Information may be personal data where the aim, or an incidental consequence, of the processing, is that you learn or record something about an identifiable individual, or the processing could affect an identifiable individual. Data from a Tracker would be to identify the individual or his activities. It is therefore personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998.

Any individual who wishes to gather personal data must be registered with the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) and have a DPA number. It is a criminal offense to process data and not have a DPA number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief guide to notification|url=http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Practical_application/a_brief_guide_to_notification.ashx|website=ICO.GOV.UK|publisher=The Information Commissioner's Office|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trespass'''

It may be a civil trespass to deploy a tracker onto a car not belonging to your client or to yourself. But in the OSC’s annual inspection, the OSC’s Chief Surveillance Commissioner [[Sir Christopher Rose]] stated “putting an arm into a wheel arch or under the frame of a vehicle is straining the concept of trespass“.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government officials track cars and trespass on private property, report shows|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6194581/Government-officials-track-cars-and-trespass-on-private-property-report-shows.html|accessdate=14 September 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, entering private land of anyone in order to deploy a tracker is clearly a trespass which is a civil tort.

'''Prevention of Harassment Act 1997'''

At times, the public misinterprets surveillance, in all its forms, as stalking. Whilst there is no strict legal definition of 'stalking', neither is there specific legislation to address this behavior. Rather, it is a term used to describe a particular kind of harassment. Generally, it is used to describe a long-term pattern of persistent and repeated contact with, or attempts to contact, a particular victim.

The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 created two new offenses of stalking by inserting new sections 2A and 4A into the PHA 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stalking and Harassment|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/stalking_and_harassment/|website=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new offences which came into force on 25 November 2012, are not retrospective. Section 2A (3) of the PHA 1997 sets out examples of acts or omissions which, in particular circumstances, are ones associated with stalking. Examples are: following a person, watching or spying on them, or forcing contact with the victim through any means, including social media.

Such behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful. In many cases, the conduct might appear innocent (if considered in isolation), but when carried out repeatedly, so as to amount to a course of conduct, it may then cause significant alarm, harassment or distress to the victim.

It should be noted that the examples given in section 2A (3) is not an exhaustive list but an indication of the types of behavior that may be displayed in a stalking offense.

Stalking and harassment of another or others can include a range of offenses such as those under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the Offences Against the Person Act 1861; the Sexual Offences Act 2003; and the Malicious Communications Act 1988.

Examples of the types of conduct often associated with stalking include direct communication; physical following; indirect contact through friends, colleagues, family or technology; or, other intrusions into the victim’s privacy. The behavior curtails a victim’s freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful.

If the subject of inquiry is aware of the tracking, then this may amount to harassment under the Prevention of Harassment Act 1997. There is a case at the Royal Courts of Justice where a private investigator is being sued under this act for the use of trackers. In December 2011, a Claim was brought against Richmond Day &amp; Wilson Limited (First Defendant) and Bernard Matthews Limited (Second Defendant), Britain’s leading Turkey Provider.

The case relates to the discovery of a tracking device found in August 2011 on a vehicle supposedly connected to Hillside Animal Sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Animal campaigner claims car was bugged by Bernard Matthews|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/animal-campaigner-claims-car-was-bugged-98522|accessdate=14 September 2014|publisher=The Mirror Newspaper|date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000'''

Property Interference: The Home Office published a document entitled “Covert Surveillance and Property Interference, Revised Code of Practice, Pursuant to section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of practice for covert surveillance and property interference|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-covert-surveillance-and-property-interference|website=GOV.UK|publisher=GOV.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it suggests in Chapter 7, page 61 that;

'''General basis for lawful activity'''

7. 1 Authorizations under section 5 of the 1994 Act or Part III of the 1997 Act should be sought wherever members of the intelligence services, the police, the services police, Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or Office of Fair Trading (OFT), or persons acting on their behalf, conduct entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy that would be otherwise unlawful.

7. 2 For the purposes of this chapter, “property interference” shall be taken to include entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy.

Example: The use of a surveillance device for providing information about the location of a vehicle may involve some physical interference with that vehicle as well as subsequent directed surveillance activity. Such an operation could be authorized by a combined authorization for property interference (under Part III of the 1997 Act) and, where appropriate, directed surveillance (under the 2000 Act). In this case, the necessity and proportionality of the property interference element of the authorization would need to be considered by the appropriate authorizing officer separately to the necessity and proportionality of obtaining private information by means of the directed surveillance.

This can be interpreted to mean that placing a tracker on a vehicle without the consent of the owner is illegal unless you obtain authorization from the Surveillance Commissionaire under the RIPA 2000 laws. Since a member of the public cannot obtain such authorizations, it is therefore illegal property interference.

Another interpretation is that it is illegal to do so if you are acting under the instruction of a public authority and you do not obtain authorization. The legislation makes no mention of property interference for anyone else.

Currently, there is no legislation in place that deals with the deployment of trackers in a criminal sense except RIPA 2000 and that RIPA 2000 only applies to those agencies and persons mentioned in it.

==Uses in marketing==

In August 2010, Brazilian company [[Unilever]] ran a promotion where GPS trackers were placed in boxes of [[Omo (detergent)|Omo]] laundry detergent. Teams would then track consumers who purchased the boxes of detergent to their homes where they would be awarded a prize for their purchase. The company also launched a website (in Portuguese) to show the approximate location of the winners' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://adage.com/globalnews/article?article_id=145183 | work=Advertising Age | title=Is Your Detergent Stalking You? | first=Laurel| last=Wentz| date=2010-07-29 | accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.getsam.in/gps-tracker/ | work=Advertising Age | title=What is GPS Tracking System? |  accessdate=2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration by [[Canaan]]ite populations preceded the Hyksos.

In about 1650 BC, the Hyksos invaded the territory of both dynasties and established the [[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifteenth Dynasty]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the term "Hyksos" derives from the Egyptian expression ''heqau khaswet'' (or ''heqa-khaset''; "rulers [of] foreign lands"), used in Egyptian texts such as the ''[[Turin King List]]'' to describe the rulers of neighbouring lands. This expression begins to appear as early as the late [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] to refer to various [[Nubians|Nubian chieftains]] and in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] to refer to the Semitic-speaking chieftains of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]].

Unique in the [[Ancient Greek]] language, the word ὑκσώς ([[Romanization of Greek|trasl.]] hyksόs, with the [[rough breathing]] and the final grave accent, upon [[omega]]) is said to be derived from Egyptian. It is used with the unique meaning of ''"king shepherd"'', by [[Manetho]] (in Ios. Ap. I,14), priest and historian who wrote in Greek and knew the pre-Ptolemaic documents to support his history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorenzo Rocci|title= ''Vocabolario Greco-Italiano''|publisher=Società Editrice [[Dante Alighieri]]|place= Città di Castello (Perugia)|year=1993|language=it|url=https://www.societaeditricedantealighieri.it/145-auctores-classici-greci}}; this word was not quoted in the ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', years editions of 1853 and of 1893. &lt;br /&gt;
And also the full acronym used for title of Manetho's work&lt;/ref&gt; Until the decipherment of hieroglyphics Manetho was the only available source for a list of the egyptian kings. As a proof of its non-Greek origin, the word ὑκσώς (hyksōs) does not observe the rules of [[Ancient Greek accent#Rule relating to grave accent|Ancient Greek accent]], and is one of the few Greek words with a [[kappa]] followed by a [[sigma]], instead of the more common [[Xi (letter)|Xi]].

==Origins==
===Josephus===
In his ''[[Against Apion]]'', the first-century AD historian [[Josephus]] debates the synchronism between the Biblical account of [[the Exodus]] of the [[Israelites]] from Egypt and two Exodus-like events that the Egyptian historian [[Manetho]] (ca. 300 BC) apparently mentions. It is difficult to distinguish between what Manetho himself recounted, and how Josephus or [[Apion]] interpret him. Josephus identifies the Israelite Exodus with the first exodus mentioned by Manetho, when some 480,000 Hyksos "shepherd kings" (also referred to as just 'shepherds', as 'kings' and as 'captive shepherds' in his discussion of Manetho) left Egypt for Jerusalem.&lt;ref name = "AA1:86–90"&gt;Josephus, Flavius, &lt;cite&gt;''Against Apion''&lt;/cite&gt;, 1:86–90.&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of "Hyksos" identifies this first exodus with the Hyksos period (16th century BC).

Josephus provides the earliest recorded instance of the much repeated false etymology of the term ''Hyksos'', as a Hellenised form of the Egyptian phrase ''Hekw [[Shasu]]'', meaning "Shepherd Kings". Scholars have only recently shown that the term derives from ''heqa-khase'', a phrase meaning "rulers of foreign lands".&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Israel]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Silberman, Neil Asher]], ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', 2001, The Free Press, New York City, {{ISBN|0-684-86912-8}} p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Apion identifies a second exodus mentioned by Manetho when a renegade Egyptian priest called ''[[Osarseph]]'' led 80,000 "[[lepers]]" to rebel against Egypt. Then, Apion additionally conflates these with the Biblical [[the Exodus|Exodus]], and contrary to Manetho, even alleges that this heretic priest changed his name to [[Moses]].&lt;ref name = "AA1:234–50"&gt;Josephus, Flavius, &lt;cite&gt;Against Apion&lt;/cite&gt;, 1:234–250.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utoronto.ca/wjudaism/contemporary/articles/a_sheresblau.html Miriam - From Prophet to Leper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skeptically.org/oldtestament/id4.html Egyptian Account of the Leper's Exodus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; do not interpret ''lepers'' and ''leprous priests'' as literally referring to a disease, but rather to a strange and unwelcome new belief system.

===Way of settlement===

Manetho's account, as recorded by Josephus, describes the appearance of the Hyksos in Egypt as an armed invasion by a horde of foreign barbarians who met little resistance, and who subdued the country by military force. He records that the Hyksos burnt their cities, destroyed temples, and led women and children into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Egypt from the Earliest Time to the Persian Conquest'', [[James Henry Breasted]], p. 216, republished 2003, {{ISBN|0-7661-7720-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''Against Apion'', I:75–77. "By main force they easily seized it without striking a blow; and having overpowered the rulers of the land, they then burned our cities ruthlessly, razed to the ground the temples of gods… Finally, they appointed as king one of their number whose name was [[Salitis]]. He had his seat at Memphis, levying tribute from Upper and Lower Egypt and always leaving garrisons behind in the most advantageous positions."&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed&lt;ref name = "Winlock"&gt;Winlock, Herbert E., ''The Rise and Fall of the Middle Kingdom in Thebes''.&lt;/ref&gt; that new revolutionary methods of warfare ensured the Hyksos the ascendancy in their influx into the new emporia being established in Egypt's delta and at Thebes in support of the Red Sea trade. [[Herbert Eustis Winlock]] describes new military hardware, such as the composite bow, as well as the improved [[recurve bow]], and most importantly the horse-drawn war [[chariot]], as well as improved arrowheads, various kinds of swords and daggers, a new type of shield, [[Mail (armour)|mailed shirts]], and the metal helmet.&lt;ref name = "Winlock" /&gt; The chariot had initially been introduced to the Middle East by [[Indo-Iranians]].&lt;ref name="Military_Technology"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/military-technology#toc57589 |title=Military Technology |last=Guilmartin  |first=John F. |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= |access-date=September 2, 2018 |quote=Around 1600 bce, Iranian tribes introduced the war-horse into Mesopotamia from the north, along with the light two-wheeled chariot.

===Ethnicity===
The Hyksos were probably an ethnically mixed people of largely Semitic origin.&lt;ref name="Lebanon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon/Government-and-society#ref386505 |title=Lebanon: Origins and relations with Egypt |last1=Barnett |first1=Richard David |last2=Ochsenwald |first2=William L. |last3=Bugh |first3=Glenn Richard |author-link1=Richard David Barnett |author-link2=William L.

[[Kamose]], the last king of the Theban 17th Dynasty, refers to [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apepi]] as a "Chieftain of [[Retjenu]]" in a stela that implies a Canaanite background for this Hyksos king: this is the strongest evidence for a Canaanite background for the Hyksos. [[Khyan]]'s name "has generally been interpreted as [[Amorites|Amorite]] "Hayanu" (reading ''h-ya-a-n'') which the Egyptian form represents perfectly, and this is in all likelihood the correct interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Ryholt, Kim S.B.. ''The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C.'', Museum Tuscalanum Press (1997) p.128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Ryholt]] furthermore observes the name Hayanu is recorded in the [[List of Assyrian kings|Assyrian king-lists]] for a "remote ancestor" of [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1813 BC) of [[Assyria]], which suggests that it had been used for centuries prior to Khyan's own reign.&lt;ref&gt;Ryholt, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of [[Sakir-Har]]'s name, one of the three earliest Fifteenth Dynasty kings, also leans towards a [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] or Canaanite origin for the Hyksos rulers—if not the Hyksos peoples themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ryholt, pp.127–128. "[Sakir-Har] is evidently a [[theophoric name|theophorous name]] compounded with ''hr'', Canaanite ''harru'', [or] 'mountain.' This sacred or deified mountain is attested in at least two other names, both West Semitic ([[Yaqub-Har]] and [[Anat-her]]), and so there is reason to suspect that the present name also may be West Semitic. The element skr seems identical to śkr, 'to hire, to reward,' which occurs in several Amorite names. Assuming that śkr takes a nominal form as in the names ''sa-ki-ru-um'' and ''sa-ka-ŕu-um'', the name should be transliterated as either Sakir-Har or Sakar-Har. The former two names presumably mean 'the Reward.' Accordingly, the name here under consideration would mean 'Reward of Har."&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary with the Hyksos, there was a widespread [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] [[Indo-Aryan migration|expansion]] in central and south Asia. The arrival of the Hyksos in Egypt, along with the arrival of the Hurrians in Syria and the Kassites in Babylonia, has been connected with this migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Hollar|2011|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyksos used the same horsedrawn [[chariot]] as the Indo-Aryans, and Egyptian sources mention a rapid conquest.

===History===
{{Hiero|Hyksos|&lt;hiero&gt;S38-N29-N25:X1*Z1&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=left|era=2ip}}
Traditionally, only the Fifteenth Dynasty rulers are called ''Hyksos''. The Greek name "Hyksos" was coined by [[Manetho]] to identify the Fifteenth Dynasty of Asiatic rulers of northern Egypt. In Egyptian Hyksos means "ruler(s) of foreign countries", however, Josephus mistranslated Hyksos as "Shepherd Kings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=A.B.|title=Herodotus, Book II: Commentary, 99-182 v. 3|year=1993|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-07737-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8DiTX_EsWasC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Manetho+mistranslated+Hyksos#v=onepage&amp;q=Manetho%20mistranslated%20Hyksos&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2011|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By around 1700 BC, Egypt was fragmenting politically, with local kingdoms springing up in the northeastern delta area. One of these was that of King Nehesy, whose capital was at Avaris; he ruled over a population consisting largely of Syro-Canaanites who had settled in the area during the 12th Dynasty, and who were probably mainly soldiers, sailors, shipbuilders and workmen. His dynasty was probably replaced by a West-Semitic-speaking Syro-Canaanite dynasty that formed the basis of the later Hyksos kingdom, able to spread southwards because of the unstable political situation while aided by "an army, ships, and foreign connections."&lt;ref name="Bietak p57"&gt;Bietak, Manfred "Second Intermediate Period, overview" in Kathryn Bard, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'' Routledge 1999 {{ISBN|0-415-18589-0}} p57&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earlier [[Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] had been West Asian and [[Semitic languages|Semitic-speaking]]; however, its pharaohs did not style themselves "Hyksos", and they seem to have been vassals of the Thirteenth Dynasty who oversaw a community of Asiatic merchants and shepherds who had been granted land in the Nile Delta.  The Hyksos, by contrast, were largely Amoritic invaders who, capitalizing on a weak moment in Egypt's history, managed to conquer the entire country briefly as far south as Thebes (under Khyan, ca. 1582 BC).

The Hyksos had Canaanite names, as seen in those with names from [[ancient Semitic religion]] such as [[Anat]] or [[Baal]]. Several of their pharaohs did in fact adopt the Egyptian title ''hekw chasut'' (foreign overlords) for themselves, along with Egyptian throne names. They introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the [[composite bow]] and the horse-drawn [[chariot]].

The names, the order, and even the total number of the Fifteenth Dynasty rulers are not known with full certainty. The names appear in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] on [[monument]]s and small objects such as jar lids and [[scarab artifact|scarab]]s. In those instances in which [[Fivefold Titulary#.28Praenomen.29 He of the Sedge and the Bee|''Prenomen'']] and [[Fivefold Titulary#.28Nomen.29 Son of Ra|''Nomen'']] do not occur together on the same object, there is no certainty that the names belong together as the two names of a single person. The Danish Egyptologist [[Kim Ryholt]] sums up the complex situation by stating that "there are only vague indications of the origin of the Fifteenth Dynasty" and concurring that the small number of surviving names of the Fifteenth Dynasty are "too few to allow for general conclusions" about the Hyksos' background in his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C., Museum Tuscalanum Press, 1997. p.126&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Ryholt stresses that
: we also lack positive indications that any of the rulers of the Fifteenth Dynasty were related by blood, and, accordingly we could be dealing with a dynasty of mixed ethnic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Ryholt, op. cit., p.126 An example given by Ryholt "is the family of the kings Warad-Sin and Rim-Sin of [[Larsa]]. Their father had been the ruler of two Amorite tribes, but both he and their grandfather had Elamite names, while they themselves had Akkadian names, and a sister of theirs had a Sumerian name.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manetho]]'s history of Egypt is known only through the works of others, such as ''[[Against Apion]]'' by [[Flavius Josephus]]. These sources do not list the names of the six rulers in the same order. To complicate matters further, the spellings are so distorted that they are useless for chronological purposes; there is no close or obvious connection between the bulk of these names&amp;mdash;''Salitis'', ''Beon'' or ''Bnon'', ''Apachnan'' or ''Pachnan'', ''Annas'' or ''Staan'', ''Apophis'', ''Assis'' or ''Archles''&amp;mdash;and the Egyptian names that appear on scarabs and other objects. The Turin king list affirms there were six Hyksos rulers, but only four of them are clearly attested as Hyksos kings from the surviving archaeological or textual records: 1. [[Sakir-Har]], 2. [[Khyan]], 3. [[Apepi I|Apophis]] and 4. [[Khamudi]].

Khyan and Apophis are by far the best attested kings of this dynasty, whereas Sakir-Har is attested by only a single doorjamb from Avaris that bears his royal titulary. Khamudi is named as the last Hyksos king on a fragment from the Turin Canon. The hieroglyphic names of these Fifteenth Dynasty rulers exist on monuments, scarabs, and other objects.

Two Hyksos pharaohs remain unknown. Many scholars have suggested that they were Maaibre [[Sheshi]], [[Aperanat|Aper-Anath]], [[Semqen|Samuqenu]], [[Yakbim Sekhaenre|Sekhaenre Yakbim]] or Meruserre [[Yaqub-Har]] (who are all attested by seals or scarabs in the Delta region) but, thus far, all that is certain is that they were Asiatic kings in the Egypt's Delta region. They could be either the remaining two Hyksos kings or were members of the previous Fourteenth Dynasty at Xois.

===Range===
The Hyksos kingdom was centered in the eastern [[Nile Delta]] and [[Middle Egypt]] and was limited in size, never extending south into [[Upper Egypt]], which was under the control of [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]]-based rulers, except briefly, for about three years, at the end of Khyan's reign and the beginning of Aphophis'. The Hyksos Fifteenth Dynasty rulers established their capital and seat of government at [[Avaris]].

The first pharaoh of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], [[Ahmose I]], finally expelled the Hyksos from their last holdout at [[Sharuhen]] in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] by the sixteenth year of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas.

''History and Chronology of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt: Seven Studies'', pp.46–49. University of Toronto Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent native rulers in Thebes do seem,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} however, to have reached a practical ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with the later Hyksos rulers. This included transit rights through Hyksos-controlled Middle and [[Lower Egypt]] and pasturage rights in the fertile Delta. One text, the ''[[Carnarvon Tablet]] I'', relates the misgivings of the Theban ruler's council of advisors when [[Kamose]] proposed moving against the Hyksos, who he claimed were a humiliating stain upon the holy land of Egypt. The councilors clearly did not wish to disturb the status quo:

{{quote|[W]e are at ease in our (part of) Egypt. Elephantine (at the First Cataract) is strong, and the middle (of the land) is with us as far as Cusae [near modern Asyut]. The sleekest of their fields are plowed for us, and our cattle are pastured in the Delta. Emmer is sent for our pigs. Our cattle have not been taken away… He holds the land of the Asiatics; we hold Egypt[.]&lt;ref name = "Pritchard 232"&gt;Pritchard (ed.), ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament'' (ANET), pp 232f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It would appear as though Hyksos administration was accepted in most quarters, if not actually supported by many of their northern Egyptian subjects.

Not until the beginning of the Theban wars of liberation during the Seventeenth Dynasty are Theban wares again found in the Faiyum. Some texts indicate that while the Hyksos controlled the delta region administratively, the Thebans were too busy mining gold and making money off the Red Sea trade to care. Lower Egypt and Thebes functioned autonomously, and shared limited contact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Hoffmeier, Book Review of ''The Hyksos: New Historical and Archaeological Perspectives'', ed. Eliezer Oren, University of Pennsylvania 1997. in JEA 90 (2004), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the Egyptians===
Scholars have taken the increasing use of scarabs and the adoption of some Egyptian forms of art by the Fifteenth Dynasty Hyksos kings and their wide distribution as an indication of their becoming progressively Egyptianized.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Charlotte. &lt;cite&gt;''The Hyksos Period in Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt;. p.15-18. Shire Egyptology. 2005. {{ISBN|0-7478-0638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyksos used Egyptian titles associated with traditional Egyptian kingship, and took the Egyptian god [[Set (deity)|Set]] to represent their own titulary deity.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Charlotte. &lt;cite&gt;''The Hyksos Period in Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt;. p.29-31. Shire Egyptology. 2005. {{ISBN|0-7478-0638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The native Egyptians viewed the Hyksos as non-Egyptian "invaders". When they were eventually driven out of Egypt, all traces of their occupation were erased. 

No accounts survive recording the history of the period from the Hyksos perspective, only that of the native Egyptians who evicted the occupiers, in this case the rulers of the Eighteenth Dynasty who were the direct successor of the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', editor Ian Shaw, p. 186, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-280293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the latter who started and led a sustained war against the Hyksos. Some{{who|date=May 2011}} think that the native kings from Thebes had an incentive to demonize the Asiatic rulers in the North, thus accounting for the destruction of their monuments. Scholars such as [[John A. Wilson (Egyptologist)|John A. Wilson]] found that the description of the Hyksos as overpowering, irreligious foreign rulers had support from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;''The Culture of Ancient Egypt'', John Albert Wilson, p. 160, University of Chicago Press, org. pub 1956 -still in print 2009, {{ISBN|0-226-90152-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theban offensive ==

===Under Seqenenre Tao===
[[File:Sequenre tao.JPG|200px|thumb|Mummified head of [[Seqenenre Tao]], bearing axe wounds. The common theory is that he died in a battle against the Hyksos.]]
The revolt which drove the Hyksos from Upper Egypt began in the closing years of the Seventeenth Dynasty at Thebes. Later New Kingdom literary tradition has brought one of these Theban kings, [[Seqenenre Tao]], into contact with his Hyksos contemporary in the north, Apepi (also known as Apophis). The tradition took the form of a tale in which the Hyksos king Apepi sent a messenger to Seqenenre in Thebes to demand that the Theban sport of harpooning hippopotami be done away with; his excuse was that the noise of these beasts was such that he was unable to sleep in faraway Avaris. The real reason was probably that their main god was Set, who was represented as part man, part hippopotamus. [[Jan Assmann]] argues that because the Ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a "lonely" god lacking personality, Set the desert god, who was worshipped exclusively according to the tale, represented a manifestation of evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Of God and Gods'', Jan Assmann, p47-48, University of Wisconsin Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-299-22550-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the only historical information that can be gleaned from the tale is that Egypt was a divided land, the area of direct Hyksos control being in the north, but the whole of Egypt possibly paying tribute to the Hyksos kings.

Seqenenre participated in active diplomatic posturing, which probably consisted of more than simply exchanging insults with the Asiatic ruler in the North. He seems{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} to have led military skirmishes against the Hyksos, and judging by the vicious head wounds on his [[mummy]] in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, he may have died during one of them. His son and successor, [[Kamose]], the last ruler of the Seventeenth Dynasty at Thebes, is credited with the first significant victories in the Theban-led war against the Hyksos.

=== Under Kamose ===
[[File:ScarabBearingNameOfApophis MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|150px|left|Scarab bearing the name of the Hyksos King Apepi, now at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]
Kamose sailed north from Thebes at the head of his army in his third regnal year. He surprised and overran the southernmost garrison of the Hyksos at Nefrusy, just north of Cusae (near modern [[Asyut]]), and Kamose then led his army as far north as the neighborhood of Avaris itself. Though the city was not taken, the fields around it were devastated by the Thebans. A second stele discovered at Thebes continues the account of the war broken off on the Carnarvon Tablet I, and mentions the interception and capture of a courier bearing a message from Apepi at Avaris to his ally, the ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kush]] (modern Sudan), requesting the latter's urgent support against the threat posed by Kamose's activities against both their kingdoms. Kamose promptly ordered a detachment of his troops to occupy the [[Bahariya Oasis]] in the [[Libyan Desert]] to control and block the desert route to the south. Kamose, called "the Strong," then sailed back up the Nile to Thebes for a joyous victory celebration, after what was probably not much more than a surprise spoiling raid in force that caught the Hyksos off guard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} His Year Three is the only date attested for Kamose and he may have died shortly after the battle from wounds.&lt;ref name="Bietak p57"/&gt;

By the end of the reign of Apepi, perhaps the second-to-last Hyksos king of the Fifteenth Dynasty, the Hyksos had been routed from Middle Egypt and had retreated northward and regrouped in the vicinity of the entrance of the Faiyum at [[Atfih]]. This Fifteenth Dynasty pharaoh had outlived his first Egyptian contemporary, Seqenenra Tao II, and was still on the throne (albeit of a much reduced kingdom) at the end of Kamose's reign. The last Hyksos ruler of the Fifteenth Dynasty, Khamudi, undoubtedly had a relatively short reign that fell within the first half of the reign of [[Ahmose I]], Kamose's successor and the founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== Under Ahmose ===
[[File:AhmoseIAxhead-DrawingCloseUp.png|thumb|200px|right|Close-up of a drawing of axe blade depicting Ahmose I striking down a Hyksos Warrior, part of the burial equipment of Queen [[Ahhotep I]].]]
Ahmose I, who is regarded as the first pharaoh of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] may have been on the Theban throne for some time before he resumed the war against the Hyksos.

The details of his military campaigns are taken from the account on the walls of the tomb of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], a soldier from [[El-Kab]], a town in southern Upper Egypt, whose father had served under Seqenenra Tao, and whose family had long been [[nomarch]]s of the districts. It seems{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} that several campaigns against the stronghold at Avaris were needed before the Hyksos were finally dislodged and driven from Lower Egypt. When this occurred is not known with certainty. Some authorities{{who|date=May 2011}} place the expulsion as early as Ahmose's fourth year, while [[Donald B. Redford]], whose chronological structure has been adopted here, places it as late as the king's fifteenth year. The Ahmose who left the inscription states that he followed on foot as his King Ahmose rode to war in his chariot (the first mention of the use of the horse and chariot by the Egyptians); in the fighting around Avaris he captured prisoners and carried off several hands (as proof of slain enemies), which when reported to the royal herald resulted in his being awarded the "Gold of Valor" on three separate occasions. The actual fall of Avaris is only briefly mentioned: "Then Avaris was despoiled. Then I carried off spoil from there: one man, three women, a total of four persons. Then his majesty gave them to me to be slaves."&lt;ref&gt;ANET, p.233f&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Avaris, the fleeing Hyksos were pursued by the Egyptian army across northern [[Sinai Peninsula]] and into the southern Levant. Here, in the [[Negev]] desert between [[Rafah]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]], the fortified town of [[Sharuhen]] was reduced after, according to the soldier from El-Kab, a long three-year siege operation. How soon after the sack of Avaris this Asiatic campaign took place is uncertain. One can reasonably conclude that the thrust into southern Canaan probably followed the Hyksos' eviction from Avaris fairly closely, but, given a period of protracted struggle before Avaris fell and possibly more than one season of campaigning before the Hyksos were shut up in [[Sharuhen]], the chronological sequence must remain uncertain.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Later times==
The Hyksos continued to play a role in Egyptian literature as a synonym for "Asiatic" down to Hellenistic times. The term was frequently evoked{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} against such groups as the Semites settled in Aswan or the delta, and this may have led the Egyptian priest and historian [[Manetho]] (or [[Manetho#Authorship and date of composition|Ptolemaeus the Mendesian]]) to identify the coming of the Hyksos with the sojourn in Egypt of Joseph and his brothers, and led to some authors identifying the expulsion of the Hyksos with [[the Exodus]]. For instance, [[Justin Martyr]] says:
:Moses is mentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. In this way he is mentioned both by [[Polemon of Athens|Polemon]] in the first book of his Hellenics and by [[Apion|Apion son of Posidonius]] in his book against the Jews, and in the fourth book of his history, where he says that during the reign of Inachus over Argos the Jews revolted from [[Amasis I|Amasis]] king of the Egyptians and that Moses led them. And [[Manetho#Authorship and date of composition|Ptolemaeus the Mendesian]], in relating the history of Egypt, concurs in all this.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, Hortatory Address to the Greeks (ch 9) in Volume 1 of Roberts, A., &amp; Donaldson, J. (1950). The Ante-Nicene Fathers: Translations of the writings of the Fathers down to A.D. 325. Grand Rapids: W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;
With the chaos at the end of the 19th Dynasty, the first pharaohs of the 20th Dynasty in the Elephantine Stele and the [[Papyrus Harris|Harris Papyrus]] reinvigorated an anti-Hyksos stance to strengthen their nativist reaction towards the Asiatic settlers of the north, who may{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} again have been expelled from the country. [[Setnakht]], the founder of the 20th Dynasty, records in a Year 2 stela from [[Elephantine]] that he defeated and expelled a large force of Asiatics who had invaded Egypt during the chaos between the end of [[Twosret]]'s reign and the beginning of the 20th Dynasty and captured much of their stolen gold and silver booty.

The story of the Hyksos was known to the Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'']] ,2.1.4.&lt;/ref&gt; who attempted to identify it within their own mythology with the expulsion from Egypt of [[Belus (Egyptian)|Belos]] ([[Baal]]?&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks''  1959 (1974:30): "Belos, whose name reproduces the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] Ba'al, 'Lord'".&lt;/ref&gt;) and the daughters of [[Danaos]], associated with the origin of the [[Argos|Argive]] Dynasty.

'''ISO 3166-2:IE''' is the entry for [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Ireland, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[provinces of Ireland|4 provinces]]
* [[counties of the Republic of Ireland|26 counties]]

The 26 counties are traditional counties, which are different from the [[local government in the Republic of Ireland|first-level administrative subdivisions of Ireland]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|IE}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Ireland. The second part is one or two letters. For the counties, the letters are generally the same as those currently used in [[vehicle registration plates of Ireland|vehicle registration plates]], with the following exceptions:
* [[County Cork]] vehicles rather than {{mono|CO}} use {{mono|C}}; in ISO 3166-2 the latter is used for the province of [[Connacht]].
* three counties where there were multiple councils and vehicle codes until the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]:
** [[County Limerick]] vehicles rather than {{mono|LK}} now use {{mono|L}}, which had been restricted to the city of [[Limerick]] before 2014 
** [[County Waterford]] vehicles rather than {{mono|WD}} now use {{mono|W}}, which had been restricted to the city of [[Waterford]] before 2014 
** [[County Tipperary]] vehicles rather than {{mono|TA}} use {{mono|T}} . Before 2014 [[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]] used {{mono|TN}} and {{mono|TS}} respectively.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (en): [[English language|English]]
* (ga): [[Irish language|Irish]]

'''Jabal Sawda''' ({{lang-ar|جبل السودة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|jabal al-sūda}}'', {{IPA-ar|dʒabal asːuːda|pron}})is a peak located in [[Saudi Arabia]], with an elevation of around {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}}.

Most authorities claim that the peak, with a questioned elevation of 3,133 m, is the highest point in Saudi Arabia, but [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission|SRTM]] data indicates an elevation of 2,985 m, with higher elevations elsewhere in the country.

Also known as Mount Souda in Abha (جبل السودة في ابها) is a [[mountain]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], located in the [[Hejaz Mountains]] at Coordinates 18°16'02"[[north|N]] and  42°22'05"[[east|E]].

The village of [[Al Souda]] is located nearby. That town is a tourist center and has a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] to the top of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g298542-d7084575-r292681756-Cable_Car-Abha_Asir_Province.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''județ''''' ({{IPA-ro|ʒuˈdet͡s}}, plural '''''județe''''' {{IPA-ro|ʒuˈdet͡se|}}) is an [[administrative division]] in [[Romania]], and was also used from 1940 to 1947 in the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and from 1998 to 2003 in [[Moldova]].

''Județ'' translates into English as "jurisdiction", but is commonly rendered as [[county]] (the preferred term for that being ''comitat'' in Romanian).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

There are 41 ''județe'' in Romania, divided into [[municipiu|municipii]] (municipalities), ''orașe'' (cities) and ''[[Communes of Romania|comune]]'' (communes). Each ''județ'' has a county seat (''reședință de județ'') which serves as its administrative capital; this designation usually belongs to the largest and most developed city in the respective county. The central [[Government of Romania|government]] is represented by one [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] in every ''județ''.

==Etymology==
In the [[Romanian Principalities]], the ''județ'' was an office with administrative and judicial functions, corresponding to both [[judge]] and [[mayor]]. The word is etymologically rooted in the [[Latin]] "judicium", and is therefore [[cognate]] to other administrative institutions like the [[Sardinia]]n ''[[giudicati]]'', or terms like ''[[jurisdiction]]'' and ''[[judge]]''.

In Romanian, the term ''județ'' does not take an initial capital unless it is the first word of a sentence.

The '''Khorat Plateau''' ({{lang-th|ที่ราบสูงโคราช}}) is a [[plateau]] in the northeastern [[Isan]] region of [[Thailand]]. The plateau forms a [[natural region]], named after the short form of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], a historical barrier controlling access to and from the area.

==Geography==
The average elevation is 200 m and it covers an area of about 155,000&amp;nbsp;km². The saucer-shaped plateau is divided by a range of hills called the [[Phu Phan Mountains]] into two basins: the northern Sakhon Nakhon Basin, and the southern Khorat Basin. The plateau is tilted towards the southeast, and drained by the [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River]]s, tributaries to the [[Mekong]] that forms the northeastern boundary of the area. It is separated from [[central Thailand]] by the [[Phetchabun Mountains]] and the [[Dong Phaya Yen Mountains]] in the west, the [[Sankamphaeng Range]] in the southwest and by the [[Dângrêk Mountains]] in the south, all of which historically made access to the plateau difficult.

These mountains together with the [[Truong Son Range]] in the northeast catch a lot of the rainfall, so the southwest [[monsoon]] has much lower intensity than in other regions—the mean annual rainfall in Nakhon Ratchasima is about 1,150&amp;nbsp;mm, compared with 1,500&amp;nbsp;mm in central Thailand. The difference between the dry and wet seasons is much greater, which makes the area less optimal for [[rice]]. The portion known as [[Tung Kula Rong Hai]] was once exceptionally [[arid]].

Much of the surface of the plateau was once classified as [[laterite]], and layers that can easily be cut into brick-shaped blocks are still so called, but the classification of [[soil]]s as various types of [[oxisol]]s is more useful for [[agriculture]]. Oxisols of the type called rhodic ferralsols, or [[Yasothon Province|Yasothon]] soils, formed under humid tropical conditions in the early [[Tertiary]]. When portions of the plain uplifted as a plateau, these [[relict]] soils, characterized by a bright red color, wound up on [[Highland (geography)|upland]]s in a great semicircle around the southern rim. These soils overlie associated [[gravel]] [[soil horizon|horizon]]s cleared of [[sand]] by [[field (agriculture)|field]] [[termites]], in a prolonged and still on-going process of [[bioturbation]].  Xanthic ferralsols of the [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province|Khorat]] and [[Ubon Ratchathani Province|Ubon]] Series, characterized by a pale yellow to brown color, developed in midlands in processes still under investigation, as are those  forming [[lowland]] soils resembling European [[brown earth|brown soil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lofjle|first1=E|last2=Kubiniok|first2=Jochen|title=Landform Development and Bioturbation on the Khorat Plateau, Northeast Thailand|journal=Natural History Bulletin of the Siam Society|date=1996|volume=44|pages=199–216|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265197088_LANDFORM_DEVELOPMENT_AND_BIOTURBATION_ON_THE_KHORA_T_PLATEAU_NORTHEAST_THAILAND|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
Many [[prehistoric Thailand]] sites are located on the plateau, with some bronze relics of the [[Dong Son culture]] having been found. The [[World Heritage site|World Heritage]] [[Ban Chiang]] archaeological site, discovered in 1966, yielded evidence of [[bronze]] making beginning c. 2000 BCE, but lacking evidence of weaponry so often associated with the [[Bronze Age]] in Europe and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.about.com/cs/asia/a/banchiang.htm |title= Ban Chiang, Thailand Bronze Age Village and Cemetery |accessdate= 28 Dec 2010 |author= K. Kris Hirst |publisher= About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site appears to have once been part of a broader culture, until abandoned c. 200 CE, not to be resettled until the early-19th century. None Nok Tha in the [[Phu Wiang District]] of Khon Kaen yielded evidence of an Iron Age settlement dating from about 1420 to 50 BCE.

The region was once under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Dvaravati]] Kingdom, and later under the [[Khmer Empire]]. It is dotted with the ruins of Khmer resthouses located about 25&amp;nbsp;km apart, a comfortable day's [[Walking|walk]], along the [[Ancient Khmer Highway|Khmer highway]]s. The chapels were not just places of rest, but also were [[hospice]]s and [[library|libraries]], and typically included a [[baray]] (pond).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Werner|first1=Ulrich|title=Thailand's Ancient Civilizations, Isaan Heartland|url=http://thailandculturecustomguide.org/geography-of-thailand/isaan-heartland.html|website=Your Guide to Thai Culture|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though [[Charles Higham (archaeologist)|Higham]] states, "...we remain largely unaware of the relationships between sites and the presence or otherwise of states on the Khorat plateau" during the 7th to 11th centuries.  Muang Sema and Muang Fa Daet are notable though for their religious structures, including [[Bai sema|sema stones]] at Muang Fa Daet.&lt;ref name=Higham&gt;Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9786167339443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|312–316}}

==History==
There is a paucity of information from the centuries known as the [[Dark ages of Cambodia]], but the plateau seems to have been largely depopulated. In 1718, the first [[Lao people|Lao]] [[muang]] in the [[Chi River|Chi]] valley—and in fact anywhere in the interior of the Khorat Plateau—was founded at [[Suwannaphum District]], in present-day [[Roi Et Province]], by an official in the service of King [[Nokasad]] of the [[Kingdom of Champasak]].&lt;ref name=Brow1976 &gt;{{citation | last1 = Brow  | first1 = James  | year = 1976 | title = Population, land and structural change in Sri Lanka and Thailand |journal= Contributions to Asian studies |volume= |series= |issue= issue 9 |page= 47 | publisher = Kogan Page | isbn = 90-04-04529-5

In [[cave diving|cave]] (and occasionally wreck) diving, '''line markers''' are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly a notched acute isosceles triangle in basic outline), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a "jump" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low visibility.

Non-directional markers ("cookies") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.

==History==
The line arrow was invented by Lewis Holzendorf and developed by Forrest Wilson at the [[Cave diving]] [[National Speleological Society|NSS]] workshop, inspired by [[Sheck Exley]] and other cave diving pioneers, and later, a few hundreds of the handmade markers were sold through Branford Dive Center in North Florida. Soon they became very popular and today are commonly used by underwater cave explorers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.diverite.com/products/catalog/reels/ac2015|title=Line Arrow|accessdate=20 October 2011|author=Dive Rite|publisher=Dive Rite website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Line markers are generally used on permanent guidelines to provide critical information to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided are used to wrap the line to secure the marker in place. A simple passage of the line through the enlarged area at the base of the two slots will allow the marker to slide along the line, or even fall off if brushed by a diver. To more securely fasten the marker, an extra wrap may be added at each slot. The basic function of these markers is fairly consistent internationally, but procedures may differ by region, and between teams. The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary line markers are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"/&gt;

Cave markers may be carried on a short length of bungee with a knot at one end and a clip at the other, but other methods are also used. Reasonable security and easy access are all that is required.

===Directional Markers===
Line arrows are used to indicate the direction along the line to the nearest air source. In cave systems with only one opening, line arrows will always indicate the route back to the entry, but in cave systems with multiple openings, they may not point to the entry used by the dive team, and in some cases this may not be a usable exit.&lt;ref name=Riordan&gt;Daniel Riordan, Awareness: Recipe For Successful Cave Navigation, DirQuest Vol. 3, No. 2 - Summer 2002, http://www.funteqdiving.nl/website/Downloads/grotduiken/Riordan%20-%20Cave%20Awareness%20Navigation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular cave diving systems have permanent line arrows at regular intervals pointing to the nearest exit, and may be marked with a distance to the exit. Permanent arrows may also be used to identify secondary passages and midpoints in a cave.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tdisdi.com/cave-diving-directional-and-non-directional-markers-101/|title=Cave Diving: Directional and Non-directional Markers 101|last=Kieren|first=Lauren|year=2016|work=tdisdi.com|publisher=SDI - TDI - ERDI|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Line arrows are placed to help the divers to establish the direction they come from, when they later need to find the way out, but should not alter the general navigation information of the system, so line arrows are added only where they cannot cause other groups to become confused about the direction to the nearest air source.&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt; An arrow would be added at the point of attachment of a reel line when tying off to explore new areas, and may be removed after return and removal of the temporary line. If the place is to be marked for future reference, the arrow may be left in place.

===Non-directional markers===
The original non-directional markers in cave diving were clothes pegs, but the circular plastic "cookies" were developed later, based on the successful line-arrow design, and are more secure when placed on a guideline. They can be used to mark reference points, to distinguish lines at an intersection, or can be placed by each member of a team on a jump or gap line to identify who is still on the line if the team gets separated. As they are commonly used to identify the presence of a diver, they generally have some kind of personal identification, such as initials or drawings and may have notches, or holes added so they can be identified by feel.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"/&gt; 

A non-directional marker indicates the presence of a diver or team beyond a point and is mainly useful for that team. They may be used to indicate the direction the team came from and intend to exit by when the intersection is already marked by arrows, particularly if there are alternatives available which the team does not want to use. To avoid confusing other divers, these temporary markers are removed on the way out.&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt;

===Hybrid markers=== 
A hybrid marker, also known as a referencing exit marker or REM, is a more recently developed line marker used as a directional marker by the diver placing it, and seen as a cookie by others. They are rectangular with slots like the arrow and cookie forms for attachment to a line, and have a relatively large blank space on one end to add identification on one side and to write on the other side. Referencing exit markers are asymmetrical so can be used to show the direction which the diver came from. They are personal markers, and should not be used by others to judge the suitability of a route as the practicability of an exit may depend on the size of the diver and the equipment carried.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016"/&gt;

==Manufacture==
Originally hand made from available materials. Commercially marketed line markers are commonly injection-moulded plastic and are available in a few colours. Small variations in size and shape allow personal markers to be identified more easily, and unique markings may be added by the user.

==Airports==
&lt;!-- Note to editors:

(1) Please do not move or remove the onlyinclude tags; they are used to transclude this state's "Commercial Service - Primary" airports in the [[List of airports in the United States]]. Also please do not add columns to the table since all the U.S. state lists are using the same format so that they can be transcluded into a single sortable table.

(2) To compare airport use, enplanement (passenger boarding) figures are taken from a single source and are for the same year. This list currently contains the 2016 enplanement data, updated by the FAA in July 2017. Please do not change the enplanements for individual airports based on data from other sources. If you wish to add such information, please place it in the airport's article, not on this list.

(3) Airport names shown in bold indicate the airport has scheduled service on commercial airlines. If you change an airport name to bold, please be sure to also add an ==Airlines and destinations== section to the corresponding airport article.

This is a '''list of cities with the most high-rise buildings'''.{{ref|a|A}} A high-rise is defined as a structure at least {{convert|35|m|ft}} or 12 stories tall.&lt;ref name="High-rise definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/standard/3/high-rise-building|title=High-rise definition as per Emporis|website=Emporis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities with 100 or more high-rise buildings are listed here.

note1: in many cities of the list, the information is not always complete and up-to-date. This applies to the cities of China, Brazil and the Russian Federation.

Note2: this list contains data on high-rise buildings within the city limits (with the exception of Metro Manila). For the list of agglomerations with the largest number of high-rise buildings, an additional Wikipedia page is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">The following list sorts countries according to their weighted mean applied import duty on all products. Import duty refers to taxes levied on imported goods, capital and services. The level of customs duties is a direct indicator of the openness of an economy to world trade. However, there may also be import barriers that are not based on the levy of duties. All data is from the [[World Bank|world bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/tm.tax.mrch.wm.ar.zs|title=Tariff rate, applied, weighted mean, all products (%) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Import duties are regarded as a variation of protectionism. The average weighted import duty in these important economic areas is the following percentage: [[China|People's Republic of China]]: 3.54%, [[Japan]]: 2.55%, [[European Union]]: 1.96% and the [[United States]]: 1.67%. The respective import duty does not apply to countries with which free trade agreements have been concluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15041">'''Municipalities in Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|[[općina]]}}; plural: ''općine'') are the second lowest administrative unit of government in the country, and along with [[List of cities in Croatia|cities and towns]] (''grad'', plural: ''gradovi'') they form the second level of administrative subdisivion, after [[Counties of Croatia|counties]].

Though equal in powers and administrative bodies, municipalities and towns differ in that municipalities are usually more likely to consist of a collection of villages in rural or suburban areas, whereas towns are more likely to cover urbanised areas. Croatian law defines municipalities as local self-government units which are established, in an area where several inhabited settlements represent a natural, economic and social entity, related to one other by the common interests of the area's population.&lt;ref name=Local&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|issue=19/2013|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2013_02_19_323.html|title=Zakon o lokalnoj i područnoj (regionalnoj) samoupravi (pročišćeni tekst)|language=Croatian|trans-title=Local and Regional Self-Government Act (consolidated text)|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the 21 counties of Croatia are subdivided into 128 towns and 428 municipalities.&lt;ref name="CountiesAct2006"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=9 September 2011|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans-title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_07_86_2045.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popovaca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/popovaca-dobila-status-grada-237487|title= Popovača dobila status grada|date=12 April 2013|work=[[Poslovni dnevnik]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tasks and organization ==
Municipalities, within their self-governing scope of activities, perform the tasks of local significance, which directly fulfil the citizens’ needs, and which were not assigned to the state bodies by the Constitution or law, and in particular affairs related to the organization of localities and housing, zoning and planning, public utilities, child care, social welfare, primary health services, education and primary schools, culture, physical education and sports, customer protection, protection and improvement of the environment, fire protection and civil defence, local transport.&lt;ref name="Local"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=2405 The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (consolidated text) - Croatian Parliament].Retrieved October 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Municipality government ===

[[Municipal council]] (''općinsko vijeće'') is the representative body of citizens and the body of local self-government. The councillors are elected for a four-year term on the basis of [[universal suffrage]] in [[direct elections]] by [[secret ballot]] using [[proportional representation|proportional system]] with [[d'Hondt method]]. The executive head of the municipality is the [[municipality president]] (or head of the municipality, ''općinski načelnik''), also elected in direct elections for a four-year term, by [[Majority vote|majoritarian vote]] ([[two-round system]]) (the deputy president is elected together with the president). He/She (with the deputy president) can be recalled by a referendum. Municipalities have administrative departments as offices of municipal administration (in small municipalities there is unique administrative department) chaired by the heads (principals). They are  appointed by the municipal president on the basis of a public competition.&lt;ref name="Local"/&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]]|issue=144/2012|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o lokalnim izborima|trans-title=Local Elections Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2012_12_144_3074.html|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian municipalities are administratively subdivided into "local committee areas" (''mjesni odbori'') with elected councils.

==List of municipalities==

{{As of|2015}}, there are 428 municipalities in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uprava.gov.hr/UserDocsImages//Lokalna%20samouprava//100613-Kopija%20opcine_gradovi_RH.xls|title=Popis gradova i općina|work=uprava.hr|publisher=Ministry of Public Administration, Croatia|date=10 June 2013|format=Microsoft Excel|language=Croatian|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">The '''National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis''' (NCGIA) was founded in 1988 and hosted at three member campuses: The [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]; the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]]; and the [[University of Maine]].

The center was founded after receiving  a $5 million grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]. Ron Abler—then at NSF—described the rationale for the NCGIA and compared it to corresponding efforts in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Abler, Ronald F. "The national science foundation national center for geographic information and analysis." International Journal of Geographical Information System 1.4 (1987): 303–326.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable faculty involved with the NCGIA include [[Michael Goodchild]], [[Michael Batty]], [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]], A. Stewart Fotheringham, [[Andrew U. Frank|Andrew Frank]], Helen Couclelis, [[Luc Anselin]], [[Waldo R. Tobler]] amongst others. [[David William Rhind]] and Mike Goodchild compare later US and the UK approach.&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, Michael F., and David W. Rhind. "The US National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis: some comparisons with the Regional Research Laboratories." The Association for Geographic Information Yearbook (1990): 226–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research plan&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (1989) The research plan of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis. International Journal of Geographical Information Systems 3: 117–36. [109]&lt;/ref&gt; was organized along so-called Research Initiatives, which generally started and ended with "specialist meetings", where interdisciplinary teams discussed pressing research issues. Often a publication followed:

* Initiative 1: Accuracy of spatial databases, led by [[Michael Goodchild]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, Michael F. NCGIA Research Initiative 1: Accuracy of spatial databases. NCGIA (National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis), 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, Michael F. "Accuracy of Spatial Databases—NCGIA Research Initiative 1, Closing Report." (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Initiative 2: Languages of Spatial Relations, led by   David Mark   and [[Andrew U. Frank]]&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2dm174nc&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Initiative 3: Multiple Representations, led by Barbara Buttenfield
* Initiative 4: The Use and Value of Geographic Information, led by  Harlan Onsrud   and Hugh Calkins 
* Initiative 5: Architecture of Very Large Spatial Databases, led by  Terence Smith   and [[Andrew U. Frank]]
* Initiative 6: Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS), led by Paul Densham  and Michael Goodchild 
* Initiative 7: Visualizing the Quality of Spatial Information, led by Kate Beard   and Barbara Buttenfield  
* Initiative 8: Formalizing Cartographic Knowledge, led by Barbara Buttenfield 
* Initiative 9: Institutions Sharing Geographic Information, led by  Harlan Onsrud   and Gerard Rushton
* Initiative 10: Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in GIS, led by  Max Egenhofer   and Reginald Golledge
&lt;!--Note: No Initiative 11 given--&gt;
* Initiative 12: Integration of Remote Sensing and GIS, led by John Estes, Frank Davis and Jeffrey Star&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/research/initiatives.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the list of publications resulting from these research initiatives and other efforts of the NCGIA were published in the International Journal of Geographical Information Systems.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''natural region''' is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a [[region]] which is distinguished by its common natural features of [[geography]], [[geology]], and [[climate]]. 

From the [[ecology|ecological]] point of view, the naturally occurring flora and fauna of the region are likely to be influenced by its geographical and geological factors, such as [[soil]] and [[water resources|water availability]], in a significant manner. Thus most natural regions are homogeneous [[ecosystem]]s. Human impact can be an important factor in the shaping and destiny of a particular natural region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1739/ UNESCO - Natural and Cultural Landscape of Danube Region]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 11 major regions in the world.

==Locations of some natural regions of the world==

 {{Annotation|45|250|'''Zona Sur'''}}
 {{Annotation|15|360|'''[[Zona Austral]]'''}}
}}

The concept "natural region" may refer to a large, poor area, or to a large basic geographical unit, like the vast [[boreal forest]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/natural-regions Natural Regions - The Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also be used generically, like in [[alpine tundra]], or specifically to refer to a particular place.

The term is particularly useful where there is no corresponding or coterminous official region. [[The Fens]] of eastern [[England]], the [[Thai highlands]], and the [[Pays de Bray]] in Normandy, are examples of this. Others might include regions with particular geological characteristics, like [[badlands]], such as the [[Bardenas Reales]], an upland [[massif]] of acidic rock, or [[The Burren]], in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

'''Ohel''' ({{lang-he-n|אוהל}}; plural: '''ohelim''', literally, "tent"){{sfn|Steinmetz|2005|p=117}}{{sfn|Krajewska|1993|p=22}} is a structure built around a Jewish grave as a sign of prominence of the deceased. ''Ohelim'' cover the graves of some (but not all) [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s, important rabbis, [[tzadik]]im, prominent Jewish community leaders, and biblical figures. Typically a small [[masonry]] building, an ''ohel'' may include room for visitors to pray, meditate, and light candles in honor of the deceased.

==Source==
According to Krajewska, the tradition of covering a grave with an ''ohel'' may be based on the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]], in which [[Abraham]] buried [[Sarah]].{{sfn|Krajewska|1993|p=22}} Nolan Menachemson suggests that the Hasidic tradition of covering the graves of Rebbes with an ''ohel'' derives from the ''[[Tabernacle|Ohel Moed]]'' ("Tent of Meeting") in which [[Moses]] communicated with God during the [[Israelite]]s' travels in the desert.{{sfn|Menachemson|2007|p=41}}

==Construction==
''Ohelim'' are usually simple [[masonry]] structures. They may include one or two windows.{{sfn|Krajewska|1993|p=22}} In prewar Poland, the ''ohel'' of a Rebbe was located close by the [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidic court]], and was big enough to accommodate a [[minyan]] of ten men beside the grave.{{sfn|Biale|2017|p=426}}

The [[Ohel (Chabad-Lubavitch)|ohel]] of the [[Chabad|Lubavitcher]] Rebbes in [[Queens, New York]], is unusual in that it does not have a roof. This allows [[Kohen|kohanim]] to visit the graves without coming into contact with [[Tumah and taharah|impurity from the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/kohanim/|title=Kohanim|first=Rabbi Yaakov|last=Goldstein|date=28 November 2016|accessdate=2 April 2018|work=shulchanaruchharav.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
In the case of a Hasidic Rebbe, the ''ohel'' is a place for visitors to pray, meditate, write ''[[kvitel]]ach'' (petitionary prayer notes), and light candles in honor of the deceased.{{sfn|Rabinowicz |1996|p=351}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sztetl.org.pl/en/tradition-and-jewish-culture/religion/cemeteries|title=Cemeteries|first=Jan |last=Jagielski|year=2017|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=[[POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kadish|2006}} ''Ohelim'' of Hasidic Rebbes, as well as the tombs of [[tzadik]]im venerated by Moroccan Jews, serve as year-round pilgrimage sites, with the biggest influx of visitors coming on the Rebbe's or tzadik's [[Yom Hillula]] (anniversary of death).{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=414}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/pilgrimage-contemporary-jewish-pilgrimage|title= Pilgrimage: Contemporary Jewish Pilgrimage|first=Moshe|last=Shokeid|work=Encyclopedia of Religion|year=2016|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paleolimnology''' ({{lang-el|paleon}}=old, ''limne''=lake, ''logos''=study) is a scientific subdiscipline closely related to both [[limnology]] and [[paleoecology]].  Palaeolimnological studies are concerned with reconstructing the [[paleoenvironment]]s of inland waters ([[lake]]s and [[streams]]; [[freshwater]], [[brackish]], or [[saline water|saline]]) – and especially changes associated with such events as [[climatic change]], human impacts (e.g., [[eutrophication]], or [[acid rain|acidification]]), and internal ontogenic processes.

Paleolimnological studies are commonly based on meticulous analyses of [[sediment]] cores, including the [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[mineralogy|mineralogical]] properties of sediments, and diverse [[biology|biological]] records (e.g., fossil [[diatoms]], [[cladocera]], [[ostracodes]], [[molluscs]], [[pollen]], [[pigments]], or [[chironomid]]s). One of the primary sources for recent paleolimnological research is the Journal of Paleolimnology.

==History==

===Lake ontogeny===
Most early paleolimnological studies focused especially on the biological [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] of lakes, and the role of internal lake processes in directing lake development.  Although [[Einar Naumann]] had speculated that the productivity of lakes should gradually decrease due to leaching of catchment soils, [[August Thienemann]] suggested that the reverse process likely occurred.  Early midge records seemed to support Thienemann's view.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, I. R. 1987.  Chironomidae (Diptera) in paleoecology. Quaternary Science Reviews 6: 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|Hutchinson]] &amp; Wollack suggested that following an initial oligotrophic stage lakes would achieve and maintain a trophic equilibrium.  They also stressed parallels between the early development of lake communities, and the sigmoid growth phase of animal communities – implying that the apparent early developmental processes in lakes were dominated by colonization effects, and lags due to the limited reproductive potential of the colonising organisms.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

In a classic paper, [[Raymond Lindeman]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R. L. 1942. The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23, 399–418.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a hypothetical developmental sequence, with lakes progressively developing through [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], [[mesotrophic lake|mesotrophic]], and [[eutrophic]] stages, before senescing to a [[dystrophic lake|dystrophic]] stage and filling completely with sediment. A climax forest community would eventually be established on the peaty fill of the former lake basin.  These ideas were further elaborated by [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Ed Deevey]],&lt;ref&gt;Deevey, E. S., Jr. 1955. The obliteration of the hypolimmon. Mem. Ist. Ital. Idrobiol., Suppl 8, 9–38.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that lake development was dominated by a process of morphometric [[eutrophication]].  As the [[hypolimnion]] of lakes gradually filled with sediments, [[oxygen]] depletion would promote the release of iron-bound [[phosphorus]] to the overlying water. This process of internal fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, further accelerating the in-filling process.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I. R. 2006. Chironomid overview. pp.360–366 in S.A. EIias (ed.) Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science, Vo1. 1, Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Deevey and Lindemann's ideas were widely, if uncritically, accepted.  Although these ideas are still widely held by some limnologists, they were effectively refuted in 1957 by Deevey's student [[Daniel A. Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, D.A. 1957. On the sigmoid growth phase in the history of Linsley Pond. American Journal of Science 255: 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Whiteside&lt;ref&gt;Whiteside. M. C. 1983. The mythical concept of eutrophication. Hydrobiologia 103, 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  also criticized Deevey and Lindemann's proposal, and palaeolimnologists now consider that a host of external  factors are equally or more important as regulators of lake development and productivity.  Indeed, late-glacial climatic oscillations (e.g., the [[Younger Dryas]]) appear to have been accompanied by parallel changes in productivity, illustrating that 1) lake development is not a unidirectional process, and 2) climatic change can have a profound effect on lake communities.

==Limnic Environment==
[[Limnology]] is study of inland water bodies including: lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, wetlands and more.&lt;ref name="limnology book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander J|last2=Goldman|first2=Charles R|title=Limnology|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-07-023673-8|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological properties===

====Anthropogenic eutrophication, acidification, and climate change====
Interest in paleolimnology eventually shifted from esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used [[chironomid]] fossils to assess the impacts of increased nutrient loading (anthropogenic [[eutrophication]]) on lake communities. Their studies reveal pronounced changes in the bottom fauna of North American and European lakes, a consequence of severe oxygen depletion in the eutrophied lakes.

From 1980 to 1990 the primary focus of paleolimnologists efforts shifted to understanding the role of human impacts ([[acid rain]]) versus natural processes (e.g., soil leaching) as drivers of [[pH]] change in northern lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Battarbee, R. W. 1984. Diatom analysis and the acidification of lakes. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 305: 451–477.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pH]]-sensitivity of [[diatom]] communities had been recognised since at least the 1930s, when [[Friedrich Hustedt]] developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. [[Gunnar Nygaard (phycologist)|Gunnar Nygaard]] subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, [[Jouko Meriläinen]] introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function.  Using diatom and [[chrysophyte]] fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions.  Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, anthropogenic acidification.

In recent years palaeolimnologists have recognised that climate is a dominant force in aquatic ecosystem processes, and have begun to use lacustrine records to reconstruct [[paleoclimate]]s.  Sensitive records of climate change have been developed from a variety of indicators including, for example, paleotemperature reconstructions derived from [[chironomid]] fossils, and palaeosalinity records inferred from [[diatoms]].

==== Freshwater [http://extension.usu.edu/waterquality/whats-in-your-water/aquatic_macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates] ====
Freshwater macroinvertebrates ([[invertebrate]]s that can be see by naked eye; &gt; 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) are a very diverse group of small animals present in [[river]]s, streams, lakes and wetlands. These animals include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, annelids and arachnids. They comprise a functionally and taxonomically diverse group that plays an important role in linking the food web in the [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They serve as a main source of food for the fishes and they depend on different types of algae and bacteria for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J. Iwan|last2=Sayer|first2=Carl D.|title=DOES THE FISH–INVERTEBRATE–PERIPHYTON CASCADE PRECIPITATE PLANT LOSS IN SHALLOW LAKES?|journal=Ecology|date=August 2003|volume=84|issue=8|pages=2155–2167|doi=10.1890/02-0422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most aquatic macro-invertebrates are small while some are quite large such as freshwater crayfish. They are very sensitive to different physical and chemical conditions and respond to it accordingly due to their limited mobility. For example, their community will change when a pollutant enters into the water or due to the change of [[water quality]]. Therefore, the water body which is rich with a macro-invertebrate community can be used to provide an estimate of water body health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Marc|title=Water: Facts without Myths|journal=Water|date=7 August 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.3390/w1010003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Macro invertebrates termed "benthos" inhabit surfaces of vegetation, rocks and other aquatic sediments. They are widely distributed in the aquatic environment and present at a range of trophic levels. Most  macroinvertebrates taxa are dependent on a range of [[abiotic factor]]s and [[biotic factor]]s and therefore community structure can be used to represent the local ecosystem. These factors may be the availability and quality of food, [[pH]], [[temperature]], salinity, land use pattern and [[water flow]] etc. These factors are interconnected and influence each other. For example, any change in the land use affects the riparian vegetation that may be increased or decreased which changes the inputs into the aquatic ecosystem, affecting the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|last2=Gresens|first2=Susan|last3=Kenney|first3=Melissa|last4=Sutton-Grier|first4=Ariana|title=Benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality: The intersection of science and policy|journal=Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=99–128|doi=10.1163/187498209X12525675906077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all of these reasons, macroinvertabrates are considered as one of the best indicators of water quality.

===== Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates =====
Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates vary in their tolerance to changes in the aquatic environment.

===== Macroinvertebrates as an indicator of [[water quality]] =====
Macroinvertebrateas are commonly and widely distributed in many types of water bodies and respond with a range of sensitivities to many kinds of stressors. They are commonly used for toxicity testing and ecological assessments in water bodies and many of them complete their life cycles in a single water body so they are exposed directly to physical, chemical, and biological stressors and they also integrate the long and short term changes. When a freshwater source is degraded, the most sensitive invertebrate species are lost initially, followed by species more tolerant to pollution.These species either sustain their existence or their number decreases in response to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.T|first1=Barbour|title=USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols For Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, 1–35|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Macro-invertebrates are an essential part of the food chain. Their strategies for feeding can be clustered into several "functional feeding" groups. For example, shedders feed on leaves and woody materials, some depends on the vegetation growing in the water body. Examples of shredders are amphipods, isopods, freshwater crayfish, and caddisfly larvae.

==Paleoclimate proxies==
Paleoclimatology (or the study of past climates) uses proxy data in order to relate elements collected in modern-day samples to suggest the climatic conditions of the past.

===Sediment cores===
Sediment cores are one of the primary tools for studying paleolimnology because of the role in which lake and river sediments play in preserving biological information.&lt;ref name="sediment book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birks|first1=H. John. B.|last2=Lotter|first2=Andre F.|last3=Juggins|first3=Steve|last4=Smol|first4=John P.|title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Data Handling and Numerical Techniques|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleolimnologists collect [[Core sample|sediment cores]] and observe various proxy indicators in order to reconstruct past limnology of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Some of these indicators include geochemical markers and isotopic data which are found within the various sections of the sediment core.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; In order to calibrate data, a group of around 40 or more calibration lakes are used to reconstruct what the conditions of a new core are likely to reflect.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; The use of these calibration lakes is necessary to identify dramatic differences in a newly collected core compared to normal variations which would be depicted in the calibration lakes. Through the use of sediment cores as a technique, paleolimnologists are able to use other proxies (such as pollen, charcoal, diatoms, chironomids, and other organic matter) in order to reconstruct the past climatic conditions of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Lake sediment cores in particular offer a more comprehensive analysis of an area because of the continual accumulation of sediment as well as other organic matter like pollen and charcoal.

===Pollen records===
Pollen and spores can be analyzed within a lab setting to determine the family, genus, or species which the pollen grains belong. The overall taxonomic assemblage of pollen types reflects the surrounding vegetation of the lake.  [[Palynology|Pollen analysis]] is a major field in [[paleoecology]]. A range of statistical and qualitative treatment of pollen records can be used to reconstruct past vegetation and climate.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt;

=== Diatoms ===
The taxonomic assemblages of [[diatom]]s reflect many aspects of the lake temperature, chemical, and nutrient environment.

=== Organic matter characteristics ===
Organic matter may be characterized in terms of 1) amount (accumulation rate, reflecting productivity), 2) origin (aquatic or terrestrial determined from the C:N ratio), 3) carbon isotopic composition (reflecting plant photosynthetic pathways of C3 vs C4 plants, and reflecting drought and/or aquatic productivity), 4) nitrogen isotopic composition (reflecting sources of nitrogen and nitrogen cycling). There are a range of biomarkers widely used, as well as compound-specific isotopic analyses.  [[Diagenesis]] is an important factor to consider in interpreting organic matter records.

===Chironomids===

==== [[Chironomids]] as a proxy of climate change: Paleolimnology and chironomids ====
One of the major factor that affects the flora and fauna of the earth is the change of climate at the local, regional and global scale. These changes are preserved over the period of time as a fossil record and through paleolimnological methods, these changes can be traced out and also helpful for the prediction of the future climate change. Chironomids are one of the best indicators of climate change. These are two winged flies and belongs to family Chironomidae with 500 to 15,000 species. Ecologically they are considered as [[Bottom feeder|bottom dwellers]] and are very responsive to any fluctuation in the surrounding environment. They are considered as a good indicator of [[salinity]], water depth, [[stream flow]], aquatic productivity, oxygen level, lake acidification, [[pollution]], [[Temperature|temperatur]]e, and overall [[ecosystem health]]. As the assemblage of chironomids is dependent on several [[environmental factor]]s, they can be easily related to those changing factors using a transfer function to connect a particular group of organisms to a specific [[environmental variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilyashuk|first1=Elena A.|last2=Ilyashuk|first2=Boris P.|last3=Tylmann|first3=Wojciech|last4=Koinig|first4=Karin A.|last5=Psenner|first5=Roland|title=Biodiversity dynamics of chironomid midges in high-altitude lakes of the Alps over the past two millennia|journal=Insect Conservation and Diversity|date=1 November 2015|volume=8|issue=6|pages=547–561|doi=10.1111/icad.12137|language=en|issn=1752-4598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake deposits have a rich diversity of fossilized insects that trace back to middle Paleozoic era and more abundance can be found in the Quaternary period.Among aquatic invertebrates, different families of aquatic fly larvae can be traced out in the lake sediments of Quaternary era. Among them, Chironomids are of greatest ecological importance due to their diverse habitat in the aquatic ecosystem, feeding habitat, important component in the food web and above all their usage as a plaeolimnological studies because their head capsule and feeding structures are fossilized in the lake sediments.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew S.|title=Paleolimnology : the history and evolution of lake systems|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195133530|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chironomids complete their larval stage in the water and its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] continues up to several years while adult life span is very short. They have an important role in the degradation of material in the aquatic ecosystem and serve as an important part of the food web during their whole life cycle.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smol|first1=edited by Reinhard Pienitz and Marianne S.V. Douglas and John P.|title=Long-term environmental change in Arctic and Antarctic lakes|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-2126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Climate change ====
According to [[IPCC]] (2007) reports one of the vital aspect of environment is the continuous climate change due several factors over the period of time which is influential in shaping the biodiversity.
Macroinvertebrates, especially chironomids have been considered as an important [[Indicator organism|indicator]] of the [[climate change]] especially temperature due to their presence in the abundance in the [[lake sediment]] as a fossil. There is a strong correlation between the chironomids assemblage and the water temperature, lake depth, salinity and, nutrients of the lake.Lake water levels over the past time period can be inferred from the chironomids assemblage due to their correlation.It is due to the fact that climate change resulted in the water level change of the lake that is related to change in the pattern of chironomids distribution and abundance.Their strong correlation helps to build the information about the evaporation and precipitation in the past. Past climate change is reconstructed based on the paleolimnology with the help of different [[fossilized]] records especially the lake sediments that helps to find out the regional and local climate change. It is important to differentiate between the impacts that a lake store due to the regional and local level [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt; 

Recent studies in [[Arctic]] shows that [[biodiversity]] affect more due to the arctic warming than other associated factors like human alteration and [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RAHEL|first1=FRANK J.|last2=OLDEN|first2=JULIAN D.|title=Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Aquatic Invasive Species|journal=Conservation Biology|date=June 2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Himalayan region water bodies are not only affected by the anthropogenic disturbances but also impacted by the different types of pollutants that are transferred to this area over a longer distance.It is vital to understand all the associated factors acting on the aquatic biodiversity while analyzing the impact of climate change over the past years with the help of lake sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=C.M|last2=Sharma|first2=S|last3=Gurung|first3=S|last4=Bajracharya|first4=R.M|last5=Jüttner|first5=I|last6=Pradhan|first6=N.S|title=Global Climatic Change and High Altitude Lakes: Impacts on Aquatic Biodiversity and Pollution Status|journal=Natural Resources Management: Reviews and Research in the Himalayan Watersheds|date=2009|issue=44(977)|pages=103–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to consider that the impact and intensity of different changes due to climate change may have totally different affect on different [[ecosystems]] depending upon its sensitivity to that change &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beniston|first1=Martin|title=Climatic Change in Mountain Regions: A Review of Possible Impacts | journal=Climatic Change|date=2003|volume=59|issue=1/2|pages=5–31|doi=10.1023/A:1024458411589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors influencing chironomids distribution and abundance ====
There are several factors that has been affecting the abundance and distribution pattern of [[Chironomids]] over the past years.Therefore, it is important to be careful while making interpretations from their fossil records.There are several debates for the last many years on the impact of temperature on their abundance and diversity along with other associated factors. For the correct interpretation of the [[Fossil|fossil records]], it is important to understand all the associated factors of an ecosystem.In order to understand the different forces that have been affecting the [[fossil]] data of lake, it important to reconstruct [[Physical property|physical]], chemical and the [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient]] content of the lakes that actually shapes the communities.
Their distribution and abundance is highly influenced by the combination of human disturbance and change in the climate. Both of them influence the catchment area that resulted into the changing of [[Aquatic vegetation|vegetation]], [[hydrology]], and nutrients cycle. Any change at the regional level especially the temperature affects the water quality at the local scale and then at the end it affect the [[habitat]] that is species-specific.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

==== Chironomids and reconstruction of quantitative change in [[Holocene Epoch|Holocene climate]] ====
There is ongoing debate about the main factor that controls the distribution and abundance of chironomids.Several factors are considered as the controlling factor especially temperature that in turn control other supporting factors including Ph, [[salinity]], nutrient flow and productivity especially in the late [[Pleistocene]]/Holocene timer period. For many years research has been carried out on the relationship between temperature and chironomids distribution pattern due to its influence on its emergence. Chironomids are directly and indirectly affected by [[temperature]] during the whole life cycle including their larval emergence, growth, feeding and [[Insect reproduction|reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; According to Eggermont and Heiri (2012) there is indirect impact of temperature on different physic chemical aspects of water resulted into determination of their distribution and abundance. There is also a strong relationship between the chironomids abundance, [[emergence]] and distribution with the mean temperature of the air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=Hilde|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|title=The chironomid-temperature relationship: expression in nature and palaeoenvironmental implications|journal=Biological Reviews|date=May 2012|volume=87|issue=2|pages=430–456|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00206.x|pmid=22032243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a research conducted by Gunten et al., 2007 at [[Lakes in Switzerland|high altitude lake]] Lej da la Tscheppain Switzerland, seasonal temperature reconstruction can be done with the help of independent chironomids and diatoms.Any change in the assemblage of chironomids reflects change in the temperature and duration of ice cover of that specific water body due to climate change. According to their findings, chironomids respond mostly to the change in the [[Temperature|summer temperature]], so seasonal variation in temperature can be inferred from different cores of the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Gunten|first1=Lucien|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|last3=Bigler|first3=Christian|last4=van Leeuwen|first4=Jacqueline|last5=Casty|first5=Carlo|last6=Lotter|first6=Andr?

The '''Palk Strait''' ({{lang-ta|பாக்கு சலசந்தி / பாக்கு நீரிணை}}, [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: පෝක් සමුද්‍ර සන්ධිය ''Pok Samudra Sandhiya'') is a [[strait]] between the [[Tamil Nadu]] [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[India]] and the [[Mannar district]] of the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] of the [[island nation]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. It connects the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the northeast with Palk Bay in the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/srilanka.pdf Map of Sri Lanka with Palk Strait and Palk Bay]&lt;/ref&gt; The strait is {{convert|53|to|82|km|mi}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;Distances measured on Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; Several rivers flow into it, including the [[Vaigai River]] of Tamil Nadu. The strait is named after [[Robert Palk]], who was a governor of [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] (1755–1763) during the [[Company rule in India|Company Raj]] period.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Palk Straits|volume=20 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Palk Bay is studded at its southern end with a [[Archipelago|chain]] of low islands and [[reef]] [[shoals]] that are collectively called [[Adam's Bridge]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; since ages it is popularly known in Hindu Mythology as "Ram Setu" i.e. The Bridge of Rama.&lt;ref name = EB&gt;{{cite web|title= Adam's bridge| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003680|work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2007|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chain extends between [[Dhanushkodi]] on [[Pamban Island]] (also known as Rameswaram Island) in Tamil Nadu and [[Mannar Island]] in Sri Lanka. The island of Rameswaram is linked to the Indian mainland by the [[Pamban Bridge]].

== History ==
As from 1914, there used to be regular trains from Madras/Chennai to Dhanushkodi, a ferry to [[Talaimannar]] on Mannar Island, and thence a train to [[Colombo]]. In 1964, a [[cyclone]] destroyed Dhanushkodi and the railway and caused severe damage along the shores of Palk Strait and Palk Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/03/06/stories/2004030600010100.htm Land's end]&lt;/ref&gt; Dhanushkodi was not rebuilt and the railway from Talaimannar to Mahawilachchiya in Sri Lanka was given up due to the civil war (It was later completely rebuilt). There was a ferry between small piers in Rameswaram and Talaimannar, but this was discontinued till date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/01/sri-lanka-india-to-relaunch-ferry-service-after-three-decades/ Sri Lanka, India to relaunch ferry service after three decades]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed canal ===
The shallow waters and reefs of the strait make it difficult for large ships to pass through, although fishing boats and small craft carrying coastal trade have navigated the strait for centuries. Large ships must travel around Sri Lanka. Construction of a shipping canal through the strait was first proposed to the British government of India in 1860, and a number of commissions have studied the proposal up to the present day. The most recent study of the [[Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project]], as it is now called, was an [[environmental impact assessment]] and a [[Feasibility study|technical feasibility study]] commissioned by the Tamil Nadu government in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcs.org/article/india-the-world/harnessing-the-troubled-waters-sethusamudram-canal-project-1508.html Harnessing the Troubled Waters: Sethusamudram Canal Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the plan encountered opposition from various religious circles. The [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic poem]] ''[[Ramayana]]'', written thousands of years ago in [[Sanskrit]] and an important [[Hindu scripture|Hindu text]], recounts how [[Rama]], with the help of an army of [[vanara]]s, built a bridge of stones across the sea to [[Lanka]] to rescue his wife [[Sita]] from the [[Asura]] king [[Ravana]]. The [[Ram Karmabhoomi]] movement, encouraged by a [[NASA]] satellite photograph of [[Rama's Setu]], was formed to prevent the shipping canal from being built.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hanuman bridge is myth: Experts|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-19/india/27311963_1_adam-s-bridge-nasa-rama-or-ramayana|work = [[Times of India]]|date = October 19, 2002|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|p|ɒ|t|k|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/kropotkin "Kropotkin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|link=no|Пётр Алексе́евич Кропо́ткин}}; December 9, 1842 – February 8, 1921) was a Russian [[activist]], [[revolutionary]], scientist, geographer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|first=D. R.|date=1975|title=Kropotkin, Reclus, and 'Relevant' Geography|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20001005|journal=Area|volume=7|issue=3|pages=188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher who advocated [[anarcho-communism]].

Born into an aristocratic land-owning family, he attended a military school and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost four years) and in England. He returned to Russia after the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, but was disappointed by the [[Bolshevik]] form of state socialism.

Kropotkin was a proponent of a decentralised communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations of self-governing communities and worker-run enterprises. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''; and his principal scientific offering, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]''. He also contributed the article on anarchism to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[iarchive:PeterKropotkinEntryOnanarchismFromTheEncyclopdiaBritannica|Peter Kropotkin entry on 'anarchism' from the Encyclopædia Britannica (eleventh ed.)]], Internet Archive. Public Domain text.&lt;/ref&gt; and left unfinished a work on anarchist ethical philosophy.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Kropotkin was born in Moscow, into the second-highest level of the Russian aristocracy. His mother was the daughter of a [[Cossack]] general.&lt;ref name="harman-p20" /&gt; His father, Alexei Petrovich Kropotkin, was a prince in [[Smolensk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990|isbn=9780921689607|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCpksaH3NrgC&amp;pg=PA13 |author1=Woodcock, George  |author2=Avakumović, Ivan |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Rurik dynasty]] which had ruled Russia before the rise of the Romanovs. Kropotkin's father owned large tracts of land and nearly 1,200 male [[serf]]s in three provinces.&lt;ref name="harman-p20"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harman, Oren|title=The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2011|isbn=9780393339994|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZJ2evtw7HAC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[U]nder the influence of [[Republicanism|republican]] teachings", Kropotkin dropped his princely title at age 12, and "even rebuked his friends, when they so referred to him."&lt;ref name="rnb"&gt;Roger N. Baldwin, "The Story of Kropotkin's Life," in Kropotkin's ''Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings'', ed. by Baldwin (Orig. 1927; Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc., 1970), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, at age 14, Kropotkin enrolled in the [[Page Corps|Corps of Pages]] at [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name=Miller7&gt;Martin A. Miller, "Introduction" to P. A. Kropotkin, ''Selected Writings on Anarchism and Revolution.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1970; p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 150 boys&amp;nbsp;– mostly children of nobility belonging to the court&amp;nbsp;– were educated in this privileged corps, which combined the character of a [[military school]] endowed with special rights and of a court institution attached to the [[Imperial Household]]. Kropotkin's memoirs detail the [[hazing]] and other abuse of pages for which the Corps had become notorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Smith, Elder &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=63|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LtdMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=peter+kropotkin+memoirs+revolutionist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Moscow, Kropotkin developed what would become a lifelong interest in the condition of the peasantry. Although his work as a page for Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] made Kropotkin skeptical about the tsar's "liberal" reputation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Kropotkin, Petr Alexseyevich|editor=Winkle, Justin|title=The Concise New Makers of Modern Culture|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009|isbn=9780415477826|page=425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_mVLMM55gUC&amp;pg=PA425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin was greatly pleased by the tsar's decision to [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipate the serfs]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Todes, Daniel Philip|title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195058307|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVskyJh6TgC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[St. Petersburg]], he read widely on his own account, and gave special attention to the works of the [[Encyclopédistes|French encyclopædists]] and to [[History of France|French history]]. The years 1857–1861 witnessed a growth in the intellectual forces of Russia, and Kropotkin came under the influence of the new liberal-revolutionary literature, which largely expressed his own aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, Kropotkin graduated first in his class from the Corps of Pages, and entered the Tsarist army.&lt;ref name=Miller8&gt;Miller, "Introduction," pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the corps had the prescriptive right to choose the regiment to which they would be attached. Following a desire to "be someone useful", Kropotkin chose the difficult route of serving in a [[Cossack]] regiment in eastern [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name=Miller8 /&gt; For some time, he was ''[[aide de camp]]'' to the governor of [[Transbaikalia]] at [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].  Later he was appointed attaché for Cossack affairs to the governor-general of East Siberia at [[Irkutsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical expeditions in Siberia===
[[File:Peter Kropotkin 1864.png|thumb|upright|Kropotkin in 1864]]

The administrator under whom Kropotkin served, General [[Boleslar Kazimirovich Kukel]] (1829–1869) was a liberal and a democrat who maintained personal connections to various Russian radical political figures exiled to Siberia. These included the writer [[M. I. Mikhailov]] (1826–1865), to whom Kukel sent Kropotkin to warn the exiled intellectual that Moscow police agents were on the scene to examine his ongoing political activities in confinement.&lt;ref name=Miller9&gt;Miller, "Introduction," p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this assignment, Kropotkin made the acquaintance of Mikhailov, who provided the young Tsarist functionary with a copy of a book by the French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] — Kropotkin's first introduction to anarchist ideas.&lt;ref name=Miller9 /&gt; Kukel was subsequently dismissed from his administrative position and Kropotkin moved from administration to state-sponsored scientific endeavors.&lt;ref name=Miller9 /&gt;

In 1864 Kropotkin accepted a position in a geographical survey expedition, crossing North [[Manchuria]] from [[Transbaikalia]] to the [[Amur River|Amur]], and soon was attached to another expedition up the [[Sungari River]] into the heart of [[Manchuria]]. The expeditions yielded valuable geographical results. The impossibility of obtaining any real administrative reforms in [[Siberia]] now induced Kropotkin to devote himself almost entirely to scientific exploration, in which he continued to be highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin continued his political reading, including works by such prominent liberal thinkers as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alexander Herzen]]. These readings, along with his experiences among peasants in Siberia, led him to declare himself an anarchist by 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, Dana|chapter=Alchemy in Clarens: Kropotkin and Reclus, 1877–1881|editors=Jun, Nathan J. &amp; Wahl, Shane|title=New Perspectives on Anarchism|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2010|isbn=9780739132418|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5t0R0ckDMAC&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Kropotkin resigned his commission in the army and returned to St. Petersburg, where he entered the [[Saint Petersburg Imperial University]] to study mathematics, becoming at the same time secretary to the geography section of the [[Russian Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="Marshall-2010-p311"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marshall, Peter|title=Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism|publisher=PM Press|year=2010|isbn=9781604860641|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDWIOL_KtGYC&amp;pg=PA311}}&lt;/ref&gt; His departure from a family tradition of military service prompted his father to disinherit him, "leaving him a 'prince' with no visible means of support".&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=The Anarchism of Peter Kropotkin |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=March 4, 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5071/The-Anarchism-of-Peter-Kropotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1871, Kropotkin explored the glacial deposits of [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] for the Society.&lt;ref name="Marshall-2010-p311" /&gt; In 1873, he published an important contribution to science, a map and paper in which he showed that the existing maps entirely misrepresented the [[geography of Asia|physical features of Asia]]; the main structural lines were in fact from southwest to northeast, not from north to south or from east to west as had been previously supposed. During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large. Accordingly, he refused the offer and returned to St. Petersburg, where he joined the revolutionary party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism in Switzerland and France===

Kropotkin visited [[Switzerland]] in 1872 and became a member of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA) at [[Geneva]]. However, he found that he did not like IWA's style of socialism. Instead, he studied the programme of the more radical [[Jura federation]] at [[Neuchâtel]] and spent time in the company of the leading members, and adopted the creed of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=282–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism in Russia and arrest===

On returning to Russia, Kropotkin's friend Dmitri Klements introduced him to the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], a socialist/populist group created in 1872. Kropotkin worked to spread revolutionary propaganda among peasants and workers, and acted as a bridge between the Circle and the aristocracy. Throughout this period, Kropotkin maintained his position within the Geographical Society in order to provide cover for his activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cahm, Caroline|title=Kropotkin: And the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872–1886|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780521891578|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zk7wTSWT3JUC&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for subversive political activity, as a result of his work with the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]]. Because of his aristocratic background, he received special privileges in prison, such as permission to continue his geographical work in his cell. He delivered his report on the subject of the [[Ice Age]] in 1876, where he argued that it had taken place in not as distant a past as originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Todes, Daniel Philip|title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195058307|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVskyJh6TgC&amp;pg=PA125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Escape and exile ===

In 1876, just before his trial, Kropotkin was moved to a low-security prison in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped with the help of his friends. On the night of the escape, Kropotkin and his friends celebrated by dining in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming correctly that the police would not think to look for them there. After this, he boarded a boat, and headed to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bell, Jeffrey A.|chapter=Kropotkin, Pyotr|editor=Bell, Jeffrey A.|title=Industrialization and Imperialism, 1800–1914: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780313314513|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XB6ckxWOq9kC&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short stay there, he moved to Switzerland where he joined the Jura Federation. In 1877, he moved to Paris, where he helped start the socialist movement. In 1878, he returned to Switzerland where he edited the Jura Federation's revolutionary newspaper ''Le Révolté'', and published various revolutionary pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=417–423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kropotkin Nadar.png|thumb|right|Kropotkin by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]]]  
In 1881, shortly after the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Tsar Alexander II]], he was expelled from Switzerland. After a short stay at [[Thonon]] (Savoy), he stayed in London for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|page=440|year=2010 |version=reproduction of 1899 edition|isbn=978-0-486-47316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the Anarchist Congress in London from July 14, 1881.&lt;ref name=Bantman2006&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_2006_num_84_4_5056 |page=965

Kropotkin returned to Thonon in late 1882. Soon he was arrested by the French government, tried at [[Lyon]], and sentenced by a police-court magistrate (under a special law passed on the fall of the [[Paris Commune]]) to five years' imprisonment, on the ground that he had belonged to the IWA (1883). The French Chamber repeatedly agitated on his behalf, and he was released in 1886. He was invited to Britain by [[Henry Seymour (secularist)|Henry Seymour]] and [[Charlotte Wilson]] and all three worked on Seymour's [[The Anarchist]]. Soon after Wilson and Kropotkin would split from the individualist anarchist Seymour and found the [[Freedom Press]], an anarchist newspaper which continues to this day. Kropotkin was a regular contributor while Wilson was integral to the administrative and financial running of the paper until she resigned its editorship in 1895. He settled near London, living at various times in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], then [[Bromley]], where his daughter and only child, Alexandra, was born on April 15, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8z8mdUYp-6gC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Peter+Kropotkin%22+1887+Alexandra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cXFi9ZZ2vP&amp;sig=OQyj3kHr6IPR7ymhnSYh0YThNpE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil8LKz9ODTAhXIhVQKHbQCDyoQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peter%20Kropotkin%22%201887%20Alexandra&amp;f=false "Alexandra Kropotkin"] ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'' by [[Paul Avrich]] (2005) [[AK Press]] pps. 16-18; Retrieved May 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Bromley Council guide to blue plaques&lt;/ref&gt; He also lived for a number of years in [[Brighton]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Marshall [[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]'', London: Fontana, 1993, p.315&lt;/ref&gt; While living in London, Kropotkin became friends with a number of prominent English-speaking socialists, including [[William Morris]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1h9DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA365&amp;dq=kropotkin%20george%20bernard%20shaw&amp;pg=PA365#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Bernard Shaw Chronology|last=Gibbs|first=A.|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=9780230599581|location=|pages=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Russia===
[[File:Krapotkin in Haparanda.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Kropotkin in [[Haparanda]], 1917]]

In 1917, after the [[February Revolution]], Kropotkin returned to Russia after 40 years of exile. His arrival was greeted by cheering crowds of tens of thousands of people. He was offered the ministry of education in the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which he promptly refused, feeling that working with them would be a violation of his anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burbank, Jane|title=Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism, 1917–1922|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195045734|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJHHAttsOL4C&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His enthusiasm for the changes occurring in the [[Russian Empire]] expanded when [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. He had this to say about the October Revolution: "During all the activities of the present revolutionary political parties we must never forget that the October movement of the proletariat, which ended in a revolution, has proved to everybody that a social revolution is within the bounds of possibility. And this struggle, which takes place worldwide, has to be supported by all means - all the rest is secondary. The party of the Bolsheviks was right to adopt the old, purely proletarian name of "Communist Party". Even if it does not achieve everything that it would like to, it will nevertheless enlighten the path of the civilised countries for at least a century. Its ideas will slowly be adopted by the peoples in the same way as in the nineteenth century the world adopted the ideas of the Great French Revolution. That is the colossal achievement of the October Revolution." ....
"I see the October Revolution as an attempt to bring the preceding February Revolution to its logical conclusion with a transition to communism and federalism." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bolshevik.info/meeting-lenin-kropotkin-bonc-brujevic1919.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though he led a life on the margins of the revolutionary upheaval, Kropotkin became increasingly critical of the methods of the Bolshevik dictatorship, and went on to express these feelings in writing. “Unhappily, this effort has been made in Russia under a strongly centralized party dictatorship. This effort was made in the same way as the extremely centralized and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] endeavor of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]]. I owe it to you to say frankly that, according to my view, this effort to build a communist republic on the basis of a strongly centralized state communism under the iron law of party dictatorship is bound to end in failure. We are learning to know in Russia how not to introduce communism, even with a people tired of the old regime and opposing no active resistance to the experiments of the new rulers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="Letter to the Workers of Western Europe", in Kropotkin’s Revolutionary Pamphlets|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|year=1970|isbn=9780486225197|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Emma Goldman gives eulogy at Peter Kropotkin's funeral.jpg|thumb|250px|Kropotkin's friend and comrade [[Emma Goldman]], accompanied by [[Alexander Berkman]], delivers a eulogy before crowds at Kropotkin's funeral in Moscow.]]
Kropotkin died of pneumonia on February 8, 1921, in the city of [[Dmitrov]], and was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Thousands of people marched in his funeral procession, including, with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s approval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Goldman|first= Emma|authorlink= Emma Goldman|title= [[Living My Life]]|year= 1931|publisher= [[Dover Publications]]|pages= 867–868|isbn= 0-486-22543-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; anarchists carrying banners with anti-Bolshevik slogans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.warwick.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/russian/id/528 Album Die Beerdigung von P.A.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Critique of capitalism===
Kropotkin pointed out what he considered to be the fallacies of the [[Economics#Criticisms|economic systems]] of [[feudalism]] and [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalism]].  He believed they create poverty and [[artificial scarcity]] while promoting [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. Instead, he proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid, [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual support]], and [[cooperation|voluntary cooperation]], asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mutual_Aid.html?id=uDAaAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He disagreed with the Marxian critique of capitalism, including the [[labour theory of value]], believing there was no necessary link between work performed and the prices of commodities. His attacks on the institution of wage-labour were based more on the power employers exerted over employees – which he claimed was made possible by the state protecting private ownership of productive resources – than the extraction of [[surplus value]] from their labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PoqAJrrYtAC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=kropotkin+labor+theory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihs4uVyNLcAhWq5IMKHYyiBoEQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=kropotkin%20labor%20theory&amp;f=false|title=Radical Economics and Labour.

===Cooperation and competition===
In 1902, Kropotkin published his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which provided an alternative view of animal and human survival, beyond the claims of interpersonal [[competition]] and natural hierarchy proffered at the time by some "[[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]]" such as [[Francis Galton]]. He argued that "it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human".&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ Are Anarchists Revolting?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin explored the widespread use of [[cooperation]] as a survival mechanism in human societies - through their many stages - and among animals. He used many real-life examples in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating [[evolution]] is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups, without central control, authority, or compulsion. He did so in order to counteract the concept of fierce competition as the core of [[evolution]], which concept provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic, and social theories{{which|date=July 2014}} of the time and for the prevalent interpretations of [[Social darwinism|Darwinism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the last chapter, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Kropotkin, Peter | title = quotation from ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'' | year = 1902 | url = http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense{{spaced ndash}}not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...] are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.|source=Peter Kropotkin, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), Conclusion.}}

Kropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not see them as the driving force of history (as did [[capitalist]]s and social Darwinists).&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&amp;pg=PA262 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262}} He believed that seeking out conflict proved to be socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or [[organized religion|the Church]], which he saw as stifling human [[creativity]] and freedom and impeding human instinctual drive towards sociality and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&amp;pg=PA349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin's observations of cooperative tendencies in [[indigenous people]]s (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) led him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition, such as those of industrialized Europe, and that many societies exhibited cooperation among individuals and groups as the norm. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by, for example, equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when he died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth (see [[Gift economy]]).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutual aid===
In his 1892 book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', Kropotkin proposed a system of economics based on mutual exchanges made in a system of voluntary cooperation. He believed that should a society be socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services required by it, then no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange will prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Conquest_of_Bread.html?id=TB2ul8NVVPcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Conquest of Bread|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1892|isbn=|location=|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s [[collectivist]] economic model was simply a wage system by a different name,&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin wrote: "After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap." (quoted in {{cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&amp;pg=PA211}})&lt;/ref&gt; and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labor]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=[[The Russian Anarchists]]|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed these ideas in ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

According to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;

{{quote|With ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[Individualist anarchism|individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal anarchism, following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.}}

===Self-sufficiency===
Kropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.  To these ends he advocated irrigation and greenhouses to boost local food production ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=bFFOCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=Kropotkin+on+self-sufficiency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qrxobXVwl-&amp;sig=Xodu31FhJ3bXTtE1kacgSINWvg8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_1eTouOPWAhVC6yYKHeWPBF0Q6AEIZDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Kropotkin%20on%20self-sufficiency&amp;f=false|title=Kropotkin, Read, and the Intellectual History of British Anarchism: Between Reason and Romanticism|last=Adams|first=M.|date=2015-06-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137392626|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''Porta San Pellegrino''' is a gate in the outer wall of [[Vatican City]]. It is located beside [[Bernini's Colonnade]] and the small Vatican post; it is also known as Porta Viridaria. The gate was rebuilt by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in 1492 and his arms are at the top of the gate. The gate is little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utenti.quipo.it/romeartlover/Vasi41.htm#Porta |title=Basilica di S.

On Friday, February 6, 2015, [[Catholic News Service]] (CNS) reported, in a brief online news release on its website, that the Vatican, through a communique, had announced that it had finished remodeling a public bathroom, to include three showers (which the article stated will be open every day except Wednesday, the day of the Pope's general audience, and other times when there are large events in the Basilica and the Square) and a barber's chair (haircuts will be available on Mondays), near Bernini's Colonnade. The services, which will include issuance of kits for hygiene, are meant for the homeless pilgrims of the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/briefs/cns/20150206.htm#head4 |title=Catholic News Service}}{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''Rome wasn't built in a day''" is an adage attesting to the need for time to create great things.  It is the usual English translation of a medieval French phrase, «''Rome ne fu[t] pas faite toute en un jour''», from the collection ''Li Proverbe au Vilain'', published around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/liproverbeauvila00tobluoft#page/42/mode/2up |title=Li proverbe au vilain, die Sprichwรถrter des gemeinen Mannes : Altfranzรถsische Dichtung nach den bisher bekannten Handschriften |publisher=Archive.org |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern French form is «{{lang|fr|[[wikt:Rome ne s'est pas faite en un jour#French|Rome ne s'est pas faite en un jour]]}}».

The expression, (as "Rome was not built in one day") is given in English in [[John Heywood]]'s ''A Dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue'' (c. 1538),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVtLAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA64 |title=The Proverbs of John Heywood: Being the "Proverbes" of that Author Printed ... - John Heywood - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] referred to the idea in Latin in an address at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in 1563.&lt;ref&gt;«''Hæc tamen vulgaris sententia me aliquantulum recreavit, quæ etsi non auferre, tamen minuere possit dolorem meum, quæ quidem sententia hæc est'', Romam uno die non fuisse conditam.» "But this common saying has given me a certain amount of comfort – a saying which cannot take away, but can at least lessen, the grief that I feel; and the saying is, that Rome was not built in one day." —https://books.google.com/books?id=VOZRAAAAcAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Perfect (grammar)#Latin|present perfect]] and [[Indirect discourse|''oratio recta'']] version of the Latin saying—the version one would use for a stand-alone quotation—would be ''Roma uno die non est condita''.

'''St. Mark's Square''' ({{lang-hr|Trg svetog Marka}}, abbreviated ''Trg sv. Marka'', also known as ''Markov trg'') is a square located in the old part of [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], called [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] or Gornji grad ({{lang-en|Upper town}}).

In the center of square is located [[St. Mark's Church, Zagreb|St. Mark's Church]]. The square also sports important governmental buildings: [[Banski dvori]] (the seat of the [[Government of Croatia]]), [[Croatian Parliament]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski sabor}}) and [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]]. On the corner of St. Mark's Square and the Street of Ćiril and Metod is the [[Old City Hall (Zagreb)|Old City Hall]], where the Zagreb City Council held its sessions.

In 2006, the square underwent a renovation project. &lt;ref name=renovation&gt;{{cite web | title=Gradonačelnik Bandić otvorio obnovljeni Trg svetog Marka | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/gradonacelnik-bandic-otvorio-obnovljeni-trg-svetog-marka/3755277/ | work=jutarnji.hr | date=2006-09-16 | accessdate=2017-02-15 |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, the Government forbid any form of protests on St. Mark's Square, which caused controversies in Croatian civil society. This ban was partially lifted in 2012.

The square is also the site of the inaugurations of [[President of Croatia|Croatia's presidents]]. [[Franjo Tuđman]] took his oath as President of the Republic in 1992 and 1997, [[Stjepan Mesić]] in 2000 and 2005, [[Ivo Josipović]] in 2010, and [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]] in 2015.

The '''Straits of Florida''', '''Florida Straits''', or '''Florida Strait''' ({{lang-es|Estrecho de Florida}}) is a [[strait]] located south-southeast of the North American [[mainland]], generally accepted to be between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and between the [[Florida Keys]] (U.S.) and [[Cuba]]. It is 150&amp;nbsp;km (93&amp;nbsp;mi) wide at the narrowest point between [[Key West]] and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet (1,800&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sea-seek.com/?geo=5858&lt;/ref&gt; The strait carries the [[Florida Current]], the beginning of the [[Gulf Stream]], from the Gulf of Mexico.

==Oil and gas==
Five wells were drilled in state waters south of the [[Florida Keys]] from 1947 to 1962.  [[Gulf Oil]] drilled three wells in federal waters south of the Florida Keys in 1960 and 1961.  All the wells were dry holes.

The boundary between the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s of the US and Cuba is halfway between Cuba and Florida, as determined by a 1977 treaty between the US and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/USA-CUB1977MB.PDF Maritime boundary - modus vivendi effected by exchange of letters between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba], 27 April 1977, PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offshore Cuba===
Cuba has three producing [[offshore drilling|offshore oil]] fields within 5&amp;nbsp;km of its north coast opposite Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume15/pdfs/pinon.pdf University of Texas, Jorge R Pinon Cervera: ''Cuba's energy challenge: a second look''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612115539/http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume15/pdfs/pinon.pdf |date=2009-06-12 }}, PDF file, retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[US Geological Survey]] estimates that the North Cuba Basin contains {{convert|5500000000|oilbbl}} of undiscovered petroleum liquids and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, almost all in the offshore part of the basin.&lt;ref&gt;''Assessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources of the North Cuba Basin, Cuba, 2004'', (2005) US Geological Survey, Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of allowing oil and gas exploration offshore Florida became a hotly contested topic in the 2008 US elections.  In a column published 5 June 2008, syndicated columnist [[George Will]] wrote that a Chinese oil company was then drilling in [[Cuba]]n waters {{convert|60|mi|km}} from the Florida coast, a claim that was repeated by candidates in favor of offshore drilling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/04/AR2008060403052.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns George Will (5 June 2008): ''The gas price we deserve''], accessed 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, no drilling was then taking place in that part of Cuban waters.

In 2004 the Spanish oil company [[Repsol]] drilled in deep Cuban waters between Cuba and the Florida Keys, and found an oil deposit; the deposit was judged noncommercial, and the hole was plugged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/OILINT/idUSN1631398320080416 Reuters (16 April 2008): ''Cuban off-shore drilling put off until 2009''], accessed 11 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Cuba signed an agreement with the [[Brazil]]ian state oil company [[Petrobras]], which provides for Petrobras to drill for oil and gas in deep waters off the north shore of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1853252,00.html Time (23 October 2008): ''How Cuba's oil could change the US embargo''] Retrieved 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Petrobras signs with Cuba", ''World Oil'', December 2008, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2009, Cuba signed an agreement with the Russian government giving the Russian oil company [[Zarubezhneft]] oil exploration rights off the north shore of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8175704.stm ''Russia to drill for oil off Cuba''], 29 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2011 Petrobas had withdrawn from the 2008 agreement due to poor prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petrobas abandons oil exploration in Cuba|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/03/10/petrobras-abandons-oil-exploration-in-cuba-all-eyes-set-on-repsol-ypf|publisher=MercoPress|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offshore Bahamas===
In 2009 the [[Falkland Islands]]-registered company Bahamas Petroleum Company Ltd. and [[Norway|Norwegian]] company [[Statoil]] announced a joint venture to drill for oil in [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] waters north of Cuba and southeast of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (18 May 2009): [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS54466+18-May-2009+PRN20090518 ''BPC Limited and StatoilHydro to reopen Bahamian energy exploration with offshore...''], accessed 28 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BPC website, [http://www.bpcltdgroup.com/index.cfm/Overview%20of%20Assets-95.html Overview of assets], accessed 15 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the Bahamas has indicated that applications for offshore drilling are on hold pending negotiations with Cuba, the United States, and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] on the exact boundaries between their respective [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Clement Jones, [http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/298640522186314.php "Deveaux confirms Cuban oil negotiations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629232252/http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/298640522186314.php |date=2009-06-29 }}, ''Nassau Guardian'', 7 July 2009, accessed 15 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Survex''' is an [[free and open-source]] [[cave surveying]] software, licensed under the [[GNU GPL]]. It is designed to be portable and can be run on a variety of platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Unix-like]].  Survex is very powerful cave survey software, and is actively developing into a complete cave visualization package.

Centreline data is entered using plain text files, which are processed by 'Cavern'.  The text files contain a hierarchy of cave surveys, each of which consists of a list of survey legs, which join survey stations.  This program calculates the real world coordinates of survey stations, taking into account loop closure errors using least-squares minimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Warren

  | title = Distributing Misclosure Errors in Surveying
  | journal = Cambridge Underground
  | pages = 19–30
  | date =1986–87
  | url = http://cucc.survex.com/archive/jnl/1986-7/errors.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This processed data can then be visualised using a GUI front end called Aven.  Survex has [[zero one infinity rule | no arbitrary limits]], and so is particularly good for large complicated cave systems, or areas where you need to see the relationships between multiple cave systems.

Survex was started in 1990 by Olly Betts and Wookey, and more recently Mark Shinwell has developed 'Aven'. Like most cave surveying software, the motivation for its creation arose from a particular surveying project - [[Cambridge University Caving Club|Cambridge University Caving Club's]] explorations in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Telephone numbers in [[Cyprus]] follow a [[Telephone numbering plan#Closed dialing plans|closed]] [[telephone numbering plan]] which was adopted on 1 December 2001. As a result, for land line phone numbers the digit 2 followed by the old area code was affixed to the subscriber number and for mobile phones 9 was affixed to the phone number.  The plan is also used in [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].

Previously, landline numbers consisted of the trunk code 0, the area code, and a six-digit number. 

*Land line number in Nicosia called from Nicosia :
**'''xxxxxx'''
*Landline number in Nicosia called from inside Cyprus (other than Nicosia):
**'''02 xxxxxx'''
*Landline number in Nicosia called from abroad :
**'''+357 2 xxxxxx'''
 
Under the new system, these changed to numbers with eight digits, to be dialled from within Cyprus or abroad.
*Landline number in Nicosia called from inside Cyprus (including Nicosia):
**'''22''' xxxxxx
*Landline number in Nicosia called from abroad:
**'''+357 22''' xxxxxx

Mobile phone numbers had the prefix 09, followed by six digits, which had to be dialled in full. 

*Mobile phone number called from within Cyprus:
**'''99 xxxxxx''' (during that period only '''09''' code was in use, from CYTA)
*Mobile phone number called from abroad :
**'''+357 9 xxxxxx'''

As with fixed line numbers, under the new system, these changed to numbers with eight digits, to be dialled from within Cyprus or abroad. 
 
*Mobile phone number called from within  Cyprus:
**'''9x'''xxxxxx (where '''x''' is either 9 or 7 which belongs to '''CYTA''', 6 which belongs to '''MTN''', 5 to '''PrimeTel''' 4 to '''LemonTel''' and to 4  Callsat )
*Mobile phone number called from abroad after  12/2001:
**'''+357 9x''' xxxxxx

99 and 97 are assigned to [http://www.cytamobile-vodafone.com CYTAmobile-Vodafone] (which was the only mobile phone carrier until 2004), 96 is assigned to [http://www.mtn.com.cy MTN], 95 to [http://www.primetel.com.cy PrimeTel] and 94 to [http://www.lemontel.com.cy LemonTel] CallSat www.callsat.eu Numbering portability between the networks is possible.

All numbers (except short codes) in Cyprus now have eight digits, hence the new numbering plan's promotional logo (in advertising) was an octopus called TESA (from [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Τελικό Εθνικό Σχέδιο Αριθμοδότησης''' ''Final National Numbering Plan'') [http://www.cyta.com.cy/tesa/index.htm]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

== The situation in Northern Cyprus ==
{{main|Telephone numbers in Northern Cyprus}}

In [[Northern Cyprus]], the [[Telephone numbers in Turkey|Turkish numbering plan]] is in use. The Turkish area code 0392 has been assigned for use with landline numbers, with 0533 [[Kuzey Kibris Turkcell]] and 0542 [[KKTC Telsim]] being used for [[mobile phone]]s, while the Turkish [[country calling code|country code]] +90 is used for calls from the rest of the world.

For calls from the [[Republic of Cyprus]] to [[Northern Cyprus]], the code 0139 followed by the 7-digit subscriber number is used, which are charged at local call rates. 0139 is still used for direct calls to [[Northern Cyprus]] even after the numbering plan change of December 2001. 

For calls from Northern Cyprus to the Republic of Cyprus, area code 0123 is used but the call is charged at international rates. It is also possible to use the international prefix 00357. 

These direct telephone connections between the two halves of the island are operated by the United Nations exchange, which allows direct telephone calls between the two communities is in place since 4 May 1998.

After 2 March 2003, direct international calls from the Republic of Cyprus to [[Turkey]] are possible and now callers from the Republic of Cyprus can call Northern Cyprus through Turkey dialling 0090 392 xxxxxxx as well as using 0139 (although in this case calls will be charged at international rates).

== Italian Africa (1913-1941) ==

The very first Italian registration plates, from 1913 to the end of the 1920s, were rectangular, with a white background and with the name or initials of the colony in red followed by the registration number, on a single line, but the documentation on this is fragmentary. For the Italian colonial troops, however, special military service plates were used with the initials SOM (Somalia) or T (Tripolitania) in front.
Subsequently, until 1935, the Italian colonies used white plates on black with a [[Vehicle registration plates of Italy#Province codes 1927 to present day|colonial code]] on the first line, and up to 5 numbers on the second line. The numbers, in relief, were assigned serially and the plates were made of metal, with the [[fasces]] as a seal. The colonial codes were:

*ERITREA, later ER for [[Eritrea]]
*SOMALIA, later SOM for [[Somalia]]
*TRIPOLI for [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]]
*CNA for [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]]

Between 1937 and 1941 there was an Italian governorate in Ethiopia and in those years a new type of Italian license plate was issued. They were exactly the same as the previous ones, but they had three squares on the left, colored top to bottom green, white and red, like the [[Italian flag]], with the letters AOI (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') for [[Italian East Africa]] inside. The front plates resembled standard Italian front license plates, as these were smaller, and only sometimes had the colored squares like the rear license plates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.targheetarghe.it/it-it/p/29/escursioni-esteri&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviations used to indicate the origin are:
*AA for [[Addis Ababa]]
*AM for [[Amhara Governorate|Amara]]
*ER for [[Eritrea Governorate|Eritrea]]
*GS for [[Galla-Sidamo Governorate|Galla e Sidama]]
*HA for [[Harrar Governorate|Harrar]]
*SC for [[Shewa Governorate|Scioà]]
*SOM for [[Somalia Governorate|Somalia]]

'''Wikimapia''' is a privately owned internet company that provides an [[open-content]] [[collaborative mapping]] project. The project implements an interactive "clickable" web map with a geographically-referenced wiki system, with the aim to mark and describe all geographical objects in the world.

Wikimapia was created by Alexandre Koriakine and Evgeniy Saveliev in May 2006.&lt;ref name=WMTeam /&gt; The data, a [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] collection of places marked by registered users and guests, has grown to just under 28,000,000 objects {{as of|November 2017|lc=yes}},&lt;ref name=WMStats/&gt; and is released under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons License Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)]].&lt;ref name=WMTerms /&gt;&lt;ref name=WMHappyBday/&gt; Although the project's name is reminiscent of that of [[Wikipedia]], and the creators share the "[[wiki]]" philosophy,&lt;ref name=WMTeam /&gt; it is not a part of the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]] family of wikis.

==Main principles==
According to the website, Wikimapia is an open-content collaborative mapping project, aimed at marking all geographical objects in the world and providing a useful description of them.&lt;ref name=WMAbout/&gt; It aims to create and maintain a free, complete, multilingual and up-to-date map of the whole world. Wikimapia intends to contain detailed information about every place on Earth.&lt;ref name=WMAbout/&gt;

==Features==

===Viewing===
The Wikimapia website provides a [[Google Maps API]]-based interactive web map that consists of user-generated information layered on top of [[Google Maps]] satellite imagery and other resources. The navigation interface provides scroll and zoom functionality similar to that of Google Maps.

The Wikimapia layer is a collection of "objects" with a polygonal outline (like buildings, forests or lakes) and "linear features" (streets, railroads, rivers, ferry). Streets are connected by intersection points to form a street grid. Both kinds of items may have textual descriptions and photos attached to them. Viewers are able to click on any marked object or street segment to see its description. Descriptions can be searched by a built-in search tool. Tools for refining existing places according to category as well as measuring distances between objects are also available. Objects marked as buildings can have internal places (such as a business inside of a larger office building) added.

Categories are organized in a hierarchy such that viewing by a more general category includes having the specific category included. This is such as viewing "house" includes viewing "detached house". The hierarchy is not a strict hierarchy. For instance, the category "convenience store" appears in multiple places in the hierarchy.

The interface is available in many languages, and the textual description of each item may have multiple versions in different languages. Wikimapia maps can also be embedded on other websites.

===Map editing===
The data in Wikimapia is derived from voluntary [[crowdsourcing]].&lt;ref name=WMTerms /&gt; All users, registered or unregistered (''guest''), are allowed to add a place on the Wikimapia layer. Using a simple graphical editing tool, users are able to draw an outline or polygon that matches the satellite image layer underneath. Each object or "tag" has specific information fields which include categories, a textual description, street address, and a related Wikipedia link. Users are likewise capable of uploading several relevant photos.

Registered users have fewer restrictions on map editing and are able to edit and/or delete existing places as well as draw "''linear features''" (roads, railroads, rivers and ferry lines). A "watchlist" could be manually set up to monitor all activity or object changes made in one or more of the assigned rectangular areas on the map.

==Administration==
The website is maintained and developed by a small team of administrators (the ''Wikimapia Team''), who introduce new features and determine further evolution course.&lt;ref name=WMTeam /&gt; Improvements are largely based on a feedback system from registered users through public forum discussions, bug reports and feature requests.

===User levels and special roles===
The registered user community is largely self-organized, with users communicating through an internal message system and through a public forum. Map editing rewards the user "experience points" and milestone "awards" assigned by the system.&lt;ref name=WMAwards&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimapia Awards|url=http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&amp;show=/user/tools/awards/|website=Wikimapia.org|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WMUserRank&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimapia; Users Rank|url=http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&amp;show=/user/tools/users_rating/?username=|website=Wikimapia.org|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registered users are automatically ranked in levels according to accumulated experience points, with higher levels gaining access to advanced tools and having fewer restrictions on editing activity. A registered user may be promoted to "Advanced User" (''AU'') status as other existing ''AU''s deem it fit. Additional editing and moderation tools, which include the authority to ban users, are given to an Advanced User, who is given the responsibility of countering vandalism in the map.&lt;ref name=WMAdvUser&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimapia Special Role; Advanced User|url=http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&amp;show=/user/tools/awards/?show_badge=4|website=Wikimapia.org|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WMCommunity /&gt;

Special roles of maintaining the website forum, place categories, and the Wikimapia Documentation (''Docs'') are also given by the ''Wikimapia Team'' to some users.&lt;ref name=WMCommunity&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimapia Docs (Community)|url=http://wikimapia.org/docs/Community#Special_roles|website=Wikimapia.org|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of contents==
The data in Wikimapia is derived from voluntary contributors who visit and add the information on the website.&lt;ref name=WMTerms&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimapia terms reference; Terms of Service, Copyright Notice and Privacy Notice.|url=http://wikimapia.org/terms_reference.html|website=Wikimapia.org|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The textual description attached to each place object is in free format, having no restriction on style, with the exception of possessing a [[Neutrality (philosophy)|Neutral Point of View]], where "neutral" is defined as excluding "feelings, opinions, experiences, words which display a personal bias or agenda, politics and/or religion".&lt;ref name=WMAbout/&gt; Citing the source of the information is optional, and a link to a relevant and existing [[Wikipedia]] article is encouraged.

In spite of these recommendations, map coverage is generally uneven, with some areas, usually in developing countries, being cluttered with crude outlines, private residences, subjective evaluations or advertisements, requiring constant attention and refining by regular editors.{{Vague|date=August 2015}} Information can either be edited or deleted by registered users as they deem it inappropriate.

==Licensing==
In December 2009, Wikimapia launched an [[API]] and made its content available in several formats for non-commercial use. In December 2010, the data was announced as being available under a Non-Commercial Creative Commons license.

In May 2012, Wikimapia announced that all the content was available under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons License Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)]].&lt;ref name=WMTerms /&gt;&lt;ref name=WMHappyBday/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wikimapia.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=74&amp;p=298348#p298348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
The site generates some income from [[AdSense]] and Wikimapia Ads.&lt;ref name=WMAds/&gt;

== Interoperability ==
Wikimapia functionality is available on:
*[[Google Earth]], using Google Earth dynamic layer in KML file.&lt;ref name=WMgooKML/&gt;
