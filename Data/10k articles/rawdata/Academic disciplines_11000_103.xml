'''Authenticity''' is a concept in [[psychology]] (in particular [[Existential psychotherapy|existential psychiatry]]) as well as [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]] (in regard to various arts and musical genres). In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], “[[Know thyself]].” But authenticity extends this message: "Don’t merely know thyself – be thyself."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

Views of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely. For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

==Theories==

===Existentialism===
One of the greatest problems facing such abstract approaches is that the drives people call the "needs of one's inner being" are diffuse, subjective, and often culture-bound. For this reason among others, authenticity is often "at the limits" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-11946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Sartre is concerned also with the "[[vertiginous]]" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. "Panegyric Upon Abraham" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees “both the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people’s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. “&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kristoffer Holt, “Authentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as “levelling.” Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by “facing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, “One must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith.

Nietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nietzsche, F.W., &amp; Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls “herding animal morality,”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; if he is to find authenticity. To “stand alone” and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be “strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations.’”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche’s existential philosophies is “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.

According to Abulof, authenticity's calling – being true to oneself – deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the "self": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes “determine your destiny!” urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, “How am I not myself?” and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to “bad faith.” Otherwise, my choices – whatever they might be – constitute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530–532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existential journalism====
[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are “gladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are restricted by “institutional red tape” and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the “red tape” because their work will be published.

Actively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Philosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erich Fromm===
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]&lt;ref&gt;Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart 1941 (also published as "Fear of Freedom" Routledge UK 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the "absolute freedom" of Sartre – as "the illusion of individuality",&lt;ref&gt;Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

===Other perspectives===
Those who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as "the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself "Dare to be yourself"]. ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to "the good life," it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.

==History==
Secular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that "the unexamined life is not worth living". In aesthetics, "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of "authenticity" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Linley, P. A., Maltby, J., Baliousis, M., Joseph, S. (2008) [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Authenticity%20Scale.pdf The authentic personality: "A theoretical and empirical conceptualization, and the development of the Authenticity Scale"]. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''55''' (3): 385–399. {{doi|10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Glossary/demo_glossary.cgi?mode=history&amp;term_id=1196 Authentic life].

The search for authenticity is a hallmark of romantic modernity. Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's “cold” reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935280039|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell,|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a "canon" of existentialist writers which include [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.

The call of, and for, authenticity - "be theyself!" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2018&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: "in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Due to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini (2010). "Semiotic and semantic implications of "authenticity"". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611–612.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more "authentic" relationship with the natural world.

Some writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a "textbook" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of "[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.
[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as "poseurs" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]
Individuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of "[[selling out]]," used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.

Australian author [[Helen Demidenko]]'s novel ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. The novel is about a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. When the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name, this created debate in Australia's literary community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}

The concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"/&gt; "Poseur" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. "The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Deena. ''Heavy Metal:The Music and its Subculture." Da Capo Press, 2009. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In metal, one study of how fans sought out authenticity within the metal scene noted three elements to authenticity: long-term dedication to the scene; knowing key events of metal culture; and making the right choices based on one's authentic inner voice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Susanna. "I Bang My Head, Therefore I Am: Constructing Individual and Social Authenticity in the Heavy Metal Subculture" in ''Young.'' 21 (1). 2013. p. 95-110&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Black metal]], an [[extreme metal]] genre, sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else."{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} In the metal and hardcore punk subcultures, a band that began from a working class milieu that later signs to a major record label for a lucrative recording contract may be deemed to have "[[sell out|sold out]]" and lost their authenticity. In addition to the focus on authenticity in "...punk, [[house music|house]], grunge, garage, and hip-hop," ideas of authenticity have seeped into many other genres, including those considered by some to be less "authentic" than the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

===In marketing===
{{See also|Brand management|}}
In marketing brand authenticity is defined as the degree to which brand identity is causally linked to brand behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Schallehn, Mike; Burmann, Christoph; Riley, Nicola (2014). [https://doi.org/10.1108/JPBM-06-2013-0339 Brand authenticity: model development and empirical testing] Journal of Brand Management. 23 (3), p. 193: https://doi.org/10.1108/JPBM-06-2013-0339&lt;/ref&gt; Authenticity is perceived, if a brand fulfills its brand promise in a unique, consistent and continuous way.&lt;ref&gt;Drivers of perceived brand authenticity https://www.brandauthenticity.org/brand-authenticity.htm Retrieved 07-19-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Beltian body''' is a detachable tip found on the pinnules of some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' and closely related genera. Beltian bodies, named after [[Thomas Belt]], are rich in lipids, sugars and proteins and often red in colour. They are believed to have evolved in a symbiotic relationship with [[ant]]s. The ants live inside special plant structures ([[Domatia]]) or near the plant and keep away [[herbivore]]s.

Other ant-[[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] related plant structures include [[Beccarian body|Beccarian]], [[Mullerian body|Mullerian]] and [[pearl body|pearl bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Oecologia|title=The exploitation of an ant-defended host plant by a shelter-building herbivore|volume=109|issue=3|pages=454–460|year=1997|first=Micky D.|last=Eubanks |author2=Kimberly A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4489">'''Brownout''' in [[software engineering]] is a technique to increase the robustness of an application to computing [[Thrashing (computer science)|capacity shortage]].&lt;ref name=Klein2014/&gt; If too many users are simultaneously accessing an application hosted [[Software as a Service|online]], the underlying [[Server (computing)|computing infrastructure]] may become [[Thrashing (computer science)|overloaded]], rendering the application unresponsive. Users are likely to abandon the application and switch to competing alternatives,&lt;ref name=Nah2004/&gt; hence incurring long-term revenue loss. To better deal with such a situation, the application can be given brownout capabilities: The application will disable certain features – e.g., an online shop will no longer display recommendations of related products – to avoid overload. Although reducing features generally has a negative impact on the short-term revenue of the application owner,&lt;ref name=Fleder2010/&gt; long-term revenue loss can be avoided.

The technique is inspired by [[Brownout (electricity)|brownouts in power grids]], which consists in reducing the power grid's voltage in case electricity demand exceeds production. Some consumers, such as incandescent light bulbs, will dim – hence originating the term – and draw less power, thus helping match demand with production. Similarly, a brownout application helps match its computing capacity requirements to what is available on the target infrastructure. 

Brownout complements [[Elasticity (cloud computing)|elasticity]]. The former can help the application withstand short-term capacity shortage, but does so without changing the capacity available to the application. In contrast, elasticity consists of adding (or removing) capacity to the application, preferably in advance, so as to avoid capacity shortage altogether. The two techniques can be combined; e.g., brownout is triggered when the number of users increases unexpectedly until elasticity can be triggered, the latter usually requiring minutes to show an effect.&lt;ref name=Moreno2015/&gt;

Brownout is relatively non-intrusive for the developer, for example, it can be implemented as an [[Aspect (computer programming)|advice]] in aspect-oriented programming. However, surrounding components, such as load-balancers, need to be made brownout-aware to distinguish between cases where an application is running normally and cases where the application maintains a low response time by triggering brownout.&lt;ref name=Klein2014b/&gt;

The '''[http://ridl.cfd.rit.edu/ Center for Detectors (CfD)]''' is a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] College of Science academic research center. The CfD was founded in 2010 by [[Donald Figer|Dr. Donald Figer.]] Located in the [http://www.rit.edu/research/itc/ IT Collaboratory at RIT], the CfD designs, develops, and implements new advanced sensor technologies through collaboration with academic researchers, industry engineers, government scientists, and university students. The mission of the CfD is to enable scientific discovery, national security, better living, and commercial innovation through the design and development of advanced photon detectors and associated technology in a broad array of applications (e.g. [[astrophysics]], biomedical imaging, [[Earth system science]], and [[Interplanetary spaceflight|inter-planetary travel]]).

== Research ==
[[File:M13Final merged small CfD.jpg|left|thumb|Color image of M13, the Great Cluster in [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], taken by CfD personnel using the Teledyne Hawaii 4RG SiPIN detector (HyViSI). This was the first demonstration of this device in an astronomical application.]]
The CfD uses a multi-disciplinary approach, spanning the many branches of engineering, imaging science, physics and astronomy. Some projects, such as the “Cosmic Ray Damaged Image Repair” project, incorporate astronomy and imaging science. Others, like the NASA-funded Phase II: New Infrared Detectors for Astrophysics project, unite microelectronic engineers, astronomy experts, imaging scientists, and various other professionals in science fields. The Center for Detectors benefits from employees that come from a diverse range of academic programs and professional occupations. The CfD staff includes professors, engineers, and students (undergraduate, masters, and PhD). Many student researchers apply CfD research to their current academic programs at RIT. Students pursue various degrees such as [[Microelectronics|Microelectronic]], [[Computer engineering|Computer]], and [[Electronic Engineering|Electrical Engineering]]. Many undergraduate student researchers choose to pursue master's degrees based on the research that they conduct at CfD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=450:center-for-detectors&amp;catid=142:labs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/news/athenaeum_story.php?id=48266&lt;/ref&gt;

CfD is [[Grant (money)|grant-funded]] and has been awarded more than $16M in external funding since 2006. Primary sponsors include [[NASA]], [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]]. Additional sources of funding include [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]],  [[Exelis Inc.|ITT Excelis]], and [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]].

==Outreach and Communications==
Education supplements to two of the CfD grants have funded projects involving students from local high schools. Students mapped the “Journey of a Photon,” and presented their work at venues nationwide. A second group of high school students used an RIT-developed 3D projection system dubbed the “Planeterrainium” to explore planetary surfaces in 3D.

The Center has been featured at several conferences and in press venues. CfD researcher Kim Kolb presented her MS thesis at the [http://spie.org/op SPIE Optics and Photonics Conferences]. The [http://www.rbj.net Rochester Business Journal] and [http://www.rit.edu/news/ RIT University News] have published articles summarizing the foundations of the Center for Detectors to the public, and informing the RIT community about the purpose of the facilities.

CfD has hosted a variety of distinguished speakers as well. Some presenters include Dr. Donald Hall of the [[University of Hawaii]], Dr. Chris Packham of the [[University of Florida]], Dr. Joss Bland-Hawthorn of the [[University of Sydney]], [[Bruce J. Tromberg|Bruce Tromberg]], of the University of California, Irvine, and Dr. Shouleh Nikzad, Dr. Michael Hoenk, and [[Bedabrata Pain]] of the [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technology’s]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

==Equipment and Facilities==
[[File:RIT CfD Dewar System.JPG|right|thumb|The Center's detector testing system uses custom-built cylindrical vacuum cryogenic dewars.]] The Center has four research labs: the [http://ridle.cis.rit.edu Rochester Imaging Detector Laboratory]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the [[Quantum Dot]] Detector Laboratory, the [[Cleanroom|Clean Room]] Probe Testing Laboratory, and the [[LIDAR]] Laboratory. Three test systems were designed at the CfD, which are essential to the lab’s detector-testing capabilities.

[[File:CfD Spot Projector.JPG|left|thumb|This laser spot projector is used in the Center for Detectors. The system is mounted on a 3D motorized stage that produces a small point source for measurements of intrapixel sensitivity.]] The Center also has access to other RIT facilities, including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203031251/http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=451%3Acenter-for-electronics-manufacturing-a-assembly&amp;catid=142%3Alabs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229 Center for Electronics Manufacturing and Assembly], which specializes in semiconductor chip packaging, printed circuit board assemblies, and electronics/[[optoelectronics]] systems, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203031218/http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=453%3Abrinkman-machine-tools-and-manufacturing-laboratory&amp;catid=142%3Alabs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229 Brinkman Manufacturing Lab], which provides machining support for in-house fabrications.

'''Cholesterol''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chole-'' ([[bile]]) and ''stereos'' (solid), followed by the [[chemical]] [[suffix]] ''-ol'' for an [[alcohol]]) is an [[organic compound|organic]] [[molecule]]. It is a [[sterol]] (or [[chemical modification|modified]] [[steroid]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cholesterol|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[lipid]] molecule, and is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by all animal [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cells]], because it is an essential structural component of all [[animal]] [[cell membrane]]s.

In addition to its importance for animal cell structure, cholesterol also serves as a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for the biosynthesis of [[steroid hormone]]s, [[bile acid]]&lt;ref name="Hanukoglu_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Steroidogenic enzymes: structure, function, and role in regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis | journal = J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 779–804 | date = Dec 1992 | pmid = 22217824 | doi = 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90307-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vitamin D]]. Cholesterol is the principal [[sterol]] synthesized by all animals. In [[vertebrate]]s, [[liver|hepatic]] cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), although there are some exceptions, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which require cholesterol for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razin S, Tully JG | title = Cholesterol Requirement of Mycoplasmas | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–310 | date = May 1970 | pmid = 4911537 | pmc = 247552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Poulletier de la Salle]] first identified cholesterol in solid form in [[gallstone]]s in 1769. However, it was not until 1815 that chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] named the compound "cholesterine".&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul (1816) "Recherches chimiques sur les corps gras, et particulièrement sur leurs combinaisons avec les alcalis. Sixième mémoire. Examen des graisses d'homme, de mouton, de boeuf, de jaguar et d'oie" (Chemical researches on fatty substances, and particularly on their combinations o filippos ine kapios with alkalis. Sixth memoir. Study of human, sheep, beef, jaguar and goose fat), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''2''' : 339–372.

" (I will name ''cholesterine'' — from χολη (bile) and στερεος (solid) — the crystalized substance from human gallstones ... )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olson RE | title = Discovery of the lipoproteins, their role in fat transport and their significance as risk factors | journal = J.

==Physiology==
Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell is capable of synthesizing it by way of a complex 37-step process, beginning with the [[mevalonate pathway]] and ending with a 19-step conversion of [[lanosterol]] to cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Furthermore, it can be absorbed directly from animal-based foods.

A human male weighing 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000&amp;nbsp;mg) per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name="cdc-calories"&gt;{{cite web | title = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | publisher = United States Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/calories.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2012-01-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ingested cholesterol is [[esterified]], and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Lecerf JM, de Lorgeril M | title = Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21385506 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114511000237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various [[lipoprotein]]s (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubois C, Armand M, Mekki N, Portugal H, Pauli AM, Bernard PM, Lafont H, Lairon D | title = Effects of increasing amounts of dietary cholesterol on postprandial lipemia and lipoproteins in human subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 35 | issue = 1994 | pages = 1993–2007 | date = 1994 | pmid = 7868978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to recognize, however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Cholesterol is [[Enterohepatic circulation|recycled]] in the body. The [[liver]] excretes it in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 95% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the [[small intestine]] back into the bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts.&lt;ref name="Plant cholesterol"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | last1 = Behrman | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Gopalan | first2 = Venkat | name-list-format = vanc | title=Cholesterol and Plants | editor-first= William M. | editor-last = Scovell | volume = 82 | number = 12 | year = 2005 | pages = 1791 | doi = 10.1021/ed082p1791|bibcode=2005JChEd..82.1791B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants manufacture [[phytosterol]]s (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption.&lt;ref name="John_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = John S, Sorokin AV, Thompson PD | title = Phytosterols and vascular disease | journal = Curr. Opin. Lipidol. | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17218830 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e328011e9e3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the [[GI tract]], an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant [[sterols]] and [[Stanol ester|stanols]], ranges between ~200–300&amp;nbsp;mg/day depending on eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jesch ED, Carr TP |title=Food Ingredients That Inhibit Cholesterol Absorption |journal=Prev Nutr Food Sci |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=67–80 |year=2017 |pmid=28702423 |pmc=5503415 |doi=10.3746/pnf.2017.22.2.67 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700&amp;nbsp;mg/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agren JJ, Tvrzicka E, Nenonen MT, Helve T, Hänninen O | title = Divergent changes in serum sterols during a strict uncooked vegan diet in patients with rheumatoid arthritis | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–9 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11242480 | doi = 10.1079/BJN2000234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
Cholesterol, given that it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is required to build and maintain [[Cell membrane|membranes]] and modulates [[membrane fluidity]] over the range of physiological temperatures. The [[hydroxyl]] group on cholesterol interacts with the [[Polar molecules|polar]] heads of the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[sphingolipid]]s, while the bulky [[steroid]] and the [[hydrocarbon]] chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the [[Polar molecules#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]] [[Fatty acid|fatty-acid chain]] of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-4646-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sadava D, Hillis DM, Heller HC, Berenbaum MR | title = Life: The Science of Biology 9th Edition | publisher = Freeman | location = San Francisco | year = 2011 | pages = 105–114 | isbn = 978-1-4292-4646-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a ''trans'' conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar.&lt;ref name="Ohvo-Rekilä_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohvo-Rekilä H, Ramstedt B, Leppimäki P, Slotte JP | title = Cholesterol interactions with phospholipids in membranes | journal = Prog.

Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated [[caveolae]] and [[clathrin]]-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent [[endocytosis]]. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using [[methyl beta cyclodextrin]] (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of [[lipid raft]]s in the [[plasma membrane]], which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules.&lt;ref name="Incardona_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Incardona JP, Eaton S | title = Cholesterol in signal transduction | journal = Curr.

&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a [[myelin]] sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of [[Schwann cell]] membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-5056-3"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pawlina W, Ross MW | title = Histology: a text and atlas: with correlated cell and molecular biology | edition = | publisher = Lippincott Wiliams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 230 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-7817-5056-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demyelination]] (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed to be part of the basis for [[multiple sclerosis]].

Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of [[vitamin D]] and all [[steroid hormones]], including the [[adrenal gland]] hormones [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]], as well as the sex hormones [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]]s, and [[testosterone]], and their derivatives.&lt;ref name="Hanukoglu_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne AH, Hales DB | title = Overview of steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to active steroid hormones | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15583024 | doi = 10.1210/er.2003-0030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liver excretes cholesterol into [[bile|biliary]] fluids, which is then stored in the [[gallbladder]]. Bile contains [[Bile acid|bile salts]], which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/liver/bile.html|title=Secretion of Bile and the Role of Bile Acids In Digestion|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
All animal cells manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the [[liver]] and the [[intestines]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-its-made-cholesterol-production-in-your-body|title=How it’s made: Cholesterol production in your body  - Harvard Health|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sites of higher synthesis rates include [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[reproductive organ]]s.

Synthesis within the body starts with the [[mevalonate pathway]] where two molecules of [[acetyl CoA]] condense to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]]. This is followed by a second condensation between [[acetyl CoA]] and [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] to form [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA]] ([[HMG-CoA]]).&lt;ref name="Mehta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/09/biosynthesis-and-regulation-of-cholesterol-animation/|title=Biosynthesis and Regulation of Cholesterol (with Animation)|website=PharmaXChange.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Condensation of Acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

This molecule is then reduced to [[mevalonate]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Production of [[mevalonate]] is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for [[statin]]s (a class of cholesterol lowering drugs).

[[File:Melavonic Acid Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
Mevalonate is finally converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] through the action of geranyl transferase.

[[Konrad Bloch]] and [[Feodor Lynen]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1964 for their discoveries concerning some of the mechanisms and methods of regulation of cholesterol and [[fatty acid metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,  1964|last=|first=|date=|publisher==Nobel Prize, Nobel Media |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of cholesterol synthesis===
Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of [[intracellular]] cholesterol in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[protein]] [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2).&lt;ref name="Espenshade_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL | title = Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 401–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17666007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: [[SREBP cleavage-activating protein|SCAP]] (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and [[INSIG-1]]. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.

The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown MS, Goldstein JL | title = The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–40 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9150132 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. [[Michael S. Brown]] and Dr. [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.

Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]]. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]]. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tymoczko | first1 = John L. | last2 = Berg | first2 = Tymoczko | last3 = Stryer | first3 = Lubert | last4 = Berg | first4 = Jeremy Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry | edition = | publisher = W.H.

===Dietary sources===
[[Animal fat]]s are complex mixtures of [[triglyceride]]s, with lesser amounts of both the [[phospholipid]]s and cholesterol molecules from which all animal (and human) cell membranes are constructed.

===Plasma transport and regulation of absorption===
{{See also|Blood lipids}}

[[File:MetabolismoLipidiE.png|thumb|Lipid logistics: transport of triglycerides and cholesterol in organisms in form of lipoproteins as chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL.]]
As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in [[water]]; it dissolves into the (water-based) bloodstream only at exceedingly small concentrations. Instead, cholesterol is transported within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex discoidal particles with exterior [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via [[emulsification]]. [[Triglyceride]]s and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some is carried as its native "free" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex [[apolipoproteins]], typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. Lipoprotein particles thus include a molecular addresses which play key roles in distribution and delivery of fats around the body in the water outside cells.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27277824|year=2016|author1=Mahley|first1=R.

Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.

VLDL molecules are produced by the liver from [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells, and are degraded by [[lipoprotein lipase]] on the blood vessel wall to IDL.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Blood vessels cleave and absorb [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] from IDL molecules, increasing the concentration of cholesterol. IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by [[HTGL]] and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become LDL molecules, with the highest concentration of cholesterol within them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of [[apolipoprotein B100]], recognized by [[LDL receptor]]s in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of [[apolipoprotein B100]], many LDL receptors concentrate in [[clathrin]]-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via [[endocytosis]]. These vesicles then fuse with a [[lysosome]], where the [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol ''de novo'', according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

When this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness).&lt;ref name="Weingärtner_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH | title = The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13467 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976107 | pmc = 2956704 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 | editor1-last = Federici | editor1-first = Massimo |bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513467W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a [[lipoprotein]]) with "bad" cholesterol.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"/&gt;

===Metabolism, recycling and excretion===
Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives called [[oxysterol]]s. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Kandutsch_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kandutsch AA, Chen HW, Heiniger HJ | title = Biological activity of some oxygenated sterols | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4355 | pages = 498–501 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 663671 | doi = 10.1126/science.663671 |bibcode = 1978Sci...201..498K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”.

In biochemical experiments radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol are used.

===Hypercholesterolemia===
{{Main|hypercholesterolemia|lipid hypothesis}}
[[File:ColesterolemiaMortalitaE.png|thumb|Cholesterolemia and mortality for men and women &lt;50 years and &gt;60 years]]
According to the [[lipid hypothesis]], since cholesterol (like all fat molecules) is transported around the body (in the [[Extracellular fluid|water outside cells]]) inside [[lipoprotein]] particles, elevated cholesterol concentrations ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) potentially offer a lower cost way to estimate concentrations of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] particles; possibly even low concentrations of functional [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] particles, both variations strongly associated with [[cardiovascular disease]] because LDL particles promote [[atheroma]] development in arteries ([[atherosclerosis]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

This atherosclerotic disease process, over decades, leads to [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[stroke]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles,&lt;ref name="Brunzell_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunzell JD, Davidson M, Furberg CD, Goldberg RB, Howard BV, Stein JH, Witztum JL | title = Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 811–22 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18375431 | doi = 10.2337/dc08-9018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LDL particles are often termed "bad cholesterol" because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as "good cholesterol". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body build, [[medication]]s, food choices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol-and-diet/mediterranean-diet Department of Health (UK), NHS Choices, "''More evidence for Mediterranean diet''". 8 March 2011.] Access date: Nov 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and other factors.&lt;ref name="Durrington_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durrington P | title = Dyslipidaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 362 | issue = 9385 | pages = 717–31 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12957096 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially "small dense LDL" (sdLDL) particles, are associated with [[atheroma]] formation in the walls of [[artery|arteries]], a condition known as [[atherosclerosis]], which is the principal cause of [[coronary heart disease]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people.&lt;ref name="Lewington_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewington S, Whitlock G, Clarke R, Sherliker P, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R | title = Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9602 | pages = 1829–39 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18061058 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high. Recently, a ''post hoc'' analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of "good cholesterol".&lt;ref name="van_der_Steeg_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Steeg WA, Holme I, Boekholdt SM, Larsen ML, Lindahl C, Stroes ES, Tikkanen MJ, Wareham NJ, Faergeman O, Olsson AG, Pedersen TR, Khaw KT, Kastelein JJ | title = High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein particle size, and apolipoprotein A-I: significance for cardiovascular risk: the IDEAL and EPIC-Norfolk studies | journal = J.

Med. | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–69 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 3422148 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.148.1.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heart Association]] provides a similar set of guidelines for total (fasting) blood cholesterol levels and risk for heart disease:&lt;ref name="urlCholesterol"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about.jsp | title = Cholesterol | date = 17 November 2008| format = | website = | publisher = American Heart Association | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as today's testing methods determine LDL ("bad") and HDL ("good") cholesterol separately, this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 130&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (2.6 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]/L),&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011020231058/http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about_diff.html |archive-date=20 October 2001 |url=http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about.jsp |dead-url=yes |title=About cholesterol |publisher=American Heart Association |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a newer upper limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (1.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/L) can be considered in higher-risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier.

[[File:Blood values sorted by mass and molar concentration.png|thumb|center|600px|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]], showing usual, as well as optimal, levels of HDL, LDL and total cholesterol in mass and molar concentrations, is found in orange color at right, that is, among the blood constituents with the highest concentration.]]

Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a [[Low-density lipoprotein#Estimation of LDL particles via cholesterol content|variant]]): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.&lt;ref name="Warnick_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L | title = Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints | journal = Clin. Chem. | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–9 | date = January 1990 | pmid = 2297909 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang TY, Newby LK, Chen AY, Mulgund J, Roe MT, Sonel AF, Bhatt DL, [[Elizabeth DeLong|DeLong ER]], Ohman EM, Gibler WB, Peterson ED | title = Hypercholesterolemia paradox in relation to mortality in acute coronary syndrome | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 32 | issue = 9 | pages = E22–8 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19645040 | doi = 10.1002/clc.20518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Framingham Heart Study]], in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1&amp;nbsp;mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to the fact that people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name="Anderson_1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson KM, Castelli WP, Levy D | title = Cholesterol and mortality. 30 years of follow-up from the Framingham study | journal = JAMA | volume = 257 | issue = 16 | pages = 2176–80 | date = April 1987 | pmid = 3560398 | doi = 10.1001/jama.257.16.2176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme, in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age.&lt;ref name="Ulmer_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ulmer H, Kelleher C, Diem G, Concin H | title = Why Eve is not Adam: prospective follow-up in 149650 women and men of cholesterol and other risk factors related to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality | journal = J Women's Health (Larchmt) | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15006277 | doi = 10.1089/154099904322836447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vast majority of doctors and medical scientists consider that there is a link between cholesterol and atherosclerosis as discussed above,&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-373979-9"&gt;{{cite book | first = Daniel | last = Sternberg | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Cholesterol Wars: The Cholesterol Skeptics vs the Preponderance of Evidence | edition = | publisher = Academic Press | location = Boston | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-12-373979-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2014 meta-analysis concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats for cardiovascular health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chowdhury R, Warnakula S, Kunutsor S, Crowe F, Ward HA, Johnson L, Franco OH, Butterworth AS, Forouhi NG, Thompson SG, Khaw KT, Mozaffarian D, Danesh J, Di Angelantonio E | title = Association of dietary, circulating, and supplement fatty acids with coronary risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 160 | issue = 6 | pages = 398–406 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24723079 | doi = 10.7326/M13-1788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypocholesterolemia===
Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness.&lt;ref name="Lewington_2007" /&gt; A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. [[Hyperthyroidism]], or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the [[LDL receptor]], may result in hypocholesterolemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizos CV, Elisaf MS, Liberopoulos EN | title = Effects of thyroid dysfunction on lipid profile | journal = The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 76––84 | date = 24 February 2011 | pmid = 21660244 | doi = 10.2174/1874192401105010076 | pmc=3109527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cholesterol testing===
The [[American Heart Association]] recommends testing cholesterol every 4–6 years for people aged 20 years or older.&lt;ref name="urlHow To Get Your Cholesterol Tested"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/SymptomsDiagnosisMonitoringofHighCholesterol/How-To-Get-Your-Cholesterol-Tested_UCM_305595_Article.jsp | title = How To Get Your Cholesterol Tested | format = | website = | publisher = American Heart Association | pages = | quote = | accessdate = 2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate set of [[American Heart Association]] guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that patients taking [[statin]] medications should have their cholesterol tested 4–12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3–12 months thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cardiosource.org/News-Media/Publications/Cardiology-Magazine/2013/12/Getting-a-Grasp-of-the-Guidelines.aspx|publisher=American College of Cardiology | vauthors = Stone NJ, Robinson J, Goff DC | year = 2013 | title = Getting a grasp of the Guidelines|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to determine a [[lipid profile|lipoprotein profile]]. This measures total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, HDL ("good") cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L or more (200+&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL ("good") cholesterol less than 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]] (or use of [[anti-hypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive medication]]), low HDL level, family history of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) and [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]].&lt;ref name="urlATP III Update 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |title=Implications of Recent Clinical Trials for the ATP III Guidelines |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lungs and Blood Institute |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202053506/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 |quote= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cholesteric liquid crystals==
Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the [[liquid crystal]]line "cholesteric phase". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Liquid crystal|nematic phase]], and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in [[liquid-crystal display]] [[thermometer]]s and in temperature-sensitive paints.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Stereoisomers==
Cholesterol has 256 [[stereoisomer]]s that arise from its 8 stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers are of biochemical significance (''nat''-cholesterol and ''ent''-cholesterol, for ''natural'' and ''enantiomer'', respectively),&lt;ref name="Westover_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westover EJ, Covey DF, Brockman HL, Brown RE, Pike LJ | title = Cholesterol depletion results in site-specific increases in epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation due to membrane level effects.

Chem. | volume = 278 | issue = 51 | pages = 51125–33 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14530278 | pmc = 2593805 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M304332200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiana_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kristiana I, Luu W, Stevenson J, Cartland S, Jessup W, Belani JD, Rychnovsky SD, Brown AJ | title = Cholesterol through the looking glass: ability of its enantiomer also to elicit homeostatic responses | journal = J.

The '''Clore Social Leadership Programme (Clore Social)''' was established in 2008 to develop and strengthen leadership skills and capacity across the social sector. Clore Social was initiated by the [[Clore Duffield Foundation]] and inspired by its sister programme, the Clore Leadership Programme for the creative and cultural sectors. Its founding director was [[Mary Marsh|Dame Mary Marsh]].

Clore Social identifies, connects and develops leaders through its fully funded fellowship programme and works with people, partners and funders across all sectors to offer a holistic approach to developing leaders for social impact. So far 101 fellows have joined its network. It is run by a small staff team from its office in Kings Cross, London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8947">'''Cognitive rhetoric''' refers to an approach to [[rhetoric]], [[composition studies|composition]], and [[pedagogy]] as well as a method for language and [[literary studies]] drawing from, or contributing to, [[cognitive science]].

==History==

Following the [[cognitive revolution]], cognitive linguists, computer scientists, and cognitive psychologists have borrowed terms from rhetorical and [[literary criticism]]. Specifically, [[metaphor]] is a fundamental concept throughout [[cognitive science]], particularly for cognitive linguistic models in which meaning-making is dependent on metaphor production and comprehension.

Computer scientists and philosophers of mind draw on literary studies for terms like “scripts”, “stories”, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|“stream of consciousness”]], “multiple drafts”, and “[[Joycean machine]]”. Cognitive psychologists have researched literary and rhetorical topics such as “[[reader response]]” and “[[deixis]]” in narrative fiction, and transmission of poetry in oral traditions.

==Composition==

Rhetoric is a term often used in reference to [[composition studies]] and pedagogy, a tradition that dates back to [[Ancient Greece]]. The emergence of Rhetoric as a teachable craft (''techne'') links rhetoric and composition pedagogy, notably in the tradition of [[Sophism]]. [[Aristotle]] collected Sophist handbooks on rhetoric and critiqued them in ''Synagoge Techne'' (fourth century BCE).

In Ancient Rome, the Greek Rhetorical tradition was absorbed and became vital to education, as rhetoric was valued in a highly political society with an advanced system of law, where speaking well was crucial to winning favor, alliances, and legal rulings.

Cognitive Rhetoricians focusing on composition (such as [[Linda Flower]] and John Hayes) draw from the paradigm, methods, and terms of cognitive science to build a pedagogy of composition, where writing is an instance of everyday problem-solving processes.

[[James A. Berlin]] has argued that by focusing on professional composition and communications and ignoring ideology, social-cognitive rhetoric—which maps structures of the mind onto structures of language and the interpersonal world—lends itself to use as a tool for training workers in [[corporate capitalism]]. Berlin contrasts Social-Cognitive Rhetoric with Social-Epistemic Rhetoric, which makes ideology the core issue of composition pedagogy.

==Language and literary studies==

Cognitive Rhetoric offers a new way of looking at properties of literature from the perspective of cognitive science. It is interdisciplinary in character and committed to data and methods that produce falsifiable theory. Rhetoric also offers a store of stylistic devices observed for their effect on audiences, providing a rich index with distinguished examples available to researchers in cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive science.

For [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]] (a prominent figure in Cognitive Rhetoric), [[narrative imaging]] is the fundamental instrument of everyday thought. Individuals organize experience in a constant narrative flow, starting with small spatial stories. Meaning is fundamentally parabolic (like a parable): two or more event shapes or conceptual spaces converge (blending) in the parabolic process, generating concepts with unique properties not found in either of the inputs. This process is everyday: anticipating that an object you are headed toward will make contact with you is a parable whereby you project a spatial viewpoint. Such narrative flow is a highly adaptive process, crucial for planning, evaluating, explaining, as well as recalling the past and imagining a future. Thus, literary processes have adaptive value prior to the emergence of linguistic capability (modular or continuous).

'''Computability logic''' ('''CoL''') is a research program and mathematical framework for redeveloping logic as a systematic formal theory of computability, as opposed to [[classical logic]] which is a formal theory of truth. It was introduced and so named by [[Giorgi Japaridze]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt; G. Japaridze, ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016800720300023X    Introduction to computability logic]''. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 123 (2003), pages 1–99.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comparing CoL with classical logic, while formulas in the latter represent true/false statements, in CoL they represent [[computational problem]]s. In classical logic, validity of a formula is understood as being always true, i.e., true regardless of the interpretation of its non-logical primitives (atoms), based solely on form rather than meaning. Similarly, in CoL validity means being always computable. More generally, classical logic tells us when the truth of a given statement always follows from the truth of a given set of other statements. Similarly, CoL tells us when the computability of a given problem  ''A'' always follows from the computability of other given problems ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Moreover, it provides a uniform way to actually construct a solution ([[algorithm]]) for such an ''A'' from any known solutions of ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

CoL understands computational problems in their most general – [[Interactive computation|interactive]] sense. They are formalized as games played by a machine against its environment, and computability means existence of a machine that wins the game against any possible behavior by the environment. Defining what such game-playing machines mean, CoL provides a generalization of the [[Church-Turing thesis]] to the interactive level. The classical concept of truth turns out to be a special, zero-interactivity-degree case of computability. This makes classical logic a special fragment of CoL. Being a [[conservative extension]] of the former, computability logic is, at the same time, by an order of magnitude more expressive, constructive and computationally meaningful. Besides classical logic, [[independence-friendly logic|independence-friendly (IF) logic]]  and certain proper extensions of [[linear logic]] and [[intuitionistic logic]] also turn out to be natural fragments of CoL.&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m02201161744867/?p=a62bebfc0dec4164a3a3ba90fefb86aa&amp;pi=10 In the beginning was game semantics]''.   Games: Unifying Logic, Language and Philosophy. O. Majer, A.-V. Pietarinen and T. Tulenheimo, eds. Springer 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–350. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0507045v3.pdf Prepublication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, ''[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007207000346 The intuitionistic fragment of computability logic at the propositional level]''. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 147 (2007), pages 187–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence meaningful concepts of "intuitionistic truth", "linear-logic truth" and "IF-logic truth" can be derived from the semantics of CoL.

Providing a systematic answer to the fundamental question of what can be computed and how, CoL claims a wide range of potential application areas. Those include constructive applied theories, knowledge base systems, systems for planning and action. Out of these, only applications in constructive applied theories have been extensively explored so far: a series of CoL-based number theories, termed "clarithmetics", have been constructed&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540111001076 Introduction to clarithmetic I]''. Information and Computation 209 (2011),  pp.&amp;nbsp;1312–1354.

Logical Methods is Computer Science 12 (2016), Issue 3, paper 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–59.&lt;/ref&gt; as computationally and complexity-theoretically meaningful alternatives to the classical-logic-based [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] and its variations such as systems of [[bounded arithmetic]].

The traditional proof systems such as [[natural deduction]] or [[sequent calculus]] turn out to be insufficient for axiomatizing any more or less nontrivial fragments of CoL. This has necessitated developing alternative, more general and flexible methods of proof, such as [[cirquent calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;G.

==Language== 
[[File:Operators_of_computability_logic.png|thumb|Operators of computability logic: names, symbols and readings]] The full language of CoL is an extension of the language of classical first-order logic. Its logical vocabulary has several sorts of conjunctions, disjunctions, quantifiers, implications, negations and so called recurrence operators. This collection includes  all connectives and quantifiers of classical logic. The language also has two sorts of nonlogical atoms: ''elementary'' and ''general''. Elementary atoms, which are nothing but the atoms of classical logic, represent ''elementary problems'', i.e., games with no moves that are automatically won by the machine when true and lost when false. General atoms, on the other hand, can be interpreted as any games, elementary or non-elementary. Both semantically and syntactically, classical logic is nothing but the fragment of CoL obtained by forbidding general atoms in its language, and forbidding all operators other than &amp;not;, &amp;and;, &amp;or;, &amp;rarr;, &amp;forall;, &amp;exist;.

Japaridze has repeatedly pointed out that the language of CoL is open-ended, and may undergo further extensions. Due to the expressiveness of this language, advances in CoL, such as constructing axiomatizations or building CoL-based applied theories, have usually been limited to one or another proper fragment of the language.

==Semantics== 
The games underlying the semantics of CoL are called "''static games''". Such games impose no regulations on which player can or should move in a given situation, and it is generally up to the player to decide whether to move or wait for moves by its adversary. It is always a possibility that the adversary moves while a given player is "thinking" on its next step. However, static games are defined in such a way that it never hurts a player to delay its own moves, so such games never become contests of speed. All elementary games are automatically static, and so are the games allowed to be interpretations of general atoms.  There are two players in static games: the ''machine'' and the ''environment''. The machine can only follow algorithmic strategies, while there are no restrictions on the behavior of the environment. Each run (play) is won by one of these players and lost by the other.

The logical operators of CoL are understood as operations on games. Here we informally survey some of those operations. For simplicity we assume that the domain of discourse is always {0,1,2,…}. 

The operation &amp;not; of ''negation'' ("not") switches the roles of the two players, turning moves and wins by the machine into those by the environment, and vice versa. For instance, if ''Chess'' is the game of chess (but with ties ruled out) from the white player’s perspective, then &amp;not;''Chess'' is the same game from the black player’s perspective. 

The ''parallel conjunction'' &amp;and; ("pand")  and ''parallel disjunction'' &amp;or; ("por") combine games in a parallel fashion. A run of ''A''&amp;and;''B'' or ''A''&amp;or;''B'' is a simultaneous play in the two conjuncts. The machine wins ''A''&amp;and;''B'' (resp. ''A''&amp;or;''B'') if it wins both (resp. at least one) of those. So, for instance, ''Chess''&amp;or;&amp;not;''Chess'' is a game on two boards, one played white and one black, and where the task of the machine is to win on at least one board. Such a game can be easily won regardless who the adversary is, by copying his moves from one board to the other. The ''parallel implication'' operator &amp;rarr; ("pimplication") is defined by ''A''&amp;rarr;''B'' = &amp;not;''A''&amp;or;''B''. The intuitive meaning of this operation is ''reducing'' ''B'' to ''A'', i.e., solving ''A'' as long as the adversary solves ''B''. The ''parallel quantifiers'' &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;and;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ("pall") and &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;or;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ("pexists") can be defined by &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;and;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''xA''(''x'') = ''A''(0)&amp;and;''A''(1)&amp;and;''A''(2)&amp;and;...  and  &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;or;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''xA''(''x'') = ''A''(0)&amp;or;''A''(1)&amp;or;''A''(2)&amp;or;.... These are thus simultaneous plays of ''A''(0),''A''(1),''A''(2),…, each on a separate board. The machine wins &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;and;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''xA''(''x'') (resp. &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;or;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''xA''(''x'')) if it wins all (resp. some) of these games. The ''blind quantifiers'' &amp;forall; ("blall") and &amp;exist; ("blexists"), on the other hand, generate single-board games. A run of &amp;forall;''xA''(''x'') or &amp;exist;''xA''(''x'') is a single run of ''A''. The machine wins &amp;forall;''xA''(''x'') (resp. &amp;exist;''xA''(''x'')) if such a run is a won run of ''A''(''x'') for all (resp. at least one) possible values of ''x''. 

All of the operators characterized so far behave exactly like their classical counterparts when they are applied to elementary (moveless) games, and validate the same principles. This is why CoL uses the same symbols for those operators as classical logic does. When such operators are applied to non-elementary games, however, their behavior is no longer classical. So, for instance, if ''p'' is an elementary atom and ''P'' a general atom, ''p''&amp;rarr;''p''&amp;and;''p'' is valid while ''P''&amp;rarr;''P''&amp;and;''P'' is not. The principle of the excluded middle ''P''&amp;or;&amp;not;''P'', however, remains valid. The same principle is invalid with all three other sorts (choice, sequential and toggling) of disjunction.  The ''choice disjunction''  &amp;#8852; ("chor") of games ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A''&amp;#8852;''B'', is a game where, in order to win, the machine has to choose one of the two disjuncts and then win in the chosen component. The ''sequential disjunction'' ("sor") ''A''&lt;small&gt;&amp;#5121;&lt;/small&gt;''B'' starts as ''A''; it also ends as ''A'' unless the machine makes a "switch" move, in which case ''A'' is abandoned and the game restarts and continues as ''B''. In the ''toggling disjunction'' ("tor") ''A''&amp;#10843;''B'', the machine may switch between ''A'' and ''B'' any finite number of times. Each disjunction operator has its dual conjunction, obtained by interchanging the roles of the two players. The corresponding quantifiers can further be defined as infinite conjunctions or disjunctions in the same way as in the case of the parallel quantifiers. Each sort disjunction also induces a corresponding implication operation the same way as this was the case with the parallel implication &amp;rarr;. For instance, the ''choice implication'' ("chimplication") ''A''&amp;#8848;''B'' is defined as &amp;not;''A''&amp;#8852;''B''. 

Then comes the ''recurrence'' group of operators. The ''parallel recurrence'' ("precurrence") of ''A'' can be defined as the infinite parallel conjunction ''A''&amp;and;A&amp;and;A&amp;and;... The sequential ("srecurrence") and toggling ("trecurrence") sorts of recurrences can be defined similarly. The corresponding ''corecurrence'' operators, on the other hand, can be defined as infinite disjunctions instead. ''Branching recurrence'' ("brecurrence") &lt;big&gt;&amp;#10992;&lt;/big&gt;, which is the strongest sort of recurrence, does not have a corresponding conjunction. &lt;big&gt;&amp;#10992;&lt;/big&gt;''A'' is a game that starts and proceeds as ''A''. At any time, however, the environment is allowed to make a "replicative" move, which creates two copies of the then-current position of ''A'', thus splitting the play into two parallel threads with a common past but possibly different future developments. In the same fashion, the environment can further replicate any of positions of any thread, thus creating more and more threads of ''A''. Those threads are played in parallel, and the machine needs to win ''A'' in all threads to be the winner in &lt;big&gt;&amp;#10992;&lt;/big&gt;''A''. ''Branching corecurrence'' ("cobrecurrence") &lt;big&gt;&amp;#10991;&lt;/big&gt; is defined symmetrically by interchanging "machine" and "environment". 

Each sort of recurrence further induces a corresponding weak version of implication and weak version of negation. The former is said to be a ''rimplication'', and the latter a ''refutation''. The ''branching rimplication'' ("brimplication") ''A''&lt;big&gt;&amp;#10204;&lt;/big&gt;''B'' is nothing but &lt;big&gt;&amp;#10992;&lt;/big&gt;''A''&amp;rarr;''B'', and the ''branching refutation'' ("brefutation") of ''A'' is ''A''&lt;big&gt;&amp;#10204;&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#8869;, where &amp;#8869; is the always-lost elementary game. Similarly for all other sorts of rimplication and refutation.

==As a problem specification tool== 
The language of CoL offers a systematic way to specify an infinite variety of computational problems, with or without names established in the literature. Below are some examples. 

Let ''f'' be a unary function. The problem of computing ''f'' will be written as &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;x&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8852;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;y(''y''=''f''(''x'')). According to the semantics of CoL, this is a game where the first move ("input") is by the environment, which should choose a value ''m'' for ''x''. Intuitively, this amounts to asking the machine to tell the value of ''f''(''m''). The game continues as &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8852;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;y(''y''=''f''(''m'')). Now the machine is expected to make a move ("output"), which should be choosing a value ''n'' for ''y''. This amounts to saying that ''n'' is the value of ''f''(m). The game is now brought down to the elementary ''n''=''f''(''m''), which is won by the machine if and only if ''n'' is indeed the value of ''f''(''m''). 

Let ''p'' be a unary predicate. Then &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''p''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''p''(''x'')) expresses the problem of [[Decidability (logic)|deciding]] ''p'', &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''p''(''x'')&amp;&lt;small&gt;&amp;#5121;&lt;/small&gt;&amp;not;''p''(''x'')) expresses the problem of [[Recursively enumerable set|semidieciding]] ''p'', and &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''p''(''x'')&amp;#10843;&amp;not;''p''(''x'')) the problem of [[Computation in the limit|recursively approximating]] ''p''. 

Let ''p'' and ''q'' be two unary predicates. Then  &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''p''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''p''(''x''))&lt;big&gt;&amp;#10204;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''q''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''q''(''x'')) expresses the problem of [[Turing reduction|Turing-reducing]] ''q'' to ''p'' (in the sense that ''q'' is Turing reducible to ''p'' if and only if the interactive problem  &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''p''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''p''(''x''))&lt;big&gt;&amp;#10204;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''q''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''q''(''x'')) is computable).   &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''p''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''p''(''x''))&lt;big&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''(''q''(''x'')&amp;#8852;&amp;not;''q''(''x'')) does the same but for the stronger version of Turing reduction where the oracle for ''p'' can be queried only once. &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;x&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8852;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''y''(''q''(''x'')&amp;#8596;''p''(''y'')) does the same for the problem of [[Many-one reduction|many-one reducing]] ''q'' to ''p''. With more complex expressions one can capture all kinds of nameless yet potentially meaningful relations and operations on computational problems, such as, for instance, "Turing-reducing the problem of semideciding ''r'' to the problem of many-one reducing ''q'' to ''p''". Imposing time or space restrictions on the work of the machine, one further gets complexity-theoretic counterparts of such relations and operations.

==As a problem solving tool== 
The known deductive systems for various fragments of CoL share the property that a solution (algorithm) can be automatically extracted from a proof of a problem in the system. This property is further inherited by all applied theories based on those systems.  So, in order to find a solution for a given problem, it is sufficient to express it in the language of CoL and then find a proof of that expression. Another way to look at this phenomenon is to think of a formula ''G'' of CoL as program specification (goal). Then a proof of ''G'' is – more precisely, translates into – a program meeting that specification. There is no need to verify that the specification is met, because the proof itself is, in fact, such a verification. 

Examples of CoL-based applied theories are the so-called ''clarithmetics''. These are number theories based on CoL in the same sense as Peano arithmetic PA is based on classical logic. Such a system is usually a conservative extension of PA. It typically includes all [[Peano axioms]], and adds to them one or two extra-Peano axioms such as &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8851;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''x''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8852;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''y''(''y''=''x''') expressing the computability of the successor function. Typically it also has one or two non-logical rules of inference, such as constructive versions of induction or comprehension. Through routine variations in such rules one can obtain sound and complete systems characterizing one or another interactive computational complexity class ''C''. This is in the sense that a problem belongs to ''C'' if and only if it has a proof in the theory. So, such a theory can be used for finding not merely algorithmic solutions, but also efficient ones on demand, such as solutions that run in polynomial time or logarithmic space. It should be pointed out that all claritmetical theories share the same logical postulates, and only their non-logical postulates vary depending on the target complexity class. Their notable distinguishing feature from other approaches with similar aspirations (such as [[bounded arithmetic]]) is that they extend rather than weaken PA, preserving the full deductive power and convenience of the latter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9623">The '''conformal cyclic cosmology''' ('''CCC''') is a [[cosmological model]] in the framework of [[general relativity]], advanced by the theoretical physicists [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Vahe Gurzadyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Cosmos may show echoes of events before Big Bang |first=Jason |last=Palmer |date=2010-11-27 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11837869|accessdate=2010-11-27|newspaper=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e06/PAPERS/THESPA01.PDF |title=Before the big bang: An outrageous new perspective and its implications for particle physics |first=Roger |last=Penrose |date=June 2006 |accessdate=2010-11-27 |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |pages=2759–2767 |publisher=Proceedings of EPAC 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurzadyan |first1=VG |last2=Penrose |first2=R |year=2013 |title=On CCC-predicted concentric low-variance circles in the CMB sky |journal=Eur.

In CCC, the universe iterates through infinite cycles, with the future [[Penrose diagram|timelike infinity]] of each previous iteration being identified with the [[Big Bang]] singularity of the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penrose claims to have glimpsed universe before Big Bang |first=Edwin |last=Cartlidge |publisher=physicsworld.com |date=2010-11-19 |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/44388|accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose popularized this theory in his 2010 book [[Cycles of Time (book)|''Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe'']].

== Basic construction ==
Penrose's basic construction&lt;ref name="epac2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roger Penrose |title=Before the Big Bang: An Outrageous New Perspective and its Implications for Particle Physics|year=2006|journal=Proceedings of the EPAC 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e06/PAPERS/THESPA01.PDF|pages=2759–2762}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to connect a [[countable]] sequence of open [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW) spacetimes, each representing a [[big bang]] followed by an infinite future expansion. Penrose noticed that the past [[conformal boundary]] of one copy of FLRW spacetime can be "attached" to the future conformal boundary of another, after an appropriate [[conformal map|conformal rescaling]]. In particular, each individual FLRW metric &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is multiplied by the square of a conformal factor &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; that approaches zero at [[Penrose diagram|timelike infinity]], effectively "squashing down" the future conformal boundary to a conformally regular [[hypersurface]] (which is [[Spacelike#Spacetime intervals|spacelike]] if there is a positive [[cosmological constant]], as is currently believed). The result is a new solution to Einstein's equations, which Penrose takes to represent the entire universe, and which is composed of a sequence of sectors that Penrose calls "aeons".

== Physical implications ==
The significant feature of this construction for particle physics is that, since [[boson]]s obey the laws of [[Conformal field theory|conformally invariant quantum theory]], they will behave in the same way in the rescaled aeons as in their former FLRW counterparts (classically, this corresponds to light-cone structures being preserved under conformal rescaling). For such particles, the boundary between aeons is not a boundary at all, but just a spacelike surface that can be passed across like any other. [[Fermions]], on the other hand, remain confined to a given aeon, thus providing a convenient solution to the [[black hole information paradox]]; according to Penrose, fermions must be irreversibly converted into radiation during black hole evaporation, to preserve the smoothness of the boundary between aeons.

The curvature properties of Penrose's cosmology are also convenient for other aspects of cosmology. First, the boundary between aeons satisfies the [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]], thus providing a certain kind of low-entropy past as required by statistical mechanics and by observation. Second, Penrose has calculated that a certain amount of gravitational radiation should be preserved across the boundary between aeons. Penrose suggests this extra gravitational radiation may be enough to explain the observed [[cosmic acceleration]] without appeal to a [[dark energy]] matter field.

== Empirical tests ==
In 2010, Penrose and [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] published a [[preprint]] of a paper claiming that observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) made by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] contained an excess of concentric circles compared to simulations based on the standard [[Lambda-CDM model]] of cosmology, quoting a 6-sigma significance of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1011.3706 |author1=Gurzadyan VG |author2=Penrose R |title=Concentric circles in WMAP data may provide evidence of violent pre-Big-Bang activity |date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statistical significance of the claimed detection has since been disputed. Three groups have independently attempted to reproduce these results, but found that the detection of the concentric anomalies was not statistically significant, in that no more concentric circles appeared in the data than in Lambda-CDM simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.1268 |author1=Wehus IK |author2=Eriksen HK |title=A search for concentric circles in the 7-year WMAP temperature sky maps |date=2010-12-07 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/733/2/L29 |volume=733 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=L29|bibcode = 2011ApJ...733L..29W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.1305 |author1=Moss A |author2=Scott D |author3=Zibin JP |title=No evidence for anomalously low variance circles on the sky |date=2010-12-07 |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2011/04/033 |volume=2011 |issue=4 |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |page=033|bibcode = 2011JCAP...04..033M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.1656 |author1=Hajian A |title=Are There Echoes From The Pre-Big Bang Universe? A Search for Low Variance Circles in the CMB Sky |date=2010-12-08 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/740/2/52 |volume=740 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=52 |bibcode=2011ApJ...740...52H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeAbreu | first1 = A. | year = 2015  | title = Searching for concentric low variance circles in the cosmic microwave background | arxiv=1508.05158 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2015/12/031 | volume=2015 | issue = 12 | journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics | page=031|bibcode = 2015JCAP...12..031D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the disagreement was tracked down to an issue of how to construct the simulations that are used to determine the significance: The three independent attempts to repeat the analysis all used simulations based on the standard Lambda-CDM model, while Penrose and Gurzadyan used an undocumented non-standard approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1012.1486|title=More on the low variance circles in CMB sky|author1=Gurzadyan VG |author2=Penrose R |class=astro-ph.CO |date=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Gurzadyan and Penrose published the further development of their work introducing a new method they termed the "sky-twist procedure" (not based on simulations) in which WMAP data is directly analysed;&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt; in 2015, they published the results of Planck data analysis confirming those of WMAP, including the inhomogeneous sky distribution of those structures.&lt;ref name="CCC and the Fermi paradox"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurzadyan | first1 = V.G. | last2 = Penrose | first2 = R. | year = 2016 | title = CCC and the Fermi paradox | url = | journal = Eur. Phys. J. Plus | volume = 131 | pages = 11 | doi=10.1140/epjp/i2016-16011-1|arxiv = 1512.00554 |bibcode = 2016EPJP..131...11G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published on August 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2018 Daniel An, [[Krzysztof Antoni Meissner]] and Penrose presented a continued analysis of the CMB data as it seemed to them that “…anomalous points provide an important new input to cosmology, irrespective of the validity of CCC.” They also suggest that those anomalies could be what in CCC are [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] points i.e. remnant signals from “…[[Hawking evaporation]] of supermassive black holes in the aeon prior to ours” and claim that a [[B modes|B-mode]] location found by the [[BICEP2]] team is exactly at one of these Hawking point as predicted by CCC.[[arxiv:1808.01740|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== CCC and the Fermi paradox ==
In 2015 Gurzadyan and Penrose also discussed the [[Fermi paradox]], the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence but high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. Within conformal cyclic cosmology, the cosmic microwave background provides the possibility of information transfer from one aeon to another, including of intelligent signals within [[information panspermia]] concept.&lt;ref name="CCC and the Fermi paradox"/&gt;

'''The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine''' is an international instrument aiming to prohibit the misuse of innovations in [[biomedicine]] and to protect human [[dignity]]. The Convention was opened for signature on 4 April 1997 in [[Oviedo, Spain]] and is thus otherwise known as the '''Oviedo Convention'''. The International [[treaty]] is a manifestation of the effort on the part of the [[Council of Europe]] to keep pace with developments in the field of biomedicine; it is notably the first multilateral binding instrument entirely devoted to biolaw.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention entered into force on 1 December 1999.

==Characteristics==
The Convention provides a framework structure to preserve human dignity comprehensively across the field of [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubios.info/EJ123/ej123d.htm Ismini Kriari-Cataris, ''The Convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine: Convention on human rights and biomedicine,'' Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences Athens, Greece, Journal of Asian and International Bioethics, 12 (2002) 90-93]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is shaped around the premise that there is a fundamental connection between human rights and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum common standard is created by the Convention and allows states to legislate for a greater degree of protection upon ratification (''Article 27''). In addition, judicial protection is conferred on the national courts. Therefore, there is no basis on which an individual can bring an action in relation to the Oviedo Convention alone. The Convention may only be referenced in conjunction with proceedings brought in respect of a violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Absence of any provisions for a judicial procedure from the convention is considered to be a major weakness of the Oviedo Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gr2tq4rz9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+Convention+on+Human+Rights+and+Biomedicine%3A+An+appraisal+of+the+Council+of+Europe+Convention&amp;rft.jtitle=European+Journal+of+Health+Law&amp;rft.au=Roscam+Abbing%2C+H.D.C&amp;rft.date=1998&amp;rft.issn=0929-0273&amp;rft.eissn=1571-8093&amp;rft.volume=5&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=377&amp;rft.epage=387&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1163%2F15718099820522588&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=29051894&amp;paramdict=en-NZ Henriette Roscam Abbing, ''The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.

The rate of advancement in biomedicine caused concern to the Council of Europe that as much as development in this field instilled hope for mankind, it also posed a threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the objective of the Council of Europe to set out common general standards for the protection of the dignity of the human person in relation to biomedical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  A draft convention was requested by the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/healthbioethic/cdbi/default_en.asp Committee on Bioethics]&lt;/ref&gt; and drafted by its Working Group in July 1992. The draft convention underwent public consultation in July 1994, adopted by the Committee of Ministers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/cm/home_en.asp Committee of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1996, and finally opened for signature on 4 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parties to the Convention==
35 states have signed the ‘’’Oviedo Convention’'' since it was opened for signature in 1997, however only 29 of these states have signed and ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/164/signatures|title=Parties to the Oviedo Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=Treaty Office|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that only 29 states have implemented the principles of the instrument into their national law. Furthermore, 6 of those ratifying states have reservations limiting the extent to which they are bound to certain provisions. Notably, the UK and Germany have neither signed nor ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Parties to the Oviedo Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK considered the convention too restrictive, whereas Germany thought it too permissive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues addressed by the Convention==
The preamble to the Oviedo Convention makes clear that its intention is for developments in biomedicine to benefit future generations and all of humanity.  The convention sets out the legal framework, which will ensure the protection of the dignity and identity of the human being. Intended as a supplementary instrument, the convention will be read in conjunction with other human rights protections namely: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Introduction.aspx UDHR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx ICCPR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx ICESCR]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx CRC]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ([[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|ECHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf ECHR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703000000/http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf |date=July 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/T/DGHL/Monitoring/SocialCharter/ European Social Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Principles===
The general provisions of the Oviedo Convention outline the object and purpose of the instrument. The aim is to secure the dignity of human beings within the field of biomedicine. Several principles are adopted in order to achieve this goal. Embodied in the first chapter to the convention, the principles relate to the primacy of the human being, equitable access to healthcare ([[health equity|equitable access to healthcare]]), and professional standards.

===Consent===
The issue of consent is pivotal to the Convention because of the relationship it has to individual [[autonomy]]. Medical intervention carried out without consent is a general prohibition within ''Article 5''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, consent must be free and fully informed. Free and [[informed consent]] is based on objective information. Protection is afforded to those not able to consent and provision is made for emergency situations. Specific rules must be observed where any medical intervention is carried out in any situation where a person is not able to give free and informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private life and right to information===
This issue is closely related to the right to privacy in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The scope of the right encompasses an individual’s entitlement not to know as well as the right to know information regarding their health. Interests of the patient, a third party, or society may lead to a restriction of either facet of the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human genome===
The Oviedo Convention incorporates provisions to address concerns relating to research into the [[human genome]]. Focus is honed on [[genetic testing]], the storage of genetic data and modification of the human genome.  Genetic testing as a tool for discrimination is prohibited under ''Article 11'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 11]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Article 12'' allows genetic testing only for health or for scientific research linked to health purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching theme is that genetic testing is reserved for health-related purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, modification of the human genome, for reasons other than health-related is generally prohibited under ''Article 13'' of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
The freedom of scientific research&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=freedom%20of%20scientific%20research  World Congress for Freedom of Research]&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in ''Chapter V''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter V]&lt;/ref&gt; However, precedence is afforded to the protection of human dignity and other fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the freedom of research is qualified (''Article 15'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out on human beings is under strict controls set forth by the convention (''Article 16'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The general rules on consent stipulated in ''Chapter II''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; must be observed in the context of research. In addition, the creation of embryos [[in vitro]] for the purposes of scientific research is expressly prohibited (''Article 18'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 18]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Organs and Transplantation===
The Convention provides the general rule that living donors for organ transplants are only to be utilised if there is no availability of organs from a deceased person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter VI]&lt;/ref&gt; Any removed parts of the body must be disposed of respectfully in accordance with the wishes of the individual. In addition, there is to be no financial gain arising from the human body or its parts, however adequate compensation for expenses incurred for a medical procedure is not prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 132]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules relating to consent laid out in ''Chapter II'' of the Convention also apply in the context of organ transplantation.

==Infringements of the Provisions of the Convention==
In accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, any individual who has suffered damage should have access to fair compensation (''Article 24'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate judicial protection is required to be put in place to ensure there is no infringement of the principles contained in the Convention. Proportionate sanctions will be imposed for non-compliance in accordance with ''Article 25''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider Protection==
The Oviedo Convention reflects a [[minimum harmonisation]] instrument. Therefore, parties to the convention have jurisdiction to provide a greater degree of protection than that offered by the convention. However, they cannot offer lesser protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 161-162]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of the Convention==
Questions of interpretation may be referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for an advisory opinion to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 164]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are unable to bring an action on the basis of violation of the Oviedo Convention alone, but may reference the provisions in proceedings relating to the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Reservations==
A [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] may be made with respect to a particular provision of the convention (''Article 36''). Six states have reservations regarding particular provisions:
* [[Croatia]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[France]]
* [[Norway]]
* [[Switzerland]]
* [[Turkey]]

==Denunciation==
Any [[signatory]] can denounce the convention by means of notification to the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]].

==Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings==
Deliberate [[cloning]], to create genetically identical human beings, is contrary to human dignity and constitutes a misuse of biology and medicine. It is therefore prohibited under this protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/168.htm Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Transplantation==
The protocol stipulates that, insofar as is possible, equitable access to transplantation services should be ensured. In addition, any transplantation should be carried out with respect for rights and freedoms of donors, potential donors, and recipients of organs and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/186.htm Protocol on Transplantation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Biomedical Research==
In the context of biomedical research, the protocol aims to ensure protection for dignity and identity of all human beings without discrimination. The Protocol recognises that research can contribute to saving and improving human life but it can also run contrary to the fundamental principles of dignity and other rights. Where this may be the case the research should not be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/195.htm Protocol on Biomedical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes==
The protocol responds to the concerns regarding possible improper use of genetic testing and aims to protect the dignity and identity of all human beings within this sphere. Through restricting use of genetic testing to health purposes only the convention aims to achieve its object and purpose. Genetic Testing is also permitted for scientific research, but its regulation is not included in this Protocol. It also establishes the need of free and informed consent and genetic counselling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/203.htm Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8897">A '''coupled human–environment system''' (known also as a '''coupled human and natural system''', or '''CHANS''') characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems (e.g., economic, social) and natural (e.g., hydrologic, atmospheric, biological, geological) systems.&lt;ref&gt;  [https://www.nsf.gov/geo/ere/ereweb/fundlisting.cfm?09560946044805114F1D4B14474914  Environmental Resource and Education Funding Opportunities], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marina11"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/0012-9623-92.2.218 |title=Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS): Approach, Challenges, and Strategies |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=218–28 |year=2011 |last1=Alberti |first1=Marina |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Heidi |last3=Baker |first3=Lawrence A |last4=Brozovic |first4=Nicholas |last5=Drinkwater |first5=Laurie E |last6=Drzyzga |first6=Scott A |last7=Jantz |first7=Claire A |last8=Fragoso |first8=José |last9=Holland |first9=Daniel S |last10=Kohler |first10=Timothy (Tim) A |last11=Liu |first11=Jianguo (Jack) |last12=McConnell |first12=William J |last13=Maschner |first13=Herbert D.

As CHANS research is relatively new, it has not yet matured into a coherent field. Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-discplinary fields such as [[human ecology]], [[ecological anthropology]], [[environmental geography]], [[ecological economics|economics]], as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in [[complex adaptive systems]], [[complexity economics]], [[dynamical system]]s theory, and the [[earth science]]s. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Liu07"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[639:chans]2.0.co;2 |jstor=25547831 |pmid=18240679 |title=Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639–49 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Jianguo |last2=Dietz |first2=Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=Stephen R |last4=Folke |first4=Carl |last5=Alberti |first5=Marina |last6=Redman |first6=Charles L |last7=Schneider |first7=Stephen H |last8=Ostrom |first8=Elinor |last9=Pell |first9=Alice N |last10=Lubchenco |first10=Jane |last11=Taylor |first11=William W |last12=Ouyang |first12=Zhiyun |last13=Deadman |first13=Peter |last14=Kratz |first14=Timothy |last15=Provencher |first15=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1144004 |pmid=17872436 |title=Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1513–6 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=J |last2=Dietz |first2=T |last3=Carpenter |first3=S.

==History==
The phrase "coupled human–environment systems" appears in the earlier literature (dating back to 1999) noting that social and natural systems are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Sheppard04"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Sheppard | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=McMaster | editor2-first=R.

The CYP omega hydroxylases are often referred to as monoxygenases; however, the [[monooxygenase]]s are CYP450 enzymes that add a hydroxyl group to a wide range of [[xenobiotic]] (e.g. drugs, industrial toxins) and naturally occurring endobiotic (e.g. cholesterol) substrates, most of which are not fatty acids. The CYP450 omega hydroxylases are accordingly better viewed as a subset of monooxygenases that have the ability to hydroxylate fatty acids. While once regarded as functioning mainly in the [[catabolism]] of dietary fatty acids, the omega oxygenases are now considered critical in the production or break-down of fatty acid-derived mediators which are made by cells and act within their cells of origin as [[autocrine signaling]] agents or on nearby cells as [[paracrine signaling]] agents to regulate various functions such as blood pressure control and inflammation.

==Action==
The omega oxygenases metabolize fatty acids (RH) by adding a hydroxyl (OH) to their terminal (i.e. furthest from the fatty acids' carboxy residue) carbons; in the reaction, the two atoms of molecular oxygen(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ are reduced to one hydroxyl group and one water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule) by the concomitant oxidation of [[NAD(P)H]] (see [[monooxygenase]]).&lt;ref name="PUB00000123"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harayama S, Kok M, Neidle EL |title=Functional and evolutionary relationships among diverse oxygenases |journal=Annu.

RH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NADPH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → ROH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

==Functions==
CYP450 enzymes belong to a superfamily which in humans is composed of at least 57 CYPs; within this superfamily, members of six CYP4A subfamilies, (which are CYP4A, CYP4B, CYP4F, CYP4V, CYP4X, and CYP4z) possess ω-hydroxylase activity viz., CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4F&lt;ref name="Panigrahy_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panigrahy D, Kaipainen A, Greene ER, Huang S | title = Cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids: the neglected pathway in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 723–35 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 20941528 | pmc = 2962793 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9264-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15822183 | year = 2005 | author1 = Kroetz | first1 = D.

*1) The only member of the CYP4B subfamily, [[CYP4B1]], shows a preference for ω-oxidizing [[short-chain fatty acid]]s, i.e. fatty acids that are 7-9 carbons long; CYP4B1 is far more weakly expressed in humans than that expressed in other mammals that were tested.&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26233909 | pmc = 4667791 | year = 2015 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = A.

*2) A member of the CYP4A subfamily, [[CYP4A11]], preferentially ω-hydroxylate [[medium-chain fatty acids]], i.e. fatty acids that are 10-16 carbons long; [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F2]], [[CYP4F3]]A, [[CYP4F3]]B,  [[CYP4F11]], [[CYP4V2]], and [[CYP4Z1]] also metabolize these fatty acids.&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"/&gt;  Subsequent to their ω-hydroxylation, these products are converted to their acyl[[carnitine]] derivatives and transferred to [[mitochondria]] for complete oxidized by [[beta oxidation]] (see also [[omega oxidation]]).&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;
*3) Members of the CYP4F family, i.e. CYPA11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F11, as well as CYP2U1 ω-hydroxylate long chain fatty acids, i.e. fatty acids that are 18 to 20 carbons long.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;  These hydroxyl fatty acids are then serially metabolized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]], and dicarboxylyl CoA synthetase to form their respective [[Coenzyme A]] (CoA)-bound dicarboxylic acids and transferred to [[peroxisome]]s where they may undergo chain shortening or, as acylcarnitine derivatives or free acids, transferred to mitochondria for complete beta oxidation. The chain-shortened products of peroxisome metabolism may also be converted to [[phospholipid]]s, [[triglycerides]], and [[cholesterol ester]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;
*4) Members of the CYP4F family, i.e. CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, ω-hydroxylate [[very long chain fatty acids]], i.e. fatty acids that are 22 to 26 carbons long.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt; These hydroxyl fatty acids are then serially metabolized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]], and dicarboxylyl CoA synthetase to form their respective CoA-bound dicarboxylic acids and transferred to [[peroxisome]]s where they may undergo chain shortening or, as acylcarnitine derivatives or free acids, transferred to mitochondria for complete beta oxidation. The chain-shortened products of peroxisome metabolism may also be converted to [[phospholipid]]s, [[triglycerides]], and [[cholesterol ester]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;
*5) [[CYP4F22]] ω-hydroxylates extremely long very long chain fatty acids, i.e. fatty acids that are 28 or more carbons long. The ω-hydroxylation of these special fatty acids is critical to creating and maintaining the skins water barrier function; autosomal recessive inactivating mutations of CYP4F22 are associated with the [[Lamellar ichthyosis]] subtype of [[Congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25982146 | year = 2015 | author1 = Sugiura | first1 = K | title = Update on autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis: MRNA analysis using hair samples is a powerful tool for genetic diagnosis | journal = Journal of Dermatological Science | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–9 | last2 = Akiyama | first2 = M | doi = 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2015.04.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*6) CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F11 ω-hydroxylate [[leukotriene B4]] and very probably [[5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]] and [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]].&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"/&gt;  This hydroxylation greatly reduces the ability of these arachidonic acid metabolites to stimulate cells that mediate [[inflammation]] and [[allergic reactions]] and may thereby limit and contribute to the resolution of these [[innate immunity]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3095426 | year = 1986 | author1 = O'Flaherty | first1 = J.

*7) CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, CYP4F11, CYP4F12, CYP4V2, CYP2U1, and possibly CYP4Z1 metabolize arachidonic acid to [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]] (20-HETE).&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14660610"/&gt;  Animal and human tissue studies suggest that the CYP-dependent production of 20-HETE contributes to the regulation of blood pressure, the growth of certain cancers, and the [[metabolic syndrome]] while genetic studies on [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] in humans support roles for: '''a)''' CYP4F11-dependent 20-HETE production in the prevention of hypertension; '''b)''' CYP4F2-dependent 20-HETE production of 20-HETE in the prevention of hypertension, [[ischemic stroke]], and [[myocardial infarction]]; and '''c)''' CYP2U1 in [[Hereditary spastic paraplegia]], possibly by a 20-HETE-dependent mechanism in a small percentage of patients with this disease (see [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid#Human studies]]). Some or possibly even all of these CYPs may also omega hydroxylate [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA). 20-hydroxy EPA and 20-hydroxy-DHA do stimulate [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha]] but their range of biological activities have yet to be investigated.&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"/&gt;

}}'''Deborah Swackhamer''' is an [[environmental chemist]] and professor emerita at the [[University of Minnesota]] in Minneapolis. Swackhamer has applied her expertise in studying the effects of exposure to toxic chemicals, as well as the processes that spread those chemicals, to developing policies that address exposure risks.

== Education and early career ==
Swackhamer received her Bachelor's degree in [[Chemistry]] from [[Grinnell College]] in Iowa in 1976. She then received her Masters of Science from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1981, where she studied [[Water chemistry|Water Chemistry]]. In 1985, she earned her PhD in [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a thesis entitled "Role of water-particle partitioning and sedimentation in controlling the fate and transport of PCBs in lakes" in the laboratory of David E. Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|title=Role of water-particle partitioning and sedimentation in controlling the fate and transport of PCBs in lakes|date=1985-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236422302_Role_of_water-particle_partitioning_and_sedimentation_in_controlling_the_fate_and_transport_of_PCBs_in_lakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCB, or [[polychlorinated biphenyl]], is a chlorine compound that was once widely found in dielectric and coolant fluids used in electronics. PCBs are now widely considered an environmental contaminant as they've been shown to cause a variety of adverse health effects, including cancer, fertility complications, and neurologic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs|title=Learn about Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10|date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swackhamer's thesis research focused on better understanding how PCBs were transported in bodies of water, using Lake Michigan as a model for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987-01-01|title=Distribution and Characterization of PCBs in Lake Michigan Water|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133087716244|journal=Journal of Great Lakes Research|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=24–36|doi=10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71624-4|issn=0380-1330|last1=Swackhamer|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Armstrong|first2=David E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=ARMSTRONG|first2=DE|date=1986-09-01|title=Estimation of the atmospheric and nonatmospheric contributions and losses of polychlorinated biphenyls to Lake Michigan on the basis of sediment records of remote lakes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278869708|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|volume=20|issue=9|pages=879–883|doi=10.1021/es00151a005|pmid=22263819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=E.

Following her doctorate, Swackhamer became a postdoctoral research associate at [[Indiana University]] in Chemistry and Public &amp; Environmental Affairs, working in [[Ronald A. Hites]]'s group from 1985 to 1987. There, she worked to develop a method for quantitating the insecticide [[toxaphene]] in environmental samples using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah L.|last2=Charles|first2=M.

== Research ==
In 1987, Swackhamer joined the [[University of Minnesota]] faculty where she continued her research of studying the process that affect the behavior and fate of organic contaminants that are resistant to degradation and remain in the environment for a long time, known as "persistent organic compounds." Her research has more specifically centered on PCBs, [[dioxins]], and pesticides in the [[Great Lakes]] region. For instance, her group found that the high water concentrations of the pesticide [[toxaphene]] in [[Lake Superior]] are the result of colder temperatures and lower sedimentation rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=Schottler|first2=Shawn|last3=F.

Her group has also modeled annual and seasonal fluxes of toxaphene from water to air and sediment, finding that toxaphene contamination will persist far into the future in the Great Lake region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.

== Public service and leadership ==
Swackhamer has lent her expertise to serving on a number of environmental advisory boards. Starting in 2000 to 2013, she joined the Science Advisory Board of the [[International Joint Commission]] of the United States and Canada, which provides scientific advice to the Commission and the Water Quality Board under the [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]]. During her tenure, she co-authored a report on emerging issues of the Great Lakes to identify issues of importance for the next 25 years, as well as opportunities for sustaining progress under the Great Lakes Quality Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/330179/publication.html|title=Expert consultation on emerging issues of the Great Lakes in the 21st century : report of the Great Lakes Science Advisory Board to the International Joint Commission / Edited by Peter Boyer, Allan Jones and Deborah Swackhamer. : E95-2/3-2006E-PDF - Government of Canada Publications - Canada.ca|last=Services|first=Government of Canada, Public Services and Procurement Canada, Integrated Services Branch, Government Information Services, Publishing and Depository|website=publications.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges identified included climate change, chemical contaminants, and changes to the biological community surrounding the Great Lakes. In 2003, Swackhamer became the director of the University of Minnesota's Water Resources Center. She served as the director of University of Minnesota’s Water Resources Center. From 2006 to 2012, she was a member of the board of directors, National Institutes of Water Resources (NIWR), serving as its president from 2010 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niwr.info/about/past-presidents|title=NIWR :: Past Presidents|website=niwr.info|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Swackhamer was appointed to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Board of Environmental Science and Toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/global/best/Board-Members|title=BEST Board Members|website=dels.nas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2012, Swackhamer was a member of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Advisory Board, and served as its Chair from 2008 to 2012. She later served as Chair of the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), an independent an external panel of experts that advises the agency's office of science. Her three-year term began in the spring of 2015, however, she was prematurely dismissed from her position following her testimony to the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/scientist-tells-her-story-latest-partisan-battle-house-science-panel|title=Scientist tells her story in latest partisan battle on House science panel|date=2017-06-28|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epa-accused-interfering-top-science-adviser-s-congressional-testimony-n777916|title=EPA accused of interfering with top science adviser's congressional testimony|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/epa-official-pressured-scientist-on-congressional-testimony-emails-show.html|title=E.P.A.

Nevertheless, EPA leadership tried to interfere with her testimony in advance of the hearing, which raised concerns among the House Democrats, who alleged that such interference was "inappropriate and may have violated federal regulations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientist-epa-pressured-me-to-change-testimony-to-congress/|title=Scientist says EPA staff pressured her to change testimony to Congress|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the pressure, Swackhamer did not change her testimony and was subsequently dismissed. Following her dismissal, she told ''[[The New York Times]]'': "The Board of Scientific Counselors had 68 members two months ago [in April 2018]. It will have 11 come Sept. 1. They’ve essentially suspended scientific activities by ending these terms.”

'''Eco-restructuring''' is the implication for an ecologically sustainable [[economy]].  The principle of [[ecological modernization]] establishes the core literature of the functions that eco-restructuring has within a global regime. Eco-restructuring has an emphasis on the technological progressions within an ecological system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maricica|first=D. I.|year=2011|title=Ecological modernisation a basis for the tourism sustainable development|url=|journal=Annals of DAAAM &amp; Proceedings|volume=22 |issue=1|pages=1357–1358|via=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials implement environmental policies to establish the industrial- ecological progressions that enable the motion of economic modernization. When establishing economic growth, policy makers focus on the progression towards a sustainable environment by establishing a framework of ecological engineering. Government funding is necessary when investing in efficient technologies to stimulate technological development.

Environmental dimensions such as the preservation of landscape is achieved through [[sustainability]]. When analyzing the issues of sustainability, the importance of socio-technical transitions is highlighted to meet the needs of ecological policies. When an organization of resources is sustainable, it means that it will remain at a certain level of progress due to self-preservation without affecting the fundamental purpose of its existence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2009|title=Sustainable development and the need for technological revolution|journal=Annals of DAAAM &amp; Proceeding|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=1061–1062|via=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the industrial sector allows for sustainability to progress in an effective manner. When eco-restructuring is applied to the concept of sustainability, environmentally friendly technologies are essentially the main framework for clean and efficient productions.

Social support and acknowledgement must be present when highlighting the functions of modernizing the ecological structures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buttel|first=F. H.|year=2000|title=Ecological modernization as social theory|journal=Geoforum|volume=31 |issue=1|pages=57–65|via=10.1016/S0016-7185(99)00044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To have a smooth transition between socio-technical categories, social agreement is important when introducing eco-restructuring methods. When forming new ecological policies, policy makers focus on the movement that sustainable environments have in regards to the social expectations.

Economic [[Production (economics)|production]] is an example of the existing relationship between eco-restructuring and sustainability. Cleaner production with minimal impact on the environment is the main idea behind the correlation of the two subjects. Since [[industrial ecology]] contributes to the direction of sustainability, eco-restructuring is perceived as a benefit for the environment and natural adaptation. Critics of the eco-restructuring and sustainability policies argue that a clear balance between a self-preserving ecological system and mass production is difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=A.|year=1996|title=Ecotechnology in industrial practice: Implementation using sustainability indices and case studies|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=7 |issue=2|pages=117–138|via=10.1016/0925- 8574(96)00005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological engineering has been a major component used when applying eco-restructuring methods in the production of resources.

== Origins ==
In 1998, the book ''Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. The book provided a significant contribution to the research of industrial- ecological progressions. Robert Ayres introduced a new prototype of eco-restructuring for sustainable development of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadkarni|first=M. V.|year=2000|title=Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development|journal=Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=55|pages=62–63|via=http://search.proquest.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication for cleaner and more efficient technologies contributes to the research of ecological construction.

=== Technologies ===

Efficient technologies are defined as services that reduce the non-renewable resources produced and increase the production rate.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duchin|first=F.|last2=Lange|first2=G. M.|last3=Kell|first3=G.|year=1995|title=Technological change, trade and the environment|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=14|pages=185–193|via=doi:10.1016/0921-8009(95)00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] is a form of energy obtained from clean and natural resources. Solar and wind power technologies are examples of clean energy forms that would eliminate pollution produced from the coal and diesel energy sectors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Economic movement ===

The economic movement outlined by Robert Ayers refers to the use of [[Green economy|green economies]]. This type of economy structure looks at ways to reduce the environmental impacts. Nations focus on steering their policy agenda to allow the implementation of ecological strategies. This will accelerate the transformation of the economy sectors towards a clean and effective ecological state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social lifestyles ===

Human economic activities can influence the type of issues that ecological systems face. These social lifestyles are subject to the changes in the production of goods and services. An example of this idea would be the collection of raw materials and disposing them in a proper efficient manner that will have little impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the whole cycle is restructured to meet the principles of ecological regulation, then experts would have to analyze the effects of human activities and determine a possible alternative to the removal of [[biomedical waste]] and other raw materials.

Many of the eco-restructuring principles were outlined in the ''Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development'' book. However, policy makers can also have an opinion on the ideas and promises that this method of sustainability offers. Certain factors can influence the regulations that the policies cover such as the need for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Legislative measures are also developed based on the propositions of ecological and economical advantages. The principle of sustainable development applies to the restructuring of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles. These principles have helped to determine an evolution of the ecological system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Environmental factors ==
When an ecological system is altered, environmental standards must be put in place to preserve the stability of the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The application of eco-restructuring seeks to improve the environmental stability in relation to manufacturing and waste management. However, ecological effects can occur by following improper procedures. Despite the precautions that must be considered, there are environmental benefits of ecological modernization such as renewable energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of renewable energy would eliminate the threat of ecological dangers such as pollution. Modern technologies also have a role in the impact of the environment. When new technologies are developed, sustainability is achieved through improving the environmental dimensions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Eco-restructuring and sustainability ==
Socio-technical transitions correlate to the need for social change in the study of sustainable resources. Sustainability has a significant role in the fields of management such as education, health care, economics, ecology and technology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The main framework for clean and efficient productions is supported by the idea of a self-preserving system. Despite the research supporting the reformation of the ecological system, natural resources can suffer a depletion and will need the support of sustainability to preserve its existence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; New policies are required to move towards equality and sustainability since the social expectations reflect the relationship between the two concepts. The public perception for an alternative solution to sustainable development is reflected through the ecological policies enacted by government officials. Eco-restructuring offers a positive aspect to the principles of ecological modernization. It is an alternative to the motion of technological progressions within the global economic regime.

'''Electronic engineering''' (also called '''electronics and communications engineering''')  is an [[electrical engineering]] discipline which utilizes nonlinear and [[active component|active]] electrical components (such as [[semiconductor device]]s, especially [[transistors]], [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuits]]) to design [[electronic circuit]]s, [[electronic device|devices]], [[VLSI]] devices and their [[electronic system|systems]]. The discipline typically also designs [[passive component|passive]] electrical components, usually based on [[printed circuit board]]s.

Electronics is a subfield within the wider [[electrical engineering]] academic subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as [[analog electronics]], [[digital electronics]], [[consumer electronics]], [[embedded systems]] and [[power electronics]]. [[Electronics]] engineering deals with implementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example [[solid-state physics]], [[radio engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[control systems]], [[signal processing]], [[systems engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[instrumentation engineering]], [[electric power control]], [[robotics]], and many others.

The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) is one of the most important and influential organizations for electronics engineers.

== Relationship to electrical engineering ==
Electronics is a subfield within the wider [[electrical engineering]] academic subject. An academic degree with a major in electronics engineering can be acquired from some universities, while other universities use electrical engineering as the subject. The term [[electrical engineer]] is still used in the academic world to include electronic engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Hambley ''Electrical Engineering'', pp. 3, 441, Prentice Hall, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-13-147046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people consider the term 'electrical engineer' should be reserved for those having specialized in power and heavy current or high voltage engineering, while others consider that power is just one subset of electrical engineering, as well as '[[electrical distribution]] engineering'. The term '[[power engineering]]' is used as a descriptor in that industry.  Again, in recent years there has been a growth of new separate-entry degree courses such as '[[systems engineering]]' and '[[communication systems engineering]]', often followed by academic departments of similar name, which are typically not considered as subfields of electronics engineering but of electrical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6dEAAAAIAAj&amp;dq=electrical+vs+electronic+engineering&amp;lr= |title=Principles of Electrical Engineering |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pansini ''Electrical Distribution Engineering'', p. xiv, The Fairmont Press Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-88173-546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of electronic engineering}}
Electronic engineering as a profession sprang from technological improvements in the [[telegraph]] industry in the late 19th century and the [[radio]] and the [[telephone]] industries in the early 20th century. People were attracted to radio by the technical fascination it inspired, first in receiving and then in transmitting. Many who went into broadcasting in the 1920s were only 'amateurs' in the period before [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Barnouw ''A Tower in Babel'', p. 28, Oxford University Press US, 1966 {{ISBN|978-0-19-500474-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To a large extent, the modern discipline of electronic engineering was born out of telephone, radio, and [[television]] equipment development and the large amount of electronic systems development during [[World War II]] of [[radar]], [[sonar]], communication systems, and advanced munitions and weapon systems. In the interwar years, the subject was known as [[radio engineering]] and it was only in the late 1950s that the term '''electronic engineering''' started to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdDAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=radio+engineering&amp;lr= |title=Radio Engineering Principles |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronics ==
{{main|Electronics}}
In the field of electronic engineering, engineers design and test [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] that use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] properties of [[electrical element|electrical components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality. The [[Tuner (electronics)|tuner circuit]], which allows the user of a radio to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit.

In designing an integrated circuit, electronics engineers first construct circuit [[schematic]]s that specify the electrical components and describe the interconnections between them. When completed, [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] engineers convert the schematics into actual layouts, which map the layers of various [[conductor (material)|conductor]] and [[semiconductor]] materials needed to construct the circuit. The conversion from schematics to layouts can be done by [[software]] (see [[electronic design automation]]) but very often requires human fine-tuning to decrease space and power consumption. Once the layout is complete, it can be sent to a [[fabrication plant]] for manufacturing.

For systems of intermediate complexity, engineers may use [[VHDL]] modeling for [[programmable logic device]]s and [[FPGA]]s.

[[Integrated circuit]]s, [[FPGAs]] and other electrical components can then be assembled on [[printed circuit board]]s to form more complicated circuits. Today, printed circuit boards are found in most electronic devices including [[television]]s, [[computer]]s and [[digital audio player|audio player]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Harper ''High Performance Printed Circuit Boards'', pp. xiii-xiv, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-07-026713-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subfields ==

Electronic engineering has many subfields. This section describes some of the most popular subfields in electronic engineering; although there are engineers who focus exclusively on one subfield, there are also many who focus on a combination of subfields.

'''Signal processing''' deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (information theory)|signals]]. Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information.

For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[audio filter|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error checking]] and [[error detection]] of digital signals.

'''Telecommunications engineering''' deals with the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[channel (communications)|channel]] such as a [[coax cable|co-axial cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space]].

Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier wave]] in order to shift the information to a [[carrier frequency]] suitable for transmission, this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]]. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]]. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

'''Electromagnetics''' is an in-depth study about the signals that are transmitted in a channel (Wired or Wireless). This includes Basics of Electromagnetic waves, Transmission Lines and [[Waveguides]], Antennas, its types and applications with [[Radio frequency|Radio-Frequency]] (RF) and Microwaves. Its applications are seen widely in other sub-fields like Telecommunication, Control and Instrumentation Engineering.

'''Control engineering''' has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airplanes]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile|cars]]. It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in a [[automobile|car]] with [[cruise control]], the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|engine's]] power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.

'''Instrumentation engineering''' deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Mass flow rate|flow]] and [[temperature]]. These devices are known as [[instrumentation]].

The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[radar gun]]s use the [[Doppler effect]] to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier–Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.

'''Computer engineering''' deals with the design of [[computer]]s and computer systems. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]] or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]]. Development of [[embedded systems]]—systems made for specific tasks (e.g., mobile phones)—is also included in this field.  This field includes the [[micro controller]] and its applications.
Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.

'''VLSI design engineering''' [[VLSI]] stands for ''very large scale integration''. It deals with fabrication of ICs and various electronic components.

== Education and training ==

Electronics engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electronic engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science]], or [[Bachelor of Technology]] depending upon the university.  Many UK universities also offer [[Master of Engineering]] ([[MEng]]) degrees at the graduate level.

Some electronics engineers also choose to pursue a [[postgraduate]] degree such as a [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Engineering, or an [[Engineering Doctorate]]. The master's degree is being introduced in some European and American Universities as a first degree and the differentiation of an engineer with graduate and postgraduate studies is often difficult. In these cases, experience is taken into account. The master's degree may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia.

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. Certification allows engineers to legally sign off on plans for projects affecting public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tryengineering.org/ask-expert/are-there-any-professional-examinations-available-electronics-and-telecommunications |title=Are there any professional examinations available in the electronics and telecommunications engineering field? Where do I get the listings of these examinations, and how do I apply for them? Who is eligible to write such examinations? |access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements, including work experience requirements, before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada, and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]] (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the European Union).

A degree in electronics generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[project management]] and specific topics in [[electrical engineering]]. Initially, such topics cover most, if not all, of the subfields of electronic engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subfields towards the end of the degree.

Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] and [[simulation software]] programs when designing electronic systems. Although most electronic engineers will understand basic circuit theory, the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanic]]s and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with [[embedded systems]].

Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to ''electronics'' engineering course. ''Electrical'' engineering courses have other specialisms such as [[machines]], [[power generation]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]]. This list does not include the extensive [[engineering mathematics]] curriculum that is a prerequisite to a degree.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh K.

== Professional bodies ==

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) (now renamed the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] or IET). Members of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (MIET) are recognized professionally in Europe, as Electrical and computer (technology) engineers. The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature in electrical/electronic engineering, has over 430,000 members, and holds more than 450 IEEE sponsored or cosponsored conferences worldwide each year. [[SMIEEE]] is a recognised [[professional designation]] in the United States.

== Project engineering ==
For most engineers not involved at the cutting edge of system design and development, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time is also spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason, project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.

The workplaces of electronics engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electronics engineers may be found in the pristine laboratory environment of a fabrication plant, the offices of a consulting firm or in a research laboratory. During their working life, electronics engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers and other engineers.

Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electronics engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. And these are mostly used in the field of consumer electronics products.&lt;ref&gt;Homer L. Davidson, ''Troubleshooting and Repairing Consumer Electronics'', p. 1, McGraw–Hill Professional, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-07-142181-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnoscape'' is one of five elementary frameworks ('''''ethnoscapes''''', ''[[mediascape]]s'', ''[[technoscape]]s'', ''[[financescape]]s'', and ''[[ideoscape]]s'') used by [[Arjun Appadurai]], in purpose of exploring fundamental discrepancies of global cultural flows. The suffix ''-scape'' indicates that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, [[Linguistics|linguistic]], and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: nation-states, multinationals, diasporic communities, and subnational groupings and movements, whether religious, political, or economic, etc..

By using the ethnoscape, Appadurai extends the landscape of persons who form the shifting world where we live, that is, tourists, [[Immigration|immigrants]], refugees, or any moving groups and individuals of fundamental feature of the world and appear to affect the politics of (and between) nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank J. and Boli|first1=Frank J. and John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|page=98|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|journal=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appadurai claims that this is not to say there are no relatively stable communities and networks of kinship, friendship, work, and leisure, as well as of birth, residence, and other filial forms. But it is to say that the warp of these stabilities is everywhere shot through with the weft of human motion, as more persons and groups deal with the realities of having to move of the fantasies of wanting to move. Ethnoscapes allow us to recognize that our notions of space, place and community have become much more complex, indeed a ‘single community’ may now be dispersed across a variety of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smart|first1=B.|title=Postmodernity|date=1993|publisher=London: Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7999">In [[molecular biology]], '''[[exon]] skipping''' is a form of [[RNA splicing]] used to cause cells to “skip” over faulty or misaligned sections of genetic code, leading to a truncated but still functional protein despite the genetic mutation.

==Exon-skipping mechanism==
{{See also|RNA splicing}}
Exon skipping is used to restore the [[reading frame]] within a gene. [[Gene]]s are the genetic instructions for creating a protein, and are composed of [[intron]]s and [[exon]]s. Exons are the sections of DNA that contain the instruction set for generating a protein; they are interspersed with non-coding regions called introns. The introns are later removed before the protein is made, leaving only the coding exon regions.

Splicing naturally occurs in [[pre-mRNA]] when introns are being removed to form mature-mRNA that consists solely of exons. Starting in the late 1990s, scientists realized they could take advantage of this naturally occurring cellular splicing to downplay genetic [[mutations]] into less harmful ones.&lt;ref name = "wahl"&gt;Wahl, Margaret. [http://quest.mda.org/article/exon-skipping-dmd-what-it-and-whom-can-it-help Exon Skipping in DMD: What Is It and Whom Can It Help?] Quest Magazine Online. N.p., 01 Oct. 2011.

The mechanism behind exon skipping is a mutation specific [[antisense oligonucleotide]] (AON). An antisense oligonucleotide is a synthesized short nucleic acid polymer, typically fifty or fewer base pairs in length that will bind to the mutation site in the pre-messenger RNA, to induce exon skipping.&lt;ref name = "hard"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AON binds to the mutated exon, so that when the gene is then translated from the mature mRNA, it is “skipped” over, thus restoring the disrupted reading frame.&lt;ref name = "hard"/&gt; This allows for the generation of an internally deleted, but largely functional protein.

Some mutations require exon skipping at multiple sites, sometimes adjacent to one another, in order to restore the reading frame. Multiple exon skipping has successfully been carried out using a combination of AONs that target multiple exons.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Exon skipping as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)==

Exon skipping is being heavily researched for the treatment of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD), where the muscular protein [[dystrophin]] is prematurely truncated, which leads to a non-functioning protein. Successful treatment by way of exon skipping could lead to a mostly functional dystrophin protein, and create a phenotype similar to the less severe [[Becker muscular dystrophy]] (BMD).&lt;ref name = "wahl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.muscular-dystrophy.org/about_muscular_dystrophy/research_faqs/612_what_is_exon_skipping_and_how_does_it_work What Is Exon Skipping and How Does It Work?] Muscular Dystrophy Campaign. N.p., 11 July 2009. Web. 05 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the protein that becomes compromised is dystrophin.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;  The dystrophin protein has two essential functional domains that flank a central rod domain consisting of repetitive and partially dispensable segments.&lt;ref name = "aartsma"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1986821|year=2007|author1=Aartsma-Rus|first1=A|title=Antisense-mediated exon skipping: A versatile tool with therapeutic and research applications|journal=RNA|volume=13|issue=10|pages=1609–1624|last2=Van Ommen|first2=G. J.|doi=10.1261/rna.653607|pmid=17684229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dystrophin’s function is to maintain muscle fiber stability during contraction by linking the extra cellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Mutations that disrupt the [[open reading frame]] within dystrophin create prematurely truncated proteins that are unable to perform their job. Such mutations lead to muscle fiber damage, replacement of muscle tissue by fat and fibrotic tissue, and premature death typically occurring in the early twenties of DMD patients.&lt;ref name = "aartsma"/&gt; Comparatively, mutations that do not upset the open reading frame, lead to a dystrophin protein that is internally deleted and shorter than normal, but still partially functional. Such mutations are associated with the much milder Becker muscular dystrophy. Mildly affected BMD patients carrying deletions that involve over two thirds of the central rod domain have been described, suggesting that this domain is largely dispensable.

Dystrophin can maintain a large degree of functionality so long as the essential terminal domains are unaffected, and exon skipping only occurs within the central rod domain. Given these parameters, exon skipping can be used to restore an open reading frame by inducing a deletion of one or several exons within the central rod domain, and thus converting a DMD phenotype into a BMD phenotype.	

The genetic mutation that leads to Becker muscular dystrophy is an [[in-frame deletion]]. This means that, out of the 79 exons that code for dystrophin, one or several in the middle may be removed, without affecting the exons that follow the deletion. This allows for a shorter-than-normal dystrophin protein that maintains a degree of functionality. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the genetic mutation is out-of-frame. Out-of-frame mutations cause a premature stop in protein generation - the ribosome is unable to “read” the RNA past the point of initial error - leading to a severely shortened and completely non-functional dystrophin protein.&lt;ref name = "aartsma" /&gt;

The goal of exon skipping is to manipulate the splicing pattern so that an out-of-frame mutation becomes an in-frame mutation, thus changing a severe DMD mutation into a less harmful in-frame BMD mutation.

Genetic testing, usually from blood samples, can be used to determine the precise nature and location of the DMD mutation in the dystrophin gene. It is known that these mutations cluster in areas known as the 'hot spot' regions — primarily in exons 45–53 and to a lesser extent exons 2–20.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"/&gt; As the majority of DMD mutations occur in these 'hot spot' regions, a treatment which causes these exons to be skipped could be used to treat up to 50% of DMD patients.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14526374|year=2003|author1=Van Deutekom|first1=J. C.|title=Advances in Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=4|issue=10|pages=774–83|last2=Van Ommen|first2=G. J.|doi=10.1038/nrg1180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">A '''Fachwirt''' is a higher professional certification in [[Germany]] allocated to level 6 of the [[European Qualifications Framework]], where it was translated to Business Management Specialist. 

To facilitate appreciation of the Fachwirt internationally, the [[Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce]] (''Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag'', DIHK) proposed ''Bachelor Professional'' as the English translation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-main.ihk.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/berufsbildung/weiterbildung/Abschlusserlaeuterung_Bachelor_professional_englisch.pdf ''Bachelor professional CCI'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dihk.de/ressourcen/downloads/dihk_hrk_durchlaessigkeit.pdf |title=''Für mehr Durchlässigkeit zwischen beruflicher Bildung und Hochschulbildung!'' |access-date=2013-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602033525/http://www.dihk.de/ressourcen/downloads/dihk_hrk_durchlaessigkeit.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the danger of confusion with academic degrees, this motion was rejected by the German state ministers of education. Yet, this has not stopped the IHK institutions from issuing certificates in English that show the title "Bachelor Professional" in big letters, with only a small note at the bottom of the page that it is not an university degree. However, owners of the certificate must be very careful not to come into conflict with § 132a Abs. 2 of the German criminal code by using the title in relation to someone located in Germany. Applying for a position solely outside of Germany with the certificate is arguably not affected, however (and is the original purpose of the translation). A legally grey area may be the use of the title on career networks on the Internet (which is actually quite common), where both German and foreign companies are targeted at the same time.

== Characteristics ==

The Fachwirt provides a form of [[continuing professional development]], which is usually pursued following an [[apprenticeship]] and at least one year of professional experience in a recognized occupation. The final examinations, regulated by the German Vocational Training Act, are carried out by specialized committees of the German [[Chamber of Commerce|Chambers of Commerce and Industry]] (DIHK). Learning objectives, defined by DIHK created frameworks, require knowledge in business administration as well as practical and theoretical skills in a particular industrial sector (e.g. ''Handelsfachwirt'' for Trade and Commerce, ''Verkehrsfachwirt'' for Transport Management, ''Fachwirt im Sozial- und Gesundheitswesen'' for Social and Health Services). 

Although not a prerequisite for admission to the final exams, training courses are offered by several, primarily private educational institutions. Depending on the specialization, the curricula suggest coursework of 400 to 800 hours, which is taught in 6 to 24 month of full-time or part-time study, respectively, comparable to almost a full term at university which carries 30 [[European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System | ECTS]] representative of 900 hours of course work.

The '''Federal Desktop Core Configuration''' is a list of [[Computer security|security]] settings recommended by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] for general-purpose [[microcomputers]] that are connected directly to the network of a [[List of United States federal agencies|United States government agency]].

The FDCC is a list of agreed upon Microsoft Windows operating system common core system functions, applications, files, and services that are changed in their configuration around which a framework for a more secure, and security-reliable MS Windows operating system was created. The standards were then made mandatory for every federal government computer effective Feb 1, 2008. If you wanted to connect to a federal office computer network your system had to meet or exceed the FDCC standard or you were denied access.

FDCC applied only to [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista|Vista]] desktop and laptop computers and was replaced by the [[United States Government Configuration Baseline]] (USGCB), which included settings for Windows 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

For Windows 7, the NIST changed the naming convention to the US Government Computer Baseline (USGCB ver 2.0). In addition to un-classifying a general Windows settings guide, the NIST also publishes guides specifically for Windows Firewall, Internet Explorer, and a guide (Vista-Energy, for example) created to capture settings that adhere to energy conservation policies.

==History==
On 20 March 2007 the [[Office of Management and Budget]] issued a memorandum instructing United States government agencies to develop plans for using the Microsoft Windows XP and Vista security configurations.&lt;ref name="faq13"&gt;{{Cite web

The FDCC baseline was developed (and is maintained) by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in collaboration with [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]], [[United States Department of the Interior|DOI]], [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]], [[National Security Agency|NSA]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref name="EvansMemo" /&gt; with input from [[Notice of proposed rulemaking|public comment]].&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; It applies to Windows XP Professional and Vista  systems only&amp;mdash;these security policies are not tested (and according to the NIST, will not work) on Windows 9''x''/ME/NT/2000 or Windows Server 2003.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt;

Major Version 1.1 (released 31 October 2008) had no new or changed settings, but expanded SCAP reporting options.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; As with all previous versions, the standard is applicable to general-purpose workstations and laptops for [[End-user (computer science)|end user]]s. Windows XP and Vista systems in use as servers are exempt from this standard. Also exempt are [[Embedded system|embedded computer]]s and "special purpose" systems (defined as specialized [[Computational science|scientific]], [[Health informatics|medical]], [[Programmable logic controller|process control]], and experimental systems), though {{abbr|NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology}} still recommends that FDCC security configuration be considered "where feasible and appropriate".&lt;ref name="faq1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/fdcc_faqs_20080128.cfm#q1|title=F D C C Additional NIST Frequently Asked Questions &amp;ndash; Is FDCC applicable to special purpose (e.g., scientific, medical, process control, and experimental systems) computers?|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|work=National Vulnerability Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDCC settings, generally speaking, block open connections in operating systems, disables functions, disables rarely used applications in the SOHO environment, disables unnecessary services, changes permissions on items, changes the way log files are collected and recorded, affects Group Policy Object (GPO) settings, and alters entries in the Windows system registry.

InfoWeek introduced the FDCC to mostly administrators and engineers with the article titled ‘The Feds Don’t Allow It. Should You?’ written by Kelly Jackson Higgins of DarkReading.com and published on February 4, 2008.

Due to the complexity of the guidelines response initially was slow. Implementation took time while the settings were internally researched by both government and enterprise implementation techs. The NIST and the NSA published guidelines in hundreds-of-page texts and introduced what they called SCAP files for applications. (See Wikipedia SCAP page)

The Windows platform was built for easy interoperability and networking and therefore left opportunities within the operating systems for all types of auto- and semi-automatic connections to other computers.  These weren’t flaws or programming mistakes, it was purposefully built that way. An example of this can be found by looking at the Windows Remote Connection program which is ''enabled by default'' after a typical Windows operating system installation.  The FDCC/USGCB configuration, for instance, reverses that setting so that you have to manually re-enable to allow remote connections.

==Requirements==
Organizations required to document FDCC [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] can do so by using [[Security Content Automation Protocol|SCAP]] tools.

There are 600+ settings in the average FDCC/USGCB document – but not all of them are usable for the average small or home office (SOHO) computer. For instance, released on 20 June 2008, FDCC Major Version 1.0 specifies 674 settings.&lt;ref name="download"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=F D C C download page
 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/download_fdcc.cfm
 |work=National Vulnerability Database
 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "all wireless interfaces should be disabled".&lt;ref name="faq10"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=F D C C Additional NIST Frequently Asked Questions &amp;ndash; Are there any conditions under which wireless is allowed?
 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/fdcc_faqs_20080128.cfm#q10
 |work=National Vulnerability Database
 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition that not all recommended settings will be practical for every system, exceptions (such as "authorized enterprise wireless networks") can be made if documented in an FDCC deviation report.&lt;ref name="EvansMemo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="faq10" /&gt;

Strict implementation of all of the recommended settings has been known to cause usability issues. The NIST publishes a list of known issues and it can be found here (&lt;nowiki&gt;https://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/microsoft_content.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  There are a few third-party software vendors that have emerged that claim to have tested settings in a SOHO environment however, at this time, the general public still remains relatively unaware of the FDCC and USGCB security settings developed and put forward by the NIST.

[[File:Hrushikesh kulkarni vegetables.JPG|thumb|Vegetables, the second largest food group in many nutrition guides, come in a wide variety of shapes, colors and sizes.]]
A '''food group''' is a collection of [[food]]s that share similar [[nutrition]]al properties or [[biological classification]]s. [[List of nutrition guides|Nutrition guides]] typically divide foods into food groups and [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|recommend]] daily [[serving size|servings]] of each group for a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. In the United States for instance, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|year=2013|origyear=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The most common food groups==
* '''[[Dairy product|Dairy]]''', also called '''milk products''' and sometimes categorized with [[:Category:Milk substitutes|milk alternatives]] or meat, is typically a smaller category in [[nutrition guides]],&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating - Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |accessdate=3 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA's MyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt; Examples of dairy products include milk, butter, ghee, [[yogurt]], [[cheese]], cream and ice cream. The categorization of dairy as a food group with recommended daily servings has been criticized by, for example, the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] who point out that "research has shown little benefit, and considerable potential for harm, of such high dairy intakes. Moderate consumption of milk or other dairy products—one to two servings a day—is fine, and likely has some benefits for children. But it’s not essential for adults, for a host of reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate-questions/|title=Healthy Eating Plate &amp; Healthy Eating Pyramid|date=18 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fruits]]''', sometimes categorized with vegetables, include [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[berry|berries]] and [[lemon]]s. Fruits contain carbohydrates, mostly in the form of sugar as well as important vitamins and minerals.
* '''[[Cereal|Grains, beans and legumes]]''', sometimes categorized as '''cereals''', is often the largest category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], [[bread]] and [[pasta]]. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are a good source of [[starch]] and are often categorized with other starchy food such as potatoes. 
* '''[[Meat]]''', sometimes labelled '''[[protein]]''' and occasionally inclusive of [[legume]]s and beans, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat analogue]]s and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[turkey (food)|turkey]], [[pork]] and [[beef]].
* '''[[confectionery|Confections]]''', also called '''[[confectionery|sugary foods]]''' and sometimes categorized with [[fat]]s and [[oils]], is typically a very small category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt; Examples include [[candy]], [[soft drinks]], and chocolate. 
* '''[[Vegetable]]s''', sometimes categorized with fruit and occasionally inclusive of [[legumes]], is typically a large category second only to [[Food grain|grain]]s, or sometimes equal or superior to grains, in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[spinach]], [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[broccoli]].
* '''[[Drinking water|Water]]''' is treated in very different ways by different food guides. Some exclude the category,&lt;ref name=US/&gt; others list it separately from other food groups,&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; and yet others make it the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foundation&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid™ 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the guide.

==Uncommon food groups==
The number of "common" food groups varies depending on who is defining them. [[Canada's Food Guide]], which has been in continual publication since 1942 and is the second most requested government document (after the income tax form) in [[Canada]], recognizes only four official food groups, listing the remainder of foods as "another". Some of these "others" include:

'''Forensic anthropology''' is the application of the anatomical science of [[anthropology]] and its various subfields, including forensic [[archaeology]] and forensic [[taphonomy]],&lt;ref name="Nawrocki subfield" /&gt; in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable, as might happen in a plane crash. Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental to the investigation and documentation of [[genocide]] and [[mass grave]]s. Along with [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologists]], [[forensic dentistry|forensic dentists]], and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as [[expert witness]]es.  Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim's age, [[Sex differences in humans|sex]], [[Human height|stature]], and [[Ancestor|ancestry]]. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine [[cause of death]], [[Major trauma|past trauma]] such as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]].

The methods used to identify a person from a skeleton relies on the past contributions of various anthropologists and the study of human skeletal [[Polymorphism (biology)|differences]].  Through the collection of thousands of specimens and the analysis of differences within a population, estimations can be made based on physical characteristics.  Through these, a set of remains can potentially be identified.  The field of forensic anthropology grew during the twentieth century into a fully recognized forensic specialty involving trained anthropologists as well as numerous research institutions gathering data on decomposition and the effects it can have on the skeleton.

==Modern uses==
[[Image:Srebrenica Massacre - Exhumed Grave of Victims - Potocari 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Exhumed bodies of victims of the 1995 Srebrenica Genocide in a mass grave found in 2007.]]
Today, forensic anthropology is a well established discipline within the forensic field. Anthropologists are called upon to investigate remains and to help identify individuals from bones when other physical characteristics which could be used to identify a body no longer exist. Forensic anthropologists work in conjunction with forensic pathologists to identify remains based on their skeletal characteristics.  If the victim is not found for a lengthy period of time or has been eaten by [[scavenger]]s, flesh markers used for identification would be destroyed, making normal identification difficult if not impossible.  Forensic anthropologists can provide physical characteristics of the person to input into missing person databases such as that of the [[National Crime Information Center]] in the US&lt;ref name="NCIC" /&gt; or [[INTERPOL]]'s [[Interpol notice|yellow notice]] database.&lt;ref name="Interpol" /&gt;

In addition to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist in the investigation of war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks&lt;ref name="McShane" /&gt; as well as plane crashes such as the [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] disaster&lt;ref name="Hinkes" /&gt; and the [[USAir Flight 427]] disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible.&lt;ref name="College" /&gt; Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the [[Rwandan Genocide]]&lt;ref name="Nuwer" /&gt; and the [[Srebrenica Genocide]].&lt;ref name="Elson" /&gt; Organizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic Anthropology, and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline.

==History==
===Early history===
[[Image:EAHooton.png|thumb|right|Earnest Hooton, one of the pioneers in the field of physical anthropology.]]
The use of [[anthropology]] in the forensic investigation of remains grew out of the recognition of anthropology as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of [[physical anthropology]]. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science during the early years of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt; [[Earnest Hooton]] pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States.&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt; He was an organizing committee member of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]] along with its founder [[Aleš Hrdlička]]. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Spencer" /&gt; In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of [[Anthropological criminology|criminal anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Snow" /&gt; Now considered a [[pseudoscience]], criminal anthropologists believed that [[phrenology]] and [[physiognomy]] could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the [[eugenics]] movement, popular at the time.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt; It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of [[anthropometry]] and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by [[Alphonse Bertillon]]. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.

Another prominent early anthropologist, [[Thomas Wingate Todd]], was primarily responsible for the creation of the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600 [[Simian|anthropoid]] skulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt; Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding [[Suture (joint)|suture]] closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the [[Human mandible|mandible]]. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the [[pubic symphysis]]. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of [[Skeletonization|skeletonized]] remains.&lt;ref name="Buikstra" /&gt; These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, but it was not until the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, [[Wilton M. Krogman]], that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.

===The growth of forensic anthropology===
During the 1940s, Krogman was the first anthropologist to actively publicize anthropologists' potential forensic value, going as far as placing advertisements in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin informing agencies of the ability of anthropologists to assist in the identification of skeletal remains. This period saw the first official use of anthropologists by federal agencies including the FBI.  During the 1950s, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps employed forensic anthropologists in the identification of war casualties during the Korean War.&lt;ref name="Snow" /&gt; It was at this time that forensic anthropology officially began. The sudden influx of available skeletons for anthropologists to study, whose identities were eventually confirmed, allowed for the creation of more accurate formulas for the identification of sex, age,&lt;ref name="McKern" /&gt; and stature&lt;ref name="Trotter" /&gt; based solely on skeletal characteristics. These formulas, developed in the 1940s and refined by war, are still in use by modern forensic anthropologists.

The [[professionalization]] of the field began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the replacement of [[coroner]]s with [[medical examiner]]s in many locations around the country.&lt;ref name="Snow" /&gt; It was during this time that the field of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] and the first forensic anthropology research facility and [[body farm]] was opened by [[William M. Bass]].&lt;ref name="Buikstra2" /&gt; Public attention and interest in forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by [[Ed Gein]].&lt;ref name="Golda" /&gt;

==Methods==
One of the main tools forensic anthropologists use in the identification of remains is their knowledge of [[osteology]] and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton. During the course of an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.

===Determination of sex===
Depending on which bones are present, sex can be determined by looking for distinctive [[Sex differences in human physiology#Skeleton and muscular system|sexual dimorphisms]]. When available, the [[pelvis]] is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Ident of Skel Remains" /&gt; The examination of the [[pubic arch]] and the location of the [[sacrum]] can help determine sex.
{{multiple image

| height1 = 210
| image2 = Gray241.png
| caption2 = Male pelvis. Note narrow pubic arch and longer sacrum.
| width2 = 250
| height2 = 210
}}
However, the pelvis is not always present, so forensic anthropologists must be aware of other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers that can be used to determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the [[temporal line]], the [[orbit (anatomy)|eye sockets]], the [[supraorbital ridge]],&lt;ref name="FoSci Outreach" /&gt; as well as the [[nuchal lines]], and the [[mastoid process]].&lt;ref name="Hawks" /&gt; In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.&lt;ref name="juniordentist" /&gt;

It is important for forensic anthropologists to take into account all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It is for this reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female.&lt;ref name="fonsfaw" /&gt; In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

===Determination of stature===
The [[estimation of stature]] by anthropologists is based on a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds. Stature is given as a range of possible values, in centimeters, and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg. The three bones that are used are the [[femur]], the [[tibia]], and the [[fibula]].&lt;ref name="sfu" /&gt; In addition to the leg bones, the bones of the arm, the [[humerus]], [[ulna]], and [[radius (bone)|radius]] can be used.&lt;ref name="mall" /&gt; The formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual. Sex, ancestry, and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height, if possible. This is due to the differences that occur between populations, sexes, and age groups.&lt;ref name="hawks2" /&gt; By knowing all the variables associated with height, a more accurate estimate can be made. For example, a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is {{math| 2.32 × femur length + 65.53 ± 3.94&amp;nbsp;cm}}. A female of the same ancestry would use the formula, {{math| 2.47 × femur length + 54.10 ± 3.72&amp;nbsp;cm}}.&lt;ref name="redwoods" /&gt; It is also important to note an individual's approximate age when determining stature. This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages. After age 30, a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade.&lt;ref name="sfu" /&gt;

===Determination of age===
The determination of an individual's age by anthropologists depends on whether or not the individual was an adult or a child. The determination of the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth.&lt;ref name="teeth age" /&gt; When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which [[Epiphyseal plate|growth plates]] are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The [[clavicle]] is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25.&lt;ref name="young or old" /&gt; In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much [[List of bones of the human skeleton|higher number]].

The aging of adult skeletons is not as straightforward as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached.&lt;ref name="adult age" /&gt; One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton is to look at [[osteon|bone osteons]] under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments.&lt;ref name="young or old" /&gt; Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones.&lt;ref name="skel as evid" /&gt; The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.

===Determination of ancestry===
The determination of an individual's ancestry is typically grouped into three historical groups, Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. However, the use of these classifications is becoming much harder as the rate of interancestrial marriages increases and markers become less defined.&lt;ref name="nlm" /&gt;  By measuring distances between landmarks on the skull as well as the size and shape of specific bones anthropologists can use a series of equations to estimate ancestry. Typically, the [[maxilla]] is used to help anthropologists determine an individual's ancestry due to the three basic shapes, hyperbolic, parabolic, and rounded, belonging to the three historical ancestries, Negroid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid respectively.&lt;ref name="westport" /&gt; In addition to the maxilla, the [[zygomatic arch]] and the nasal opening have been used to narrow down possible ancestry.&lt;ref name="activity ancestry" /&gt; A program called [[FORDISC]] has been created that will calculate the most likely ancestry using complex mathematical formulas.&lt;ref name="observation" /&gt; This program is continually updated with new information from known individuals to maintain a database of current populations and their respective measurements.

===Other markers===
Anthropologists are also able to see other markers present on the bones. Past fractures will be evident by the presence of [[bone remodeling]]. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle.&lt;ref name="Smith Ashley" /&gt; Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in [[bone marrow]] samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.

==Subfields==
===Forensic archaeology===
Forensic archaeologists employ their knowledge of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner.&lt;ref name="Chicora" /&gt; When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact.  The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Contribution of Forensic Archaeology to Homicide Investigations|last = Schultz, Dupras|first = |date = 2008|journal = Homicide Studies|doi = 10.1177/1088767908324430|pmid = |volume=12 |pages=399–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained in and around the excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints.&lt;ref name="Nawrocki arch" /&gt;  Their training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Forensic Research: Expanding the Concept of Applied Archaeology|last = Sigler-Eisenberg|first = |date = 1985|journal = American Antiquity|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Forensic archaeologists are involved within three main areas. Assisting with crime scene research, investigation, and recovery of evidence and/or skeletal remains is only one aspect.

Processing scenes of mass fatality or incidents of terrorism (i.e. homicide, mass graves and war crimes, and other violations of human rights) is a branch of work that forensic archaeologists are involved with as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Forensic archaeologists can help determine potential [[grave|grave sites]] that might have been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it.&lt;ref name="sfu arch" /&gt; The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.

One other implement to the career of a forensic archaeologist is teaching and research. Educating law enforcement, crime scene technicians and investigators, as well as undergraduate and graduate students is a critical part of a forensic archaeologist’s career in order to spread knowledge of proper excavation techniques to other forensic personnel and to increase awareness of the field in general. Crime scene evidence in the past has been compromised due to improper excavation and recovery by untrained personnel. Forensic anthropologists are then unable to provide meaningful analyses on retrieved skeletal remains due to damage or contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Archaeology and Forensic Death Investigations|last = Haglund|first = William|date = 2001|journal = Historical Archaeology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted to improve archaeological field methods, particularly to advance nondestructive methods of search and recovery are also important for the advancement  and recognition of the field.

There is an ethical component that must be considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted to assist with the processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archaeology and the Forensic Investigation of Recent Mass Graves: Ethical Issues for a New Practice of Archaeology|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11759-008-9080-x|journal = Archaeologies|date = 2008-08-20|issn = 1555-8622|pages = 414–428|volume = 4|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s11759-008-9080-x|first = Caroline|last = Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic taphonomy===
[[Image:Human remains.jpg|thumb|right|The examination of remains can help build a peri and post-mortem profile of the individual.]]The examination of skeletal remains often takes into account environmental factors that affect decomposition. [[taphonomy|Forensic taphonomy]] is the study of these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals.&lt;ref name="tap manual" /&gt; In order to study these effects, [[body farm]]s have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated [[cadaver]]s. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

Forensic taphonomy is divided into two separate sections, biotaphonomy and geotaphonomy. Biotaphonomy is the study of how the environment affects the decomposition of the body.  Specifically it is the examination of biological remains in order to ascertain how decomposition or destruction occurred.&lt;ref name="CSI" /&gt;  This can include factors such as animal scavenging, climate, as well as the size and age of the individual at the time of death. Biotaphonomy must also take into account common mortuary services such as embalming and their effects on decomposition.&lt;ref name="Nawrocki" /&gt;

Geotaphonomy is the examination of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body.&lt;ref name="CSI" /&gt; By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton was a result of peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.&lt;ref name="Nawrocki" /&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Forensic Anthropology Lab..png|thumb|left|Forensic Anthropology Lab at the National Museum of National History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., USA]]Individuals looking to become forensic anthropologists first obtain a bachelor's degree in anthropology from an accredited university. During their studies they should focus on physical anthropology as well as osteology. In addition it is recommended that individuals take courses in a wide range of sciences such as biology, chemistry, anatomy, and genetics.&lt;ref name="Hall edu" /&gt;

Once undergraduate education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking to pursue a forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a [[gross anatomy]] class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists.&lt;ref name="Nawrocki subfield" /&gt; Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe&lt;ref name="FASE" /&gt; or the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology.&lt;ref name="ABFA exam" /&gt;

Typically, most forensic anthropologists perform forensic casework on a part-time basis, however there are individuals who work in the field full-time usually with federal or international agencies. Forensic anthropologists are usually employed in academia either at a university or a research facility.&lt;ref name="abfa" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Ethics==
Like other forensic fields, forensic anthropologists are held to a high level of ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any [[conflict of interest]]s or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions.&lt;ref name="swganth" /&gt; It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.&lt;ref name="abfa ethics" /&gt;

In addition to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always keep in mind that the remains they are working with were once a person. If possible, local customs regarding dealing with the dead should be observed and all remains should be treated with respect and dignity.

(Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=World Report on Disability.|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.

According to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319908376|title=The geography of disability and economic disadvantage in Australian capital cities|last=Louise.|first=O'Rance,|date=2009|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|others=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.|isbn=9781740249102|location=Canberra|oclc=319908376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For examples, in Memphis, Tennesse, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/21/economic-blight-50-worst-american-cities-live/415609001/|title=These are America's worst cities for crime, employment, housing costs|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2017_AnnualReport_2017_FINAL.pdf|title=2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report|last=Kraus, L., Lauer, E., Coleman, R., and Houtenville, A.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Disability_statistics_-_health|title=Disability statistics - health - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Recent development of Geography of Disability: [https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf] ===
Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.

Imrie, explained the recent development in ''The Geographies of Disability'' as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.

However, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’

The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The socio-economic of disability ==

The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.

=== The models of disability ===
(link to an external article: Social Model of disability [[Social model of disability|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability]] )

The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.

In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.

“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Environmental politics of Disability  ==

=== The environmental politics of Disability ===
A disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to  highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.

=== Accessible Tourism ===
The concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajadacz|first=Alina|date=2015-01-01|title=The Contribution Of The Geography Of Disability To The Development Of ‘Accessible Tourism’|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/tour/25/1/article-p19.xml|journal=Turyzm|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.2478/tour-2014-0016|issn=0867-5856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism UNWTO] has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism|title=Accessible Tourism {{!}} Ethics, Culture and Social Responsibility|website=ethics.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Discrimination Law and Policy ==
In WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:

“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non-disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Australia, The ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA)'' illegitimate any direct or indirect discriminating actions towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/disability-discrimination|title=Disability discrimination|last=connie.kwan|date=2015-02-18|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation''' is a [[Gilding|gilt]]-[[bronze]] statue of [[Maitreya]] seated in meditation and is one of the best known and most highly regarded [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s.&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Judith Smith, ''Arts of Korea''. (1998) p. 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Korea]], it was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cha.go.kr/chaen/search/selectGeneralSearchDetail.do?sCcebKdcd=11&amp;ccebAsno=00780000&amp;sCcebCtcd=11 |title=Heritage Search - National Treasure 78 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is 83.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height.  It was cast from bronze and gilded, probably in the middle or late 6th century.  The bronze is less than one centimeter in thickness (and as thin as 2 mm&lt;ref name="NMK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/site/eng/relic/search/view?relicId=4358 |title=Collection Database - Pensive Bodhisattva |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=National Museum of Korea |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which attests to the skills of bronze-workers during this time period.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

In 1912 a Japanese person acquired it, and donated it to the General Governing Department of Japan over [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]. Since 1916 it has been housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

The maitreya is semi-seated on a stool with its right leg crossed over the left in deep meditation.  The face of the statue, has a hint of a smile, and exhibits a sense of serene concentration.  The right arm of the statue, at the elbow, rests on its lap while its delicate hand reaches towards its cheek giving the impression of deep thought.  One shoulder of the maitreya is slightly higher than the other and the upper body is slightly bent forward which also creates the impresses on the viewer an aura of deep thought.  The statue wears a crown which is rather elaborate with many prongs and parts of the crown rest on the shoulders of the maitreya.  The statue is also dressed in a complicated scarf-like vestment that curves around the body with wing-like projections.  The left foot rests on a base which is shaped like a lotus flower.  The statue is probably of [[Silla]] provenance because of the style is more formalized than realistic.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

At one point, the statue had a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], but only traces of it remain. It was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. An X-ray analysis in 1963 showed that "it has no trace of defect or repair either inside or out, and that it was made of a rare material using unique techniques.".&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

'''Low-definition television''' ('''LDTV''') refers to [[television system]]s that have a lower [[screen resolution]] than [[standard-definition television]] systems. The term is usually used in reference to [[digital television]], in particular when [[broadcasting]] at the same (or similar) resolution as low-definition [[analog TV]] systems. [[Mobile television|Mobile DTV]] systems usually transmit in low definition, as do all [[slow-scan TV]] systems.

==Sources==
The most common source of LDTV programming is the [[Internet]], where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to [[download]]. Many [[mobile phone]]s and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony’s [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320).

For the first years of its existence, [[YouTube]] offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less, only extending - first to widescreen 426×240, then to gradually higher resolutions - once the video service had become well established, it could afford radically improved storage space and transmission bandwidth, and could rely on a good proportion of its users having high-speed internet connections. More recently, YouTube has also extended further into the LDTV realm by adding an even lower 256×144p resolution with a halved framerate - giving an overall effect reminiscent of early online video streaming attempts using [[RealVideo]] or similar, where 160×120p at single-figure &lt;abbr title="frames per second"&gt;fps&lt;/abbr&gt; was deemed acceptable - to cater to those whose network connections could not even widthstand the rigors of "240p".

A [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i), but using VHS for professional production will yield results subjectively comparable to LDTV because of VHS's low [[VHS#Video recording|bandwidth]], particularly in the field of color reproduction, which can be as little as a few hundred kHz, translating to a few dozen color clocks per line. VHS does, however, still provide [[high motion]] and a relatively high vertical resolution via interlacing, which is a feature uncommon in true LDTV material, and reasonable luma resolution.

In comparison, professional-level [[Betacam SP]] tape produces approx 440×486i/576i, and some [[college]] [[TV studio]]s use [[Super VHS]] at ~560×486i/576i, along with an increased colour carrier bandwidth. Both of these systems, whilst showing a marked improvement over VHS, ultimately offer lower resolution images than DVD, but are still comparable to (and thus remain useful for) lower-bandwidth broadcast television, which is compromised in the analogue domain by a narrower available frequency range for each individual channel, and in the digital by a literally lower horizontal pixel count (often 480 or 544, versus the 720 of DVD and full-rate SDTV broadcasts). Again, both systems offer high motion and a high vertical resolution by way of interlacing, and are more justifiably counted as SD rather than LD.

&lt;!-- Before you edit this paragraph, consider reading the linked citations carefully. Otherwise, retro gaming enthusiasts armed with oscilloscopes, old video game consoles, analog CRT televisions, and heavily-marked-up printouts of BT.470-5 may come knocking at your metaphorical door. --&gt;Older [[video game console]]s and home computers often generated a technically-compliant NTSC or PAL signal, but only sent one field type rather than alternating between the two.  This created a 240- or 288-line progressive signal, which in theory can be decoded on any receiver that can decode normal, interlaced signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scanlines.hazard-city.de/ |title=Scanlines Demystified |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://retrogaming.hazard-city.de/ |title=Connecting your old videogames to your new flatpanel TV set |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snesinterlaced" /&gt;  Since the [[shadow mask]] and beam width of standard [[cathode ray tube]] televisions were designed for interlaced signals, these systems produced a distinctive fixed pattern of alternating bright and dark [[scan lines]]; many [[emulators]] for older systems offer to recreate this effect.  The horizontal resolution ranged from 160 pixels to 720 pixels, depending on the video chip's capabilities (and the skill of the programmer).   

The [[Video CD]] format was introduced on such a console ([[CD-i]]), and it likewise originally used a [[progressive scan|progressive]] LDTV signal {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} (352×240 or 352×288), which is half the vertical and horizontal resolution of full-bandwidth [[SDTV]]. However, most DVD and SVCD players, as well as VCD 2.0 players (which can display still images at 704×480/576i and offer limited DVD menu-esque functions), will internally upscale VCD material to 704x480/576i (or 480/576p for progressive-scan players) for playback, as this is both more widely compatible and gives a better overall appearance. No motion information is lost due to this process, as, unlike the single-field output of classic computers and consoles, VCD video is not high-motion and only plays back at 25 or 30 frames per second. A similar recording standard (quarter-resolution and half framerate) is also used for super-long-play home DVD recording, although it does not typically adhere to the same bitrate or encoding specifications, and could therefore be considered LDTV. (Regular "LP" DVD recording is closest in spec to a high grade VHS or Betamax recording, having half the normal horizontal resolution and a lower bitrate, but otherwise being identical to a full-rate "SP" recording, including high-motion interlace, and thus still qualifies as SDTV)

With the late 1980s introduction of 16 and 32-bit computers/game consoles, such as [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Super Nintendo]]&lt;ref name="snesinterlaced" /&gt;, and [[Sega Genesis]], outputs up to 486i/576i were supported for the first time, but rarely used due to heavy demands on processing power and memory.  Standard resolutions also had a tendency to produce annoying flicker at horizontal edges unless employed quite carefully, such as using anti-aliasing, which was either not available or computationally exorbitant.  Thus, 240/288p remained the primary format on most games of the fourth and [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation consoles]] (Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Nintendo 64).  With the advent of [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation consoles]] and the launch of the [[Dreamcast]], 480/576i use became more common, and 240/288p usage declined.

More recent game systems tend to use only properly interlaced NTSC or PAL in addition to higher resolution modes, except when running games designed for older, compatible systems in their native modes. The [[PlayStation 2]] generates 240p/288p if a PlayStation game calls for this mode, as do many [[Virtual Console]] emulated games on [[Wii]]. Nintendo's official [[software development kit]] documentation refers to 240p as 'non-interlaced mode' or 'double-strike'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naesten.dyndns.org:8080/psyq/man/os/osVi.html |title=N64 Functions Reference Manual - Video Interface (VI) Management |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djek.nl/Downloads/GC/DOCS/GRAPPRO/VI.us.pdf |title=GameCube SDK - Video Interface Library (VI) |accessdate=2011-06-27 |page=6 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the launch of the Wii Virtual Console service many users with [[component video]] cables experienced problems displaying some Virtual Console games due to certain TV models/manufacturers not supporting 240p over a component video connection. Nintendo's solution was to implement 'Wii Component Cable Interlace Mode' which forces the emulator to output 480i instead of 240p,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/ts/pictureSound.jsp#neogeo |title=Nintendo Support - Display problems while playing Virtual Console games |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however many games released prior have still not been updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.computerandvideogames.com/viewtopic.php?t=32854 |title=Wii Component cable Interlace Mode |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teleconferencing LDTV==
Upcoming sources of LDTV using standard broadcasting techniques include mobile TV services powered by [[DVB-H]], [[1seg]], [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]], or [[ATSC-M/H]]. However, this kind of LDTV transmission technology is based on existent LDTV [[teleconferencing]] standards that have been in place for a decade or more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

'''Neural oscillations''', or '''brainwaves''', are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural activity in the [[central nervous system]]. [[Neural tissue]] can generate [[oscillation|oscillatory activity]] in many ways, driven either by mechanisms within individual [[neurons]] or by interactions between neurons.  In individual neurons, oscillations can appear either as oscillations in [[membrane potential]] or as rhythmic patterns of [[action potentials]], which then produce oscillatory activation of [[post-synaptic potential|post-synaptic]] neurons.  At the level of [[neural ensemble]]s, synchronized activity of large numbers of neurons can give rise to [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] oscillations, which can be observed in an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]. Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns. The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons. A well-known example of macroscopic neural oscillations is [[alpha wave|alpha activity]].

Neural oscillations were observed by researchers as early as 1924 (by [[Hans Berger]]). More than 50 years later, intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons, but its functional role is still not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Llinas|first1=R. R. |title=Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective |journal=Front Cell Neurosci |volume=8 |page=320 |year=2014 |pmid=25408634 |pmc=4219458 |doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible roles of neural oscillations include [[neural binding|feature binding]], [[neural code|information transfer mechanisms]] and the [[central pattern generator|generation of rhythmic motor output]]. Over the last decades more insight has been gained, especially with advances in [[brain imaging]]. A major area of research in [[neuroscience]] involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are. Oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed at different [[levels of Organization (anatomy)|levels of organization]] and is thought to play a key role in processing neural information. Numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations; a unified interpretation, however, is still lacking.

== Overview ==

Neural oscillations are observed throughout the central nervous system at all levels, and include [[action potential|spike trains]], [[local field potentials]] and large-scale [[oscillation]]s which can be measured by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using [[time-frequency analysis]]. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a [[neural ensemble]], also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory.&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fries P | title = A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence | journal = TICS | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 474–480 | year = 2005 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fell J, Axmacher N | title = The role of phase synchronization in memory processes | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 12 | pages = 105–118 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2979 | pmid = 21248789 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrn1650 | vauthors = Schnitzler A, Gross J | title = Normal and pathological oscillatory communication in the brain | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 285&amp;ndash;296 | year = 2005 | pmid=15803160 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural oscillations have been most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to [[pink noise]], but also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is [[alpha waves|alpha activity]] (7.5–12.5 [[Hertz|Hz]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2654794 | pmid=19300566 | volume=3 | title=Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research | date=June 2007 | vauthors=Gerrard P, Malcolm R | journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | pages=349–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be detected from the [[occipital lobe]] during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger H, Gray CM | title = Uber das Elektroenkephalogramm des Menschen | journal = Arch Psychiat Nervenkr | volume = 87 | pages = 527–570 | year = 1929 | doi = 10.1007/BF01797193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other frequency bands are: [[delta wave|delta]] (1&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[theta wave|theta]] (4&amp;ndash;8&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[beta wave|beta]] (13&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[gamma wave|low gamma]] (30&amp;ndash;70&amp;nbsp;Hz), and [[gamma wave|high gamma]] (70&amp;ndash;150&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequency bands, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity have been linked to cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dement W, Kleitman N |title=Cyclic variations in EEG during sleep and their relation to eye movements, body motility and dreaming |journal=Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol |year=1957 |volume=9 |pages=673–90 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(57)90088-3 |pmid=13480240 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as [[awareness]] and [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engel AK, Singer W |title=Temporal binding and the neural correlates of sensory awareness |year=2001 |volume=5 |pages=16–25 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01568-0 |issue=1 |pmid=11164732 |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Varela F, Lachaux JP, Rodriguez E, Martinerie J | title = The brainweb: phase synchronization and large-scale integration | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 2 | pages = 229–239 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/35067550 | pmid = 11283746 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neural oscillations in human brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, they are also observed using more invasive recording techniques such as [[single-unit recording]]s. Neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of [[action potential]]s or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called ''resonators''.&lt;ref name = "Izhikevich 2007"&gt;{{cite book | author = Izhikevich EM | title = Dynamical systems in neuroscience | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |  year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bursting]] is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for [[neural coding|information coding]] in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed in the form of [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]] (i.e. in the absence of action potentials).&lt;ref name = "Llinas 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Llinas R, Yarom Y | year = 1986 | title = Oscillatory properties of guinea-pig inferior olivary neurones and their pharmacological modulation: an in vitro study | journal = J Physiol | volume=376 | pages=163&amp;ndash;182 | pmid=3795074 | pmc=1182792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If numerous neurons spike in [[synchronization|synchrony]], they can give rise to oscillations in [[local field potentials]]. Quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Mureșan RC, Jurjuț OF, Moca VV, Singer W, Nikolić D | title = The Oscillation Score: An Efficient Method for Estimating Oscillation Strength in Neuronal Activity | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | year = 2008  | volume = 99 |issue=3 | pages = 1333–1353 | doi =10.1152/jn.00772.2007 | pmid =18160427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural oscillations are commonly studied from a mathematical framework and belong to the field of "neurodynamics", an area of research in the [[cognitive science]]s that places a strong focus upon the dynamic character of neural activity in describing [[brain]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/286819 | author = Burrow T | title = The neurodynamics of behavior. A phylobiological foreword | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 10 | pages = 271–288 | year = 1943 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers the brain a [[dynamical system]] and uses [[differential equations]] to describe how neural activity evolves over time. In particular, it aims to relate dynamic patterns of brain activity to cognitive functions such as perception and memory. In very [[abstract structure|abstract form]], neural oscillations can be analyzed [[Analytical expression|analytically]]. When studied in a more physiologically realistic setting, oscillatory activity is generally studied using [[computer simulation]]s of a [[computational neuroscience|computational model]].

The functions of neural oscillations are wide-ranging and vary for different types of oscillatory activity. Examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and the [[neural binding]] of sensory features in perception, such as the shape and color of an object. Neural oscillations also play an important role in many [[neurological disorder]]s, such as excessive synchronization during [[seizure]] activity in [[epilepsy]] or [[tremor]] in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices in [[brain–computer interface]]s, in which subjects can control an external device by changing the amplitude of particular brain rhythmics &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608085&lt;/ref&gt;.{{additional citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Physiology==
{{main|Electrophysiology}}

Oscillatory activity is observed throughout the [[central nervous system]] at all levels of organization. Three different levels have been widely recognized: the micro-scale (activity of a single neuron), the meso-scale (activity of a local group of neurons) and the macro-scale (activity of different brain regions).&lt;ref name = "Haken 1996"&gt;{{cite book | author=Haken H | title= Principles of brain functioning | year=1996 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-58967-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Current Clamp recording of Neuron.GIF|thumb|right|[[Tonic (physiology)|Tonic]] firing pattern of single neuron showing rhythmic spiking activity]]

=== Microscopic ===

Neurons generate [[action potentials]] resulting from changes in the electric membrane potential. Neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so-called spike trains. These spike trains are the basis for [[neural coding]] and information transfer in the brain. Spike trains can form all kinds of patterns, such as rhythmic spiking and [[bursting]], and often display oscillatory activity.&lt;ref name = "Wang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wang XJ | title= Neurophysiological and computational principles of cortical rhythms in cognition | year=2010 | journal=Physiol Rev | volume=90 | pages = 1195–1268 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00035.2008 | issue=3 | pmid=20664082 | pmc=2923921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations|sub-threshold fluctuations]] in membrane potential. These rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential. They can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons.

Neuronal spiking can be classified by their activity patterns. The excitability of neurons can be subdivided in Class I and II. Class I neurons can generate action potentials with arbitrarily low frequency depending on the input strength, whereas Class II neurons generate action potentials in a certain frequency band, which is relatively insensitive to changes in input strength.&lt;ref name = "Izhikevich 2007"/&gt; Class II neurons are also more prone to display sub-threshold oscillations in membrane potential.

=== Mesoscopic ===

A group of neurons can also generate oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up ([[Interference (wave propagation)|constructive interference]]). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which gives rise to large-amplitude oscillations of the [[local field potential]]. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far too small to be picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Nunez PL, Srinivasan R | title = Electric fields of the brain: The neurophysics of EEG |publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1981 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gu5qAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons in a [[neural ensemble]] rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of [[macroscopic scale|large-scale]] oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page).&lt;ref name='Wang 2010'/&gt; Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity [[endogenous]]ly through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory [[interneurons]] play an important role in producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Cardin JA, Carlen M, Meletis K, Knoblich, U, Zhang F, Deisseroth K, Tsai LH, Moore CI | title =Driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm and controls sensory responses | journal = Nature | year = 2009 | volume= 459 | issue= 7247 | pages= 663–U63 |  doi=10.1038/nature08002 | pmid=19396156| pmc = 3655711| bibcode=2009Natur.459..663C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroscopic ===

Neural oscillation can also arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural [[connectome]]. [[Propagation delay|Time delays]] play an important role here. Because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled, these connections between brain areas form [[feedback]] loops. [[Positive feedback]] loops tends to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is inversely related to the delay time. An example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the [[thalamus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] – the [[thalamocortical radiation]]s. This thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as [[recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinás R, Ribary U, Contreras D, Pedroarena C | title = The neuronal basis for consciousness | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

==Mechanisms==

=== Neuronal properties ===
{{see also|Action potential|Bursting}}

Scientists have identified some intrinsic [[neuron|neuronal properties]] that play an important role in generating membrane potential oscillations. In particular, [[voltage-gated ion channels]] are critical in the generation of action potentials. The dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well-established [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations. Using [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation analysis]], different oscillatory varieties of these neuronal models can be determined, allowing for the classification of types of neuronal responses. The oscillatory dynamics of neuronal spiking as identified in the Hodgkin–Huxley model closely agree with empirical findings. In addition to periodic spiking, [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]], i.e. [[resonance]] behavior that does not result in action potentials, may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Llinas RR | title = The Intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: A new insight into CNS function | journal = Science | volume = 242 | pages = 1654–1664 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.1126/science.3059497 | pmid = 3059497 | issue = 4886| bibcode = 1988Sci...242.1654L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Llinas RR, Grace AA, Yarom Y | year = 1991 | title = In vitro neurons in mammalian cortical layer 4 exhibit intrinsic oscillatory activity in the 10- to 50-Hz frequency range | journal = Proc.

Bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations, and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance neuronal resonance.&lt;ref name = 'Wang 2010'/&gt;

=== Network properties ===
{{see also| Connectome}}

Apart from intrinsic properties of neurons, [[biological neural network]] properties are also an important source of oscillatory activity. Neurons [[Neuron#Connectivity|communicate]] with one another via synapses and affect the timing of spike trains in the post-synaptic neurons. Depending on the properties of the connection, such as the coupling strength, time delay and whether coupling is [[EPSP|excitatory]] or [[IPSP|inhibitory]], the spike trains of the interacting neurons may become [[phase synchronization|synchronized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeitler M, Daffertshofer A, Gielen CC | year = 2009 | title =Asymmetry in pulse-coupled oscillators with delay | journal = Phys. Rev. E| volume = 79 | issue = 6 | p = 065203(R) | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.79.065203 | bibcode = 2009PhRvE..79f5203Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neurons are locally connected, forming small clusters that are called [[neural ensemble]]s. Certain network structures promote oscillatory activity at specific frequencies. For example, neuronal activity generated by two populations of interconnected ''inhibitory'' and ''excitatory'' cells can show spontaneous oscillations that are described by the [[Wilson-Cowan model]].

If a group of neurons engages in synchronized oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator.&lt;ref name = "Haken 1996"/&gt; Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity.&lt;ref name = "Pikovsky 2001"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pikovsky A, Rosenblum M, Kurths J | title= Synchronization: a universal concept in nonlinear sciences | year=2001 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-53352-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the [[thalamus]] and the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] (see [[Recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance|thalamocortical oscillation]]), involve time-delays due to the finite [[Action potential#Propagation|conduction velocity]] of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form [[feedback|feed-back loops]] that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form [[large scale brain networks]], whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of [[frequency domain|spectral analysis]] and [[Granger causality]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Brovelli, Steven L. Bressler and their colleagues, [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/101/26/9849.pdf 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"/&gt;

=== Neuromodulation ===
{{main| Neuromodulation (biology)}}

In addition to fast direct [[synapse|synaptic interactions]] between neurons forming a network, oscillatory activity is regulated by [[neuromodulators]] on a much slower time scale. That is, the concentration levels of certain neurotransmitters are known to regulate the amount of oscillatory activity.

== Mathematical description ==

Oscillations can often be described and analyzed using mathematics. Mathematicians have identified several [[dynamical systems|dynamical]] mechanisms that generate rhythmicity.  Among the most important are [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic]] (linear) oscillators, [[limit cycle]] oscillators, and delayed-[[feedback]] oscillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzsaki G, Draguhn A | title = Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5679 | year = 2004 | pages = 1926–1929 | doi =  10.1126/science.1099745 | pmid = 15218136 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1926B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harmonic oscillations appear very frequently in nature—examples are sound waves, the motion of a [[pendulum]], and vibrations of every sort. They generally arise when a physical system is perturbed by a small degree from a [[Principle of minimum energy|minimum-energy state]], and are well understood mathematically.  Noise-driven harmonic oscillators realistically simulate alpha rhythm in the waking EEG as well as slow waves and spindles in the sleep EEG. Successful EEG analysis algorithms were based on such models. Several other EEG components are better described by limit-cycle or delayed-feedback oscillations.  Limit-cycle oscillations arise from physical systems that show large deviations from [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|equilibrium]], whereas delayed-feedback oscillations arise when components of a system affect each other after significant time delays.  Limit-cycle oscillations can be complex but there are powerful mathematical tools for analyzing them; the mathematics of delayed-feedback oscillations is primitive in comparison. Linear oscillators and limit-cycle oscillators qualitatively differ in terms of how they respond to fluctuations in input.  In a linear oscillator, the frequency is more or less constant but the amplitude can vary greatly. In a limit-cycle oscillator, the amplitude tends to be more or less constant but the frequency can vary greatly.  A [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] is an example of a limit-cycle oscillation in that the frequency of beats varies widely, while each individual beat continues to pump about the same amount of blood.

[[Computational models]] adopt a variety of abstractions in order to describe complex oscillatory dynamics observed in brain activity. Many models are used in the field, each defined at a different level of abstraction and trying to model different aspects of neural systems. They range from models of the short-term behaviour of individual neurons, through models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons, to models of how behaviour can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems.

{{see also| Biological neuron model}}

A model of a biological neuron is a mathematical description of the properties of nerve cells, or neurons, that is designed to accurately describe and predict its biological processes. The most successful and widely used model of neurons, the Hodgkin–Huxley model, is based on data from the [[squid giant axon]]. It is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of a neuron, in particular the generation and propagation of [[action potentials]]. The model is very accurate and detailed and [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]] received the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work.

The mathematics of the Hodgkin–Huxley model are quite complicated and several simplifications have been proposed, such as the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]] and the [[Hindmarsh–Rose model]]. Such models only capture the basic neuronal dynamics, such as rhythmic spiking and [[bursting]], but are more computationally efficient. This allows the simulation of a large number of interconnected neurons that form a [[neural network]].

=== Spiking model ===
{{see also| Neural network}}

A neural network model describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit.  These models aim to describe how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons. Local interactions between neurons can result in the synchronization of spiking activity and form the basis of oscillatory activity. In particular, models of interacting [[pyramidal cells]] and inhibitory [[interneurons]] have been shown to generate brain rhythms such as [[gamma wave|gamma activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whittington MA, Traub RD, Kopell N, Ermentrout B, Buhl EH |title=Inhibition-based rhythms: experimental and mathematical observations on network dynamics |journal= Int J Psychophysiol |volume=38 |pages=315–336 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0167-8760(00)00173-2 |pmid=11102670 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also| Wilson-Cowan model}}

Neural field models are another important tool in studying neural oscillations and are a mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity of large numbers of neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous [[neural networks]]. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the [[mean field theory|mean field approach]], an area of [[statistical physics]] that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Bressloff PC, Cowan JD (2003) Spontaneous pattern formation in primary visual cortex.

=== Kuramoto model ===
[[File:KuramotoModel.ogv|thumb|240px| right|Simulation of [[Kuramoto model]] showing neural synchronization and oscillations in the mean field]]

{{main|Kuramoto model}}

The [[Kuramoto model]] of coupled phase oscillators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuramoto Y | title= Chemical Oscillations, Waves, and Turbulence | year=1984 | publisher=Dover Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most abstract and fundamental models used to investigate neural oscillations and synchronization. It captures the activity of a local system (e.g., a single neuron or neural ensemble) by its circular [[phase (waves)|phase]] alone and hence ignores the amplitude of oscillations (amplitude is constant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ermentrout B | contribution = An introduction to neural oscillators | editor = F Ventriglia | title= Neural Modeling and Neural Networks | year = 1994 | pages = 79–110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions amongst these oscillators are introduced by a simple algebraic form (such as a [[trigonometric functions|sine]] function) and collectively generate a dynamical pattern at the global scale. The Kuramoto model is widely used to study oscillatory brain activity and several extensions have been proposed that increase its neurobiological plausibility, for instance by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2010.00190 | vauthors = Breakspear M, Heitmann S, Daffertshofer A | title = Generative models of cortical oscillations: Neurobiological implications of the Kuramoto model | journal = Front Hum Neurosci | volume = 4 | p = 190 | year = 2010 | pmid=21151358 |pmc=2995481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it describes how the activity of a group of interacting neurons can become synchronized and generate large-scale oscillations. Simulations using the Kuramoto model with realistic long-range cortical connectivity and time-delayed interactions reveal the emergence of slow patterned fluctuations that reproduce resting-state [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent|BOLD]] functional maps, which can be measured using [[fMRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.010 | vauthors = Cabral J, Hugues E, Sporns O, Deco G | title = Role of local network oscillations in resting-state functional connectivity | journal = NeuroImage | year = 2011 | pmid=21511044 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=130–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity patterns ==

Both single neurons and groups of neurons can generate oscillatory activity spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output. Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically in the absence of any synaptic input. Likewise, brain-wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity, so-called [[resting state fMRI|resting-state activity]]. These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output. Oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all, resulting in an additive response.

=== Ongoing activity ===

Spontaneous activity is [[brain]] activity in the absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses.  The term ''ongoing brain activity'' is used in [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form [[evoked potential]]s/[[evoked field]]s, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be [[Signal noise|noise]] if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis.  Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as [[alpha wave]]s, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a [[Gaussian noise|noise]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bistability and non-Gaussian fluctuations in spontaneous cortical activity |vauthors=Freyer F, Aquino K, Robinson PA, Ritter P, Breakspear M | year=2009 |journal=J Neurosci |volume=29 |issue=26 |pages=8512–8524 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0754-09.2009 |pmid=19571142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the [[default network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2201 |title=Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging |vauthors=Fox MD, Raichle ME |year=2007 |journal=Nat Rev Neurosci |volume=8 |pages=700&amp;ndash;711 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging |vauthors=Laufs H, Kraków K, Sterzer P, Eger E, Beyerle A, Salek-Haddadi A, Kleinschmidt A|year=2003 |journal=PNAS |volume=100 |issue=19 |pages=11053–11058 |pmid=12958209 |pmc=196925 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1831638100|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011053L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing brain activity may also have an important role in perception, as it may interact with activity related to incoming stimuli. Indeed, [[EEG]] studies suggest that visual perception is dependent on both the phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations. For instance, the amplitude and phase of alpha activity at the moment of visual stimulation predicts whether a weak stimulus will be perceived by the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathewson KE, Gratton G, Fabiani M, Beck DM, Ro T | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 29 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3963-08.2009 | title = To see or not to see: Prestimulus α phase predicts visual awareness | year = 2009 | pages = 2725–32 | pmid = 19261866 | issue = 9 | pmc = 2724892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch NA, Dubois J, VanRullen R | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 29 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.0113-09.2009 | title = The phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predicts visual perception | year = 2009 | pages = 7869–76 | pmid = 19535598 | issue = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Dijk H, Schoffelen JM, Oostenveld R, Jensen O | journal =  J Neurosci | volume = 28 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.1853-07.2008 | title = Prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band predicts visual discrimination ability | year = 2008 | pages = 1816–1823 | issue = 8 | pmid = 18287498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency response ===

In response to input, a neuron or neuronal ensemble may change the frequency at which it oscillates, thus changing the [[rate coding|rate]] at which it spikes. Often, a neuron's firing rate depends on the summed activity it receives. Frequency changes are also commonly observed in central pattern generators and directly relate to the speed of motor activities, such as step frequency in walking. However, changes in ''relative'' oscillation frequency between different brain areas is not so common because the frequency of oscillatory activity is often related to the time delays between brain areas.

=== Phase resetting ===

Phase resetting occurs when input to a neuron or neuronal ensemble resets the phase of ongoing oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tass PA | title=Phase resetting in medicine and biology: stochastic modelling and data analysis | year = 2007 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=3-540-65697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to neuronal input (a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input, which is referred to as phase locking&lt;ref name="Izhikevich 2007"/&gt;) and may also occur in neuronal ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously. Phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions&lt;ref name = "Varela 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pikovsky 2001"/&gt; because the timing of spikes can become phase locked to the activity of other neurons.

Phase resetting also permits the study of evoked activity, a term used in [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] for responses in brain activity that are directly related to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]-related activity. [[Evoked potential]]s and [[event-related potential]]s are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are [[phase (waves)|phase]]-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1066168 |title=Dynamic brain sources of visual evoked responses|vauthors=Makeig S, Westerfield M, Jung TP, Enghoff S, Townsend J, Courchesne E, Sejnowski TJ |year=2002 |journal=Science |volume=295 |pages=690&amp;ndash;694 |pmid=11809976 |issue=5555|bibcode=2002Sci...295..690M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mäkinen V, Tiitinen H, May P | title = Auditory event-related responses are generated independently of ongoing brain activity | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 24 | pages = 961–968 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.10.020 | pmid = 15670673 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amplitude response ===

Next to evoked activity, neural activity related to stimulus processing may result in induced activity. Induced activity refers to modulation in ongoing brain activity induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced activity is amplitude change in oscillatory activity. For instance, [[Gamma wave|gamma activity]] often increases during increased mental activity such as during object representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01299-1|title=Oscillatory gamma activity in humans and its role in object representation|vauthors=Tallon-Baudry C, Bertrand O |year=1999 |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=3 |pages=151&amp;ndash;162|issue=4 |pmid=10322469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using [[time-frequency analysis]]. Induced activity generally reflects the activity of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory activity are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural activity, for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory activity are therefore often referred to as event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization.&lt;ref name = "Pfurtscheller 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00141-8 |title=Event-related EEG/MEG synchronization and desynchronization: basic principles |author1=Pfurtscheller G | author2=da Silva FHL |year=1999 |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=110 |pages=1842&amp;ndash;1857 |pmid=10576479 |issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Asymmetric amplitude modulation ====

It has recently been proposed that even if phases are not aligned across trials, induced activity may still cause [[event-related potential]]s because ongoing brain oscillations may not be symmetric and thus amplitude modulations may result in a baseline shift that does not average out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A novel mechanism for evoked responses in the human brain|vauthors=Nikulin VV, Linkenkaer-Hansen K, Nolte G, Lemm S, Muller KR, Ilmoniemi RJ, Curio G |year=2007 |journal=Eur J Neurosci |volume=25 |pages=3146&amp;ndash;3154|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05553.x|issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asymmetric amplitude modulations of brain oscillations generate slow evoked responses|vauthors=Mazaheri A, Jensen O |year=2008 |journal=J Neurosci |volume=28 |pages=7781&amp;ndash;7787|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1631-08.2008|issue=31|pmid=18667610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model implies that slow event-related responses, such as asymmetric alpha activity, could result from asymmetric brain oscillation amplitude modulations, such as an asymmetry of the intracellular currents that propagate forward and backward down the dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Rhythmic pulsing: linking ongoing brain activity with evoked responses|vauthors=Mazaheri A, Jensen O |year=2008 |journal=Front Hum Neurosci |volume=4 |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this assumption, asymmetries in the dendritic current would cause asymmetries in oscillatory activity measured by EEG and MEG, since dendritic currents in pyramidal cells are generally thought to generate EEG and MEG signals that can be measured at the scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetoencephalography - Theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain |vauthors=Hamalainen M, Hari R, Ilmoniemi RJ, Knuutila J, Lounasmaa OV |year=1993 |journal=Rev Mod Phys |volume=65 |pages=413&amp;ndash;497 |bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Neural synchronization can be modulated by task constraints, such as [[attention]], and is thought to play a role in [[neural binding|feature binding]],&lt;ref name = "Singer 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ph.55.030193.002025 | author = Singer W | title = Synchronization of cortical activity and its putative role in information processing and learning | journal = Annu Rev Physiol | volume = 55 | pages = 349–374 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8466179}}&lt;/ref&gt; neuronal communication,&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"/&gt; and [[motor coordination]].&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"/&gt; Neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in [[neuroscience]] in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the [[neural binding]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer W, Gray CM | title = Visual feature integration and the temporal correlation hypothesis | journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 18 | pages = 555–586 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.18.030195.003011 | pmid = 7605074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person looks at a tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in [[local field potentials]] which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in [[EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping.&lt;ref name = "Singer 1993"/&gt;

=== Pacemaker ===
{{main|Cardiac pacemaker}}

Cells in the [[sinoatrial node]], located in the [[right atrium]] of the heart, spontaneously depolarize approximately 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells have the ability to generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal [[sinus rhythm]] and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the [[heart rate]]. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the [[autonomic nervous system]], which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells.

=== Central pattern generator ===
{{main|Central pattern generator}}

Synchronized firing of neurons also forms the basis of periodic motor commands for rhythmic movements. These rhythmic outputs are produced by a group of interacting neurons that form a network, called a [[central pattern generator]]. Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that—when activated—can produce rhythmic motor patterns in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. Examples are [[walking]], [[control of respiration|breathing]], and [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marder E, Bucher D | title = Central pattern generators and the control of rhythmic movements| journal = Curr Biol | volume = 11 | pages = R986–R996 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00581-4 | issue = 23 | pmid = 11728329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most evidence for central pattern generators comes from lower animals, such as the [[lamprey]], but there is also evidence for spinal central pattern generators in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitrijevic MR, Gerasimenko Y, Pinter MM | title = Evidence for a spinal central pattern generator in humans| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 860 | pages = 360–376 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09062.x | pmid=9928325| bibcode = 1998NYASA.860..360D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danner SM, Hofstoetter US, Freundl B, Binder H, Mayr W, Rattay F, Minassian K | title = Human spinal locomotor control is based on flexibly organized burst generators | journal = Brain | volume = 138 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 577–88 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25582580 | pmc = 4408427 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awu372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information processing ===
{{main|Neural coding}}

Neuronal spiking is generally considered the basis for information transfer in the brain. For such a transfer, information needs to be coded in a spiking pattern. Different types of coding schemes have been proposed, such as [[rate coding]] and [[temporal coding]]. Neural oscillations could create periodic time windows in which input spikes have larger effect on neurons, thereby providing a mechanism for decoding temporal codes.&lt;ref name = "Gupta2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta N, Singh SS, Stopfer M | title = Oscillatory integration windows in neurons | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13808 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27976720 | pmc = 5171764 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13808 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713808G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===
{{see also| Binding problem}}

Synchronization of neuronal firing may serve as a means to group spatially segregated neurons that respond to the same stimulus in order to bind these responses for further joint processing, i.e. to exploit temporal synchrony to encode relations. Purely theoretical formulations of the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis were proposed first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Milner PM | title = A model for visual shape recognition | journal = Psychol. Rev. | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 521–535 | year = 1974 | doi = 10.1037/h0037149 | pmid=4445414}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently extensive experimental evidence has been reported supporting the potential role of synchrony as a relational code.&lt;ref name = "Gray 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gray CM, König P, Engel AK, Singer W | title = Oscillatory responses in cat visual cortex exhibit inter-columnar synchronization which reflects global stimulus properties | journal = Nature | volume = 338 | pages = 334–337 | year = 1989 |doi=10.1038/338334a0 | issue=6213 | pmid = 2922061| bibcode = 1989Natur.338..334G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes implanted in the visual cortex. These experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli. The frequency of these oscillations was in the range of 40&amp;nbsp;Hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating, suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions.&lt;ref name="Gray 1989"/&gt; Similar findings were shown in parallel by the group of Eckhorn, providing further evidence for the functional role of neural synchronization in feature binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  vauthors = Eckhorn R, Bauer R, Jordan W, Brosch M, Kruse W, Munk M, Reitboeck HJ | journal = Biol Cybern | volume = 60  | issue = 2 | title = Coherent oscillations: A mechanism of feature linking in the visual cortex? Multiple electrode and correlation analyses in the cat | year = 1988 | pages = 121–130 | doi= 10.1007/BF00202899 |  pmid = 3228555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, numerous studies have replicated these findings and extended them to different modalities such as EEG, providing extensive evidence of the functional role of [[gamma wave|gamma]] oscillations in visual perception.

Gilles Laurent and colleagues showed that oscillatory synchronization has an important functional role in odor perception. Perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wehr M, Laurent G | title = Odour encoding by temporal sequences of firing in oscillating neural assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 384 | pages = 162–166 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1038/384162a0 | pmid = 8906790 | issue = 6605 | bibcode = 1996Natur.384..162W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These oscillations can be disrupted by [[GABA]] blocker [[picrotoxin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod K, Laurent G | title = Distinct mechanisms for synchronization and temporal patterning of odor-encoding neural assemblies  | journal = Science | volume = 274 | pages = 976–979 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5289.976 | pmid = 8875938 | issue = 5289 | bibcode = 1996Sci...274..976M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stopfer M, Bhagavan S, Smith BH, Laurent G | title = Impaired odour discrimination on desynchronization of odour-encoding neural assemblies | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | pages = 70–74 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1038/36335 | pmid = 9363891 | issue = 6655 | bibcode = 1997Natur.390...70S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to more similar responses across odors in downstream β-lobe neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod K, Bäcker A, Laurent G | title = Who reads temporal information contained across synchronized and oscillatory spike trains? | journal = Nature | volume = 395 | pages = 693–698 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1038/27201 | pmid = 9790189 | issue = 6703 | bibcode = 1998Natur.395..693M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent follow-up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for [[Kenyon cell]]s in the insect [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body]], such that incoming spikes from the [[antennal lobe]] are more effective in activating Kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle.&lt;ref name="Gupta2016" /&gt;

Neural oscillations are also thought be involved in the [[sense of time]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buhusi CV, Meck WH | year = 2005 | title = What makes us tick? Functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 755–65 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1764 | pmid = 16163383 | issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in somatosensory perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahissar E, Zacksenhouse M | year = 2001 | title = Temporal and spatial coding in the rat vibrissal system | journal = Prog Brain Res | volume = 130 | pages = 75–87 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-6123(01)30007-9 | pmid = 11480290 | series = Progress in Brain Research | isbn = 9780444501103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent findings argue against a clock-like function of cortical gamma oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns SP, Xing D, Shapley RM | year = 2011 | title = Is gamma-band activity in the local field potential of V1 cortex a "clock" or filtered noise? | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 31 | pages = 9658–9664 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.0660-11.2011 | issue = 26 | pmid = 21715631 | pmc = 3518456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor coordination ===
{{main| Motor coordination}}

Oscillations have been commonly reported in the motor system. Pfurtscheller and colleagues found a reduction in [[alpha wave|alpha]] (8&amp;ndash;12&amp;nbsp;Hz) and [[Beta wave|beta]] (13&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillations in [[EEG]] activity when subjects made a movement.&lt;ref name = "Pfurtscheller 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfurtscheller G, Aranibar A | title = Event-related cortical desynchronization detected by power measurements of scalp EEG | journal = Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 42 | pages = 817–826 | year = 1977 | pmid = 67933 | issue = 6 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(77)90235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using intra-cortical recordings, similar changes in oscillatory activity were found in the motor cortex when the monkeys performed motor acts that required significant attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murthy VN, Fetz EE | title = Oscillatory activity in sensorimotor cortex of awake monkeys: Synchronization of local field potentials and relation to behavior | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 76 | pages = 3949–3967 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8985892 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanes JN, Donoghue JP| title = Oscillations in local-field potentials of the primate motor cortex during voluntary movement | journal = PNAS | volume = 90 | pages = 4470–4474 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.10.4470 | pmid = 8506287 | issue = 10 | pmc = 46533 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.4470S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, oscillations at spinal level become synchronised to beta oscillations in the motor cortex during constant muscle activation, as determined by [[Corticomuscular coherence|cortico-muscular coherence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conway, BA |author2=Halliday, DM |author3=Farmer, SF | title = Synchronization between motor cortex and spinal motoneuronal pool during the performance of a maintained motor task in man | journal = J Physiol | volume = 489 | pages = 917–924 | year = 1995 | issue = 3  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salenius S, Portin K, Kajola M | title = Cortical control of human motoneuron firing during isometric contraction  | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 77 | pages = 3401–3405 | year = 1997 | issue = 6 | pmid = 9212286  | displayauthors = etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.225bo.x | vauthors = Baker SN, Olivier E, Lemon RN | title = Coherent oscillations in monkey motor cortex and hand muscle EMG show task-dependent modulation | journal = J Physiol | volume = 501 | pages = 225–241 | year = 1997 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1159515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, muscle activity of different muscles reveals [[Intermuscular coherence|inter-muscular coherence]] at multiple distinct frequencies reflecting the underlying neural circuitry involved in [[motor coordination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boonstra TW, Danna-Dos-Santos A, Xie HB, Roerdink M, Stins JF, Breakspear M | title = Muscle networks: Connectivity analysis of EMG activity during postural control | journal = Sci Rep | volume = 5 | pages = 17830 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1038/srep17830 | pmid=26634293 | pmc=4669476| bibcode=2015NatSR...517830B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerkman JN, Daffertshofer A, Gollo LL, Breakspear M, Boonstra TW | title = Network structure of the human musculoskeletal system shapes neural interactions on multiple time scales | journal = Science Advances | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = eaat0497 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29963631 | pmc = 6021138 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.aat0497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently it was found that cortical oscillations propagate as [[travelling wave]]s across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rubino, D |author2=Robbins, KA |author3=Hatsopoulos, NG | title = Propagating waves mediate information transfer in the motor cortex  | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 9 | pages = 1549–1557 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1038/nn1802 | pmid = 17115042 | issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that motor commands in the form of travelling waves can be spatially filtered by the descending fibres to selectively control muscle force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heitmann S, Boonstra T, Gong P, Breakspear M, Ermentrout B | title = The rhythms of steady posture: Motor commands as spatially organized oscillation patterns | journal = Neurocomputing | volume = 170 | pages = 3–14 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.neucom.2015.01.088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations have shown that ongoing wave activity in cortex can elicit steady muscle force with physiological levels of EEG-EMG coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heitmann S, Boonstra T, Breakspear M | title = A dendritic mechanism for decoding traveling waves: Principles and applications to motor cortex | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e1003260 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003260 | pmid=24204220 | pmc=3814333| bibcode=2013PLSCB...9E3260H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscillatory rhythms at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz have been recorded in a brain area called the [[inferior olive]], which is associated with the cerebellum.&lt;ref name = "Llinas 1986"/&gt; These oscillations are also observed in motor output of physiological [[tremor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allum JH, Dietz V, Freund HJ| title = Neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological tremor | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 41 | pages = 557–571 | year = 1978 | pmid = 660226 | issue = 3 | doi= 10.1152/jn.1978.41.3.557}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when performing slow finger movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallbo AB, Wessberg J| title = Organization of motor output of slow finger movements in man| journal = J Physiol | volume = 469 | pages = 673–691 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8271223 | pmc = 1143894}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings may indicate that the human brain controls continuous movements intermittently. In support, it was shown that these movement discontinuities are directly correlated to oscillatory activity in a cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, which may represent a neural mechanism for the intermittent motor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross J, Timmermann J, Kujala J, Dirks M, Schmitz F, Salmelin R, Schnitzler A | title = The neural basis of intermittent motor control in humans| journal = PNAS | volume = 99 | pages = 2299–2302 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032682099 | pmid = 11854526 | issue = 4 | pmc = 122359| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.2299G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
{{main|Memory}}

Neural oscillations, in particular [[Theta rhythm|theta]] activity, are extensively linked to memory function. Theta rhythms are very strong in rodent hippocampi and entorhinal cortex during learning and memory retrieval, and they are believed to be vital to the induction of [[long-term potentiation]], a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory. [[Coupling (physics)|Coupling]] between theta and [[gamma wave|gamma]] activity is thought to be vital for memory functions, including [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Buszaki G | title = Rhythms of the brain | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nyhus E, Curran T | title = Functional role of gamma and theta oscillations in episodic memory | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1023–35 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20060015 | pmc = 2856712 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.12.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight coordination of single-neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans, as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutishauser U, Ross IB, Mamelak AN, Schuman EM | title = Human memory strength is predicted by theta-frequency phase-locking of single neurons | journal = Nature | volume = 464 | issue = 7290 | pages = 903–7 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20336071 | doi = 10.1038/nature08860 | bibcode = 2010Natur.464..903R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep and consciousness ===
{{main|Sleep}}

Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent [[consciousness]] and proceeds in cycles of [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) and [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|non-rapid eye movement]] (NREM) sleep. Sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]: for instance, stage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves (common in the awake state) to theta waves, whereas stage N3 (deep or slow-wave sleep) is characterized by the presence of delta waves. The normal order of sleep stages is N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM.

=== Development ===

Neural oscillations may play a role in neural development. For example, [[retinal waves]] are thought to have properties that define early connectivity of circuits and synapses between cells in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feller|first=Marla B|date=2009-07-06|title=Retinal waves are likely to instruct the formation of eye-specific retinogeniculate projections|journal=Neural Development|volume=4|pages=24|doi=10.1186/1749-8104-4-24|issn=1749-8104|pmc=2706239|pmid=19580682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathology ==

[[File:Writing by a Parkinson's disease patient.png|thumb|Handwriting of a person affected by [[Parkinson's disease]] showing rhythmic tremor activity in the strokes]]
[[File:Spike-waves.png|thumb|Generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges reflecting [[seizure]] activity]]

Specific types of neural oscillations may also appear in pathological situations, such as [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[epilepsy]]. These pathological oscillations often consist of an aberrant version of a normal oscillation. For example, one of the best known types is the [[spike and wave]] oscillation, which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures, and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations.

=== Tremor ===
{{main|Tremor}}

A tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic, muscle contraction and relaxation involving to-and-fro movements of one or more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as [[essential tremor]] or [[Parkinsonism|Parkinsonian]] tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McAuley JH, Marsden CD | title = Physiological and pathological tremors and rhythmic central motor control | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | year = 2000 | pages = 1545–1567 | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.8.1545 | pmid = 10908186 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epilepsy ===
{{main|Epilepsy}}

Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by [[epileptic seizure|seizures]]. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or [[Electrophysiological hypersynchronization in epilepsy|hypersynchronous neuronal activity]] in the brain.&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"&gt;V. Shusterman and W. C. Troy. From baseline to epileptiform activity: A path to synchronized rhythmicity in large-scale neural networks. Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys. 2008;77(6 Pt 1):061911&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thalamocortical dysrhythmia ===
{{main|Thalamocortical dysrhythmia}}

In thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD), normal [[Recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance|thalamocortical resonance]] is disrupted. The thalamic loss of input allows the frequency of the thalamo-cortical column to slow into the theta or delta band as identified by MEG and EEG by machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanneste S, Song JJ, De Ridder D | title = Thalamocortical dysrhythmia detected by machine learning | language = En | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1103 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29549239 | pmc = 5856824 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-02820-0 | bibcode = 2018NatCo...9.1103V }}&lt;/ref&gt; TCD can be treated with [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] methods like [[thalamotomy]].


{{clear}}

== Applications ==

=== Clinical endpoints ===
Neural oscillations are sensitive to several drugs influencing brain activity; accordingly, [[biomarker]]s based on neural oscillations are emerging as [[Clinical endpoint|secondary endpoints]] in clinical trials and in quantifying effects in pre-clinical studies. These biomarkers are often named "EEG biomarkers" or "Neurophysiological Biomarkers" and are quantified using [[Quantitative electroencephalography|Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)]]. EEG biomarkers can be extracted from the EEG using the open-source [[Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox]].

=== Brain–computer interface ===
{{main|Brain–computer interface}}

Neural oscillation has been applied as a control signal in various [[brain–computer interface]]s (BCIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Birbaumer | first=Neils | year=2006 | title=Breaking the silence: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication and motor control | journal=Psychophysiology | pmid=17076808 | volume=43 | issue=6 | pages=517–32 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2006.00456.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a non-invasive BCI interface can be created by placing electrodes on the scalp and then measuring the weak electric signals. Although individual neuron activities cannot be recovered through non-invasive BCI because the skull damps and blurs the electromagnetic signals, oscillatory activity can still be reliably detected. In particular, some forms of BCI allow users to control a device by measuring the amplitude of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands, including [[Mu wave|mu]] and [[Beta wave|beta]] rhythms.

'''Nuclear atypia''' refers to abnormal appearance of [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. It is a term used in [[cytopathology]] and [[histopathology]]. Atypical nuclei are often [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]].

Nuclear atypia can be seen in reactive changes, [[Precancerous condition|pre-neoplastic changes]] and [[malignancy]].  Severe nuclear atypia is, in most cases, considered an indicator of [[malignancy]].

The '''OPC Data Access''' Specification is the first of a group of [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] known as the [[OLE for process control|OPC]] Classic Specifications.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-classic/data-access/&lt;/ref&gt;

OPC Data Access is a group of [[Client-server model|client-server]] standards that provides specifications for communicating real-time data from [[data acquisition]] devices such as [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]s to display and interface devices like [[human-machine interface|Human-Machine Interfaces]] (HMI), [[SCADA]] systems&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]]/[[Manufacturing execution system|MES]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.br/books?id=8Lj8CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;ots=K1soEbX1SM&amp;dq=ERP%2FMES%20%22OPC%20DA%22%20OR%20%22OPC%20Data%20Access%22&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The specifications focus on the continuous communication of data.

The OPC Data Access specification is also known as OPC DA. OPC DA deals only with real-time data and not historical data (for historical data you need to use [[OPC Historical Data Access]], or OPC HDA) or events (for Alarms and Events you need to use [[OPC Alarms and Events]], or OPC AE).  There are three attributes associated with OPC DA data. These are
# a value,
# the [[quality (business)|quality]] of the value, and
# a [[timestamp]].

The OPC DA specification states that these three attributes have to be returned to an OPC client making a request. Therefore, if the data source is not capable of providing a timestamp, for example, the OPC DA server must create a timestamp.

The OPC Classic specifications are based on the [[Microsoft]] [[Component Object Model|COM]] technology&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-classic/&lt;/ref&gt; and define a [[C language|C]]/[[C++]] [[Interface (computing)|interface]]. A standard [[OLE Automation|Automation]] [[Wrapper library|wrapper]] interface is also defined for access from [[Visual Basic]], [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]] and other automation-enabled languages.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/developer-kits-classic/automation-wrapper/&lt;/ref&gt; Several vendors offer [[.NET Framework|.NET]] toolkits to make the OPC interface accessible in .NET [[Application software|applications]].

The newer OPC .NET ([[OPC Xi]]) specification is based on WCF ([[Windows Communication Foundation]]) and defines a .NET interface with the functionality of the OPC Classic specifications OPC DA, OPC HDA and OPC AE (Alarms&amp;Events).&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-net-4-0/&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[OPC Unified Architecture]] allows the same functionality but offers platform independence and optionally complex information modelling capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paleontology}}
'''Paleoecology''' (also spelled '''palaeoecology''') is the study of interactions between organisms and/or interactions between organisms and their environments across geologic timescales. As a discipline, paleoecology interacts with, depends on and informs a variety of fields including [[paleontology]], [[ecology]], [[climatology]] and [[biology]].

Paleoecology emerged out of the field of paleontology in the 1950s, though paleontologists have conducted paleoecological studies since the creation of paleontology in the 1700s and 1800s. Combining the investigative approach of searching for fossils with the theoretical approach of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]], paleoecology began as paleontologists began examining both the ancient organisms they discovered and the reconstructed environments in which they lived. Visual depictions of past marine and terrestrial communities has been considered an early form of paleoecology.

== Overview of paleoecological approaches ==

* Classic paleoecology uses data from [[fossil]]s and [[subfossil]]s to reconstruct the [[ecosystem]]s of the past. It involves the study of fossil organisms and their associated remains (such as shells, teeth, pollen, and seeds), which can help in the interpretation of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], living interactions, [[natural environment]], communities, and manner of death and burial. Such interpretations aid the reconstruction of past environments (i.e., paleoenvironments). Paleoecologists have studied the [[fossil record]] to try to clarify the relationship animals have to their environment, in part to help understand the current state of [[biodiversity]]. They have identified close links between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity, that is, between the diversity of animals and the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s they occupy.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856|author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical paleoecology is a primarily reductionist approach: scientists conduct detailed analysis of relatively small groups of organisms within shorter geologic timeframes.
* Evolutionary paleoecology uses data from fossils and other evidence to examine how organisms and their environments change throughout time. Evolutionary paleoecologists take the holistic approach of looking at both organism and environmental change, accounting for physical and chemical changes in the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere across time. By studying patterns of evolution and extinction in the context of environmental change, evolutionary paleoecologists are able to examine concepts of vulnerability and resilience in species and environments.
* Community paleoecology uses statistical analysis to examine the composition and distribution of groups of plants or animals. By quantifying how plants or animals are associated, community paleoecologists are able to investigate the structures of ancient communities of organisms. Advances in technology have helped propel the field, through the use of physical models and computer-based analysis.

== Major principles ==
While the functions and relationships of fossil organisms may not be observed directly (as in ecology), scientists can describe and analyze both individuals and communities over time. To do so, paleoecologists make the following assumptions:

*All organisms are adapted and restricted to a particular environment, and are usually adapted to a particular lifestyle.
*Essentially all organisms depend on another organism, whether directly or indirectly.
*The fossil or physical records are inherently incomplete - the geologic record is selective and some environments are more likely to be preserved than others. [[Taphonomy]], affecting the over- and underrepresentation of fossils, is an extremely important consideration in interpreting fossil assemblages.
*[[Uniformitarianism]] is the concept that processes that took place in the geologic past are the same as the ones that are observed taking place today. In paleoecology, uniformitarianism is used as a methodology: paleoecologists make inferences about ancient organisms and environments based on analogies they find in the present.

==Paleoecological methods==

The aim of paleoecology is to build the most detailed model possible of the [[Ecology|life environment]] of previously living organisms found today as fossils. The process of reconstructing past environments requires the use of ''archives'' (e.g., sediment sequences), ''proxies'' (e.g., the micro or mega-fossils and other sediment characteristics that provide the evidence of the biota and the physical environment), and ''chronology'' (e.g., obtaining absolute (or relative) dating of events in the archive). Such reconstruction takes into consideration complex interactions among environmental factors such as temperatures, food supplies, and degree of solar illumination. Often much of this information is lost or distorted by the fossilization process or diagenesis of the enclosing sediments, making interpretation difficult.  

Some other proxies for reconstructing past environments include charcoal and pollen, which synthesize fire and vegetation data, respectively. Both of these alternates can be found in lakes and peat settings, and can provide moderate to high resolution information &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NZFires/predict_future.html|title=Paleoecology: a window into the past|website=Exploring the Past to Understand the Future|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are well studied methods often utilized in the paleoecological field.  
 
The environmental complexity factor is normally tackled through [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of the available numerical data (quantitative [[paleontology]] or [[paleostatistics]]), while the study of post-mortem processes is known as the field of [[taphonomy]].

==Quaternary==
Much of the original paleoecological research has focused on the last two million years (the [[Quaternary]] period), because older environments are less well represented in the fossil [[timeline of evolution]]. Indeed, many studies concentrate on the [[Holocene]] epoch (the last 11,500 years), or the last glacial stage of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin/Weichsel/Devensian/Würm glaciation]] of the [[ice age]], from 50,000 to 11,500 years ago).  Such studies are useful&lt;ref name="Charlesetal1987acidificationbigmooselake"&gt;Charles D.F.; Whitehead D. R.; Engstrom D. R.; et al. (1987) Paleoliminological evidence for recent acidification of Big Moose Lake, Adirondack Mountains, New-York (USA). ''Biogeochemistry'', 3, 267-296, doi=10.1007/BF02185196.&lt;/ref&gt; for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem change and for reconstructing pre-industrialization ecosystems.

== Applications of paleoecology ==
Paleoecological studies are used to inform conservation, management and restoration efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoonmaker|first=Peter K.|last2=Foster|first2=David R.|date=1991|title=Some implications of paleoecology for contemporary ecology|url=|journal=The Botanical Review|volume=57|pages=204–245|doi=10.1007/BF02858563|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seddon|first=Alistair|date=2013|title=Looking forward through the past: identification of 50 priority research questions in palaeoecology|url=|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=102|pages=256–267|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fire-focused paleoecology is an informative field of study to land managers seeking to restore ecosystem fire regimes.

'''Plant ecology''' is a subdiscipline of [[ecology]] which studies the distribution and [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of [[plant]]s, the effects of environmental factors upon the abundance of plants, and the interactions among and between plants and other organisms.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt; Examples of these are the distribution of [[temperate deciduous forest]]s in North America, the effects of drought or flooding upon plant survival, and competition among desert plants for water, or effects of herds of grazing animals upon the composition of grasslands.

A global overview of the Earth's major vegetation types is provided by O.W. Archibold.&lt;ref name="Archibold 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Archibold|first=O.W.|title=Ecology of World Vegetation|year=1995|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London.|isbn=0-412-44290-6|pages=510 p}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recognizes 11 major vegetation types:  tropical forests, tropical savannas, arid regions (deserts), Mediterranean ecosystems, temperate forest ecosystems, temperate grasslands, coniferous forests, tundra (both polar and high mountain), terrestrial [[wetland]]s, freshwater ecosystems and coastal/marine systems.  This breadth of topics shows the complexity of plant ecology, since it includes plants from floating single-celled algae up to large canopy forming trees.

One feature that defines plants is photosynthesis. One of the most important aspects of plant ecology is the role plants have played in [[Great oxygenation event|creating the oxygenated atmosphere of earth]], an event that occurred some 2 billion years ago. It can be dated by the deposition of banded iron formations, distinctive sedimentary rocks with large amounts of iron oxide.  At the same time, plants began removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby initiating the process of controlling Earth's climate.  A long term trend of the Earth has been toward increasing oxygen and decreasing carbon dioxide, and many other events in the Earth's history, like the first movement of life onto land, are likely tied to this sequence of events.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Plants and Vegetation|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-86480-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early classic books on plant ecology was written by [[John Ernest Weaver|J.E. Weaver]] and [[Frederic Clements|F.E. Clements]].&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J. E. and F. E. Clements. 1938. Plant Ecology. 2nd edn. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt; It talks broadly about plant communities, and particularly the importance of forces like competition and processes like succession.

Plant ecology can also be divided by levels of organization including plant [[ecophysiology]], plant [[population ecology]], [[community ecology]], [[ecosystem ecology]], [[landscape ecology]] and biosphere ecology.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SchulzeEtAl-Book"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDo8hLWtWzgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=plant+ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hNeWT-X8BOfJiQLW0LHhCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=plant%20ecology&amp;f=false | title=Plant Ecology | publisher=Springer | year=2005 | accessdate=April 24, 2012 | author=Schulze, Ernst-Detlef|display-authors=etal}} {{ISBN|3-540-20833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of plants and vegetation is complicated by their form.  First, most [[plant]]s are [[root]]ed in the [[soil]], which makes it difficult to observe and measure nutrient uptake and species interactions.  Second, plants often  [[Vegetative reproduction|reproduce vegetatively]], that is asexually, in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish individual plants. Indeed, the very concept of an individual is doubtful, since even a tree may be regarded as a large collection of linked meristems.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G. C. 1975. Sex and Evolution. Monographs in Population Biology. No. 8. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, plant ecology and animal ecology have different styles of approach to problems that involve processes like reproduction, dispersal and mutualism. Some plant ecologists have placed considerable emphasis upon trying to treat plant populations as if they were animal populations, focusing on population ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J. L. 1977. Population Biology of Plants. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other ecologists believe that while it is useful to draw upon population ecology to solve certain scientific problems, plants demand that ecologists work with multiple perspectives, appropriate to the problem, the scale and the situation.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of ecology}}
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|150px|Alexander von Humboldt's work connecting plant distributions with environmental factors played an important role in the genesis of the discipline of plant ecology.]]Plant ecology has its origin in the application of [[plant physiology]] to the questions raised by [[plant geography|plant geographers]].&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Valk|first=Arnold|title=Philosophy of Ecology|editor=Kevin deLaplante |editor2=Bryson Brown |editor3=Kent A.

Burk |author3=Wanna D. Pitts |author4=Frank S. Gilliam |author5=Mark W. Schwartz|title=Terrestrial Plant Ecology|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|year=1999|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–16}} [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]] was one of the first to note that similar climates produced similar types of vegetation, even when they were located in different parts of the world. Willdenow's student, [[Alexander von Humboldt]], used physiognomy to describe vegetation types and observed that the distribution vegetation types was based on environmental factors. Later plant geographers who built upon Humboldt's work included [[Joakim Frederik Schouw]], [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|A.P. de Candolle]], [[August Grisebach]] and [[Anton Kerner von Marilaun]]. Schouw's work, published in 1822, linked plant distributions to environmental factors (especially temperature) and established the practice of naming [[association (ecology)|plant associations]] by adding the suffix ''-etum'' to the name of the dominant species. Working from [[herbarium]] collections, De Candolle searched for general rules of plant distribution and settled on using temperature as well.&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–16}} Grisebach's two-volume work, ''Die Vegetation der Erde nach Ihrer Klimatischen Anordnung'', published in 1872, saw plant geography reach its "ultimate form" as a descriptive field.&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Starting in the 1870s, Swiss botanist [[Simon Schwendener]], together with his students and colleagues, established the link between [[plant morphology]] and [[plant physiology|physiological]] adaptations, laying the groundwork for the first ecology textbooks, [[Eugenius Warming]]'s ''[[Plantesamfund]]'' (published in 1895) and [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]]'s 1898 ''Pflanzengeographie auf Physiologischer Grundlage''.&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"/&gt; Warming successfully incorporated plant morphology, physiology [[plant taxonomy|taxonomy]] and [[biogeography]] into plant geography to create the field of plant ecology. Although more morphological than physiological, Schimper's has been considered the beginning of plant physiological ecology.&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Plant ecology was initially built around static ideas of [[Species distribution|plant distribution]]; incorporating the concept of [[Ecological succession|succession]] added an element to change through time to the field. [[Henry Chandler Cowles]]' studies of plant succession on the [[Lake Michigan]] [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|sand dunes]] (published in 1899) and [[Frederic Clements]]' 1916 monograph on the subject established it as a key element of plant ecology.&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"/&gt;

Plant ecology developed within the wider discipline of ecology over the twentieth century. Inspired by Warming's ''Plantesamfund'', [[Arthur Tansley]] set out to map British [[plant community|plant communities]]. In 1904 he teamed up with [[William Gardner Smith (botanist)|William Gardner Smith]] and others involved in vegetation mapping to establish the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, later shortened to British Vegetation Committee. In 1913, the British Vegetation Committee organised the [[British Ecological Society]] (BES), the first professional society of ecologists.&lt;ref name = "Cooper"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = W.

Cowles' students played an important role in the development of the field of plant ecology during the first half of the twentieth century, among them [[William Skinner Cooper|William S. Cooper]], [[Emma Lucy Braun|E. Lucy Braun]] and [[Edgar Transeau]].&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Distribution==
{{Main|Phytogeography|Species distribution}}
[[File:Biomes.jpg|thumb|500px|right|World biomes are based upon the type of dominant plant.]]

Plant distributions is governed by a combination of historical factors, [[ecophysiology]] and [[biological interaction|biotic interactions]]. The set of species that can be present at a given site is limited by historical contingency. In order to show up, a species must either have evolved in an area or [[biological dispersal|dispersed]] there (either naturally or [[introduced species|through human agency]]), and must not have gone locally extinct. The set of species present locally is further limited to those that possess the [[plant physiology|physiological adaptations]] to survive the environmental conditions that exist. This group is further shaped through interactions with other species.&lt;ref name="Lambers2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambers|first=Hans|author2=F. Stuart Chapin III|author3=Thijs L. Pons|title=Plant Physiological Ecology|year=2008|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Plant communities are broadly distributed into [[biomes]] based on the form of the dominant plant species. For example, grasslands are dominated by grasses, while forests are dominated by trees. Biomes are determined by regional [[climates]], mostly temperature and precipitation, and follow general latitudinal trends. Within biomes, there may be many [[ecological communities]], which are impacted not only by climate and a variety of smaller-scale features, including [[soils]], [[hydrology]], and [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance regime]]. Biomes also change with elevation, high elevations often resembling those found at higher latitudes.

==Biological interactions==
{{Main|Biological interaction}}

===Competition===
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}

Plants, like most life forms, require relatively few basic elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur; hence they are known as CHNOPS life forms. There are also lesser elements needed as well, frequently termed micronutrients, such as magnesium and sodium. When plants grow in close proximity, they may deplete supplies of these elements and have a negative impact upon neighbours. Competition for resources vary from [[size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to [[size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely [[size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities.In many cases (perhaps most) the negative effects upon neighbours arise from size asymmetric competition for light. In other cases, there may be competition below ground for water, nitrogen, or phosphorus. To detect and measure competition, experiments are necessary; these experiments require removing neighbours, and measuring responses in the remaining plants.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Competition|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0-7923-6064-8|pages=552}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such studies are required before useful generalizations can be drawn.

Overall, it appears that light is the most important resource for which plants compete, and the increase in plant height over evolutionary time likely reflects selection for taller plants to better intercept light. Many plant communities are therefore organized into hierarchies based upon the relative competitive abilities for light.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2001" /&gt;  In some systems, particularly infertile or arid systems, below ground competition may be more significant.&lt;ref&gt;Capser, Brenda B. and Robert. B. Jackson. 1997. Plant competition underground. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 28: 545–570.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along natural gradients of soil fertility, it is likely that the ratio of above ground to below ground competition changes, with higher above ground competition in the more fertile soils.&lt;ref&gt;Belcher, J., P.A. Keddy, and L. Twolan-Strutt. 1995. Root and shoot competition along a soil depth gradient. Journal of Ecology 83: 673–682&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twolan-Strutt, L. and P.A. Keddy. 1996. Above- and below-ground competition intensity in two contrasting wetland plant communities. Ecology 77: 259–270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants that are relatively weak competitors may escape in time (by surviving as buried seeds) or in space (by dispsersing to a new location away from strong competitors.)

In principle, it is possible to examine competition at the level of the limiting resources if a detailed knowledge of the physiological processes of the competing plants is available. However, in most terrestrial ecological studies, there is only little information on the uptake and dynamics of the resources that limit the growth of different plant species, and, instead, competition is inferred from observed negative effects of neighbouring plants without knowing precisely which resources the plants were competing for.  In certain situations, plants may compete for a single growth-limiting resource, perhaps for light in agricultural systems with sufficient water and nutrients, or in dense stands of marsh vegetation, but in many natural [[ecosystem]]s plants may be colimited by several resources, e.g. [[light]], [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Craine|first= J. M.|year= 2009|title= Resource strategies in wild plants|publisher= Princeton University Press, Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, there are many details that remain to be uncovered, particularly the kinds of competition that arise in natural plant communities, the specific resource(s), the relative importance of different resources, and the role of other factors like stress or disturbance in regulating the importance of competition.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J. P. 1979. Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes. Chichester: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutualism===
{{Main|Mutualism (biology)}}

Mutualism is defined as an interaction "between two species or individuals that is beneficial to both".  Probably the most widespread example in plants is the mutual beneficial relationship between plants and fungi, known as [[mycorrhiza]]e.  The plant is assisted with nutrient uptake, while the fungus receives carbohydrates. Some the earliest known fossil plants even have fossil mycorrhizae on their rhizomes.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"/&gt;

The flowering plants are a group that have evolved by using two major mutualisms.  First, flowers are pollinated by insects.  This relationship seems to have its origins in beetles feeding on primitive flowers, eating pollen and also acting (unwittingly) as pollinators. Second, fruits are eaten by animals, and the animals then disperse the seeds.   Thus, the flowering plants actually have three major types of mutualism, since most higher plants also have mycorrhizae.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"/&gt;

Plants may also have beneficial effects upon one another, but this is less common.  Examples might include "nurse plants" whose shade allows young cacti to establish. Most examples of mutualism, however, are largely beneficial to only one of the partners, and may not really be true mutualism. The term used for these more one-sided relationships, which are mostly beneficial to one participant, is facilitation. Facilitation among neighboring plants may act by reducing the negative impacts of a stressful environment.&lt;ref name="Callaway95"&gt;Callaway, R. M. 1995. Positive interactions among plants (Interpreting botanical progress). The Botanical Review 61: 306–349.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, facilitation is more likely to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition may be the most important interaction among species.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, Paul A., ''Competition'', 2nd ed. (2001), Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commensalism]] is similar to facilitation, in that one plant is mostly exploiting another. A familiar example is the ephiphytes which grow on branches of tropical trees, or even mosses which grow on trees in [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]].

It is important to keep track of the benefits received by each species to determine the appropriate term. Although people are often fascinated by unusual examples, it is important to remember that in plants, the main mutualisms are mycorrhizae, pollination, and seed dispersal.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"/&gt;

===Herbivory===
{{Main|Herbivory|Plant defense against herbivory}}
[[File:Grazing exclosure Abisko.jpg|alt=Reindeer in front of herbivore exclosures. The vegetation is higher within the fences than outside, showing herbivory pressure. The vegetation is higher within the second fence that excludes both large and smaller herbivores (rodents) underlining the pressure brought by different herbivores.|thumb|Reindeer in front of herbivore exclosures. Excluding different herbivores (here reindeer, or reindeer and rodents) has different effects on the vegetation.]]
An important ecological function of [[plant]]s is that they [[Primary production|produce]] [[organic compound]]s for [[herbivore]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDo8hLWtWzgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=plant+ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hNeWT-X8BOfJiQLW0LHhCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=herbivory&amp;f=false | title=Plant Ecology –  (Section 1.10.1: Herbivory) | publisher=Springer | year=2005 | accessdate=April 24, 2012 | author=Schulze, Ernst-Detlef|display-authors=etal}} {{ISBN|3-540-20833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the bottom of the [[food web]]. A large number of plant traits, from thorns to chemical defenses, can be related to the intensity of herbivory. Large herbivores can also have many effects on vegetation. These include removing selected species, creating gaps for regeneration of new individuals, recycling nutrients, and dispersing seeds.  Certain ecosystem types, such as grasslands, may be dominated by the effects of large herbivores, although fire is also an equally important factor in this biome.  In few cases, herbivores are capable of nearly removing all the vegetation at a site (for example, geese in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada, and nutria in the marshes of Louisiana&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., ''Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation'', 2nd ed. (2010), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapt. 6. Herbivory.&lt;/ref&gt;) but normally herbivores have a more selective impact, particularly when large predators control the abundance of herbivores. The usual method of studying the effects of herbivores is to build exclosures, where they cannot feed, and compare the plant communities in the exclosures to those outside over many years. Often such long term experiments show that herbivores have a significant effect upon the species that make up the plant community.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;

==Other topics==

===Abundance===
{{Main|Abundance (ecology)}}

The ecological success of a plant species in a specific environment may be quantified by its [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]], and depending on the life form of the plant different measures of abundance may be relevant, e.g. density, [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], or [[plant cover]].

The change in the abundance of a plant species may be due to both [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors, e.g. [[climate change]], or [[Biotic component|biotic]] factors, e.g. [[herbivory]] or [[interspecific competition]].

===Colonisation and local extinction===
{{Main|Biogeography}}{{See also|Colonisation (biology)|Biological dispersal|Seed dispersal|Local extinction|Soil seed bank}}

Whether a plant species is present at a local area depends on the processes of [[Colonisation (biology)|colonisation]] and [[local extinction]]. The probability of colonisation decreases with distance to neighboring [[habitat]]s where the species is present and increases with plant abundance and [[fecundity]] in neighboring [[habitat]]s and the [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] distance of the species. The probability of local extinction decreases with abundance (both living plants and seeds in the [[soil seed bank]]).

'''Plant floor communications''' refers to the control and data communications typically found in automation environments, on a manufacturing plant floor or process plant.  The difference between manufacturing and process is typically the types of control involved, [[Discrete manufacturing|discrete control]] or continuous control (aka [[process control]]).  Many plants offer a hybrid of both discrete and continuous control.  The underlying commonality between them all is that the automation systems are often an integration of multi-vendor products to form one system.  Each vendor product typically offers communication capability for programming, maintaining and collecting data from their products.  A properly orchestrated plant floor environment will likely include a variety of [[Automation protocols|communications]], some for machine to machine (M2M) communications – to facilitate efficient primary control over the process and some for Machine to Enterprise (M2E) communications – to facilitate connectivity with Business Systems that provide overall reporting, scheduling and inventory management functions.

==Machine to machine (M2M) communications==
Automation controllers typically offer communication modules to enable them to support a variety of [[Automation protocols|industrial protocols]], to facilitate [[machine to machine]] communications.  These modules are often special designed for the protocol.  A new class of module, the [[universal gateway]], is becoming more prevalent as it offers the ability for an automation controller to communicate over one or more protocols simultaneously, and can be reconfigured for additional protocols without a module change.

==Machine to enterprise (M2E) communications==
Few automation controllers offer direct connectivity to business systems such as MES and ERP systems.  Overall integration of automation controllers to business systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator|system integrators]], able to bring their unique knowledge on process, equipment and vendor solutions.

==Integration==
Integration is typically managed through one of three mechanisms:

'''Direct Integration''' – Business systems include connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering.  This requires the business system developers to offer specific support for the variety of plant floor equipment that they want to interface with.  Business system vendors must be expert in their own products, and connectivity to other vendor products, often those offered by competitors.

'''[[Relational database|Relational Database]] (RDB) Integration''' – Business systems connect to plant floor data sources through a Relational Database Staging Table.  Plant floor systems will deposit the necessary information into a Relational Data Base.  The business system will remove and use the information from the RDB Table.  The benefit of RDB Staging is that business system vendors do not need to get involved in the complexities of plant floor equipment integration.  Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the [[Systems integrator|system integrator]].

'''EATM ([[Eatm|Enterprise Transaction Modules]])''' – These devices have the ability to communicate directly with plant floor equipment and will transact data with the business system in methods best supported by the business system.  Again, this can be through a staging table, Web Services, or through system specific business system [[Api|APIs]].  The benefit of an EATM is that it offers a complete, off the shelf solution, minimizing long term costs and customization.

'''Custom Integrated Solutions''' – Many system integrators designs offer custom crafted solutions, created on a per instance basis to meet site and system requirements.  There are a wide variety of [[List of automation protocols|communications drivers]] available for plant floor equipment and there are separate products that have the ability to log data to relational database tables.  Standards exist within the industry to support interoperability between software products, the most widely known being OPC, managed by the [[OPC Foundation]].  Custom Integrated Solutions typically run on workstation or server class computers.  These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term cost in terms on maintenance and reliability.  Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">In a [[computer network|network]] based on [[packet switching]], '''processing delay''' is the time it takes [[Router (computing)|routers]] to process the [[packet header]]. Processing delay is a key component in [[network delay]].

During processing of a packet, routers may check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred during transmission as well as determining where the packet's next destination is. Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less. After this nodal processing, the router directs the packet to the queue where further delay can happen ([[queuing delay]]).

In the past, the processing delay has been ignored as insignificant compared to the other forms of network delay. However, in some systems, the processing delay can be quite large especially where routers are performing complex encryption algorithms and examining or modifying packet content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/wolf/pubs/globecom2004.pdf Ramaswamy Ramaswamy, Ning Weng and Tilman Wolf, ''Characterizing Network Processing Delay'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep packet inspection]] done by some networks examine packet content for security, legal, or other reasons, which can cause very large delay and thus is only done at selected inspection points. Routers performing [[network address translation]] also have higher than normal processing delay because those routers need to examine and modify both incoming and outgoing packets.

A '''reading disability''' is a condition in which a sufferer displays difficulty reading. Examples of reading disabilities include: [[Dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]], [[Alexia (acquired dyslexia)]], and [[Hyperlexia]] (word-reading ability well above normal for age and IQ).

==Definition==
[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] defines reading disability or dyslexia as follows: "Dyslexia is a brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding. In adults, dyslexia usually occurs after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia." &lt;ref&gt;{{NINDS|dyslexia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NINDS definition is not in keeping with the bulk of scientific studies that conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that dyslexia and intelligence are related. The Rose Review 2009&lt;ref name="Identifying and Teaching Children and Young People with Dyslexia and Literacy Difficulties"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=James|title=Sir|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/14790/7/00659-2009DOM-EN_Redacted.pdf|website=Institute of Education|publisher=United Kingdom Government|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definition is more in keeping with modern research and debunked discrepancy model of dyslexia diagnosis:&lt;ref name="Discrepancy Definitions of Reading Disability: Has Intelligence Led Us Astray?"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanovich|first1=K|title=
Discrepancy Definitions of Reading Disability: Has Intelligence Led Us Astray? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly|date=Winter 1991|volume=26|issue=1|pages=7–29|jstor=747729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling.
*Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed.
*Dyslexia occurs across the range of intellectual abilities.
*It is best thought of as a continuum, not a distinct category, and there are no clear cut-off points.
*Co-occurring difficulties may be seen in aspects of language, motor co-ordination, mental calculation, concentration and personal organisation, but these are not, by themselves, markers of dyslexia.
*A good indication of the severity and persistence of dyslexic difficulties can be gained by examining how the individual responds or has responded to well founded intervention.

==Reading disabilities==

===Dyslexia===
{{Main article|Dyslexia}}
Dyslexia is a [[learning disability]] that manifests itself as a difficulty with word decoding and/or reading fluency. Comprehension may be affected as a result of difficulties with decoding, but is not a primary feature of dyslexia. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate [[reading instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stanovich KE |title=Explaining the differences between the dyslexic and the garden-variety poor reader: the phonological-core variable-difference model |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=590–604 |date=December 1988 |pmid=2465364 |doi=10.1177/002221948802101003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that dyslexia affects between 5–17% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCandliss BD, Noble KG |title=The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=196–204 |year=2003 |pmid=12953299 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10080 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Czepita2006 &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Czepita D, Lodygowska E |title=[Role of the organ of vision in the course of developmental dyslexia] |language=Polish |journal=Klin Oczna |volume=108 |issue=1–3 |pages=110–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16883955 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birsh2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Research and reading disability |editor=Judith R.

==Islamic exclusivism==
{{Further|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}

[[Muslim]]s believe that [[Islam]] is the original and primordial faith, or [[fitrah]], that was revealed by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopædia Britannica "Islam"  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam] Accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims maintain that [[Prophets in Islam|previous messages and revelations]] have been [[Tahrif|partially changed or corrupted]] over time&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;Accad (2003): According to Ibn Taymiya, although only some Muslims accept the textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of most of it.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the [[Quran]] to be the unaltered and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|final revelation]] from Allah. Religious concepts and practices include the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of Islam]], which are basic concepts and obligatory acts of worship, and following [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, encompassing everything from [[Islamic banking|banking]] and [[zakāt|welfare]], to [[Islamic military jurisprudence|warfare]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.111, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam began its history with an exclusivist attitude toward [[polytheist]] religions, but an inclusivist attitude toward monotheists, including Christians and Jews. Believers in the oneness of God were given the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'', conferring on them certain rights, including the right to practice their religions openly and not to be pressured to accept [[Islam]]. 

In practice, however, neither the inclusion of Jews and Christians nor militant exclusivism toward "pagans" was always practiced. Trinitarian Christians were accused of [[idolatry]] because of their veneration of [[icon]]s and were also sometimes treated as polytheists because of the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. As strict monotheists, Jews generally fared better than Christians under Islamic rule. Jews and Christians are viewed largely favorably as compared to any other religion.

The basic attitude of Islam toward other religions remains unchanged today, and certain Islamic nations, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], are more exclusivistic toward other religions than are others, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]].

Islam does accept sincere [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]] as [[People of the Book|people "of the Book"]] along with [[Muslim]]s.

==Judaism==

Although most Jews are pluralist or inclusivist some [[Jews]] believe that the [[God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]] is the [[Monotheism|one true God]]. The Jews believe the God of Abraham entered into a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the ancient [[Israelites]], marking them as his [[Jews as the chosen people|Chosen People]], giving them a mission to spread the concept of monotheism. Jews do not consider their chosenness to be a mark of superiority to other nations, but a responsibility to be an example of behavior for other nations to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/a/jewsaschosenpeople.htm "What Does It Mean For Jews to Be the Chosen People?" Pelaia, Ariela.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhist religious exclusivism may be seen in the implication that those who do not accept the teachings of the Buddha, such as the [[Eightfold Path]], are destined to repeat the cycle of suffering through endless reincarnations; while those who practice the true way can reach enlightenment. Neo-Buddhist groups sometimes consider their tradition the true path to enlightenment and engage in strong evangelical efforts to influence those they consider to be in darkness. Several sects associated with{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may be included in this category.

However, many followers of [[Eastern religion]]s are not exclusivist. For example, there are millions of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who would also consider themselves to follow [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7154|title=Testing Stark's Thesis:Is Mormonism the First New World Religion since Islam?|author=Gerald R.

'''Satirical ostraca''' are a category of [[Ostracon|ostraca]], (singular: an ''ostracon''), that represent the real world in unrealistic, impossible situations&amp;ndash;a [[satire]]. The common example portrayed which helped create this categorization, are [[animal]]s which take reversed roles, for example a ''vertically&amp;ndash;walking cat, with ducks on the end of [[leash]]es.'' The same role reversals can be seen on [[Satirical papyri]]. This concept is a prevalent feature in absurdist literature, such as in the works of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15195">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''sequence learning''' is inherent to human ability because it is an integrated part of conscious and nonconscious learning as well as activities. Sequences of information or sequences of actions are used in various everyday tasks: "from sequencing sounds in speech, to sequencing movements in typing or playing instruments, to sequencing actions in driving an automobile."&lt;ref name="Clegg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Benjamin A|author2=DiGirolamo, Gregory J |author3=Keele, Steven W |title=Sequence learning|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=August 1998|volume=2|issue=8|pages=275&amp;ndash;81|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01202-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence learning can be used to study skill acquisition and in studies of various groups ranging from neuropsychological patients to infants.&lt;ref name="Clegg" /&gt; According to Ritter and Nerb, “The order in which material is presented can strongly influence what is learned, how fast performance increases, and sometimes even whether the material is learned at all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Frank E. Ritter|title=In order to learn: how the sequence of topics influences learning|series=Oxford series on cognitive models and architectures|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford/New York|isbn=978-0-19-517884-5|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence learning, more known and understood as a form of explicit learning, is now also being studied as a form of [[implicit learning]] as well as other forms of learning. Sequence learning can also be referred to as sequential behavior, behavior sequencing, and serial order in behavior.

==History==
In the first half of the 20th century, [[Margaret Floy Washburn]], [[John B. Watson]], and other [[behaviorists]] believed behavioral sequencing to be governed by the reflex chain, which states that stimulation caused by an initial movement triggers an additional movement, which triggers another additional movement, and so on. In 1951, [[Karl Lashley]], a [[neurophysiologist]] at [[Harvard University]], published “The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior,” addressing the current beliefs about sequence learning and introducing his hypothesis. He criticized the previous view on the basis of six lines of evidence: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first line is that movements can occur even when [[sensory feedback]] is interrupted. The second is that some movement sequences occur too quickly for elements of the sequences to be triggered by feedback from the preceding elements. Next is that the errors in behavior suggest internal plans for what will be done later. Also, the time to initiate a movement sequence can increase with the length or complexity of the sequence. The next line is the properties of movements occurring early in a sequence can anticipate later features. Then lastly the neural activity can indicate preparation of upcoming behavior events, including upcoming behavior events in the relatively long-term future.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=David|author2=Rajal G. Cohen |author3=Steven A. Jax |author4=Daniel J. Weiss |author5=Robrecht van der Wel |title=The problem of serial order in behavior: Lashley’s legacy|journal=Human Movement Science|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=525&amp;ndash;54|doi=10.1016/j.humov.2007.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lashley argued that sequence learning, or behavioral sequencing or serial order in behavior, is not attributable to sensory feedback. Rather, he proposed that there are plans for behavior since the nervous system prepares for some behaviors but not others. He said that there was a [[hierarchical organization]] of plans. He came up with several lines of evidence. The first of these is that the context changes functional interpretations of the same behaviors, such as the way “wright, right, right, rite, and write” are interpreted based on the context of the sentence. “Right” can be interpreted as a direction or as something good depending on the context. A second line of evidence says that errors are involved in human behavior as hierarchical organization. In addition, “hierarchical organization of plans comes from the timing of behavioral sequences.” The larger the phrase, the longer the response time, which factors into “decoding” or “unpacking” hierarchical plans. Additional evidence is how easy or hard it is to learn a sequence. The mind can create a “memory for what is about to happen” as well as a “memory for what has happened.” The final evidence for the hierarchical organization of plans is characterized by [[chunking (psychology)|"chunking"]]. This skill combines multiple units into larger units.&lt;ref name= "Rosenbaum" /&gt;

==Types of sequence learning==
There are two broad categories of sequence learning&amp;mdash;explicit and implicit&amp;mdash;with subcategories. Explicit sequence learning has been known and studied since the discovery of sequence learning. However, recently, implicit sequence learning has gained more attention and research. A form of [[implicit learning]], implicit sequence learning refers to the underlying methods of learning that people are unaware of&amp;mdash;in other words, learning without knowing. The exact properties and number of mechanisms of implicit learning are debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Hsiang-Ling Jennifer|title=Implicit sequence learning: One or two learning mechanisms?|type=MA thesis|year=1994|publisher=University of Missouri|location=Columbia, Missouri|oclc=	36106139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of implicit sequence learning include motor sequence learning, temporal sequence learning, and [[Associative Sequence Learning|associative sequence learning]].

==Sequence learning problems==
Sequence learning problems are used to better understand the different types of sequence learning. There are four basic sequence learning problems: sequence prediction, sequence generation, sequence recognition, and sequential decision making. These “problems” show how sequences are formulated. They show the patterns sequences follow and how these different sequence learning problems are related to each other.

Sequence prediction attempts to predict the next immediate element of a sequence based on all the preceding elements. Sequence generation is basically the same as sequence prediction: an attempt to piece together a sequence one by one the way it naturally occurs. Sequence recognition takes certain criteria and determines whether the sequence is legitimate. Sequential decision making or sequence generation through actions breaks down into three variations: goal-oriented, trajectory-oriented, and reinforcement-maximizing. These three variations all want to pick the action(s) or step(s) that will lead to the goal in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sun|first=Ron|title=Introduction to Sequence Learning|url=http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~rsun/sun.seq-intro.ps|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sequence learning problems reflect hierarchical organization of plans because each element in the sequences builds on the previous elements.

In a classic experiment published in 1967, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]] demonstrated that though subjects viewing portraits reported apprehending the portrait as a whole, their eye movements successively fixated on the most informative parts of the image. These observations suggest that underlying an apparently parallel process of face perception, a serial [[oculomotor]] process is concealed.&lt;ref&gt;Yarbus, Alfred L., "Eye movements during perception of complex objects", Yarbus, Alfred L., tr. Basil Haigh, ed. Lorrin A. Riggs, ''Eye Movements and Vision'', New York: Plenum, 1967, OCLC 220267263, ch. 7, pp. 171&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common observation that when a [[skill]] is being acquired, we are more attentive in the initial phase, but after repeated practice, the skill becomes nearly automatic;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, P. M., "Perceptual motor skill learning", in Arthur W. Melton (ed.), ''Categories of Human Learning'', New York: Academic Press, 1964, OCLC 180195, pp. 243&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; this is also known as [[unconscious competence]]. We can then concentrate on learning a new action while performing previously learned actions skillfully. Thus, it appears that a neural code or representation for the learned skill is created in our brain, which is usually called [[procedural memory]]. The procedural memory encodes procedures or algorithms rather than facts.

==Ongoing research==
There are many other areas of application for sequence learning. How humans learn sequential procedures has been a long-standing research problem in [[cognitive science]] and currently is a major topic in [[neuroscience]]. Research work has been going on in several disciplines, including [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Ron|author2=C.

'''Tadhkirat al-Fuqahā''' (Memorandum for Jurists) is a book on Shiite jurisprudence written by Allameh [[Al-Hilli]]. The book is counted as one of the greatest reasonable books on [[Shiite]] jurisprudence.

==Introduction==
The book of Tadhkirat al-Fuqahā counted as one of the greatest reasonably comparative books on Shiite jurisprudence or [[fiqh]]. The book is also referred to by other scholars as a confident reference. Allameh Hilli mainly points to opinions and ideas of Shaykh Tousi rather that of other Shiite Scholars.

==Motive==
The book has written by the request of Allameh [[Al-Hilli]]' s son namely Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin(Died.767 lunar)

==Style==
Allameh [[Al-Hilli]] says about his aim that he intent to express and explain the summaries of indult (Fatwa) of the jurist and rules of Scholars (Ulama) according to best explanation, the most correctness way, the most rightness style and the most confident methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef| title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher= Ale bayt|language=Arabic| place= Qom|date=1414 lunar|volume=1| page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The author divided the book into four rules such as: on prayings, on transactions, on unilateral obligation, on judgments. The book is divided to fifteen sections; some of them are as follow:
* The book of purity
* The books of Alms and fasting
* The book of safekeeping
* The book of buying either pecuniary or credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef| title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher= Ale bayt| language=Arabic|  place= Qom|date=1414 lunar|volume=1| pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
The book has many characters. Some of them are as follows:
* Refer to consensus (Ijma) as Jomhourat Al Ulama or most of the religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=64–115 &amp; 36–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Documentation through Imam's narrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=71–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rejecting of juridical principles such as Istehsan and Qiyyas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale Bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=165–173 &amp; 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* using of public recourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarize==
The book has summarized by Ibn Motawwej Bahrani, one of the great pupils of Allameh Hilli, in a book by the title of "Mokhtasar Al Tadhkrah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terani|first=Aqa Bozorg|title=Zariah Fi Tasanif Al Shiah|publisher=Dar Al Azwa|place=Beyrout|language=Arabic|date=1403|volume=4|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The book has published many times in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]]. The book until now published in twelve volumes. Also some part of Al Tadhkerah has published by Allameh Mozaffar and sayyed Mortaza Khalkhali in [[Najaf]].

The '''Theology Institute of Azerbaijan''' is a [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] higher education institution specializing in theology. It operates under the direction of the [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] ({{Lang-az|Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dini Qurumlarla İş üzrə Dövlət Komitəsinin tabeliyində Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutu}}). The rector of the University is Jeyhun Mammadov.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azernews.az/nation/137676.html|title=Opening ceremony of Azerbaijan Institute of Theology held in Baku|last=|first=|date=2018-09-17|work=AzerNews.az|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, three departments and one faculty comprise the institution. Education is carried out in Azerbaijani.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Azerbaycan_Ilahiyyat_Institutunun_achilisi_olub-1195028|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun açılışı olub|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute was developed under the auspices of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan. A decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan|President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated 9 February 2018 authorized its creation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/27001|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun yaradılması haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree ensured inclusion of the faculty of Theology of the [[Baku State University]] in the Institute of Theology.

The opening ceremony took place on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Logo ==
The Institute announced a contest on 26 July 2018 to organize its logo. For this purpose, a commission was created, consisting of:

* Yagut Aliyeva, the Director of the Public Relations Department of the State Committee for Religious Organizations
* Eldar Mikayilzade, the People's Artist of Azerbaijan
* Zaur Orujov, the scientific worker of the [[Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan]]
* Kevser Tagiyev, the teacher of the Azerbaijan Institute of Theology

106 different logos were presented. On 8 August the submission of Konul Mammadzadeh was chosen. According to the unanimous opinion of the commission, the logo reflected the purpose and mission of the Institute. Specifically, the human symbol whose hands are turned toward the sky reflects how multiculturalism and tolerance communicate with God, the book represents the main source of knowledge, and the olive branch expresses peace and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.az/din/i-lahiyyat-i-nstitutunun-loqosu-mueyyenlesib/|title=İlahiyyat İnstitutunun loqosu müəyyənləşib|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the institute is to ensure the preservation and development of the religious and spiritual environment, based on the historical traditions of the Azerbaijani people. Philosophy, sociology, psychology, multiculturalism, informatics and other social and humanitarian sciences are to be taught along with religious sciences. 35 places for Islamic studies and 25 places for Religious studies were approved for the academic year 2018-2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan has allocated a scholarship named after [[Heydar Aliyev]] for one student. The Caucasian Muslim Office allocated a monthly scholarship to one student.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Administration ==
Jeyhun Mammadov was appointed as the rector of the institute on May 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/28878|title=C.V.Məmmədovun Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun rektoru təyin edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Prorector]] of the Institute was appointed on 13 September 2018. Professor Mubariz Jamalov was appointed Prorector on educational work, while Agil Shirinov was appointed Prorector for Science and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scwra.gov.az/vnews/5422/|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutuna prorektorlar təyin edilib|last=Prorectors have been appointed to Institute of Theology|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7948">'''Tussock grasses''' or '''bunch grasses''' are a group of grass species in the [[Poaceae]] family.  They usually grow as singular plants in clumps, tufts, hummocks, or bunches, rather than forming a [[sod]] or [[lawn]], in [[meadow]]s, [[grassland]]s, and prairies. As [[perennial plant]]s, most species live more than one season.  Tussock grasses are often found as [[forage]] in [[pasture]]s and [[ornamental grass]]es in gardens.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crampton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

Many species have long roots that may reach {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} or more into the soil, which can aid slope stabilization, erosion control, and [[Characterisation of pore space in soil|soil porosity]] for precipitation absorption. Also, their roots can reach moisture more deeply than other grasses and annual plants during seasonal or climatic droughts. The plants provide [[habitat]] and food for insects (including [[Lepidoptera]]), birds, small animals and larger [[herbivore]]s, and support beneficial soil [[mycorrhiza]]. The leaves supply material, such as for [[basket weaving]], for [[indigenous peoples]] and [[contemporary art]]ists.

Tussock and bunch grasses occur in almost any habitat where other grasses are found, including: [[grasslands]], [[savannas]] and [[prairie]]s, [[wetlands]] and [[estuary|estuaries]], [[riparian zone]]s, [[shrubland]]s and [[scrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[forest]]s, [[montane]] and [[alpine climate|alpine]] zones, [[tundra]] and [[dune]]s, and [[deserts]].

==Fire resistance==
In western North American [[wildfire]]s, bunch grasses tend to smolder and not ignite into flames, unlike [[invasive species]] of [[Invasive grasses of North America|annual grasses]] that contribute to a fire's spreading.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth and Kauffman"/&gt;

'''Verreville Glassworks''' was established on the north bank of the [[River Clyde]] in the village of [[Finnieston]] in 1777. Glass making was discontinued in 1842. The buildings of the works, including the 120 feet high glasshouse cone, were converted into a pottery works which remained in production until 1918.
[[File:Fig1.Verreville.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of site under excavation. The River Clyde can be seen in the background. This area was the centre of major industry in Glasgow in the 19th and early 20th century.]]

In addition to a rich historical and documentary archive, evidence for the operations and technology of these industries was gained from excavations in 2005. The [[industrial archaeology|archaeological excavation]], carried out by [[Headland Archaeology]] uncovered several buildings and structures relating to both the glass and the pottery works.

==Historical background==

The Verreville Glassworks was established by a group of Glasgow merchants in 1777. Workmen were brought from England and Germany to build the cone, a major Glasgow landmark of its day, which reached a height of 120 feet. The company amalgamated with the Glasgow Bottlework Company in c. 1786 and in 1806 the business was sold to the Dumbarton Glass Company. The new business was immediately sold to John Geddes, on the condition that he did not make window glass or bottles.

John Geddes founded the '''‘Glasgow and Verreville Glass and Pottery Company’''', which quickly established itself and developed an export trade to North America and Ireland. However, pottery production was a very competitive market and Geddes was soon declared bankrupt. In 1830 the pottery was taken over by Robert Montgomery, a former manager. Montgomery’s involvement with the pottery was short-lived and by 1833 he too was declared bankrupt. The glassworks were closed in 1834.

The glassworks and John Geddes’ house and grounds (Verreville House) were bought by Robert Alexander Kidston who was a partner in the nearby Anderston Pottery (often called Lancefield Pottery). By this time the pottery had two earthenware kilns and one china kiln. Kidston tried to raise the quality of the products - he added the production of porcelain, imported Staffordshire workers and extended the works into the grounds of Verreville House – but by 1841 he himself was in financial trouble and the firm was taken over by a consortium, one of whom was Robert Cochran, whose family later owned the much larger Britannia Pottery in Glasgow. Glassmaking appears to have ceased production in 1842 and a number of small pottery kilns were built inside the original glassworks cone. Only white and earthenwares were being made by this time. The Cochran family remained in charge of the pottery until its eventual closure in 1918.

==Archaeological Excavations==
The [[Headland Archaeology|Headland excavations]] in 2005 revealed several features related to three major phases of development: glass manufacturing activity (c. 1777 – mid-1840s), pottery manufacturing phase (late 1840s – c. 1859) and the later pottery works (after c. 1859 – c. 1918).

===Glass Manufacturing Activity===
;The Glassworking Cone

The earliest phase of activity identified on site was associated with the [[glass production|production of glass]].  Evidence for the glass cone structure was identified by four evenly spaced brick built piers. These were constructed of hand made red bricks and formed a half circle in plan. It is probable that this is the remains of the northern half of the original octagonal glass cone structure built in 1777. These piers possibly supported an arcaded external wall, allowing access to the interior of the glass cone.
[[File:Fig8.Verreville.jpg|thumb|right|A vaulted tunnel or flue associated with the production of glass]]
[[File:Fig7.Verreville.jpg|thumb|left|Structures of the glass working buildings. The brick piers in the background are the remains of the northern half of the original glass cone structure.]]
Leading into the central area of the ‘glass cone’ was a series of [[flue]]s. The largest was constructed of hand made red brick with a vaulted ceiling. The interior of the brick was blackened by soot and the floor was blackened natural sand, which contained a large quaintly of broken glass or [[cullet]]. These flues would have pulled cold air into a central (unidentified) glass [[furnace]], obliterated by the post-1920s buildings.

;The Glassworking Hovel

The sub square building (hovel), which housed the glass cone was only identified by one wall during the excavation. Two lengths of hand made red brick wall, interpreted as the original northern wall of the hovel were excavated. Truncated by later stone pillar bases the fragmentary walls were upstanding to a height of approximately 2&amp;nbsp;m. The western wall fragment had a remains of a double archway – possibly an original entrance into the glass cone.

;The Fritting Floors

Two glass working ‘floor’ structures were identified. The northern structure was constructed of yellow [[refractory]] bricks with single coarse brick walls spaced at regular intervals.  The floor base was vitrified with a thick layer of melted glass covering it. The southern structure appeared to be of a similar construction although was heavily truncated. These structures have been initially interpreted as possible [[frit]]ting (or melting) floors for the primary production of melted glass.

[[File:Fig6.Verreville.jpg|thumb|left|The pottery buildings during excavation]]
[[File:Fig4.Verreville.jpg|thumb|right|The base of a pottery kiln]]

===Pottery Manufacturing Activity===
;Yard Area
A heavily compacted surface of crushed flint covered the eastern area of the site. Several parts of the surface had been repaired by rounded cobbles and obvious areas of wear, including possible cart ruts, were apparent.

[[File:Fig3.Verreville.jpg|thumb|right|The Pottery Drying Room. The brick floor with flues is exposed. Here, pottery was dried before being fired in the kilns.]]
;Pottery Buildings
Five buildings associated with pottery manufacture were identified during the excavation including a pottery drying room, workshops and furnaces.  These all appeared to date from the expansion of the pottery works c. 1820.

;The [[Kiln]]s
Six brick built kilns were identified during the course of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular ash pits, evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, were identified with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the ash pits – to allow easy emptying of the content of the ash pits.

Three kilns were situated within the probable location of the large circular glass cone, built in c. 1777.  Historical reference note that after the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them.

===The Later Pottery works===
During the final 50 years of production existing buildings were adapted to new functions and new technology. [[Steam power]] was by now incorporated within the factory.

The archaeological evidence for the final phase of Verreville Pottery factory offers glimpses into the complex operations of [[pottery]] manufacturing such as processing, constructing, drying and firing of vessels. Clay would arrive into the area via a short gauge rail line in the warehouse. It would then be mixed by paddles in water (blunging), placed into tanks and put into the slip drying room to evaporate off the water. After this the clay would be thrown (wedged) to remove air bubbles and moulded or slip cast before placing into the pot drying room and finally into the kilns for firing.

Archaeological remains included a slip drying oven, a tunnel furnace and a pot drying room as well as evidence for modifications  to the warehouse, courtyard area and workshop and the removal of the rectangular oven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1397">In [[architecture]], '''visibility graph analysis''' ('''VGA''') is a method of analysing the inter-visibility connections within buildings or urban networks.  Visibility graph analysis was developed from the architectural theory of [[space syntax]] by Turner et al. (2001), and is applied through construction of a [[visibility graph]] within the open space of a plan.

Visibility graph analysis uses various measures from the theory of [[small-world network]]s and [[centrality]] in [[network theory]] in order to assess perceptual qualities of space and the possible usage of it.

Visibility graph analysis was firstly implemented in Turner's Depthmap software and is now widely used by both academics and practitioners through the [[open source]] and [[multi-platform]] [https://github.com/varoudis/depthmapX depthmapX] developed by Tasos Varoudis.

In [[gardening]] and [[agronomy|agronomic]] terminology, a '''volunteer''' is a plant that grows on its own, rather than being deliberately planted by a [[farmer]] or [[Gardening|gardener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davey | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1093/aob/mcl244 | title = Crop Ferality and Volunteerism | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 99 | pages = 205–206 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = 2802985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers often grow from [[seed]]s that float in on the [[wind]], are dropped by [[bird]]s, or are inadvertently mixed into [[compost]]. Unlike [[weed]]s, which are unwanted plants, a volunteer may be encouraged by gardeners once it appears, being watered, fertilized, or otherwise cared for. The action of such plants – to sprout or grow in this fashion – may also be described as '''volunteering'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Literature - V|url=https://plantsliteraturelife.tripod.com/v.html|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers that grow from the seeds of specific [[cultivars]] are not reliably identical or similar to their parent, and often differ significantly from it. Such [[open pollinated]] plants, if they show desirable characteristics, may be selected to become new cultivars.

In [[Crop rotation|agricultural rotations]], self-set plants from the previous year's crop may become established as weeds in the current crop. For example, volunteer [[winter wheat]] will germinate to quite high levels in a following [[Brassica napus|oilseed rape]] crop, usually requiring chemical control measures. In agricultural research, high purity of a harvested crop is usually desirable. To achieve this, typically a group of temporary workers will walk the crop rows looking for volunteer plants, or "rogue" plants in an exercise often referred to as "[[roguing]]".
