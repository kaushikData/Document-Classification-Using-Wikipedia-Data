'''Arthur Heulhard''' (May 11, 1849 - January 2, 1920) was a French [[journalist]] and writer, best known as an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].

Heulhard was born in [[Lormes]]. He was the author of ''Le Mensonge Chrétien'', a series of eleven volumes declaring [[Jesus]] had no historical existence. According to Heulhard it was [[Barabbas]] who was [[Crucifixion|crucifixed]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] and Christians actually worship Barabbas under the name Jesus, an imaginary person invented by the early [[Christian Church|Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Goguel|Goguel, Maurice]]. (1926). [https://archive.org/stream/jesusthenazarene008778mbp#page/n35/mode/2up/ ''Jesus The Nazarene: Myth Or History?'']. [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]]. Footnote 41. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171031180829/http://radikalkritik.de/geschichte/paul-louis-couchoud "Paul-Louis Couchoud"]. RadikalKritik. Retrieved 30 October 2017. "A man of erudite erudition, Arthur Heulhard, wrote under the title ''The Christian Lie'' a dozen volumes whose essential thesis is that the one crucified by Pilate is Barabbas."&lt;/ref&gt; Heulhard gained a follower, the French scholar Daniel Massé who supported his thesis and authored a book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul-Louis Couchoud|Couchoud, P. L]]; Stahl, R. (1927). ''Jesus Barabbas''. ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' 25: 26–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Fourchette Harmonique Club of Bibliophiles and wrote for the ''L'art Musical and La France Chorale''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Katharine. (2005). ''Interpreting the Musical Past : Early Music in Nineteenth-Century France: Early Music in Nineteenth-Century France''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 259. {{ISBN|978-0-19-536585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aushev served as Deputy Prime Minister under former Ingush President [[Murat Zyazikov]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=|last= |title= Another Killing in Region Bordering Chechnya |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/world/europe/14ingushetia.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |agency= [[Associated Press]] |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 10 June 2009 |accessdate= 22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zyazikov was a former Soviet [[K.G.B.]] agent, who was unpopular in Ingushetia because of repressive policies in the small Russian republic.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Aushev had been responsible for Ingustetia's [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies under Zyazikov while in office.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Aushev resigned from office in October 2008, when Murat Zyazikov was removed from office by the Russian government and replaced by [[Yunus-bek Yevkurov]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He reportedly did not work from October 2008, when he left office, to his death in June 2009.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Aushev's assassination was part of a string of killings and attacks on officials throughout Ingushetia and other parts of Russia's [[North Caucasus]] region in June 2009.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; On 10 June 2009, the deputy chief justice in the [[Supreme Court of Ingushetia]], [[Aza Gazgireeva]], was shot and killed.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Just nine days after Aushev's assassination, the [[President of Ingushetia]], [[Yunus-bek Yevkurov]], was severely wounded in a bomb attack on his [[motorcade]] on 22 June 2009.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|first=Clifford|last=Levy|title=Leader of Russian Region Is Attacked |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/world/europe/23ingushetia.html?hp|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Kettle''' ([[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]]: '''Mo'ohtavetoo'o''')&lt;ref&gt;'''Mo'ôhtavetoo'o''' in the current orthography. See [http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/song/1147/names/names2.htm Cheyenne Names] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906124546/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/song/1147/names/names2.htm |date=September 6, 2007 }} by Wayne Leman.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1803{{snd}}November 27, 1868) was a prominent leader of the [[Cheyenne|Southern Cheyenne]] during the [[American Indian Wars]]. Born to the ''Northern Só'taeo'o / Só'taétaneo'o'' band of the Northern Cheyenne in the [[Black Hills]] of present-day [[South Dakota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kclonewolf.com/History/SandCreek/sctime-01-1800-1859.html#sthash.ysRz0Pdj.dpuf|title=Sand Creek Massacre Timeline 1800-1859|work=kclonewolf.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later married into the ''Wotápio / Wutapai'' band (one mixed Cheyenne-[[Kiowa]] band with [[Lakota Sioux]] origin) of the Southern Cheyenne. 

Black Kettle is often remembered as a peacemaker who accepted treaties with the U.S. government to protect his people. On November 27, 1868, while attempting to escape the [[Battle of Washita River]] with his wife, he was shot and killed by soldiers of the U.S. [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]].

==Early life==
Little is known of Black Kettle's life prior to 1854, when he was made a chief of the [[Council of Forty-four]], the central government of the [[Cheyenne]] tribe. The Council met regularly at the [[Sun Dance]] gatherings, where they affirmed unity.

After 1851, relations between the Cheyenne and the U.S. government were nominally conducted under the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. Still, the U.S. government remained unwilling to control white expansion into the [[Great Plains]], particularly after the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] began in 1859. [[European American]]s displaced the Cheyenne from their lands in violation of the treaty, and consumed important resources of water and game. Increasing competition eventually led to armed conflict between the groups.

Chief Black Kettle was a pragmatist who believed that U.S. military power and the number of immigrants were overwhelming and unable to be resisted. In 1861, he and the [[Arapaho]] surrendered to the commander of [[Fort Lyon]] under the [[Treaty of Fort Wise]], believing he could gain protection for his people. The treaty was highly unfavorable to the Southern Cheyenne.

The Cheyenne led their bands to the Sand Creek reservation, which occupied a small corner of southeastern [[Colorado Territory]] about 40 miles from [[Fort Lyon]]. The land was not arable and was located far away from [[American bison|buffalo]], their major source of meat. Many Cheyenne warriors, including the [[Dog Soldiers]], did not accept the treaty and began to attack white settlers. Whether Black Kettle opposed these actions, tolerated them, or encouraged them remains controversial among historians.

==Colorado War==
[[Image:Blackkettle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Black Kettle]]
[[File:Portrait of Black Kettle or Moke-Tao-To? and Delegation Of Cheyenne and Arapaho Chiefs 28 SEP 1864.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A delegation of Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapaho chiefs in Denver, Colorado on September 28, 1864. Black Kettle is in the front row, second from left.]]
[[File:Camp Weld Conference.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This rare photograph by an unknown photographer shows the ill-fated Cheyenne chief, Black Kettle, and a number of his associates at Camp Weld, on the outskirts of Denver. They had assembled there September 28, 1864.]]
By the summer of 1864, the situation had reached a boiling point. Southern Cheyenne hardliners, along with allied [[Kiowa]] and [[Arapaho]] bands, raided American settlements for livestock and supplies. Sometimes they took captives, generally only women and children, to adopt into their tribes as replacements for lost members. On July 11, 1864, Indians killed a family of settlers, an attack which the whites called the [[Hungate massacre]] after the family. Pro-war whites displayed the scalped bodies in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Colorado governor [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] believed tribal chiefs had ordered the attack and were intent on a full-scale war.

Evans issued a proclamation ordering all "Friendly Indians of the Plains" to report to military posts or be considered "hostile". He sought and gained from the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] authorization to establish the [[Third Colorado Cavalry]]. Colonel [[John M. Chivington]] led the unit, composed predominantly of "100-daysers", who enlisted for limited 100-day terms specifically for fighting against the Cheyenne and Arapaho.

Black Kettle decided to accept Evans' offer and entered negotiations. On September 28, he concluded a peace settlement at [[Fort Weld]] outside Denver. The agreement assigned the Southern Cheyenne to the Sand Creek reservation and required them to report to [[Fort Lyon]], formerly Fort Wise. Black Kettle believed the agreement would ensure the safety of his people. After he went to the reservation, the commanding officer at the fort was replaced by one who was an ally of Chivington.

===Betrayal at Sand Creek===
Ambitious, Chivington felt pressure from Governor Evans to make use of the Third Colorado Cavalry before their terms expired at the end of 1864. On November 28, Chivington arrived with 700 men at Fort Lyon. According to an eyewitness, John S. Smith:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[H]e stopped all persons from going on ahead of him. He stopped the mail, and would not allow any person to go on ahead of him at the time he was on his way from Denver city to Fort Lyon. He placed a guard around old Colonel Bent, the former agent there; he stopped a Mr. Hagues and many men who were on their way to Fort Lyon. He took the fort by surprise, and as soon as he got there he posted pickets all around the fort, and then left at 8 o'clock that night for this Indian camp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/four/sandcrk.htm "Congressional Testimony of Mr. John S. Smith: Washington, March 14, 1865."] ''PBS: The West.'' 2001 (retrieved 31 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At dawn on November 29, Chivington attacked the Sand Creek reservation; the event became known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]]. Most of the warriors were out hunting. Following Indian agent instructions, Black Kettle flew an [[American flag]] and a [[white flag]] from his [[tipi]], but the signal was ignored. The 3rd Colorado Cavalry killed 163 Cheyenne by shooting or stabbing. They burned down the village encampment. Most of the victims were women and children. For months afterward, members of the militia displayed trophies in Denver of their battle, including body parts they had taken for souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/colorado-militia-massacre-cheyenne-at-sand-creek "Nov. 29, 1864: Colorado militia massacre at Sand Creek."] ''History.com: This Day in History.'' (retrieved 31 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Black Kettle escaped the massacre and returned to rescue his severely injured wife, who suffered nine bullet and shrapnel wounds. He continued to counsel pacifism, believing that military resistance was doomed to fail. The majority of the Southern Cheyenne chiefs disagreed. Allied with the [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]], they went to war against U.S. civilians and military forces.

Black Kettle said of that time:
{{quote|Although wrongs have been done me, I live in hopes. I have not got two hearts.... I once thought that I was the only man that persevered to be the friend of the white man, but since they have come and cleaned out our lodges, horses, and everything else, it is hard for me to believe white men any more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm Who is the Savage?]. PBS: The West Film Project. 2001. Retrieved 2011-07-13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Black Kettle moved south and continued to negotiate with U.S. officials. He achieved the [[Treaty of Little Arkansas River]] on October 14, 1865. By this document, the U.S. promised "perpetual peace" and lands in reparation for the Sand Creek massacre. However, its practical effect was to dispossess the Cheyenne yet again and require them to move to [[Indian Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]). Black Kettle's influence continued to wane. [[Roman Nose]] and his [[Dog Soldiers]] took a prevailing hard line and continued warfare.

==Medicine Lodge Treaty==
Black Kettle's dwindling band proclaimed their desire to live peacefully alongside European Americans. Black Kettle signed yet another treaty, the [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]], on October 28, 1867. The Dog Soldiers continued their raids and ambushes across Kansas, Texas, and Colorado.

The relationship between the two groups is a subject of historical dispute. According to [[Little Rock (Cheyenne chief)|Little Rock]], second-in-command of Black Kettle's village, most of the warriors came back to Black Kettle's camp after their attacks. White prisoners, including children, were held within his encampment. By this time Black Kettle's influence was waning, and it is unclear whether he could have stopped the younger warriors' actions.

==Battle of Washita River==
{{Main|Battle of Washita River}}
[[File:Washita River Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The approximate location on the Washita River where Chief Black Kettle was killed]]
In response to the continued raids and massacres, General [[Philip Sheridan]] devised a plan of punitive reprisals. He planned to attack Cheyenne winter encampments, destroying both supplies and livestock, and killing any people who resisted. At dawn on the morning of November 27, 1868 (just two days short of the fourth anniversary of the Sand Creek massacre), Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] led his [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] to attack Chief Black Kettle and his village along the [[Washita River]] in what is now western [[Oklahoma]]. Custer's troops killed more than 100 Native Americans, mostly Southern Cheyenne. While trying to cross the Washita River, Black Kettle and his wife were shot in the back and killed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | quote = In "My Life on the Plains" G. Custer states that while talking to Black Kettle's sister as one of the captives...he states that "Black Kettle came out of his lodge at the first sound of battle fired the first or one of the first shots while raising his warriors with a war-whoop and was shot down by the opening volley of the cavalry."

According to Cheyenne oral tradition, a survivor of Washita, Meotzi/Monahseetah ([[Mo-nah-se-tah]]), who had a son, Yellow Swallow, by Custer was said to be Black Kettle's daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/06/did-custer-have-cheyenne-mistress-and-son-native-oral-history-says-yes-157191|title=Did Custer Have a Cheyenne Mistress and Son?

==Legacy==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The Cheyenne have recognized Black Kettle as a peacemaker. Historian Gregory Michno, has criticized him for his alleged poor decision-making and inability to control his warriors which would have been disastrous for the tribe.&lt;ref name="michno"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michno|first1=Gregory|title=Cheyenne Chief Black Kettle|url=http://www.historynet.com/cheyenne-chief-black-kettle.htm|website=HistoryNet.com|publisher=World History Group,|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Kettle National Grassland]] in [[Roger Mills County, Oklahoma]] and [[Hemphill County, Texas]] is named for him. Near the site of his death, in present-day [[Cheyenne, Oklahoma]], the Black Kettle Museum commemorates his legacy.

==In popular culture==
Black Kettle was a recurring character in the CBS family drama ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' for its first three seasons, played by [[Nick Ramus]]. Black Kettle plays a key role for the series in the pilot episode. Dr. Quinn saves Black Kettle's life by performing a [[tracheotomy]] and removing a bullet lodged in his neck. She later receives a Cheyenne name from Black Kettle meaning "Medicine Woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0103292/|title=Black Kettle (Character)|work=IMDb|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[ska]] band [[Five Iron Frenzy]]'s ''[[Our Newest Album Ever!]]'', the song "Banner Year" is about Black Kettle, how he was betrayed, and his eventual murder at the hands of Custer.

{{Chinese name|[[Lu (surname 卢)|Loo]]}}
'''Ching Tsai Loo''', commonly known as '''C. T. Loo''' ({{zh|t=盧芹齋|p=Lú Qínzhāi}}; 1{{nbsp}}February 1880{{snd}}August{{nbsp}}15, 1957), was an [[art dealer]] of Chinese origin who maintained galleries in Paris and New York and supplied important pieces for collectors and American museums. He has been called  "the preeminent dealer of Chinese art and artifacts for the first half of the twentieth century," &lt;ref&gt;[http://npg.si.edu/cexh/artnews/loo.htm Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; but also criticized for his active role in removing antiques and archaeological treasures from China for sale to western collectors.

==Early life==
[[File:CT LOO Family Photo.jpg|thumb|CT LOO Family Photo|thumb|left|250px|Lu Family c. 1900. C.T. Loo is in the rear, second from right]]
He was born Lu Huanwen in Lujiadu 卢家渡 (Lu Family Ford){{sfnb|Pilling|2014}} a village in [[Huzhou]], [[Zhejiang]], China, some {{convert|300|km}} west of Shanghai. His family had lived in this single-surname village since the 10th century.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=27}} Orphaned at age ten, he raised by his uncle, but he decided as a teenager to try his luck in [[Nanxun]], a center of the [[silk trade]]. He did well working under Zhang Baoshan, a successful merchant, whose son, [[Zhang Renjie]], was appointed to the [[List of diplomatic missions of China|Chinese Embassy in France]]. Loo accompanied Zhang to Paris in 1902 at the age of 22. Few Chinese were living in France at that time, but Zhang Renjie invited Loo to work as doorman at his teahouse and then in his family Chinese goods import business, the gallery Ton-ying, in the [[Place de la Madeleine]]. Zhang used his connections in China to obtain antiques and works of art for the company. On his return to China, Zhang became an early financial backer of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Chang  |first = Nelson, Laurence Chang |year = 2010 |title = The Zhangs from Nanxun : A One Hundred and Fifty Year Chronicle of a Chinese Family |publisher = CF Press| location = Palo Alto; Denver |isbn = 9780692008454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UI3_-7dMPIoC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Zhang+Baoshan|ref = harv}} pp. 146, 190, 451–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and influence as an art dealer==
When Loo arrived in Paris, he wore the traditional Chinese gown and sported a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]], but soon became a Parisian dandy. He thrived in Zhang's store but felt constrained. Profits were not reinvested but instead used for the anti-Manchu revolutionary activities of his boss, who subsidized a circle of [[Anarchism in China|Chinese philosophical anarchists]].{{sfnb|Lenain|2013|p=42-43}} In 1908, Loo, now dressed in elegant Parisian fashion and calling himself Cheng-Tsai Loo (Lu Qin Zhai), {{sfnb|Pilling|2014}} opened his own store on Rue Taitbout under the name "Laiyuan and Company" with branches soon to open in Beijing and Shanghai. Loo realized that Westerners preferred later works such as Qing dynasty three-color porcelains, which could supply in good quantities because of the political ties he formed.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=28}}  A friend remarked on Loo's sources in China: "being in touch with important people... he was able to know of precious works of art which had been hidden from the storms of many revolutions." {{sfnb|Heydt|1957|P=186}}

Loo's timing was good. The reports of the French archaeological mission on the Central Asian caves at [[Dunhuang]] made the taste for Chinese things fashionable, and Loo supplied high quality works to fit the new tastes. He developed scholarly understanding and expanded public taste in Asian art, particularly sculpture and early jades, by becoming friends with such eminent [[Sinologist]]s as [[Edouard Chavannes]], [[Victor Segalen]], and especially [[Paul Pelliot]], director of the Dunhuang expedition, whom he commissioned to write catalogs (as he did later with [[Berthold Laufer]] in the United States). The outbreak of war of 1914, however, meant that he could no longer travel to and from China through Siberia but was forced to return by way of the United States. He discovered a growing market for Chinese art in New York and decided to establish a new branch there in 1915. The move from war-torn Europe to the New World was prescient, since the United States became the dominant importer of Chinese antiquities from 1916–1931.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=29-31, 36}}

[[File:CT LOO 1915 Catgalogue of Antique Chinese Porcelains Title Page.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title Page
Loo's First New York Exhibition Catalogue]]
Once established in galleries on Fifth Avenue, Loo's charm and connections in China proved effective and profitable. Loo, observes one recent scholar, lived in one of the most vigorous growth periods for the Asian art market. Wealthy collectors were learning about Asian art, as were well-endowed museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], in Boston, and the [[Freer Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. In Europe, interest in collecting art from the Orient was such that the major dealers, such as Loo, the [[Duveen| Duveen brothers]], and the Japanese dealer [[Sadajirō Yamanaka|Yamanaka &amp; Co.]], could hold exhibitions almost every year, sometimes both in New York and in Paris or London.&lt;ref&gt;Vimalin Rujivacharakul, "China and china: An Introduction to Materiality and a History of Collecting", in p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Loo worked hard to establish personal relations with American museum directors and collectors. Between 1915 and 1917, he offered gifts to at least six museums.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=109}} In July 1917, for instance, Loo wrote a postcard from Beijing to George Byron, director of the University of Pennsylvania museum, "Will write you if I have seen some fine things suitable for your honorable museum."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Blair Brownlee, David B. Brownlee, [http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/50-1/Brownlee.pdf Penn in the World] ''Expedition'' 50.1 p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Works which he sold to museums and collectors at this time are on display at the Freer Gallery, the Fogg Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, among others, including the [[Yixian luohans]], [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]'s horses, and a [[Sui dynasty]] altarpiece from the collection of the imperial collector [[Duanfang]].{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=31}}

After the end of the war in 1919, Loo found himself competing with dealers such as Duveen for the attention of collectors. A revealing transaction took place in 1921. Loo offered what he thought to be a Tang dynasty bronze head of [[Guanyin]] to [[John D. Rockefeller, III]] for $40,000. Rockefeller, perhaps concerned that dealers would want to take advantage of his wealth, declined, offering $25,000. After further bargaining led nowhere, Loo sold the piece to University of Pennsylvania Museum for $40,000.  Loo continued his attempts to develop a relation with the Rockefellers, however, hosting them in his Paris "pagoda," though they bought little of consequence from him.{{sfnb|Abe|2011|p= 110}} The decade long boom in Chinese art came to a close with the Crash of 1929, and by 1931, the volume of China's antique trade with the United States had fallen to about half what it had been in 1926.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=36}}

The years up to 1941 saw a change in the nature of Loo's market as tastes changed. In the West, the study of Asia and Asian art became more professional as museums acquired curators to deepen and widen their collections and universities developed graduate programs. In China, the beleaguered Chinese government viewed traveling exhibitions which visited the West as a way to promote China's image, and Chinese art became an occasion for national pride. Loo's business reached its peak in the second half of the 1930s as he adapted to a more sophisticated market. Loo expanding his international art network to England, France, Germany, and America. Between 1933 and 1941 Loo launched at least one important exhibition or publication project every year. He continued to make major sales to his earlier museum clients, especially of bronzes and sculpture. Loo was instrumental in building the collections of the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art|Nelson Gallery]] in Kansas City, whose organizer, [[Laurence Sickman]], became a good friend. A series of catalogs and scholarly indexes displayed  Loo's knowledge and experience. Among his most successful exhibitions was ''Three Thousand Years of Chinese Jade'', held in 1939 in New York as a fund raiser for China's wartime refugees. The war in China, however, made it nearly impossible to find or export artwork, especially the sculptures Loo so admired. Another problem for Loo was that many of his early clients either died or lost interest.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|pp=36–41}}

One new client whose interest grew was [[Eli Lilly]], an Indiana pharmaceutical executive who assembled the basic works for the Asian collection of what became the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. In 1947 Loo offered Lilly a group of Song dynasty ceramics for $54,350 which he had listed in his 1941 catalog for roughly half that price. Lilly, perhaps reasoning that Loo should have lowered, not raised, the price for works which had not sold, offered $40,000. After an exchange of correspondence which did not bring the sides together, Loo shipped the pieces to the museum and went himself to Indianapolis, bringing with him five further pieces. When Lilly agreed to pay the original asking price, Loo compromised by including the extra pieces. All are now in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley M. Mueller, "[https://www.vastari.com/feature_detail.aspx?id=BbvhIxaZ/Y0=  Eli Lilly Collects: Emotion at Work]" Vastari [n.d.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1949, the new [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist government]] gained control of China and cut Loo off from his sources. Some of Loo's associates were arrested, and Loo's nephew, who had been his agent there, escaped to Hong Kong. In 1950, Loo was forced to liquidate much of his stock, leaving the business to his long-time colleague and successor, [[Frank Caro]].{{sfnb|Cohen|1992|p=137, 149}}

==Controversies over Loo's export of Chinese art==

[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sculpted relief of Emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]'s Horse Sold to the University of Pennsylvania Museum by C.T. Loo 1918]]
The fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1911 weakened government supervision of antiquities and coincided with a growth of Western interest in them.{{sfnb|Cohen|1992|p=37, 57}}  Loo created a chain of middlemen who were on the lookout for items they thought he might buy, not only from now impoverished families, but also from imperial tombs, monuments, and monasteries.{{sfnb|Pilling|2014}}{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=48-49}}

Loo sometimes suggested that the objects he had acquired belonged to nobody. He reported that an early Zhou bronze was "accidentally discovered" by a friend of Loo's who was digging a well for a new house.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=152}} His name has been "notoriously" associated with two relief panels depicting the favorite horses of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]], the founder of the [[Tang dynasty]], among the most important Chinese sculpture pieces outside of China. Loo sold these two panels &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;to the University of Pennsylvania Museum in the late 1910s and the early 1920s for $125,000.{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=104}} Loo later wrote that two tombs discovered in 1924 contained archaic jades, and that he was "able to secure" the whole collection. Jades discovered in tombs at [[Jincun]], Henan, in 1928–29 were "superb" and "thanks to an expert buyer that we had stationed in the village, we were able to secure nearly everything that came from these tombs, and most of them are now in the Winthrop collection at the Fogg Museum." {{sfnb|Loo|1950|p= Preface}} Others are in the Freer Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asia.si.edu/explore/china/jades/jincun-jade-and-gold.asp A Mystery of History A Jade and Gold Assemblage from Jincun]" Freer-Sackler.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loo also arranged for a group of [http://www.asia.si.edu/explore/china/xiangtangshan/cave2gal.asp Buddhist sculptures] to be removed from [[Xiangtangshan Caves]] in [[Hebei]], North China. When they could not find a buyer in China, Loo shipped them to Paris, where they again did not find buyers. When these efforts had failed, he finally shipped them to the United States, where the Philadelphia Museum and Charles Freer bought significant works for prices which now seem quite low.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Swope, "[http://tomswope.blogspot.com/2011/05/chinese-buddhist-sculpture-and-fakes.html Chinese Buddhist sculpture and Fakes]," quoting from Stanley Abe, "From Stone to Sculpture: The Alchemy of the Modern," in ''Treasures Rediscovered: Chinese Stone Sculpture from the Sackler Collections at Columbia University''&lt;/ref&gt; (Chinese regulations and Western museum practices now promote protection of such cultural treasures) &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/XTSprovenance.asp Promoting the protection of Chinese cultural heritage]" Freer-Sackler&lt;/ref&gt;

These transactions continue to offend some Chinese. Xu Jian, professor of history at [[Sun Yat-sen University]] in Guangzhou, says, "Loo directly and strongly stimulated China's tomb-robbing activities." Géraldine Lenain, author of a biographical study of Loo, says emotions in China are "still very cruel, still very intense", and he's "considered a criminal, the biggest criminal of all." Daisy Wang (Wang Yiyou), author of a doctoral dissertation on Loo's career as a dealer, told an interviewer that Loo served as "an exotic Chinese servant for his rich and powerful Euro-American clientele ... based on America's capitalist and imperialist logic that Chinese antiquities were to be consumed by the rich and the powerful in modern America," not in China.{{sfnb|Pilling|2014}}

Loo recognized the feeling against him. His introduction to the catalog for his liquidation sale in 1950 noted: "No matter which object I exported from my country, they were all bought openly on the market, in competition with others." He continued: "I am happy today that these objets d'art that I exported are securely and carefully preserved for posterity, because I think that if they had remained in China, many of these beautiful objects would have been destroyed."{{sfnb|Pilling|2014}}  He suggested that the Chinese should blame some "foreigners." He pointed out that the person who was responsible for the removal of the famous relief panels of the Taizong emperor's chargers was "a foreign dealer."{{sfnb|Wang|2007|p=159}}

==Personal life==
Not long after he opened his Paris gallery, Loo was struck by the beauty of Olga Hortense Libmond (1876–1960), a woman four years his elder who ran a milliner's shop a few doors away.{{sfnb|Lenain|2013|p= [http://www.editions-picquier.fr/medias/cat_1364486422_2.pdf 57–58]}} They fell in love, and indeed saw each other constantly until his death in 1957, and she guided his life and career. But since she wanted to maintain her relationships with an older man who had financed her business, she instead offered her 15-year-old daughter, Marie-Rose (1895–1971), to Loo in marriage.{{sfnb|Lenain|2013|p= [http://www.editions-picquier.fr/medias/cat_1364486422_2.pdf 57–58]}} Marie-Rose remained married to Loo until his death in 1957.{{sfnb|Pilling|2014}} They had four daughters,{{sfnb|Pilling|2014}} among them Janine Loo Pierre-Emmanuel.

Loo died in [[Nyon]], Switzerland, 15 August 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/45105819 Abilene Reporter-News 18 August 1957 Page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/13759879/qin_zhai_lu/ Qin zhai Lu (1880–1957)] [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;/ref&gt; His body was returned to Paris, where it was interned in the burial plot of his wife's family.&lt;ref&gt;"C.T.Loo is Dead; Dealer in Art, 78," ''New York Times'' 18 August 1957 p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pagoda Paris==
In 1925, Loo bought and substantially remodeled a townhouse in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th Arrondissement]], which came to be known as "Pagoda Paris." The building became Loo's gallery and home for decades. The red brick building had jade-green roof tiles and Chinese gargoyles, 16th- and 17th-century lacquered wood paneling, an art deco glass ceiling depicting Chinese characters, an 18th- and 19th-century sculpted wood galleria of Indian origin, and a lacquer and wood elevator. The building fell into disrepair after Loo's death, but was purchased by a private French investor in 2010 and renovated as a venue for art and events. Loo's library is available to scholars.{{sfnb|Beres|2012}}

The '''Cincinnati Strangler''' was the name given to a [[serial killer]] who [[rape]]d, then [[strangling|strangled]] seven mostly elderly women in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] between 1965 and 1966. The identity of the Cincinnati Strangler is commonly believed to be former cab driver [[Posteal Laskey Jr]].&lt;!-- References to Laskey's race is irrelevant to the article; inclusion of his race is considered vandalism. --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

During the killing spree there was considerable alarm on the part of many Cincinnatians, with locksmiths and hardware stores unable to keep up with the demand for locks.&lt;ref name="Post Perry"&gt;{{cite news

Originally sentenced to [[capital punishment in the United States|death]], Laskey's sentence was commuted to [[life imprisonment]] when the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] invalidated the death penalty in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]''. In February 2007, Laskey was denied [[parole]]. The grounds cited by the Ohio Parole Board included the heinous nature of the crime, Laskey's prior record, and the community disapproval of an early release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He would have been eligible for parole again in 2017 at the age of 79 years and was incarcerated in the [[Pickaway Correctional Institution]]. Laskey died on May 29, 2007 of natural causes, while still in prison.  No one claimed his body and prison officials said he was buried in one of the State of Ohio's prison cemeteries.

'''Clara Dorothy Bewick Colby''' (1 August 1846 – 7 September 1916) was a British-American lecturer, newspaper publisher and correspondent, women's rights activist, and [[suffragist]] leader. Born in England, she immigrated to the US, where she attended university and married the former [[American Civil War]] general, later Assistant [[United States Attorney General]], [[Leonard Wright Colby]].&lt;ref name="TaylorWeir2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Marion Ann|last2=Weir|first2=Heather E.|title=Let Her Speak for Herself: Nineteenth-century Women Writing on the Women of Genesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9qjHtVJUYQC&amp;pg=PA173|year=2006|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-1-932792-53-9|pages=173–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, she founded the ''[[Women's Tribune]]'' in [[Beatrice, Nebraska]], moving it three years later to [[Washington, D.C.]]; it became the country's leading women's suffrage publication.&lt;ref name=sdpb.sd.gov /&gt; She was an advocate of peace and took part in the great peace conference at San Francisco during the exposition. She also spoke on behalf of the soldiers of the Spanish War. During the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898), she was officially appointed as war correspondent, the first woman to be so recognized.&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt;

In addition to being a suffragist and newspaper publisher, Colby was a lecturer, an interpreter of [[Walt Whitman]], and a writer. She was a delegate to the International Congress of Women (London, England, 1899); delegated by [[governor of Oregon|governor]] to represent [[Oregon]] in the First [[International Moral Education Congress]] (London, 1908); and a delegate to the First International Peace Congress (London, 1911). She served as Vice-president of the Nebraska Woman Suffrage Association, from its formation, 1881–83; and president, 1883–09. She was corresponding secretary of the Federal Suffrage Association of the United States. Colby wrote magazine articles for ''Arena'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', [[Overland Monthly|''Overland'']], ''Englishwoman'', and others. She was a newspaper correspondent for the International Peace Union, National Woman's Press Association, Oregon Woman's Press Association, Higher Thought Center (London), Woman's Freedom League, National Political Reform League, and International Woman's Franchise Club (London). She often appeared before state legislatures and congressional committees on behalf of [[woman suffrage]]; she also aided woman suffrage in England.&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt;

Colby was born in [[Gloucester]], England in 1846, the daughter of Thomas and Clara Willingham (Chilton) Bewick. The family settled near [[Windsor (town), Wisconsin|Windsor]], [[Wisconsin]] when Colby was eight.&lt;ref name="LitoffMcDonnell1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Litoff|first1=Judy Barrett|last2=McDonnell|first2=Judith|title=European Immigrant Women in the United States: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZyYa0cAPbkC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8240-5306-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being part of a large family, she had few opportunities for attending the district school, but her father encouraged and assisted his children to study in the winter evenings, and in this way she prepared herself to teach in country schools.&lt;ref name=StantonAnthony1886 /&gt; Colby's grandfather, [[Thomas Bewick]], was a notable naturalist and engraver.&lt;ref name="Brown1917"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Olympia|title=Democratic Ideals: A Memorial Sketch of Clara B. Colby|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRugAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA13|edition=Public domain|year=1917|publisher=Federal Suffrage Association|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of nineteen, Colby went to [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to live with her grandparents, Stephen Chilton and Clara Medhurst Willingham Chilton.&lt;ref name=wisconsinhistory.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen and Clara Medhurst Willingham Chilton|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=N:4294963828-4294955414&amp;dsRecordDetails=R:IM26607|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she entered the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], then in its infancy, which was struggling with co-education. She exerted a marked influence in securing the admission of women to the university and the adoption of the principles of co-education in Wisconsin. She was graduated in 1869 as the valedictorian and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in the first class of women graduated from the school.&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LitoffMcDonnell1994 /&gt; At once, she became a teacher of history and [[Latin]] in the institution, while pursuing graduate studies. She married [[Leonard Wright Colby]], a graduate of the same university, in June 1871, and moved to Beatrice the following year, where he was elected to the [[Nebraska State Senate]]. Amidst the hardships of pioneer life in a new place, the young wife found her family cares all-absorbing, but her taste for study, her love of literature and her natural desire to improve the conditions about her, led her to establish Beatrice's free public [[library]] in 1873.&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt;&lt;ref name=StantonAnthony1886 /&gt;

==Activist==
Colby edited a department in the ''Beatrice Express'' called "Woman's Work," and in 1883, she founded, published, and edited ''The Woman's Tribune''. For several years, she was deeply interested in the movement for woman's enfranchisement, devoting her journal to the advocacy of this reform. ''The Woman's Tribune'' took the prize at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition in 1900]] for its neatness and workman-like appearance, and it filled an important place in the history of the suffragist cause, being for a time the recognized organ of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]].&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt; A contemporary and friend of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and Dr. [[Mary Edwards Walker]], Colby lectured extensively not only to general audiences, but before legislative and congressional committees.&lt;ref name="StantonAnthony1886"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=Elizabeth Cady|last2=Anthony|first2=Susan B.|last3=Gage|first3=Matilda Joslyn|author4=Harper, Ida Husted|title=History of Woman Suffrage: 1876–1885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eoNKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA670|edition=Public domain|year=1886|publisher=Fowler &amp; Wells|page=670}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, at the time of the great International Council of Women in Washington, D.C. Colby published the ''Tribune'' daily during the week of the council, and continued it through the Woman's Suffrage Convention the following week. It is probably the first instance of a daily woman's paper being published by a woman.&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt; During the period of 1885-98, she served as president of the Nebraska Woman Suffrage Association,&lt;ref name=LitoffMcDonnell1994 /&gt; and in 1895, she served as the chair of the Federal Suffrage Committee.&lt;ref name="ConventionCongress)1895"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Convention|first1=|author2=National American Woman Suffrage Association Collection (Library of Congress)|author3=Susan B.

==Lecturer and author==
[[File:Clara Bewick Colby2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clara Bewick Colby]]
With an interest in esoteric spirituality, Colby was a contributor to Stanton's ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'' (1895). Colby lectured extensively in almost every state in the U.S. as well as in England, Ireland and Scotland, and also gave lectures at [[Budapest]] and other places in Europe. She took part in most of the great suffrage campaigns which were carried on in the different states in the effort to secure the franchise by vote of the electors. She made her home in [[Oregon]] for a time, taking part in several of the suffrage campaigns of that state. In 1899, she attended the Great International Council of Women held in London. While there Colby made the acquaintance of many distinguished suffrage workers. She served as a delegate to the International Moral Education Congress (London, 1908) and, in the same year, to the International Women Suffrage Alliance (Amsterdam). From the time of the discontinuance of the ''Tribune'' in 1909 until 1912, considerable time was spent in England in helping the English suffragists in their struggle for justice and in making acquaintance with many prominent English reformers. Of her experiences in England she published, from time to time, her accounts in the ''[[Washington Herald]]''. Among other writings she prepared a book entitled "The History of London" (unpublished), which was preserved by her sister, Dr. Mary B. White of [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt; From 1911 through 1913, she served as a delegate to the International Races Congress (London, 1911); International Woman Suffrage Convention (Budapest, 1913); and the International Peace Conference (The Hague, 1913).&lt;ref name=plainshumanities.unl.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Colby, Clara (1846–1916)|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.gen.009|website=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|publisher=University of Nebraska–Lincoln|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winters of 1913-15, Colby lectured in Washington on topics such as:&lt;ref name=Brown1917 /&gt;
* "Delia Blanchflower," [[Mary Augusta Ward]]'s new woman suffrage novel
* "Austria-Hungary, Its History and Conditions"

==Personal life==
[[File:Clara Bewick Colby3.jpg|thumb|upright|Colby c.1880s]]
Clara married Leonard in 1872 and they removed to [[Beatrice, Nebraska]]. Although they never had children of their own, they adopted a boy, Clarence (born ca. 1882), in 1885 from an [[Orphan Train]]. In 1891, Leonard returned home from the [[Battle of Wounded Knee]] with a Sioux baby, [[Zintkala Nuni]] (Lost Bird) and adopted her; Clara was away at this time, lecturing on suffrage issues. Leonard left with Lost Bird's nursemaid, and the Colbys divorced in 1906.&lt;ref name=plainshumanities.unl.edu /&gt; The child was raised by Clara. A lifelong [[Congregationalist]], Colby nonetheless had an interest in the [[New Thought]] spiritual movement; she served as an honorary leadership role in the [[International New Thought Alliance]].&lt;ref name=JamesJames1971 /&gt; Her health faded in her final years, and Colby died at her sister's home in Palo Alto in 1916 of [[pneumonia]] and [[myocarditis]].&lt;ref name=sdpb.sd.gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Bird of Wounded Knee|url=http://www.sdpb.sd.gov/lostbird/clara.asp|publisher=South Dakota Public Television|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LitoffMcDonnell1994 /&gt; Her ashes were buried in her childhood hometown of Windsor.&lt;ref name="JamesJames1971"&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Edward T.|last2=James|first2=Janet Wilson|last3=Boyer|first3=Paul S.|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=PA357|date=1 January 1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-62734-5|pages=357–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copts''' ({{lang-cop|ⲚⲓⲢⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ ̀ⲛ̀Ⲭⲣⲏⲥⲧⲓ̀ⲁⲛⲟⲥ}}, {{transl|co|NiRemenkīmi enKhristianos}}; {{lang-ar|أقباط}}, {{transl|arz|Aqbāt}}) are an [[ethnoreligious group]] indigenous to [[North Africa|Northeast Africa]] who primarily inhabit the area of modern [[Egypt]], where they are the largest [[Christianity in Egypt|Christian denomination]] in the country. Copts are also the largest Christian adherent group in [[Christianity in Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Christianity in Libya|Libya]]. Historically, they spoke the [[Coptic language]], a direct descendant of the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]] that was spoken in [[late antiquity]].

[[Copts in Egypt]] constitute the largest [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christian population in the Middle East]] and North Africa, as well as the largest religious minority in the region, accounting for an estimated 10&amp;ndash;15% of the [[demographics of Egypt|Egyptian population]].&lt;ref name="Christian-Muslim Gap"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cole | first = Ethan| title=Egypt's Christian-Muslim Gap Growing Bigger | publisher= [[The Christian Post]] | date=July 8, 2008 | url = http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080708/egypt-s-christian-muslim-gap-growing-bigger.htm | accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copts in Sudan]] constitute the largest [[Christianity in Sudan|Christian community in Sudan]],&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; and [[Copts in Libya]] constitute the largest [[Christianity in Libya|Christian community in Libya]], accounting for an estimated 1% of their respective populations.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{further information|Name of Egypt}}
The word ''Copt'' was adopted in English in the 17th century, from [[New Latin]] ''Coptus, Cophtus'', which is derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] collective {{transl|ar|qubṭ / qibṭ}} {{lang|ar|قبط|rtl=yes}} "the Copts" with [[Arabic grammar#nisba|nisba]] adjective {{transl|ar|qubṭī, qibṭī}} {{lang|ar|قبطى|rtl=yes}}, plural {{transl|ar|aqbāṭ}} {{lang|ar|أقباط|rtl=yes}}; Also ''quftī, qiftī'' (where the Arabic {{IPAslink|f}} represents the historical Coptic {{IPAslink|p}}) an Arabisation of the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word ''kubti'' ([[Coptic language#Bohairic|Bohairic]]) or ''kuptaion'' ([[Coptic language#Sahidic|Sahidic]]). The Coptic word is in turn an adaptation of the Greek term for the indigenous people of Egypt, {{transl|grc|Aigýptios}} ({{lang|grc|Αἰγύπτιος}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ackroyd|first1=P. R.|last2=Evans|first2=C. F.|title=The Cambridge History of the Bible: Volume 1, From the Beginnings to Jerome|date= 1963 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521099738|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnG2067meU0C&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term for Egypt, ''Aigýptos'' ({{lang-grc|Αἴγυπτος}}), is itself derived from the [[Egyptian language]], but dates to a much earlier period, being attested already in [[Mycenaean Greek]] as ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ku-pi-ti-jo'' (lit. "Egyptian"; used here as a man's name). This Mycenaean form is likely from [[Middle Egyptian]] {{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:ḥwt kꜣ ptḥ#Egyptian|ḥwt kꜣ ptḥ]]}} (reconstructed pronunciation /ħawitˌkuʀpiˈtaħ/ → /ħawiʔˌkuʀpiˈtaħ/ → /ħəˌkuʔpəˈtaħ/, [[Egyptological pronunciation]] ''Hut-ka-Ptah''), literally "Estate/Palace of the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#kꜣ "double"|kꜣ]] ("double" spirit) of [[Ptah]]" (cf. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] {{lang|akk-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;ālu&lt;/sup&gt;ḫi-ku-up-ta-aḫ}}), the name of the temple complex of the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] (and a [[synecdoche]] for the city of Memphis and the region around it).

The term is thus ultimately derived from the Greek designation of the native Egyptian population in [[Roman Egypt]] (as distinct from Greeks, Romans, Jews, etc.). After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], it became restricted to those Egyptians adhering to the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;"The people of Egypt before the Arab conquest in the 7th century identified themselves and their language in Greek as Aigyptios (Arabic qibt, Westernized as Copt); when Egyptian Muslims later ceased to call themselves Aigyptioi, the term became the distinctive name of the Christian minority." [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026216 Coptic Orthodox Church]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In Coptic, Copts referred to themselves as ''ni rem en kīmi en khristianos'' ({{lang-cop|ⲚⲓⲢⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ ̀ⲛ̀Ⲭⲣⲏⲥⲧⲓ̀ⲁⲛⲟⲥ}}), which literally means "Christian people of Egypt" or "Christian Egyptians". The Coptic name for [[Egyptians]], ''rem en kīmi'' ({{lang-cop|Ⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ}}), is realized in the [[Coptic language#Fayyumic|Fayyumic Coptic]] as ''lem en kēmi'',  or ''rem en khēmi'' in the Bohairic dialect; cf. Egyptian {{lang|egy-Latn|rmṯ n [[Km (hieroglyph)|kmt]]}}, Demotic {{lang|egy-Latn|rmṯ n kmỉ}}.

The Arabic word {{transl|ar|qibṭ}} "Copt" has also been connected to the Greek name of the town of Kóptos ({{lang-grc-koi|Κόπτος}}, now [[Qift|Qifṭ]]; Coptic ''Kebt'' and ''Keft''). It is possible that this association has contributed to making "Copt" the settled form of the name.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] s.v. "Copt".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, some Egyptian nationalists and intellectuals in the context of [[Pharaonism]] began using the term {{transl|ar|qubṭ}} in the historical sense.&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in M. Hussein. {{transl|ar|el Ittigahat el Wataneyya fil Adab el Muʻaṣir}} ''[National Trends in Modern Literature]''. Vol. 2. Cairo, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Religion in Egypt}}
{{Copts}}
The Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East. Although integrated in the larger Egyptian nation state, the Copts have survived as a distinct [[Religion in Egypt|religious community]] forming around 10 to 20 percent of the population,&lt;ref name="U.S.Dept of State/Egypt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FCO/Egypt/"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The world factbook/Egypt/"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPS News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtoninstitute.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nlgsolutions1"&gt;[http://www.nlgsolutions.com/packages/show_country.asp?countryid=EG NLG Solutions] &lt;Online&gt;. ''Egypt''. Retrieved 28 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; though estimates vary. They pride themselves on the apostolicity of the Egyptian Church whose founder was the first in an unbroken chain of patriarchs. The main body for 16 centuries has been out of communion with both the Roman Catholic Church (in Rome) and the various Eastern orthodox churches.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Foundation of the Christian Church in Egypt===
According to ancient tradition, [[Christianity]] was introduced within present day [[Egypt]] by [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] in [[Alexandria]], shortly after the ascension of [[Christ]] and during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] [[Claudius]] around 42&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of Ecclesiastical History in the fourth century, states that st. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 A.D. "Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity" Otto F.A. Meinardus p28.&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy that [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] left in [[Egypt]] was a considerable [[Christian]] community in [[Alexandria]]. From Alexandria, [[Christianity]] spread throughout [[Egypt]] within half a century of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]]'s arrival in [[Alexandria]], as is clear from a fragment of the [[Gospel of John]], written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], which was found in [[Upper Egypt]] and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century, and the [[New Testament]] writings found in [[Oxyrhynchus]], in [[Middle Egypt]], which date around the year 200&amp;nbsp;AD. In the 2nd century, [[Christianity]] began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local language, today known as the [[Coptic language]], but known as the ''Egyptian language'' at the time. By the beginning of the 3rd century AD, [[Christian]]s constituted the majority of Egypt’s population, and the [[Church of Alexandria]] was recognized as one of [[Christendom]]'s four Apostolic Sees, second in honor only to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The [[Church of Alexandria]] is therefore the oldest Christian church in Africa.

===Contributions to Christianity===
The Copts in Egypt contributed immensely to [[Christian]] tradition. The [[Catechetical]] School of Alexandria was the oldest catechetical school in the world. Founded around 190&amp;nbsp;AD by the scholar [[Pantanaeus]], the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]], and [[Origen]], the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. However, the scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before [[Braille]], wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.

Another major contribution made by the Copts in Egypt to [[Christianity]] was the creation and organization of [[monasticism]]. Worldwide Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example. The most prominent figures of the monastic movement were [[Anthony the Great]], [[Paul of Thebes]], [[Macarius the Great]], [[Shenouda the Archimandrite]] and [[Pachomius|Pachomius the Cenobite]]. By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. Since then pilgrims have visited the Egyptian [[Desert Fathers]] to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives. [[Saint Basil|Saint Basil the Great]] Archbishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca]], and the founder and organiser of the monastic movement in [[Asia Minor]], visited [[Egypt]] around 357&amp;nbsp;AD and his monastic rules are followed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]]. [[Saint Jerome]], who translated the [[Bible]] into [[Latin]], came to [[Egypt]] while en route to [[Jerusalem]] around 400&amp;nbsp;AD and left details of his experiences in his letters. [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] founded the [[Benedictine Order]] in the 6th century on the model of [[Saint Pachomius]], although in a stricter form. [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]] practice male [[circumcision]] as a rite of passage.&lt;ref name=Columbia_encyc_2011_circ&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Circumcision |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/circumcision.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical Councils===
The major contributions that the [[See of Alexandria]] has contributed to the establishment of early Christian theology and dogma are attested to by fact that the first three [[Ecumenical council]]s in the history of [[Christianity]] were headed by Egyptian patriarchs. The [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (325&amp;nbsp;AD) was presided over by [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|St. Alexander, Patriarch of Alexandria]], along with [[Hosius of Córdoba|Saint Hosius of Córdoba]]. In addition, the most prominent figure of the council was the future [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], who played the major role in the formulation of the [[Nicene Creed]], recited today in most Christian churches of different denominations. One of the council's decisions was to entrust the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] with calculating and annually announcing the exact date of [[Easter]] to the rest of the Christian churches. The [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] (381&amp;nbsp;AD) was presided over by [[Timothy of Alexandria|Patriarch Timothy of Alexandria]], while the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431&amp;nbsp;AD) was presided over by [[Cyril of Alexandria]].

===Council of Chalcedon===
In 451&amp;nbsp;AD, following the [[Council of Chalcedon]], the [[Church of Alexandria]] was divided into two branches. Those who accepted the terms of the Council became known as [[Chalcedonian]]s or [[Melkites]]. Those who did not abide by the Council's terms were labeled [[non-Chalcedonian]]s or [[Monophysites]] and later Jacobites after [[Jacob Baradaeus]]. The [[non-Chalcedonian]]s, however, rejected the term [[Monophysites]] as erroneous and referred to themselves as [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]]. The majority of the [[Egyptians]] belonged to the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] branch, which led to their persecution by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Egypt]].

===Arab conquest of Egypt===
{{main article|Islamization of Egypt}}
[[File:Kairo Hanging Church BW 1.jpg|thumb|180px|[[The Hanging Church]] in [[Coptic Cairo]].|left]]
In 641&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Egypt]] was conquered by the [[Arabs]] who faced off with the [[Byzantine]] army. Local resistance by the Egyptians however began to materialize shortly thereafter and would last until at least the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar (2 vols., Bulaq, 1854), by [[Al-Maqrizi]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronicles, by [[John of Nikiû]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Muslim rule, Christians paid special taxes and had lower access to political power, but were exempt from military service. Their position improved dramatically under the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in the early 19th century. He abolished the [[Jizya]] (a tax on non-Muslims) and allowed Egyptians (Copts) to enroll in the army. [[Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria|Pope Cyril IV]], 1854–61, reformed the church and encouraged broader Coptic participation in Egyptian affairs. Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]], in power 1863–79, further promoted the Copts. He appointed them judges to Egyptian courts and awarded them political rights and representation in government. They flourished in business affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Todros, ch 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}}

Some Copts participated in the Egyptian national movement for independence and occupied many influential positions. Two significant cultural achievements include the founding of the [[Coptic Museum]] in 1910 and the Higher Institute of Coptic Studies in 1954. Some prominent Coptic thinkers from this period are [[Salama Moussa]], [[Louis Awad]] and Secretary General of the [[Wafd Party]] [[Makram Ebeid]].

In 1952, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] led some army officers in a coup d'état against [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]], which overthrew the Kingdom of Egypt and established a republic. [[Nasser]]'s mainstream policy was [[pan-Arab]] nationalism and socialism. The Copts were severely affected by Nasser's nationalization policies, though they represented about 10 to 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="nisan"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nisan | first = Mordechai | title = Minorities in the Middle East | publisher = McFarland | year = 2002 | page = 144 | isbn = 978-0-7864-1375-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nasser's pan-Arab policies undermined the Copts' strong attachment to and sense of identity about their Egyptian pre-Arab, and certainly non-Arab identity which resulted in permits to construct churches to be delayed along with Christian religious courts to be closed.&lt;ref name= nisan/&gt;

====Pharaonism====
{{main article|Pharaonism}}
Many Coptic intellectuals hold to [[Pharaonism]], which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. Some scholars see Pharaonism as shaped by [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jacques | last = van der Vliet | title = The Copts: 'Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'? | journal = Church History &amp; Religious Culture |date=June 2009 | volume = 89 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 279–90 | doi=10.1163/187124109x407934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Donald Malcolm | last = Reid| title= Whose Pharaohs?: Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FeviPDy08e8C&amp;pg=PA258 |year= 2003|publisher= U. of California Press|pages= 258ff | chapter = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, members of the [[non-Chalcedonian]] Coptic Orthodox Church constitute the majority of the Egyptian [[Christianity|Christian]] population. Mainly through emigration and partly through European, American, and other missionary work and conversions, the Egyptian Christian community now also includes other Christian denominations such as [[Protestants]] (known in Arabic as [[Evangelicals]]), [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Rite Catholic]]s, and other [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] congregations. The term ''Coptic'' remains exclusive however to the Egyptian natives, as opposed to the Christians of non-Egyptian origins. Some Protestant churches for instance are called "Coptic Evangelical Church", thus helping differentiate their native Egyptian congregations from churches attended by non-Egyptian immigrant communities such as Europeans or Americans.

In 2005, a group of Coptic activists created a [[Coptic flag|flag]] to represent Copts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freecopts.net/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=38|title=Freecopts.net|website=freecopts.net|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]], died 17 March 2012. On 4 November 2012, [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria|Bishop Tawadros]] was chosen as the new pope of Egypt's Coptic Christians. His name was selected from a glass bowl containing the three shortlisted candidates by a blindfolded boy at a ceremony in [[Cairo]]'s [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo|St Mark's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=CNANKH-BBC-4NOV2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Bishop Tawadros new pope of Egypt's Coptic Christians|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20192922|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=4 November 2012|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copts in modern Sudan===
{{Main article|Copts in Sudan}}
{{further information|Christianity in Sudan}}
[[File:Coptic cathedral (Khartoum) 001.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Holy Mary Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]].]]
[[Sudan]] has a native Coptic minority, although many Copts in Sudan are descended from more recent Egyptian immigrants.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;
Copts in Sudan live mostly in northern cities, including [[Al Obeid]], [[Atbara]], [[Dongola]], [[Khartoum]], [[Omdurman]], [[Port Sudan]], and [[Wad Medani]].&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; They number up to 500,000, or slightly over 1 percent of the Sudanese population.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; Due to their advanced education, their role in the life of the country has been more significant than their numbers suggest.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; They have occasionally faced forced conversion to [[Islam]], resulting in their emigration and decrease in number.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

Modern immigration of Copts to Sudan peaked in the early 19th century, and they generally received a tolerant welcome there. However, this was interrupted by a decade of persecution under [[History of Mahdist Sudan|Mahdist rule]] at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; As a result of this persecution, many were forced to relinquish their faith, adopt [[Islam]], and intermarry with the native Sudanese. The [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian invasion]] in 1898 allowed Copts greater religious and economic freedom, and they extended their original roles as artisans and merchants into trading, banking, engineering, medicine, and the civil service. Proficiency in business and administration made them a privileged minority. However, the return of [[Islamism|militant Islam]] in the mid-1960s and subsequent demands by radicals for an [[Sharia|Islamic constitution]] prompted Copts to join in public opposition to religious rule.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

[[Gaafar Nimeiry]]'s introduction of Islamic [[Sharia]] law in 1983 began a new phase of oppressive treatment of Copts, among other non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; After the overthrow of Nimeiry, Coptic leaders supported a secular candidate in the 1986 elections. However, when the [[National Islamic Front]] overthrew the elected government of [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] with the help of the military, discrimination against Copts returned in earnest. Hundreds of Copts were dismissed from the civil service and judiciary.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

In February 1991, a Coptic pilot working for [[Sudan Airways]] was executed for illegal possession of foreign currency.&lt;ref name="sudanupdate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudanupdate.org/REPORTS/PEOPLES/COPTS.HTM|title=Copts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his execution, he had been offered amnesty and money if he converted to [[Islam]], but he refused. Thousands attended his funeral, and the execution was taken as a warning by many Copts, who began to flee the country.&lt;ref name="sudanupdate1"/&gt;

Restrictions on the Copts' rights to Sudanese nationality followed, and it became difficult for them to obtain Sudanese nationality by birth or by naturalization, resulting in problems when attempting to travel abroad. The confiscation of Christian schools and the imposition of an Arab-Islamic emphasis in language and history teaching were accompanied by harassment of Christian children and the introduction of [[hijab]] dress laws. A Coptic child was flogged for failing to recite a [[Koranic]] verse.&lt;ref name="sudanupdate1"/&gt; In contrast with the extensive media broadcasting of the Muslim [[Friday prayers]], the radio ceased coverage of the Christian Sunday service. As the civil war raged throughout the 1990s, the government focused its religious fervour on the south. Although experiencing discrimination, the Copts and other long-established Christian groups in the north had fewer restrictions than other types of Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

Today, the [[Coptic Church]] in Sudan is officially registered with the government, and is exempt from property tax.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; In 2005, the Sudanese government of National Unity (GNU) named a [[Coptic Orthodox]] priest to a government position, though the ruling Islamist party's continued dominance under the GNU provides ample reason to doubt its commitment to broader religious or ethnic representation.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

===Copts in modern Libya===

Living in countries with Muslim majorities (Egypt, Sudan, Libya), the size of the population of Copts is a continuously disputed matter, frequently for reasons of religious jealousy and animosity.

The Coptic population [[Copts in Egypt|in Egypt]] is difficult to estimate because researchers are forbidden by Egyptian authorities from asking a survey participant’s religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/06/20/what-egypt-under-sissi-is-really-like-for-coptic-christians/|title=What Egypt under Sissi is really like for Coptic Christians|last=Yerkes|first=Sarah|date=20 June  2016|website=|access-date=|quote=Egyptian authorities prevent surveyors from asking a participant’s religion when doing research.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some official estimates state that Coptic Christians represent from 5 to 10 percent or less of a population of over 83 million Egyptians&lt;ref name="U.S.Dept of State/Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm|title= Egypt from "U.S. Department of State/Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs"|date=September 30, 2008 |publisher= [[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCO/Egypt/"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|title=Egypt from "Foreign and Commonwealth Office"|date=August 15, 2008|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office -UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135632/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|archivedate=December 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The world factbook/Egypt/"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=Egypt from "The World Factbook"|date=September 4, 2008|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPS News"&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32988 IPS News] .

[[File:StMarkCopticOrthodoxChurchBellaireTX0.JPG|thumb|180px|St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in [[Bellaire, Texas]] ([[Greater Houston]]). There are about 1-2 million Copts living outside of Egypt, and are known as the ''[[Coptic diaspora]]''.|left]]

Outside of the Coptic primary area of residence within parts of present-day Egypt ([[Copts in Egypt]]), Sudan ([[Copts in Sudan]]), and Libya ([[Copts in Libya]]), the largest  Coptic diaspora population is located within the United States, Canada, and Australia. The numbers of the Censuses in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] are not fully correct since many Copts listed themselves in the 2011 Census mistakenly as either Egyptians, Sudanese, Libyans, Americans, Canadians or Australians and by this way reducing the Coptic population in the 2011 Census in the United States, Canada, and Australia respectively.

Nevertheless, the [[Coptic American|Coptic American (US)]] population is estimated to number about 200,000 (estimates of Coptic organizations ranging as high as a million).&lt;ref name="2009 American Community Survey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Tribune 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JS Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US-Copts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to published accounts and several Coptic/US sources (including the ''US-Coptic Association''), the Coptic Orthodox Church has between 700,000 and one million members in the United States (c. 2005–2007). ^^{{cite web|url=http://www.copticcu.com/WhyCCU.html|title=''Why CCU?''|accessdate=June 21, 2009|publisher=Coptic Credit Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Copts in Canada|Coptic Canadian]] population is estimated to number about 50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/3704|title=Protest Egyptian government allowing criminal attacks on Coptic Christians|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (estimates of Coptic organizations ranging as high as 200,000).&lt;ref name="Montreal Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elaph.com"/&gt; The [[Copts in Australia|Coptic Australian]] population is estimated to number about 50,000&lt;ref name="parliament.nsw.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coptic.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diocese of Australia|url=http://www.coptic.org.au/|website=Diocese of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; (estimates of Coptic organizations ranging as high as 100,000).

==Persecution and discrimination in Egypt==
{{Main article|Persecution of Copts|Religion in Egypt}}
{{Modern persecution of Coptic Christians}}
[[Freedom of religion|Religious freedom]] in Egypt is hampered to varying degrees by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Coptic Christians, being the largest religious minority in Egypt, are also negatively affected. Copts have faced increasing marginalization after the 1952 [[coup d'état]] led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Until recently, [[Christians]] were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches. Although the law was eased in 2005 by handing down the authority of approval to the governors, Copts continue to face many obstacles and restrictions in building new churches. These restrictions do not apply for building mosques.&lt;ref&gt;WorldWide Religious News.

The Coptic community has been targeted by hate crimes resulting in Copts being victims of murder by Islamic extremists. The most significant was the 2000–01 El Kosheh attacks, in which Muslims and Christians were involved in bloody inter-religious clashes following a dispute between a Muslim and a Christian.

[[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] is a Copt who served as [[Egypt]]'s foreign minister under President [[Anwar Sadat]].

There also use to be one Coptic governor out of 25, that of the [[upper Egypt]]ian governorate of [[Qena]], and is the first Coptic governor in decades due to the higher concentration of Copts in [[Upper Egypt]]. In addition, [[Naguib Sawiris]], an extremely successful businessman and one of the world's 100 wealthiest people, is a Copt.

While freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Egyptians are able to [[Religious conversion|convert]] to Islam generally without difficulty, but Muslims who convert to Christianity face difficulties in getting new identity papers and some have been arrested for allegedly forging such documents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/egypt14701.htm Human Rights Watch.

The Egyptian Census of 1897 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 14.7 percent (13.2 percent Christians, 1.4 percent Jews). The Egyptian Census of 1986 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 6.1 percent (5.7 percent Christians, 0 percent Jews). The decline in the Jewish representation is interpreted through the creation of the state of Israel, and the subsequent emigration of the Egyptian Jews. There is no explanation for a 55 percent decline in the percentage of Christians in Egypt. It has been suggested that Egyptian censuses held after 1952 have been politicized to under-represent the Christian population.

{{contains Coptic text}}
The [[Coptic language]] is the most recent stage of the [[Egyptian language]]. Coptic should more correctly be used to refer to the script rather than the language itself. Even though this script was introduced as far back as the 1st century BC, it has been applied to the writing of the Egyptian language from the 1st century AD to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stshenouda.com/coptlang/copthist.htm#Definition|title=The Coptic Studies' Corner|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419152624/http://www.stshenouda.com/coptlang/copthist.htm#Definition|archivedate=2012-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coptic remained the spoken language of most Egyptians until it was slowly replaced by colloquial [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 17th century, although it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer.

Today, Coptic is the native language of only about 300 Copts around the world. It is also the [[liturgical language]] of the native Egyptian Churches (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]]). It is taught worldwide in many prestigious institutions, but its teaching within Egypt remains limited.

Dialects of the Coptic language:
* [[Sahidic]]: Theban or [[Upper Egypt]]ian.
* [[Bohairic]]: The dialect of the [[Nile Delta]] and of the medieval and modern Coptic Church.
* [[Akhmimic]]
* [[Lycopolitan]] (also known as Subakhmimic)
* [[Fayyumic]]
* [[Oxyrhynchite]]

==Calendar==
{{Main article|Coptic calendar}}

The Coptic calendar, also called the Alexandrian calendar, is used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and also by [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]] as its official calendar (with different names). This [[calendar]] is based on the ancient [[Egyptian calendar]]. To avoid the calendar creep of the latter, a reform of the ancient Egyptian calendar was introduced at the time of [[Ptolemy III]] (Decree of Canopus, in 238&amp;nbsp;BC) which consisted of the intercalation of a sixth [[epagomenal day]] every fourth year. However, this reform was opposed by the Egyptian priests, and the idea was not adopted until 25&amp;nbsp;BC, when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Augustus]] formally reformed the calendar of [[Egypt]], keeping it forever synchronized with the newly introduced [[Julian calendar]]. To distinguish it from the Ancient Egyptian calendar, which remained in use by some astronomers until medieval times, this reformed calendar is known as the Coptic calendar. Its years and months coincide with those of the [[Ethiopian calendar]] but have different numbers and names.&lt;ref name="calendar"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coptic Calendar of Martyrs|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/easter.html|website=Coptic Orthodox Church Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coptic year===
{{See also|Computus}}
[[File:Coptic cross.svg|left|220px|Coptic Orthodox Cross with traditional Coptic script reading: 'Jesus Christ, the Son of God']]

The Coptic year is the extension of the ancient Egyptian civil year, retaining its subdivision into the three seasons, four months each. The three seasons are commemorated by special prayers in the Coptic Liturgy. This calendar is still in use all over Egypt by farmers to keep track of the various agricultural seasons. The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each and an intercalary month at the end of the year of 5 or 6 days, depending whether the year is a leap year or not. The year starts on 29 August in the [[Julian Calendar]] or on the 30th in the year before (Julian) Leap Years. The Coptic Leap Year follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has six days in the year before a Julian Leap Year.

The Feast of [[Neyrouz]] marks the first day of the Coptic year. Ignorant of the Egyptian language for the most part, the Arabs confused the Egyptian new year's celebrations, which the Egyptians called the feast of ''Ni-Yarouou'' (the feast the rivers), with the Persian feast of [[Nowruz]].&lt;ref name="calendar" /&gt; The misnomer remains today, and the celebrations of the Egyptian new year on the first day of the month of Thout are known as the Neyrouz. Its celebration falls on the 1st day of the month of [[Thout]], the first month of the Egyptian year, which for AD 1901 to 2098 usually coincides with 11 September, except before a Gregorian leap year when it's September 12. Coptic years are counted from AD 284, the year [[Diocletian]] became Roman Emperor, whose reign was marked by tortures and mass executions of Christians, especially in Egypt. Hence, the Coptic year is identified by the abbreviation A.M. (for ''Anno Martyrum'' or "Year of the Martyrs").{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The A.M. abbreviation is also used for the unrelated Jewish year (''Anno Mundi'').{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Every fourth Coptic year is a leap year ''without exception'', as in the Julian calendar, so the above-mentioned new year dates apply only between AD 1900 and 2099 inclusive in the Gregorian Calendar. In the Julian Calendar, the new year is ''always'' 29 August, except before a Julian leap year when it's August 30. [[Easter]] is reckoned by the Julian Calendar in the Old Calendarist way.

To obtain the Coptic year number, subtract from the Julian year number either 283 (before the Julian new year) or 284 (after it).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copticchurch.net/easter.html|title=Coptic Orthodox Calendar / Easter Calculation|website=copticchurch.net|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
Genetic studies of Coptic Egyptians revealed them to be distinct from Muslim Egyptians insofar as they contained less non-Egyptian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996 | doi=10.1038/srep09996| pmid=26017457| pmc=4446898| title=The genetics of East African populations: A Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=9996| year=2015| last1=Dobon| first1=Begoña| last2=Hassan| first2=Hisham Y.| last3=Laayouni| first3=Hafid| last4=Luisi| first4=Pierre| last5=Ricaño-Ponce| first5=Isis| last6=Zhernakova| first6=Alexandra| last7=Wijmenga| first7=Cisca| last8=Tahir| first8=Hanan| last9=Comas| first9=David| last10=Netea| first10=Mihai G.| last11=Bertranpetit| first11=Jaume}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Copts are more closely related to Muslim Egyptians than any other population, and share most of their ancestry with the Muslims. More broadly, studies have showed Copts to be genetically intermediary between the populations of southern Europe and Nubia (two frequently-used reference points), with greater European affinities in the north and greater East African in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Klales, A. R. (2014). "Computed Tomography Analysis and Reconstruction of Ancient Egyptians Originating from the Akhmim Region of Egypt: A Biocultural Perspective". MA Thesis. University of Manitoba. [http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/jspui/bitstream/1993/23992/1/Klales_Alexandra.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. A study of Coptic immigrants from northern Egypt indicated that they are most closely related to Muslim Egyptians, as well as the populations of the southern Levant and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996 | doi=10.1038/srep09996| pmid=26017457| pmc=4446898| title=The genetics of East African populations: A Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=9996| year=2015| last1=Dobon| first1=Begoña| last2=Hassan| first2=Hisham Y.| last3=Laayouni| first3=Hafid| last4=Luisi| first4=Pierre| last5=Ricaño-Ponce| first5=Isis| last6=Zhernakova| first6=Alexandra| last7=Wijmenga| first7=Cisca| last8=Tahir| first8=Hanan| last9=Comas| first9=David| last10=Netea| first10=Mihai G.| last11=Bertranpetit| first11=Jaume}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Y-DNA analysis by Hassan et al. (2008), around 45% of Copts in Sudan carry the [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]]. The remainder mainly belong to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] clade (21%). Both paternal lineages are common among other local [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations (Beja, Ethiopians, Sudanese Arabs), as well as many Nubians.&lt;ref name="Hassan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hassan, Hisham Y., et al.|title=Y‐chromosome variation among Sudanese: Restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=2008|volume=137|issue=3|pages=316–323|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/45024883/Y-chromosome_variation_among_Sudanese_re20160423-13798-werau.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2016|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20876|pmid=18618658}}&lt;/ref&gt; E1b1b/E3b reaches its highest frequencies among North Africans, Levantine Middle Easterners, and Ethiopid Northeast Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Trombetta, Beniamino, et al.|title=Phylogeographic refinement and large scale genotyping of human Y chromosome haplogroup E provide new insights into the dispersal of early pastoralists in the African continent|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|date=2015|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1940–1950|doi=10.1093/gbe/evv118|pmid=26108492|pmc=4524485|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279186127|accessdate=13 October 2016}}; [http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/suppl/2015/06/23/evv118.DC1/Supplementary_Tables_1-7_Revised.xlsx Supplementary Table 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226230059/http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/suppl/2015/06/23/evv118.DC1/Supplementary_Tables_1-7_Revised.xlsx |date=2016-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next most common haplogroups borne by Copts are the European-linked [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] clade (15%), as well as the archaic African [[Haplogroup B-M60|B]] lineage (15%).&lt;ref name="Hassan2008"/&gt;

Maternally, Hassan (2009) found that Copts in Sudan exclusively carry various descendants of the [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|macrohaplogroup N]]. This mtDNA clade is likewise closely associated with local Afroasiatic-speaking populations, including Berbers and Ethiopid peoples. Of the N derivatives borne by Copts, [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6]] is most frequent (28%), followed by the haplogroup [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mohamed|first1=Hisham Yousif Hassan|title=Genetic Patterns of Y-chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation, with Implications to the Peopling of the Sudan|url=http://khartoumspace.uofk.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/6376/Genetic%20Patterns%20of%20Y-chromosome%20and%20Mitochondrial.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=University of Khartoum|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study by Dobon et al. identified an ancestral autosomal component of West Eurasian origin that is common to many modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations in [[Northeast Africa]]. Known as the ''Coptic'' component, it peaks among Egyptian Copts who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. Copts also formed a separated group in [[principal component analysis|PCA]], a close outlier to other Egyptians, Afro-Asiatic-speaking Northeast Africans and Middle East populations. The Coptic component evolved out of a main Northeast African and Middle Eastern ancestral component that is shared by other Egyptians and also found at high frequencies among other Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa (~70%). The scientists suggest that this points to a common origin for the general population of Egypt.&lt;ref name=Dobon2015&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Begoña Dobon, et al.|title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape|journal=Scientific Reports|date=28 May 2015|volume=5|doi=10.1038/srep09996|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2015|pages=9996|pmid=26017457|pmc=4446898}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians.&lt;ref name=Dobon2015-cae&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Begoña Dobon, et al.|title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape|journal=Scientific Reports|date=28 May 2015|volume=5|doi=10.1038/srep09996|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2015|page=8|pmid=26017457|pmc=4446898|quote=The North African/Middle Eastern genetic component is identified especially in Copts.

Copts lack the influence found in Egyptians from Qatar, an Arabic population. It may suggest that Copts have a genetic composition that could resemble the ancestral Egyptian population, without the present strong Arab influence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[César Award]] for Most Promising Actress''' ({{lang-fr|César du meilleur espoir féminin}}) is one of the [[César Awards]], presented annually by the [[Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma]] to recognize the outstanding breakthrough performance of a young actress who has worked within the [[French Cinema|French film industry]] during the year preceding the ceremony. Nominees and winner are selected via a run-off voting by all the members of the Académie, within a group of 16 actresses previously shortlisted by the [[César Award for Most Promising Actress#Révélations|Révélations]] Committee.

In English, the award is variously referred to as "Breakthrough performance, actress"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/prophet-welcome-lead-cesar-noms-19831 |title='A Prophet,' 'Welcome' lead Cesar noms |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=22 January 2010 |agency=AP |author=Rebecca Leffler |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Newcomer, female".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2010/film/awards/cesar-nominations-list-1118015508/ |title=Cesar nominations list |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winners and nominees==
Following the AATC's practice, the films below are listed by year of ceremony, which corresponds to the year following the film's year of release. For example, the César Award for Most Promising Actress of 2010 was awarded on 27 February 2010 for a performance in a film released between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009.

As with the other César awards, actresses are selected via a two-round vote: first round to choose the nominees, second round to designate the winner. All the members of the Académie, without regard to their branch, are eligible to vote on both rounds. But in order to "facilitate" the nomination vote, the Révélations Committee of the Académie, consisting of casting directors, establishes and proposes a list of a maximum of 16 actresses. However, this list is non-binding and Académie members are free to vote for an actress who has not been shortlisted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-cinema.org/en/academy/rules-academy.html "Regulation of the "Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma"], Retrieved 2015-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially set to four, the number of nominees was expanded to five in 1990.

Winners are listed first in '''bold''', followed by the other nominees.

==Révélations==
Each year, the Academy's Governing Board and the Révélations Committee (made up of casting directors working in French film productions) propose a list of a maximum of 16 young actresses ("Révélations des César") to facilitate the voting for the "Most Promising Actress" award. Since 2007, all young actresses who have worked on French feature-length films or primarily French-language productions are eligible for the list. However, beginning from 2013, an actress cannot qualify for the list more than twice. The "Révélations" are also featured in a short film directed by an artist appointed by the Academy yearly. The short film, unveiled at a gala dinner which is organised in honour of the "Révélations", is also later screened at select cinemas in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academie-cinema.org/academie/comites.html|title=Les autres comités |accessdate=19 March 2015 |work=Académie des César}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academie-cinema.org/evenements/revelations.html|title=Révélations |accessdate=19 March 2015 |work=Académie des César}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was led by [[Bo Nat Khann Mway]], also known as "Saw Lah Pwe", until his death in 2016. 

The DKBA-5 split from the original [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]] in 2010 and is loosely affiliated with the [[Karen National Union]]. They have also worked with the [[Arakan Army (Kayin State)|Arakan Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmpeacemonitor.org/stakeholders/stakeholders-overview/193-aa-arakan-army Myanmar Peace Monitor - Arakan Army (Karen Region)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Burmese general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the DKBA-5 attacked government troops and security forces in [[Myawaddy Township]], [[Kayin State]].&lt;ref name="DKBA5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar Peace Monitor: Stakeholders - DKBA-5 |url=http://mmpeacemonitor.org/stakeholders/stakeholders-overview/159-dkba-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group signed a ceasefire agreement with the government on 3 November 2011, though they have not agreed to disarming, unlike their DKBA predecessors in 2010.&lt;ref name="Al-Jazeera"&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Myanmar rebel armies join forces

'''Dost Mahomet Baloch''' (c. 1873&amp;ndash;1909)&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events in the lives of Annie and Dost Mahomet" (Document 0040g), p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Islam in Australia|Australian Baloch]] [[Australian feral camel|cameleer]], who used his animals to transport goods between the ports and remote inland mining and pastoral settlements of the [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields]], [[Pilbara]] and [[Murchison (Western Australia)|Murchison]] regions of [[Western Australia]] at the end of the 19th century.

In 1893, Dost disembarked at the port of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] with 25 camels. He trekked inland with them to Coolgardie seeking work at the new gold diggings. In his early years in the colony, Dost attended night classes at [[Perth Boys High School]] to learn English in which he became very proficient. Dost also has a great-great-great grandson named Jacob Mahomet who attend Dost's 150th anniversary celebration for Burke and Wills&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camel business==
Gold was first discovered in [[Coolgardie]] in 1892 beginning the famous Coolgardie-Kalgoorlie gold rush for surface gold and, later, the extensive underground mining of gold which is still underway. Camel transport operators quickly established themselves here, many living in a tent settlement at the end of Coolgardie Street. Demand for transport was high and Dost acquired more camels and found men to work for him.

Over the next decade, Dost carried goods to remote settlements further north including [[Laverton, Western Australia|Laverton]], [[Wiluna, Western Australia|Wiluna]], [[Cue, Western Australia|Cue]], [[Port Hedland]] and [[Marble Bar]]. He had drays built to help in haulage.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastoral stations had been edging northwards following reports from exploring expeditions led by [[John Forrest|John]] and [[Alexander Forrest]], Lawrence Wells,  David Lindsay and John Wedge. Many of these expeditions relied on some camel transport. De Gray, Mundabullaangana, Pardoo, Tabba Tabba and Wallareenya were all pastoral stations, well established before Port Hedland became a gazetted town in 1896. Camels were still to be seen loaded with wool bales loping between some of these stations and the rail head until the mid nineteen thirties.

Mining operations in the [[Pilbara]] preceded those at Coolgardie with [[gold]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[tantalite]], [[antimony]] and [[bismuth]] being among the minerals chipped from the Pilbara rocks and sands during this period. The miners needed equipment, large and small. Small stores and hotels alongside prospecting sites retailed food, drink, clothing and other supplies which were brought in by camels as well as teams of horses and bullocks and, eventually, by rail from the [[Whim Creek]] wharves. Five years after  the shifting of the port to Port Hedland, a new rail link was made to [[Marble Bar]].

Dost set up a permanent base at Port Hedland in 1906 servicing the Pilbara region. Although his older brother Jorak had preceded Dost to Western Australia, it was Dost who became the leading figure among the cameleers in the north-west. Other Baluch relatives worked in the area alongside other cameleers from  [[Pakistan]],Balochistan, [[Afghanistan]] and [[north india|northern India]]. Many made journeys back and forth between Western Australia, [[South Australia]] and their birthplaces. By law, all were subject to racial restrictions applying to migration, type of business, occupation, employment and location. For example, after 1897, on departure, special permission was needed for those wishing to return to Western Australia. Following the Federation of the Australian colonies, continued residence and entry again required legal permit.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bertola, "Undesirable Persons" in Iain McCalman, Alexander Cook and Andres Reeves, ''Gold Forgotten Histories and Lost Objects of Australia'', (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

European cameleers also worked in the Pilbara, usually hitching wagons behind camel teams, unlike  the method of loading individual camels traditionally used by Baloch and Afghan cameleers.

In 1908, not long after Dost settled in Port Hedland, storekeepers at Marble Bar began arranging contracts with some of the camel operators to have their goods transported from the Port Hedland wharves. Contract rates were lower than the established going rates. Tensions flared. Non contractors refused to cart for the storekeepers and went “on strike” rallying against “non-union” rates. Two hundred and fifty camels at 32 Mile Well were unhobbled and scattered into the scrub. Camel loads were flung to the ground. The dispute was eventually settled after police and officials from both Perth and the local area intervened and facilitated discussions between the opposing parties. Troubles resurfaced periodically - three years later agreement was reached to almost double cartage rates, but it had been a period of financial stress to the cameleers.&lt;ref&gt;Pilbara Goldfields News&lt;/ref&gt;

==An Australian family==
In Coolgardie, Dost Mahomet formed a lasting relationship with Annie Charlotte Grigo, whom he met when she was working at a bakery run by her father. The bakery owner was [[John de Braun]], who also owned the gentleman's grand hotel, the Esplanade in Perth. Annie's family had migrated from [[Shire of Peak Downs|Peak Downs]] in Queensland. Annie's parents were European born – her mother in [[Horsens]], [[Denmark]], her father in [[Mitchulan]], [[Prussia]].

Marriage was opposed by Annie's father and brothers.  The pair eloped by camel and took ship to [[India]]. At Lal Bhaker, Dost's birthplace,  the two were married by traditional Muslim custom.  Annie was 17 years old. Their firstborn was a son, Mustafa born 1896. Annie and Dost then returned to the camel business in Western Australia, leaving their first born in the village.

Five children were born in Western Australia - Lillian Rosetta (1898–1970), Hagu (Ada) 1902-1987), Alious Ameer (Arthur) (c.1904-1988), Jenneth (Jean) (1906-), Pathama (Violet) (1908–1983). The couple led a mobile life working the camels through the goldfields and stations of northwest Western Australia, finally establishing a permanent home in Port Hedland where they were respected members of a small town of approximately 200 by 1909. Their home was built on the block they bought in Kingsmill St. In a seeming challenge to Dost's strict Muslim practices,&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; he bought the old brewery opposite the Esplanade Hotel. The eldest two girls attended the local primary school when it opened in 1906 alongside other children of [[European ethnic groups|European]], [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent.

Camels were hobbled away from the town. The family milked [[goat]]s for [[milk]] and [[butter]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite earlier family antagonisms, once established at Port Hedland, Dost provided finance to assist his wife's sister in her purchase of a hotel a few kilometres from the town. He also assisted two of Annie's brothers  in gaining employment and becoming established in business. Life within the extended family, however was often not harmonious.The brothers were heavy drinkers, sometimes violent and  not always respectful of Muslim practices.

Dost was a short, but strong man.&lt;ref&gt;He was 5 foot 4 inches, with a 53 inch chest. Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling was a sport he engaged in, occasionally with Europeans, but more frequently with other cameleers.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a reputation for quick temper and there are reports of physical violence in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dost and Annie's deaths==
Both parents died violently not longer after building their Australian-style home at Port Hedland.

The full circumstances of Dost's death in 1909 are unclear. It is known that Dost was killed at home during a long and fearsome fight with his two brothers-in-law. One of them fatally smashed open the back of Dost's skull with a heavy piece of jarrah. The two brothers stood trial in Broome in June 1909 but were acquitted of murder. Dost's relatives attributed Dost's death to Annie's brothers and held Annie at least partially responsible for their acquittal.

Dost was a man of wealth as well as standing when he died. He had left a written [[Will (law)|will]] bequeathing his assets to his children and Annie and designating his brother Jorak as executor. Annie left accounts that Jorak was withholding money from her and that life was very difficult. She finally agreed to Jorak's offer of financial security and a good education for the children on condition that she return to India with the children. But, she boarded ship in fear for her life.

In Karachi, she took precautions, for example, establishing contact with the British Resident in the town.  She was well remembered by many of Dost's relatives around Karachi, working and joking alongside women in the village in their day-to-day lives. Warned by some of them of threats to her life, she and the children moved one evening to a compound the other side of Karachi gaining the protection of a trusted relative.

Annie slept with a small revolver under her pillow and a watchdog outside. Three months after landing in Karachi, in August 1910, Annie was stabbed to death in her bed while her two youngest children lay alongside. Two nephews and a third person were charged with murder but were acquitted because of lack of identification.

After the court trial, the five youngest children were returned to Australia under an agreement between the district magistrate at Karachi and the [[Australian Government|Federal]] and [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australian Governments]]. They were eventually placed in the care of the State. After their deaths, accounts of their parents' assets  included camels, property in Port Hedland, monies owing to the estates, and  jewelry, but the children did not come to inherit any of this.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Garnaut, "Events”, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral histories==
With the exception of 15 hours of taped interviews by the [[Battye Library]] in Perth, very little account of their early lives was passed on by the Australian born children. In sharp contrast, many stories about Dost and Annie have been handed down among the relatives around Karachi.

The [[tamarind]] tree that still grows in Port Hedland at the site known as One Mile is reputed to have been planted by Dost Mahomet.

'''The East Side Kids''' were characters in a series of films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1940 through 1945.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]], and several of them later became members of [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play ''[[Dead End (play|Dead End]]'' into the [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film version]], he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play ([[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring [[The Dead End Kids]]. The most successful of these features were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939), starring [[John Garfield]]. Universal offered a competing series, under the [[Little Tough Guys]] brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.

==The East Side Kids==
In 1940 producer [[Sam Katzman]], noting the financial success of other tough-kid series,  made the film ''[[East Side Kids (film)|East Side Kids]]'' using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former [[Our Gang]] player [[Donald Haines]], [[Frankie Burke]], radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of "pilot" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.

Katzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, ''[[Boys of the City]]'' and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) [[Ernie Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]] as "Scruno," the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team.

In the first few films, [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the [[Pete Smith Specialties|Pete Smith]] comedies) played Jordan's older brother ''Knuckles Dolan,'' who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.

[[File:Million Dollar Kid (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bobby Stone]], [[Robert Greig]], [[Leo Gorcey]], and [[Huntz Hall]] in the film ''[[Million Dollar Kid]]'' (1944).]]
Always the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in ''Million Dollar Kid''). In ''Smart Alecks'' he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. [[Stanley Clements]] also appeared in ''Smart Alecks'' as well as '''Neath Brooklyn Bridge'' and ''Ghosts on the Loose''. After Gorcey left the subsequent "Bowery Boys" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.

Monogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its "[[Poverty Row]]" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.

The stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious "Muggs McGinnis" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut "Danny" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's "Glimpy" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (''That Gang of Mine''), murder mystery (''Boys of the City''), boxing melodrama (''Bowery Blitzkrieg''), and horror-comedy (''Spooks Run Wild''), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director [[William Beaudine]] joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.

The contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast.  In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in ''Spooks Run Wild'') returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled ''Ghosts on the Loose'' which also featured a young [[Ava Gardner]]; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic ''[[Let's Get Tough!]]'' from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of ''[[Kid Dynamite (film)|Kid Dynamite]]'' Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In ''Follow The Leader'' (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members [[Billy Benedict]], Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving ''his'' induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.

During Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of "Glove Slingers" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in ''Bowery Champs''.)

Starting with ''Clancy Street Boys'' in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In ''Million Dollar Kid'' he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with [[The Bowery Boys]].

Given the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark [[malapropism|malapropisms]] ("This calls for drastic measurements").

The East Side Kids series was supplanted by [[The Bowery Boys]] in 1946.

'''Edward George Gibson''' (born November 8, 1936) is a former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]], [[aviator|pilot]], [[engineer]], and [[physicist]].

Before becoming a NASA astronaut, Gibson graduated from the [[University of Rochester]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He became a research assistant in [[jet propulsion]] while completing his studies and eventually became a research scientist for [[Philco]] Corporation until joining NASA.

Gibson was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1965 as part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 4|Astronaut Group 4]], the first group of scientist-astronauts. He served on the support crew of [[Apollo 12]] before moving on to work on the development of the [[Skylab]] [[space station]]. In 1973–74, Gibson made his first and only flight into space as science pilot aboard [[Skylab 4]], the third and final manned flight to Skylab. He, along with Commander [[Gerald P. Carr|Gerald Carr]] and Pilot [[William R. Pogue|William Pogue]], spent just over 84 days in space. Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974, but returned in 1977 to preside over the selection of scientist-astronaut candidates. Gibson retired from NASA for the last time in October 1982.&lt;ref name="Burgess 2006 336"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Colin|title=NASA's Scientist-Astronauts|year=2006|pages=336|author2=David J.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Gibson was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], on November 8, 1936.  From ages 2 to 8, Gibson battled [[osteomyelitis]]{{mdash}}soft spots in bones{{mdash}}and spent many months in and out of hospitals.  Newly-available [[penicillin]] cured the disease.  To strengthen his leg that was nearly amputated, Gibson took up sports: swimming, football, and track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22158625/skylab_3_astronauts_are_welded_together/ |title=Skylab 3 Astronauts are Welded Together by a Single Thread |last=Recer |first=Paul |date=1973-11-23 |work=Newspapers.com |access-date=2018-07-24 |publisher=Greely Daily Tribune (Greely, CO) |agency=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from Kenmore Senior High School in [[Kenmore, New York]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[engineering]] from the [[University of Rochester]] in June 1959. At the University of Rochester, Gibson became a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. He received a [[Master of Science]] degree in engineering ([[jet propulsion]] option) from the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in June 1960 and a [[Ph.D.]] in engineering with a minor in [[physics]] from Caltech in June 1964. Gibson has also been presented with [[Honorary degree|honorary]] doctorates of science from the University of Rochester and [[Wagner College]] in [[New York City]], both in 1974.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

He was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He earned the rank of [[First Class Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|First Class]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx Edward G.

===Early career===
While studying at Caltech, Gibson was a research assistant in the field of [[jet propulsion]] and classical [[physics]]. His technical publications are in the fields of [[plasma physics]] and [[solar physics]]. He was senior research scientist with the Applied Research Laboratories of the [[Philco]] Corporation at [[Newport Beach, California]], from June 1964 until moving to NASA. While at Philco, he did research in [[laser]]s and the [[optics|optical breakdown]] of gases.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

Gibson has logged more than 4,300 hours flying time—2,270 hours in [[jet aircraft]].&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

===NASA career===
[[File:Skylab4 - February 1974 astronaut Edward Gibson.jpg|thumb|Gibson's spacewalk during his time on Skylab 4]]
Gibson was selected as a [[Astronaut Group 4|scientist-astronaut]] by NASA in June 1965. He completed a 53-week course in flight training at [[Williams Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], and earned his [[Air Force]] wings. Since then, he has flown [[helicopters]] and the [[T-38 Talon|T-38]].&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

He served as a member of the astronaut support crew and as a [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator .28CAPCOM.29|CAPCOM]] for the [[Apollo 12]] lunar landing, becoming the first from the scientist-astronaut group to get a crew assignment of any kind. He also participated in the design and testing of many elements of the [[Skylab]] space station.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;  As part of his preparation for the Skylab program, Gibson studied [[Sun|solar physics]], ultimately writing an introductory monograph/textbook   on solar [[astrophysics]] ''The Quiet Sun'',   apart from 1973 English edition published in the United States there was 1977 [[Russian language|Russian]] edition of this book, published in the [[Soviet Union]]  by [[Mir Publishers]].

====Skylab 4====
{{Main|Skylab 4}}
[[File:Gibson przy ATM.jpg|thumb|left|Gibson at the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] console in the Skylab Multiple Docking Adapter]]
Gibson was the Science Pilot of [[Skylab 4]] (third and final manned visit to the Skylab space station), launched November 16, 1973, and concluded February 8, 1974. This was the longest manned flight (84 days 1 hour 15 minutes) in the history of manned space exploration at that time. Gibson was accompanied on the record-setting 34.5-million-mile flight by [[Gerald P. Carr]] (Commander) and [[William R. Pogue]] (Pilot). They successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 revolutions of the [[Earth]]. They also acquired a wide variety of earth resources observations data using Skylab’s earth resources experiment package camera and sensor array. Dr. Gibson was the crewman primarily responsible for the 338 hours of Apollo Telescope Mount operation, which made extensive observations of solar processes.&lt;ref&gt;"NASA's Scientist-Astronauts," David Shayler and [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until March 1978, Gibson and his Skylab-4 teammates held the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds, and Gibson logged 15 hours and 22 minutes in three [[extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]] outside the Skylab Orbital Workshop.

Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data as a senior staff scientist with the Aerospace Corporation of [[Los Angeles, California]]. Beginning in March 1976, he served for one year as a consultant to ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, in [[West Germany]], on Spacelab design under the sponsorship of a U.S. Senior Scientist Award form the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]]. In March 1977, Gibson returned to the [[Astronaut Office]] astronaut candidate selection and training as Chief of the Scientist-Astronaut Candidates. During his second tenure at NASA, Gibson had hoped to fly on another space station mission due to his experience on Skylab, but at the same time was not keen on flying a [[Space Shuttle]] mission. Gibson ultimately decided to retire from NASA again on October 31, 1982 and began working for [[TRW Inc.|TRW]].&lt;ref name="Burgess 2006 336"/&gt;

===Post-NASA and later work===
In October 1990, Gibson began his own consulting firm, Gibson International Corp. The firm provides consulting services on program management, market development and space infrastructure design and operations.&lt;ref name="nasabio"/&gt;

After his NASA career, Gibson held marketing and program management positions with [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] and TRW in the areas of  space and energy development. He was the President of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry and his own consulting company, Gibson International. Currently he is Senior vice president, [[Science Applications International Corporation]], and manager of its EROS Data Center Operation in [[Sioux Falls]], [[South Dakota]].

He has performed a significant amount of speaking and writing, having published a text book in solar physics, two novels (''Reach''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reach: a novel |last=Gibson|first=Edward G.|year=1989 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York  |isbn= 978-0-385-26150-0|oclc=19127626|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BiGbAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9780385261500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''In the Wrong Hands''&lt;ref&gt;

'''Eli Whitney''' (December 8, 1765{{snd}}January 8, 1825) was an American inventor best known for inventing the [[cotton gin]].  This was one of the key inventions of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and shaped the economy of the [[Antebellum South]].&lt;ref name="mssa"/&gt;&lt;!-- this citation is being used only for industrial revolution element. We need another citation for the rest of the sentence--&gt;  Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of [[slavery in the United States]]. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost many profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention into securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. He continued making arms and inventing until his death in 1825.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Eli Whitney.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Eli Whitney]]
Whitney was born in [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westborough]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], on December 8, 1765, the eldest child of Eli Whitney Sr., a prosperous farmer, and his wife Elizabeth Fay, also of Westborough.

Although the younger Eli, born in 1765, could technically be called a "Junior", history has never known him as such. He was famous during his lifetime and afterward by the name "Eli Whitney". His son, born in 1820, also named Eli, was well known during his lifetime and afterward by the name "Eli Whitney, Jr."

Whitney's mother, Elizabeth Fay, died in 1777, when he was 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglandancestors.org/database_search/Vital_records.asp|title=Westborough Deaths|date=2001–2008|work=Massachusetts Vital Records to 1850|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|page=275|accessdate=April 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415125328/http://www.newenglandancestors.org/database_search/Vital_records.asp|archivedate=April 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14 he operated a profitable nail manufacturing operation in his father's workshop during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/whitney.html MIT Inventor of the Week archive profile]. From a website funded and administered by [[Lemelson-MIT Program]]. Accessed March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because his stepmother opposed his wish to attend college, Whitney worked as a farm laborer and school teacher to save money. He prepared for Yale at [[Leicester Academy]] (now [[Becker College]]) and under the tutelage of Rev. Elizur Goodrich of [[Durham, Connecticut]], he entered in the fall of 1789 and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1792.&lt;ref name=mssa&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/exhibits/elms/18th_item01.html|title= Elms and Magnolias: The 18th century |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |date=August 16, 1996 |publisher=Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64rvFrU3p?url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 |date=January 21, 2012 }}, Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed October 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney expected to study law but, finding himself short of funds, accepted an offer to go to South Carolina as a private tutor.
[[File:Petition of Eli Whitney to Selectmen of Westborough Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|Petition by Whitney to the [[selectmen]] of [[Westborough, Massachusetts]], to run a public school, with sample of his penmanship]]

Instead of reaching his destination, he was convinced to visit Georgia.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; In the closing years of the 18th century, Georgia was a magnet for New Englanders seeking their fortunes (its Revolutionary-era governor had been [[Lyman Hall]], a migrant from Connecticut). When he initially sailed for South Carolina, among his shipmates were the widow ([[Catherine Littlefield Greene]]) and family of the Revolutionary hero Gen. [[Nathanael Greene]] of Rhode Island. Mrs. Greene invited Whitney to visit her Georgia plantation, [[Mulberry Grove Plantation|Mulberry Grove]]. Her plantation manager and husband-to-be was Phineas Miller, another Connecticut migrant and Yale graduate (class of 1785), who would become Whitney's business partner.

==Career==
Whitney is most famous for two innovations which came to have significant impacts on the United States in the mid-19th century: the [[cotton gin]] (1793) and his advocacy of [[interchangeable parts]]. In the South, the cotton gin revolutionized the way cotton was [[harvest]]ed and reinvigorated slavery. In the North the adoption of interchangeable parts revolutionized the manufacturing industry, and contributed greatly to the U.S. victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3497 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Eli Whitney in Georgia].

===Cotton gin===
{{main|Cotton gin}}
[[File:Cotton gin harpers.jpg|thumb|"First cotton gin" from Harpers Weekly. 1869 illustration depicting event of some 70 years earlier.]]
[[File:Whitney Gin.jpg|right|thumb|Cotton Gin Patent. It shows sawtooth gin blades, which were not part of Whitney's original patent.]]
[[File:Cotton gin EWM 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A cotton gin on display at the [[Eli Whitney Museum]].]]

The cotton gin is a mechanical device that removes the seeds from cotton, a process that had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word ''gin'' is short for ''engine.'' While staying at Mulberry Grove, Whitney constructed several ingenious household devices which led Mrs Greene to introduce him to some businessmen who were discussing the desirability of a machine to
separate the short staple upland cotton from its seeds, work that was then done by hand at the rate of a pound of lint a day. In a few weeks Whitney produced a model.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2246&amp;dat=19180427&amp;id=5PclAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mvwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7052,6418392|title=Cat Gave Him Idea.|last=Gettysburg Compiler - Google News Archive Search|first=|date=April 27, 1918|website=news.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single cotton gin could generate up to {{convert|55|lb}} of cleaned cotton daily. This contributed to the economic development of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] of the United States, a prime cotton growing area; some historians believe that this invention allowed for the [[History of slavery in the United States|African slavery system]] in the Southern United States to become more sustainable at a critical point in its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/whitneycottongin.html|title=Eli Whitney: The Invention of the Cotton Gin|website=www.juliantrubin.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney received a patent (later numbered as X72) for his cotton gin on March 14, 1794,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent for Cotton Gin|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=khh&amp;AN=64084521&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|website=History Reference Center|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. Rather, like the proprietors of [[gristmill|grist]] and [[sawmill]]s, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton – two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of [[History of patent law|patent law]], made [[Patent infringement|infringement]] inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale. Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits (one patent, later annulled, was granted in 1796 to Hogden Holmes for a gin which substituted circular saws for the spikes){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney's first design. There is significant evidence that the design flaws were solved by his sponsor, Mrs. Greene, but Whitney gave her no public credit or recognition.&lt;ref name=EWnameProject&gt;[http://peoplenamedeliwhitney.blogspot.com/2009/10/eli-whitney-really-famous-one.html Eli Whitney Project]  A website for The Eli Whitney Project&lt;/ref&gt;

After validation of the patent, the legislature of South Carolina voted $50,000 for the rights for that state, while North Carolina levied a license tax for five years, from which about $30,000 was realized. There is a claim that Tennessee paid, perhaps, $10,000.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
While the cotton gin did not earn Whitney the fortune he had hoped for, it did give him fame. It has been argued by some historians that Whitney's cotton gin was an important if unintended cause of the American Civil War. After Whitney's invention, the [[Plantations in the American South|plantation slavery]] industry was rejuvenated, eventually culminating in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/civilwarmenu/a/cause_civil_war.htm |title=Top Five Causes of the Civil War |publisher=Americanhistory.about.com |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And the cotton gin transformed Southern agriculture and the national economy.&lt;ref name=EWmuseum&gt;[http://www.eliwhitney.org/ The Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop]  A website for The Eli Whitney Museum in [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden, CT.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Southern cotton found ready markets in Europe and in the burgeoning [[cotton mill|textile mill]]s of [[New England]]. Cotton exports from the U.S. boomed after the cotton gin's appearance – from less than {{convert|500000|lb}} in 1793 to {{convert|93|e6lb|kg}} by 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton was a staple that could be stored for long periods and shipped long distances, unlike most agricultural products. It became the U.S.'s chief export, representing over half the value of U.S. exports from 1820 to 1860.

Paradoxically, the cotton gin, a labor-saving device, helped preserve [[slavery]] in the U.S. Before the 1790s, slave labor was primarily employed in growing rice, tobacco, and [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]], none of which were especially profitable any more. Neither was cotton, due to the difficulty of seed removal. But with the gin, growing cotton with slave labor became highly profitable – the chief source of wealth in the American South, and the basis of frontier settlement from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to Texas. "[[King Cotton]]" became a dominant economic force, and slavery was sustained as a key institution of Southern society.

===Interchangeable parts===
{{main|Interchangeable parts}}
[[File:Eli Whitney's first contract as a gunfounder signed by Oliver Ellsworth 1786.jpg|thumb|upright|First contract of Eli Whitney as a firearms manufacturer, 1798. Signed by [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]].]]
Eli Whitney has often been incorrectly credited with inventing the idea of interchangeable parts, which he championed for years as a maker of [[musket]]s; however, the idea predated Whitney, and Whitney's role in it was one of promotion and popularizing, not invention.&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byson|first1=Bill|title=At Home: A Short History of Private Life|date=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780767919395|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful implementation of the idea eluded Whitney until near the end of his life, occurring first in others' armories.

Attempts at interchangeability of parts can be traced back as far as the [[Punic Wars]] through both archaeological remains of boats now in Museo Archeologico Baglio Anselmi and contemporary written accounts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In modern times the idea developed over decades among many people. An early leader was [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]], an 18th-century French [[artillery|artillerist]] who created a fair amount of [[standardization]] of artillery pieces, although not true interchangeability of parts. He inspired others, including [[Honoré Blanc]] and [[Louis de Tousard]], to work further on the idea, and on shoulder weapons as well as artillery. In the 19th century these efforts produced the "armory system," or [[American system of manufacturing]]. Certain other New Englanders, including [[Captain John H. Hall]] and [[Simeon North]], arrived at successful interchangeability before Whitney's armory did. The Whitney armory finally succeeded not long after his death in 1825.

The motives behind Whitney's acceptance of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney was on the verge of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in [[debt]]. His [[New Haven]] cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The [[French Revolution]] had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time.  Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], sent him a "foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques," possibly one of Honoré Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.

[[File:Eli Whitney Gun Factory William Giles Munson 1827.jpg|thumb|250px|Whitney's gun factory in 1827]]
In May 1798, Congress voted for legislation that would use eight hundred thousand dollars in order to pay for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted. It offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for the person that was able to accurately produce arms for the government. Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed it promised, he accepted the offer. Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until 1809, using multiple excuses for the delay. Recently, historians have found that during 1801–1806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin.&lt;ref name="Baida1987"/&gt;

Although Whitney's demonstration of 1801 appeared to show the feasibility of creating interchangeable parts, [[Merritt Roe Smith]] concludes that it was "staged" and "duped government authorities" into believing that he had been successful. The charade gained him time and resources toward achieving that goal.&lt;ref name="Baida1987"/&gt;

When the government complained that Whitney's price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, he was able to calculate an actual price per musket by including [[fixed cost]]s such as insurance and [[machinery]], which the government had not accounted for. He thus made early contributions to both the concepts of [[cost accounting]], and [[efficiency (economics)|economic efficiency]] in manufacturing.

===Milling machine===
{{main|Milling machine}}

Machine tool historian Joseph W. Roe credited Whitney with inventing the first [[milling machine]] circa 1818. Subsequent work by other historians (Woodbury; Smith; Muir; Battison [cited by Baida&lt;ref name="Baida1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Baida | first = Peter |date=May–June 1987 | title = Eli Whitney's Other Talent | journal = American Heritage | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/eli-whitney%E2%80%99s-other-talent?page=show | id = | accessdate =May 30, 2013 | postscript =. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]) suggests that Whitney was among a group of contemporaries all developing milling machines at about the same time (1814 to 1818), and that the others were more important to the innovation than Whitney was. (The machine that excited Roe may not have been built until 1825, after Whitney's death.) Therefore, no one person can properly be described as the inventor of the milling machine.

==Later life and legacy==
[[File:Eli Whitney 1940 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|upright|Eli Whitney on US Postage [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|Issue of 1940]], 1c]]
[[File:EliWhitneyGraveSouthSideGroveStCemeteryNewHavenCT04152008.JPG|thumb|right|South side of Eli Whitney monument in the [[Grove Street Cemetery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]]]]

Despite his humble origins, Whitney was keenly aware of the value of social and political connections. In building his arms business, he took full advantage of the access that his status as a Yale alumnus gave him to other well-placed graduates, such as [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] (class of 1778), and [[James Hillhouse]], a New Haven developer and political leader.

His 1817 marriage to Henrietta Edwards, granddaughter of the famed [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], daughter of [[Pierpont Edwards]], head of the Democratic Party in Connecticut, and first cousin of Yale's president, [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], the state's leading [[Federalist]], further tied him to Connecticut's [[ruling elite]]. In a business dependent on government contracts, such connections were essential to success.

Whitney died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 8, 1825, in New Haven, Connecticut, just a month after his 59th birthday. He left a widow and his four children behind. During the course of his illness, he invented and constructed several devices to mechanically ease his pain. These devices, drawings of which are in his collected papers, were effective but were never manufactured for use of others due to his heirs' reluctance to trade in "indelicate" items.

The [[Eli Whitney Students Program]],  Yale University's admissions program for non-traditional students, is named in honor of Whitney, who only began his studies there when he was 23,&lt;ref name="Yale Admissions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.yale.edu/eli-whitney |title=Eli Whitney Students Program – A Program for Non-Traditional Students |work=Yale College Admissions |publisher=[[Yale University]] |location=New Haven, CT |accessdate=November 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but went on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in just three years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Francis Ernest Dumas''' (1837 – March 26, 1901) was a wealthy plantation owner and slaveholder of Louisiana. He was of African American and [[Louisiana Creole people|creole]] heritage and served as an officer in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
Francis E. Dumas, born in 1837, was the son of plantation owner Joseph Dumas and was an [[octoroon]] from his mothers side. He spoke five languages and had lived in France for some time, inheriting the sugar plantation upon his return. There was no simple way for him to [[manumit|free]] his slaves under Louisiana state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPIaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Francis+e.+Dumas+manumit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8mN6e1sHZAhVGcq0KHRjmA5AQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Francis+e.+Dumas+manumit&amp;f=false|title=Conversations with Natasha Trethewey|first=Joan Wylie|last=Hall|date=28 August 2013|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the civil war began Dumas freed over 100 of his slaves and enlisted them as a company in the Union Army. He accordingly was commissioned as Captain of Company B of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|1st Louisiana Native Guards]] and received a promotion to Major in the [[2nd Louisiana Regiment Native Guard Infantry|2nd Louisiana Native Guards]], one the highest ranks achieved by an African American during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9X5YxKNW4PEC&amp;pg=PT42&amp;lpg=PT42&amp;dq=francis+ernest+dumas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_G-1aXn7S_&amp;sig=IzXE3S-f7SPMBcwksw2_oXsezdc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY1-urlMHZAhVMKawKHbhVAasQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=francis+ernest+dumas&amp;f=false|title=Thank God My Regiment an African One: The Civil War Diary of Colonel Nathan W.

He was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1868 on the [[James G. Taliaferro]] ticket backed by publisher [[Louis Charles Roudanez]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2505">'''Francisco "Franky" Carrillo''' was convicted of the 1991 shooting murder of Donald Sarpy. His conviction was reversed by the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] on March 14, 2011, after he had served twenty years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Kenny|title=Making a new life after 20 years of false imprisonment|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21972058|accessdate=1 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News Magazine|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His conviction relied on eyewitness testimony from six people. The witnesses later admitted they did not have a view of the shooter, and instead had been influenced by police officers, and each other, to identify Carrillo. Two men since confessed to the crime, and stated Carrillo was not involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franky Carrillo|url=http://www.safecalifornia.org/stories/innocent/carrillo|work=Safe California|publisher=SAFE CA|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although always protesting his innocence, Carrillo was found guilty at his initial trial, and subsequent appeals. After Carrillo's case was taken on by Ellen Eggers, the [http://law.scu.edu/ncip/ Northern California Innocence Project], and attorneys from Morrison &amp; Foerster, LLP, he was able to conclusively prove his innocence.

Carrillo's story has twice been featured on the [[podcast]] ''[[Strangers (podcast)|Strangers]]'' by [[Lea Thau]]. He is married, has 3 children, and is planning a run for the California State Assembly.

'''Freddy Fender''' (born '''Baldemar Garza Huerta'''; June 4, 1937 – October 14, 2006) was a [[Mexican American]] [[Tejano music|Tejano]], [[country music|country]] and [[rock and roll]] musician, known for his work as a solo artist and in the groups [[Los Super Seven]] and the [[Texas Tornados]]. He is best known for his 1975 hits "[[Before the Next Teardrop Falls (song)|Before the Next Teardrop Falls]]" and the subsequent remake of his own "[[Wasted Days and Wasted Nights]]".

==Early years==
Fender was born in [[San Benito, Texas]], to Margarita (Garza) Huerta and her Mexican immigrant husband, Serapio Huerta. He made his debut radio performance at age 10 on [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]]'s radio station [[KGBT (AM)|KGBT]], singing a then-hit, "Paloma Querida."&lt;ref name=freddy&gt;Kasten, Roy (2002, March/April). [http://archives.nodepression.com/2002/03/the-ballad-of-baldemar-huerta/ "The Ballad of Baldemar Huerta."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605192819/http://archives.nodepression.com/2002/03/the-ballad-of-baldemar-huerta/ |date=2013-06-05 }} [[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]], 38.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fender dropped out of high school at age 16 in 1953, and when he turned 17, he enlisted for three years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=freddy /&gt; He served time in the [[brig]] on several occasions because of his drinking, and he was court martialed in August 1956 and discharged with rank of [[Private (rank)|private]] (E-1). According to Fender, he later received a letter from the [[U.S. Department of the Navy]] saying that he had been wrongfully discharged dishonorably because of [[alcoholism]], and he was given a general discharge.&lt;ref name=freddy /&gt; He returned to Texas and played nightclubs, bars, and honky-tonks throughout the south, mostly to Latino audiences. In 1957, then known as El Bebop Kid, he released two songs to moderate success in [[Mexico]] and [[South America]]: Spanish-language versions of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" (as "''No Seas Cruel''") and [[Harry Belafonte]]'s "Jamaica Farewell." He also recorded his own Spanish version of [[Hank Williams]]'s "[[Cold Cold Heart]]" under the title "''Tu Frío Corazón''."

He became known for his [[rockabilly]] music and his cool persona as Eddie con los Shades. In 1958 he legally changed his name from Baldemar Huerta to Freddy Fender. He took the name [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from the guitar and amplifier, and Freddy because the alliteration sounded good and would "sell better with Gringos!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrystarsonline.com/SOWArchive/2006/FreddyFender_CHH.htm Countrystarsonline.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095309/http://www.countrystarsonline.com/SOWArchive/2006/FreddyFender_CHH.htm |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to California.

==Initial success==
In 1959 Fender recorded the [[blues ballad]] "[[Wasted Days and Wasted Nights]]." The song was a hit, but he was beset by legal troubles in May 1960 after he and a band member were arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. After serving nearly three years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, he was released through the intervention of then-governor [[Jimmie Davis]], also a songwriter and musician. Davis requested that Fender stay away from music while on probation as a condition of his release. However, in a 1990 [[NPR]] interview on ''[[Fresh Air with Terry Gross]]'' (rebroadcast October 17, 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6283208 |title=Remembering Freddy Fender |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fender said that the condition for parole was to stay away from places that served alcohol.

By the end of the 1960s, Fender was back in Corpus Christi, Texas, working as a mechanic and attending local  college, Del Mar College, while playing music only on the weekends.

==Number one on pop and country charts==
[[File:Freddy Fender singing in 1977.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Freddy Fender performing in 1977]]
In 1974 Fender recorded "[[Before the Next Teardrop Falls (song)|Before the Next Teardrop Falls]]." The single was selected for national distribution and became a number-one hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Country and Pop charts. It sold over a million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in May 1975.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book

Between 1975 and 1983 Fender charted 21 country hits, including "[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]," "[[Vaya con Dios (song)|''Vaya con Dios'']]," "Livin' It Down," and "The Rains Came." "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights" became Fender's second million-selling single, with the gold disc presentation taking place in September 1975.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/&gt;

Fender also was successful on the pop charts. Besides "Before the Next Teardrop Falls" reaching number one on the pop charts in May 1975, "Wasted Days And Wasted Nights" went into the pop top 10 and "Secret Love" into the top 20. "Since I Met You Baby," "You'll Lose A Good Thing" (his last pop top 40), "''Vaya con Dios''," and "Livin' It Down" (his last to reach the pop top 100) all did well on the pop charts.

While notable for his genre-crossing appeal, several of Fender's hits featured verses or choruses in Spanish. Bilingual songs seldom hit the pop charts, and when they did, it was because of novelty. Bilingual songs reaching the country charts were even more unusual.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Swamp pop influences===
Fender was heavily influenced by the [[swamp pop]] sound from southern Louisiana and southeast Texas, as is shown by his recording swamp pop standards on his 1978 album ''Swamp Gold''. One of his major hits, "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights," has a typical swamp pop ballad arrangement. Fender associated with swamp pop musicians such as [[Joe Barry]] and [[Rod Bernard]] and issued many recordings on labels owned by [[Huey Meaux]], a [[Cajun]] who specialized in swamp pop. As music writer John Broven observed, "Although Freddy was a [[Chicano]] from Texas marketed as a country artist, much of his formative career was spent in South Louisiana; spiritually, Fender's music was from the Louisiana swamps."&lt;ref name=Broven&gt;John Broven, ''South to Louisiana: The Music of the Cajun Bayous'' (Gretna, La.: Pelican, 1983), pp. 281-82. See also Shane K. Bernard, ''Swamp Pop: Cajun and Creole Rhythm and Blues'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1996), 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

===Texas Tornados===
In 1989 Fender teamed up with fellow [[Tejano music|Tex–Mex]] musicians [[Doug Sahm]], [[Flaco Jiménez]], and [[Augie Meyers]] to form the [[Texas Tornados]], whose work meshed ''[[conjunto]], [[Tejano]]'', [[R&amp;B]], [[Country music|country]], and [[blues]] to wide acclaim. When the Texas Tornados went to audition for Warner Bros. Records, Fender did not think that the group was strong enough, so he brought his own band. The audition was nearly a bust, because he played country music and that was not what the executives were looking for. Fender was persuaded to play some vintage rock and blues numbers, which was what the executives were looking for, and was subsequently given a record contract. After being a solo act, Fender was not sure if signing with a group was a good thing, but according to Fender, he "just wanted to record for a major label." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = "Winds of Change" Chicago Tribune|last = Hurst|first = J|date = July 19, 1991|work = newspaper|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group released four albums and won a [[Grammy]] in 1990 for Best Mexican American Performance for the track "''Soy de San Luis''". Fender described the group in this way: "You've heard of [[New Kids on the Block]]? Well, we're the Old Guys in the Street." Following the death of Sahm, the Tornados' production slowed. A live 1990 appearance on TV's ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', one of three the group made, was released in 2005 as part of the ''Live From Austin, Texas'', series.&lt;ref name="Tarradell"&gt;Tarradell, Mario. [http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/obituaries/stories/101506dntexfender.3aa74e12.html "Singer Freddy Fender dies at age 69"], ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', 15 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Super 7===
In the late 1990s, Fender joined another supergroup, [[Los Super Seven]], with [[Los Lobos]]' [[David Hidalgo]] and [[César Rosas]], Flaco Jiménez, [[Ruben Ramos]], [[Joe Ely]], and country singer [[Rick Trevino]]. The group won a 1998 Grammy in the Mexican American Performance category for their self-titled disc.&lt;ref name="Tarradell" /&gt;

===Later work===
In 2001 Fender made his final studio recording, a collection of classic Mexican ''[[boleros]]'' titled ''[[La Música de Baldemar Huerta]]'' that brought him a third Grammy award, this time in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album|Latin Pop Album]]. Rose Reyes, who worked with Fender in 2004 for a Texas Folklife and Austin tribute titled "Fifty Years of Freddy Fender," said of the album, "When he did Mexican standards at that point in his career, I expected it to be good because he's a perfectionist. But that record is so beautifully recorded; his voice is perfection. I was so proud it was coming back to his roots."&lt;ref name="Tarradell" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On March 13, 2001, Fender was [[List of premature obituaries|erroneously reported to be dead]] by ''Billboard''. He laughed off the magazine's error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandez |first=Sara Lee |title=Qué pasó: Despite magazine report, Fender's OK |url=http://web.caller.com/2001/march/16/today/localnew/20398.html |accessdate=2 May 2014 |newspaper=CC Caller Times |date=March 16, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502232321/http://web.caller.com/2001/march/16/today/localnew/20398.html |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent a [[kidney]] [[Organ transplant|transplant]] in 2002 with a kidney donated by his daughter and underwent a liver transplant in 2004. Nonetheless, his condition continued to worsen. He was suffering from an "incurable cancer" in which he had tumors on his lungs. On December 31, 2005, Fender performed his last concert and resumed [[chemotherapy]].

He died on October 14, 2006, at the age of 69 of [[lung cancer]] at his home in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], with his family at his bedside. He was buried in his hometown of San Benito.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/14/AR2006101400595.html|title=Tex-Mex Singer Freddy Fender Dies at 69|first=LYNN|last=BREZOSKY|date=15 October 2006|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had said in a 2004 interview with the Associated Press that he wished to become the first Mexican American inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

A Freddy Fender Museum and The Conjunto Music Museum opened November 17, 2007, in San Benito. They share a building with the San Benito Historical Museum. His family maintains the Freddy Fender Scholarship Fund and donates to philanthropic causes that Fender supported.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Film credits==
In 1988 Fender played the mayor of a small [[New Mexico]] town in the [[Robert Redford]]–directed film ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]''. Fender also appeared as Tony in the prison movie ''[[Short Eyes (film)|Short Eyes]]'', a 1977 film adaptation, directed by Robert M. Young, of the Miguel Pinero play.
Fender played the role of Pancho Villa in 1979s ''[[She Came to the Valley]]'' (later released as ''Texas in Flames''). The movie was directed by [[Albert Band]] and based on the book by Cleo Dawson.  
Fender also appeared as himself in an episode of the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''.

'''Abbé Guy-Toussaint-Julien Carron''' (1760–1821) was a [[France|French]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] who founded a number of social and educational institutions, especially while in exile in [[England]], and was a prolific author of pious tracts.

==Life==
Born in [[Rennes]], he soon employed himself in founding a variety of social institutions including a [[textile]] [[factory]] to employ the deprived inhabitants of his native town in 1789 and an institution for young women trying to escape a life of [[prostitution]]. However, in 1790, following the [[French Revolution]], he became a ''non-juror'', refusing to [[oath|swear]] to the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], and was [[imprisoned]].&lt;ref name="bouillet"&gt;Bouillet &amp; Chassang (1878)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, he was [[deported]] to [[Jersey]] where he founded [[school]]s, [[libraries]] and [[pharmacies]] for fellow French Catholics who had fled the Revolution. He resettled in [[Somers Town, London]] and established many educational and social institutions to support his community,&lt;ref&gt;Walford (1878)&lt;/ref&gt; winning the personal thanks of [[Louis XVIII]].&lt;ref name="bouillet"/&gt;

On the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1814, Carron returned to France and became head of the ''[[Institut de Marie-Thérèse]]'', a [[Charitable organization|charity]] founded for children whose families had lost their fortunes during the Revolution.&lt;ref name="bouillet"/&gt;

He published many pious and religious works which were very popular in their time.&lt;ref name="bouillet"/&gt;

'''Hasan Abdullah Ismaik''' ({{lang-ar|حسن عبدالله إسميك}}) is a [[Jordan]]ian businessman and Chairman of Hasan Abdullah Mohammed Group (HAMG Group), a UAE-based group of investment companies founded by Ismaik in 2006. He owns Marya Development &amp; Real Estate Investment LLC, a private investment company in the [[United Arab Emirates]] with a diversified investment portfolio that includes projects worth US$4 billion. He is the Chairman and majority shareholder of the German sports club [[TSV 1860 Munich]]; Chairman of Al-Ashmal Real-Estate Investment Co. in [[Jordan]]; and Chairman of publicly-listed Masaken for Land and Industrial Development Projects (Masaken Capital). In 2014, [[Forbes]] Magazine listed Ismaik as the first Jordanian [[billionaire]] and the third-youngest billionaire in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="frbs"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2014/06/02/arabtec-ceo-hasan-ismaik-becomes-first-jordanian-billionaire/#73ff2f1e6851 Arabtec CEO Hasan Ismaik Becomes First Jordanian Billionaire].

Ismaik had his name in the media when the shares in Depa had risen steadily over one year, increasing from about 40 fils in August 2013 to a high of 71 fils on June 2013 that was the day before he [[resigned]] from his position as the chairman of Depa, leaving the [[Nasdaq]] [[Dubai]]-quoted firm, [[Arabtec]] without a chairman. However, the company drastically scaled back its plans after Mr Ismaik abruptly resigned, sending shares into a [[freefall]] and leaving [[question]] marks hanging over non-core business of Ismaik.&lt;ref name="ntnl"&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/markets/dubai-regulators-suspension-of-depa-shares-is-legacy-of-arabtec-troubles] The National (August 26, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in March 2016 thereby  were [[rumours]] that Hasan Ismaik, will be appointed to the board of Arabtec again, however "the rumours over the appointment of Mr Hasan Ismaik as Chairman or member of the board of directors of Arabtec are false and are not based on any true facts or events," Arabtec said in a bourse filing.&lt;ref name="rtrs"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/arabtec-moves-idUSD5N13P02G] Reuters (Mon Mar 7, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ismaik launched his career as a real estate entrepreneur in [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], with a specific interest in the oil and gas sectors. Following the introduction of the freehold property law that sparked the real estate boom in Dubai, he transferred his business focus to the UAE market where he continued to gain commercial achievements.&lt;ref name="frbs" /&gt;

==Investments==
He pushed plans to diversify his investment portfolio and explored new investment and asset acquisition opportunities in industries as diverse as [[energy]], [[real estate]], [[construction]], [[transportation]], [[retail]] and architectural design services.&lt;ref name="frbs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hamgb"&gt;[http://www.hamg.ae/business-units/real-estate/marya/ Business Units] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422095134/http://www.hamg.ae/business-units/real-estate/marya |date=2016-04-22 }}.

==Acquisition of shares of TSV 1860 Munich==
In June 2011, Ismaik bought 60 percent, an investment of €18 million ($25.8 million) of [[TSV 1860 Munich]], a German sports club based in [[Munich]] that plays in the 4. Liga. Becoming the first [[Arab]] to acquire shares of a German [[football]] club, Ismaik claimed that his aim was to safeguard the survival of the club that was one of the founding members of the German national Bundesliga.&lt;ref name="hamgmunich"&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/mideast-money-saves-germany-s-tsv-1860-munchen-404833.html#.VxNcuvl95D- Mideast money saves Germany's TSV 1860 Munchen]. Arabian Business (12 June 2011). Retrieved on 17 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to DFL regulations, Ismaik only has 49 percent of the voting rights; the additional shares are without voting rights.

Ismaik commented on the acquisition:

{{Quote|text=TSV 1860 has a great tradition and identity that ought to be preserved and supported. The club has enormous potential and a truly great and passionate fan base. I will do everything to bring TSV 1860 back into the profit zone.”''|source=[[Arabian Business]]&lt;ref name="hamgmunich" /&gt;}}

The acquisition was followed by a long and controversial discussion about Ismaik's goals and intentions regarding this investment, which is still ongoing (Status as of December 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.n-tv.de/sport/fussball/Loewen-Investor-holt-zum-Rundumschlag-aus-article19182611.html|title=Beispiellose Attacke gegen 1860: Löwen-Investor holt zum Rundumschlag aus|last=Nachrichtenfernsehen|first=n-tv|newspaper=n-tv.de|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the acquisition of the shares, neither the financial situation nor the sporting success of TSV 1860 Munich have improved significantly.

At the end of the 2016-17 season, TSV 1860 Munich were relegated to the third tier of German football following a play-off defeat against Jahn Regensburg. Unable to resolve his differences with club officials regarding his control of the club, Ismaik refused to provide the approximately ten million euros necessary for a 3.Liga playing license and the club was subsequently automatically relegated even further to the regional fourth tier. Ismaik remains in control.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Charitable and social responsibility activities==

He has been actively involved in numerous social, charitable and humanitarian activities in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Jordan]].

__NOTOC__
'''Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim''' (July 20, 1819 in [[Frankfurt]] &amp;ndash; March 29, 1880 in [[Berlin]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[publicist]] and [[philosopher]] concerned with the ideas of [[liberalism]], [[free trade]] and [[international law]].

Oppenheim was son of a [[Jewish]] family of bankers in Frankfurt and studied [[law]] in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. In Berlin he could not reach a postdoctoral lecturer qualification because of his Jewish origin, so he became a private lecturer (''[[Privatdozent]]'') for political science and international law in Heidelberg.
But his inclinations to [[journalism]] soon won the upper hand, and, his living assured by his family, he gave up teaching.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;
[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very much taken by the questions surrounding the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|movements of 1848]].  His feeble attempts at practical politics nevertheless foundered and left him more and more to make himself known through his pen and his theories.  He spoke at the agitated mass meeting at Unter den Zelten where the legislature's petition to the king regarding the wishes of the people was discussed.  He became one of the chief editors, with [[Arnold Ruge]] and Eduard Meyen, of “Die Reform” (The Reform) which soon came under the oversight of several [[democracy|democratic]] groups. Among his other co-workers on this paper were [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Karl Heinzen]] and [[Georg Herwegh]]. Oppenheim sought a seat in the National Assembly. He thought it sufficient to refer to his writings in “Die Reform” where he developed his premise “that only with freedom did the people become mature enough for freedom,” but the people of Berlin had no patience with a candidate who campaigned only with his pen. This experience convinced him even more he that he was suited to a writing career, as he did not seem suited to speaking.&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt;

He went to [[Baden]] and, looking for secrets, broke into the private files of the departed archduke.  [[Lorenzo Brentano]], the leader of the provisional government, put him in charge of the government newspaper, the “Karlsruher Zeitung”.  When a schism broke out between Brentano's moderates and [[Gustav Struve]]'s terrorists, Oppenheim worked for the latter, and was dismissed from the newspaper when they failed.  He then traveled to [[Switzerland]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and England. He returned in 1850 and continued to publish works on democratic ideas.  He denounced the democrats for the victories of the Reaction, but thought the latter were ultimately to blame because they turned to raw despotic power rather than continuing with their phony constitutionalism.&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt;

In 1861 Oppenheim joined the [[German Progress Party]] and edited the ''Yearbook for Politics and Literature'' which was banned soon afterwards. He also became a member of the Congress of German Economists, as he was known as an excellent economist and supporter of free trade. He also paid attention to social matters.

The occurrences of 1866 worked a great transformation in Oppenheim.  He greeted the new order with joy while other liberals were more skeptical.  Oppenheim joined the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberals]] and supported [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s strategy for national unification. He wrote two flyers for the elections, one of which only saw limited distribution since the leaders saw it as too radical.  After 1870, for the first time he directly discussed practical questions, writing on [[poor laws]] and [[economics]].  He was also critical of “fanciful thinkers about the future among the teachers in the universities.”&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt;

In 1874, he was elected Member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] representing [[Reuss (state)|Reuß ä. L.]] and took his seat as an expert on the 1869 changes to commercial regulations.  In 1877 he lost his seat to a social democrat.&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt;  In reaction to Bismarck’s [[protectionism|protectionist policy]] he split with his party in 1880.

Oppenheim’s philosophical work is concentrated on [[parliamentarism]] the idea of [[Social welfare|common welfare]]. He coined the phrase “lectern socialism” (''German'' "''Kathedersozialismus''").

In his short two-year career, he became the first Frenchman to reach the level of the English members of the [[Alpine Club]], in the [[silver age of alpinism]] in the second half of the 19th century, which was dominated by the development of mountaineering in the Alps. With some of the Alpine Club's mountain guides and mountaineers, he led significant first ascents in the [[Mont Blanc massif]] and in the [[Dauphiné Alps]] (the [[Massif des Écrins]]).

== Biography ==
A grandson of geologist [[Louis Cordier]] and a great-nephew of politician and scientist [[Louis Ramond de Carbonnières]], Henri Cordier pursued studies at the ''[[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]'', founded in 1872, where he received high honors.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Death of M.

His brief Alpine career combined talent and audacity. In the 1876 season he succeeded in making eleven [[first ascent]]s. He claimed to have climbed the western peak of the [[Meije]] that year, but was subsequently forced to retract the claim.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOQSp_fJQs4C&amp;pg=PA308|last=Fleming|first=Fergus|title=Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps|year=2000|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Monthly Press]]|isbn=0-87113-778-X|lccn=00-04335|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accident ==
Descending from Le Plaret, the group left the glacier, successfully passed the crevasse zone, unroped and ate a meal. Afterwards, Cordier went ahead. In front of his horrified companions, he performed a [[Glissade (climbing)#Standing glissade|standing glissade]] down a steep snow slope above the glacial torrent of [[La Clause]] below the surface. The snow surface broke suddenly and Cordier was carried away by the white water under the ice and drowned.&lt;ref name="Braham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WCT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WCT18770903.2.14&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all|title=Extraordinary Alpine Accidents|journal=West Coast Times|issue=Putanga 2629|date=3 Mahuru 1877|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakob Anderegg was lowered into the twelve-foot hole on a rope, but could find no trace of Cordier and nearly suffocated before being pulled up.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangar"/&gt; According to [[Henri Béraldi]], Cordier had very poor eyesight, but refused glasses due to vanity. As he amused himself by slipping on the snowy slope, he was alerted by his guides and replied, "Ne vous inquiétez pas, je vais m'arrêter sur ce rocher noir" ("Do not worry, I'll stop on the black rock"). Unfortunately for Cordier, the rock in reality was a hole.&lt;ref name="Béraldi"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henri|last=Béraldi|authorlink=Henri Béraldi|title=Cent ans aux Pyrénées|trans-title=One hundred years in the Pyrenees|location=Paris|year=1898–1904}} Seven volumes.

== Legacy ==
In memory of Henri Cordier, the [[Pic de Neige Cordier]], located above the [[Glacier Blanc]] in the Massif des Ecrins, was named after him. It was climbed for the first time on 3 August 1877 by Paul Guillemin, Émile Pic, and Pierre Estienne. Cordier also gave his name to posterity in two first-routes, which he had executed in 1876 with Thomas Middlemore, John Oakley Maund and guides Jakob Anderegg, Andreas Maurer and Johann Jaun: the Cordier Couloir on the North Face of the [[Aiguille Verte]] and the Cordier route on the north face of [[Les Courtes]] (both in the Mont Blanc massif).

Grosch's Law is an [[aphorism]] that states "economy is as the square root of the speed." 

==Biography==
Born on September 13, 1918, in [[Canada]], he moved to the [[United States]] where he received his B.S. and PhD in astronomy from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1942.  In 1945, he was hired by [[IBM]] to do backup calculations for the [[Manhattan Project]] working at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory]] at [[Columbia University]]. According to an IBM history, he had been previously employed as an optical engineer in defense industry and was eager to return to research.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Jean Ford, [http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/brennan/ ''The IBM Watson Laboratory at Columbia University: A History], IBM, Armonk, New York, February 18, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he went on to work on [[Project Whirlwind]] at [[MIT]], and on other early computer projects at [[General Electric]]. Back at IBM, he served as their first space program manager in 1958-1959.

Grosch served as editor of the journal ''[[Computerworld]]'' from 1973 to 1976, and he was the president of the [[American Rocket Society]] (which became the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]) and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] from 1976 to 1978. 

Grosch received the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] Fellows Award in 1995, and the citation that accompanied it read, "A computer pioneer who managed important space and technology projects, Grosch is respected for discovering and describing the relationship between speed and cost of computers."

He holds the distinction of being the second scientist hired by [[IBM]] (after [[Wallace J. Eckert]]) and the first employee at that company with facial hair, at a time when beards were prohibited by IBM.

On Grosch's religious views, he was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grosch|first=Herbert|title=Smithsonian National Museum of American History - Computer Oral History Collection, 1969-1973, 1977 - Interview with Herbert R.

'''Hienadź Sahanovič''' (Генадзь Сагановіч) is a [[Belarus]]ian historian. He specializes in the early modern period of Central European and Belarusian history.

== Education and academic career ==

In 1984 Sahanovič graduated from the [[Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University]] in [[Minsk|Miensk]]. Beginning in 1986 he became an active member of the democratic oppostion in Soviet Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;«Бабілён» http://www.slounik.org/153727.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Sahanovič obtained a PhD degree in history from the Institute of History, [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]], where he worked as a researcher between 1984 and 2005.  His employment was terminated,&lt;ref&gt;Arkadź Šanski. 2005. Sahanovič zvolnieny [Sahanovič was Fired {from the Institute of History}]. ''Naša niva'', July 1. https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=100176&lt;/ref&gt; in the course of the politically-motivated purge of historians and social scientists, whose research did not follow the government's official line.&lt;ref&gt;The cause of Sahanovič's dismissal was the fact that during his leisure he went to do archival research in Cracow. Officially, the institute maintains that the historian was dismissed, because he published an article on the state of Belarusian historiography in the Russian periodical ''Rodina''. (See: Sahanoviču pahražajuć zvalnieńniem [Sahanovič Threatened with Dismissal]. 2005. ''Naša niva'', April 26. https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=100133). After 2003 many leading Belarusian historians were dismissed from the Belarusian Academy of Sciences and the country's universities in order to reformulate the officially espoused vision of Belarusian history by making it more pro-Russian.

The English actor and comedian [[Ian Carmichael]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1920–2010) performed in many mediums of [[light entertainment]], including theatre, radio, television and film. His career spanned from 1939 until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name="IC: DNB" /&gt; According to Brian McFarlane, writing for the [[British Film Institute]], Carmichael "epitomises the good-natured, undemanding pleasures of '50s British cinema".&lt;ref name="BFI: Screenonline" /&gt;

Carmichael made his professional stage debut in 1939 while he was studying at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]; his role was as a robot in the [[science fiction]] play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', which lasted for only a week.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=27}} His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, and he was commissioned into the [[Royal Armoured Corps]]; he also joined an entertainment unit, 30 Corps Theatrical Pool, for which he produced twenty shows.&lt;ref name="IC: DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt; At the end of the war he returned to professional acting, and in 1947 he took a role in ''She Wanted a Cream Front Door'', which ran in the [[West End theatre|West End]] for nine months.&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt; He continued to perform in the theatre throughout the rest of  his career, largely in the UK, but also in productions in Canada, South Africa and the United States.&lt;ref name="IC: DNB" /&gt; In 1947 Carmichael made his debut on television in the [[revue]] ''New Faces''.&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt;{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=205}} He continued to work in television throughout his life and, according to McFarlane, achieved considerable success with [[P.G. Wodehouse]]'s ''The World of Wooster'' in 1966–67, in which he played [[Bertie Wooster]], and as [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] between 1972 and 1975.&lt;ref name="BFI: Screenonline" /&gt;

Carmichael made his radio debut in 1947 in the [[BBC Home Service]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Theatre]]'', and continued to appear throughout his career. Included in his output were dramatisations of the Wimsey novels and Wodehouse's works, this time as [[Galahad Threepwood]] in the [[Blandings Castle]] stories.&lt;ref name="IC: DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt; In 1948 Carmichael made his cinematic debut in an uncredited role in ''[[Bond Street (film)|Bond Street]]'',{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=27}} and went on to establish a film career in the 1950s when he appeared in films by the [[Boulting brothers]], including ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956), ''[[Lucky Jim (1957 film)|Lucky Jim]]'' (1957), ''[[Brothers in Law (film)|Brothers in Law]]'' (1957), ''[[Happy Is the Bride]]'' (1958) and ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt; On Carmichael's death in 2010 [[Dennis Barker]], writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', observed that "what made Carmichael notable was that he could play fool parts in a way that did not cut the characters completely off from human sympathy: a certain dignity was always maintained."&lt;ref name="Guard: obit" /&gt;

'''James Shaibu Barka''' was elected a member of the [[Adamawa State]], [[Nigeria]] House of Assembly, and was appointed Speaker. When Adamawa State Governor [[Murtala Nyako]]'s election was nullified in February 2008, Barka became Acting Governor, handing back to Nyako after he had been reelected on 29 April 2008.

Barka was elected to the Adamawa Assembly for the Hong constituency.
In July 2003, as Majority Leader of the Assembly, he successfully moved a motion to dissolve the State Civil Service Commission, State Independent Electoral Commission and the Judicial Service Commission, replacing them by management committees with members nominated by the governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Johan Henri Quanjer''' (23 May 1934 &amp;ndash; 13 February 2001) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] author, publisher,  and [[New Age]] philosopher and mystic who spent most of his adult life in [[London]]. In 1973 he coined the term "[[Pneumatocracy]]" for the principle of the rule of the spirit in government and sought to combines politics with personal spirituality.

He was born in [[Surabaya]] on the island of [[Java]], where he reported he experienced a mystical vision as a child of two. His family moved to [[Epe, Netherlands]] in 1937. He then suffered near starvation during the [[The Netherlands in World War II|German occupation]] of [[World War II]]. As a young man he travelled in Canada and America, where he refined his philosophy, but settled in London in 1957 where he became president of the [[UFO]] society and editor of the magazine ''[[New Humanity]]''. In 1994 he stood for the [[European Parliament]] in the then London South West Constituency on the platform of the ''Spirit of Europe''. He was the first non-British national ever to be nominated to stand in a UK election. He was a strong believer and promoter of the [[European Union]]. His autobiography ''The Luminous Journey: The Reflection of Pneumatocracy, the Rule of the Soul, in My Extraordinary Life'' was published in 1996.

'''Dr. John "Gray Wolf" Williams''' became the oldest active professional mixed martial artist at age 70, when he made his professional fight debut against Larry Brewbaker on July 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowlkes |first=Ben |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/07/29/70-year-old-mma-fighter-john-williams-got-in-the-cage-to-feel-al/ |title=70-Year-Old MMA Fighter John Williams Got in the Cage to Feel Alive Again |publisher=MMA Fighting |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Williams was born in the small town of Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada on March 7, 1940.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mrjamesryan.com/2010/07/22/dr-john-williams-70-year-old-mma-fighter-setting-guinness-world-records/|title=Dr. John Williams: 70-Year-Old MMA Fighter Setting Guinness World Records|last=Ryan|first=James|date=July 22, 2010|website=The Fallen Trail|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams belonged to the Native American tribe Wabenaki, and was a direct ancestor of the great Wabenaki war chief Madockaweando.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both of John's parents spoke French and were part of the Wabenaki tribe. Dr. John Williams has always been an avid mixed martial artist (MMA) fighter, and started fighting at the juvenile age of 7.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Williams picked up fast on mixed martial arts (MMA), and by age 16 he had already received training in Olympic-style weightlifting, Kodokan Judo, and Tani-Ha Jiu-Jitsu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the time John reached the age of 23, he had started giving demonstrations that authenticated pure forms of strength and ability. Some of the tasks he performed included, bending spikes, tearing phonebooks and license plates in half, and holding two jeeps from going in the opposite directions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Martial Arts/MMA Career==
Williams became so influential through the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA), that he eventually opened up a Jiu-Jitsu practice in the United States in 1963.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inmemoriam.ca/view-announcement-485198-john-williams.html|title=John Williams: obituary and death notice on InMemoriam|website=www.inmemoriam.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although having his own practice which kept him busy in the sport, Williams went on to teach a variety of seminars all over the world. Williams brought the sport of MMA to Canada, and also was one of the first record holders of several different events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Williams was part of a very successful Canadian wrestling team which happened to be one of the top three in Canada at the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He won Mr. Moncton title in the late 1950s and entered the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] in the 1980s. In 1987, Williams set a world record for breaking multiple blocks of ice with a single punch. Each block was 11&amp;nbsp;inches thick, 22&amp;nbsp;inches wide, 42&amp;nbsp;inches long, and were stacked one on top of the other 10 consecutive blocks in a pile. This record still stands today. Some other records in the name of John Williams consists of, 13 consecutive hours of [[judo]] throws, over 100 weightlifting records, which include a world record for lifting 505 pounds in the one-handed deadlift at 160 pound bodyweight. Sadly, this record was disproved as the world record for this lift was already achieved in 1920. He fought in kickboxing, amateur and professional boxing, and he competed in both karate and judo.

Williams debut his amateur MMA fighting career in November 2000, and fought nine times, with a record of four wins and five losses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/John-Williams-5388&lt;/ref&gt;

At seventy-years old, Williams decided to set a new record. He wanted to become the oldest professional debuting mixed martial arts fighter in history. However, athletic commissions were opposed to this idea. Williams had to pass a volume of both physical and medical tests to prove it was safe for him to compete in professional mixed martial arts. Williams passed all the tests.

Prior to competing against former professional wrestler Larry Brewbaker, Williams wanted to prove a serious point on his insight concerning professional fighting and the association it has with age. Williams emphasized the fact that, "as a person becomes a senior, society kind of pushes them out of the loop. The attitude around them is that they're dumb, they can't do anything, physically they're just vegetables, and there sort of shunned by society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/07/29/70-year-old-mma-fighter-john-williams-got-in-the-cage-to-feel-al|title=70-Year-Old MMA Fighter John Williams Got in the Cage to Feel Alive Again|date=2010-07-29|website=MMA Fighting|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams wanted to prove that he was not just another senior citizen in society, but that he was capable of achieving victory in a professional fight; which many people thought was impossible at his age.

In an interview prior to his match, Williams said, "I went and got information on discrimination towards a person because of age, and I realized that if I say this is my job and I’m physically capable of doing the job, there was no way in the world they could stop me. This had nothing to do with risk factors. When you know what you’re doing, MMA is safe. I could have done an amateur thing or an exhibition, but no, I wanted to do a real fight."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Record breaking MMA debut match==
Williams, sporting a long pony-tail, met Larry Brewbaker, 49, a used car salesman with a shaved head and multiple tattoos. Their fight took place in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada,on July 24, 2010, at the "Elite 1 – Wild Card".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prommanow.com/index.php/2010/07/29/mma-fighter-john-williams-wins-pro-debut-at-70-years-old/ |title=MMA fighter John Williams wins pro debut at 70-years-old |publisher=Pro MMA Now |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 70-year-old Williams set three records that night. He became the oldest debuting MMA fighter, the oldest active MMA fighter, and the oldest winning MMA fighter. Williams won his match by ankle lock in the 2nd round.

In an interview after his record making victory, Williams said, "The point of life is living it. And I tell you, I got in that cage and I felt alive. I felt human again. You get that thing over your head, people think you’re 70 and you don’t know [expletive]. They don’t bother to get to know you. I like Eminem. I like rap music. …Mentally, I feel the same as I did when I was 30. I like the same kind of cars, make the same kind of ridiculous claims, and the enjoy same kinds of women. Nothing’s changed for me, but there’s this stereotype. You don’t change, but they try and make you fit a mold and be something you don’t want to be, which is an old person. Not me. I’ve been a fighter all my life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4123">'''Joseph Godfrey''' (1835 – July, 1909) was an [[African American]] who escaped from [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] into a [[Dakota people|Dakota]] community in [[Minnesota]], United States, and fought on their side during the [[Dakota War of 1862]]. He was the only African-American combatant of the war.&lt;ref name=Francois&gt;{{cite web | last=Francois | first=Sherick | title=Godfrey, Joseph (ca.1830–1909) | url=http://www.mnopedia.org/person/godfrey-joseph-ca1830-1909 | work=MNopedia | publisher=Minnesota Historical Society | date=2012-11-01 | accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Joseph Godfrey was born a slave in 1835 in [[Mendota, Minnesota]]. He was the son of a [[French Canadian]] [[voyageurs|voyageur]] named Joseph Godefroi and Polly, a female slave brought from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to [[Fort Snelling]] by an American army officer. Godfrey was raised in the household of Alexis Bailley, where his mother worked. Not much is known about his childhood, except that he received little to no education.  At some point Godfrey was taken to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], by a man named Bronson. During this time Godfrey served as an aid for [[Henry Hastings Sibley]], prominent trader and later first [[governor of Minnesota]], who also played a key role in the U.S.-Dakota War.&lt;ref name=Francois /&gt;

Suffering ill treatment from his owners, Godfrey ran away to seek refuge among the Dakota as a [[fugitive slave]]. In 1857 he moved to the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], where he married the daughter of Wahpaduta (Red Leaf). In August 1862, while helping local Dakota load hay onto a wagon, Godfrey was approached by another Dakota man announcing that all the white people had been killed at the agency. On the spot, Godfrey was asked what side he would take. Afraid for his life and family, Godfrey felt compelled to join the war.&lt;ref name=Francois /&gt;

=="Slayer of Many"==
Later that fall Godfrey was accused by Col. Sibley of joining the Dakota between August 19th and September 29th and actively participating in attacks. Dakota warriors awarded him the name "Atokte," meaning "slayer of many" in the [[Dakota language]]. Godfrey denied he had killed anyone. However, there were conflicting reports about his role in the conflict and how active he really was.&lt;ref name=Francois /&gt;

==Testimony and pardon==
Godfrey was captured after the [[Battle of Wood Lake]] on September 23, 1862, and held to face trial. He was the first person tried by the military commission on September 28, 1862. In an effort to escape execution, Godfrey testified against eleven of the thirty-eight Dakota warriors who were eventually hanged on December 26, 1862. Although he escaped conviction for murder, he was convicted of participating in the fighting and sentenced to death by hanging. In exchange for his testimony, the commission recommended that the President commute his sentence to ten years' imprisonment. In its recommendation to President [[Abraham Lincoln]], the court commission stated that "a large number of men of the very worst character would have gone unpunished" without Godfrey's testimony. Lincoln agreed to the commutation, and later issued a full pardon.&lt;ref name=Francois /&gt;

Godfrey was sent to [[Camp McClellan (Iowa)|Camp McClellan]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], to serve his prison sentence. After serving three years he was pardoned and freed in 1866. Upon his release, he settled on the [[Santee Sioux Reservation]] in [[Nebraska]]. Godfrey spent the rest of his life on the Santee Reservation, and died there from natural causes in July 1909. His body was buried in the Episcopalian Cemetery on the reservation.&lt;ref name=Francois /&gt;

==Biography==
Massel emigrated from [[Russia]] to [[Manchester]], England in 1895 where he worked as a printer.

Massel was a pioneer in the promotion of Hebrew as the national language, publishing works by [[Israel Cohen (Zionist)|Israel Cohen]] and [[Harry Sacher]] among others. He wrote Hebrew poems and translated English classics into Hebrew, including Milton’s Samon Agonistes,&lt;ref&gt;Sokolow, Nahum (2001). ''History of Zionism (1600-1918). Volume 1''. Adamant Media

''Jewish Translation History: A Bibliography of Bibliographies and Studies'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, {{ISBN|90-272-1650-9}}, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also spent two years preparing a unique collection of 94 portraits called ''A Gallery of Hebrew Poets; 1725–1903''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mucjs.org/EXHIBITION/4MASSEL.HTML Joseph Massel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705190415/http://www.mucjs.org/EXHIBITION/4MASSEL.HTML |date=2007-07-05 }}, accessed 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time [[Chaim Weizmann]] arrived in Manchester in 1904, Massel was living in a small street of the lower end of Cheetham Hill Road&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'',  v.302-303 (1907). January–September&lt;/ref&gt; (where his Hebrew printing works was based)&lt;ref&gt;Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana (1967). ''Studia Rosenthaliana'', Van Gorcum, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; across from Red Bank and not far from the Central Synagogue. He was much part of Manchester’s Zionist community and was a vice-president of the [[Manchester Zionist Association]]. At that time he was the only person Weizmann knew in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Weizmann, Chaim (1949). ''Trial and Error: The Autobiography of Chaim Weizmann'', Harper, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massel attended the [[First Zionist Congress]] (Basle, 1897) and had probably met Weizmann at the [[Second Zionist Congress]] (Basle, 1898).

'''Julius Drum''' (March 18, 1958&amp;ndash; September 17, 2007), also known as Julius L. Corder, was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] actor.

Born in [[Winnebago, Nebraska]], Drum was adopted at the age of five by John and Dorothy Corder of [[McCook, Nebraska]]. Upon graduating from school, he entered medical school in California and supported himself as a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]] actor. He was a member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Bogard | first =Kenneth D. | title =Julius L.

'''Katoucha Niane''' (23 October 1960 – 2 February 2008) was a [[Senegalese]] [[model (person)|model]]. Nicknamed "The [[Peul]] Princess" (in reference to her ethnic [[Fula people|Fula]] background), she worked, and later wrote, under the single name "'''Katoucha'''".  She was the daughter of [[author]], [[playwright]] and [[historian]] [[Djibril Tamsir Niane]].

==Early life and career==
When she was a child, Katoucha and her family was forced into exile after her father came into conflict with Guinean President, [[Sekou Toure]].  Living with an uncle in [[Mali]], she rejoined her family in [[Dakar]] at the age of 12. There she lived with the family of her paternal uncle, whose wife was private secretary to the President of [[Senegal]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierrette Fofana. [http://grioo.com/ar,katoucha_la_mode_et_l_excision_vues_par_elle_meme_dans_ma_chair_paris_2007,12938.html Katoucha, la mode et l'excision vues par elle même : ''Dans ma chair'', Paris 2007 (Review)].  11 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After marrying her husband at the age of 17 and giving birth to her first child, they emigrated to [[France]].

It was there in the 1980s that she began modeling; first for [[Thierry Mugler]], then for [[Paco Rabanne]] and [[Christian Lacroix]], and became known as [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]]'s "[[muse]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/29/wmodel129.xml |title=Supermodel Katoucha Niane found dead |accessdate=2008-02-29 |format= |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Peter | last=Allen | date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She remained one of the best-known models in France, and an icon in Guinea.  In 2005, she worked as host of the French-language television program ''[[France's Next Top Model]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
She was the star of the film ''[[Ramata (film)|Ramata]]'' (2007), directed by [[Léandre-Alain Baker]], in which she played the title role.
It tells of a Senegalese woman who, aged 50, discovers the pleasures of the flesh in the arms of a man 25 years younger.
''Ramata'' was released in France in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activist==
Niane stopped modeling in 1994 to focus on activism. She had been an outspoken activist against [[Female genital cutting|female circumcision]], a rite performed in some African nations. Following her success as a model, she started the organization ''KPLCE - Katoucha pour la lutte contre l’excision'' (English: ''Katoucha for the battle against female circumcision'').  Niane herself was circumcised at the age of nine. In 2007, she published a book about her personal circumcision experience, ''Dans ma chair'' (Eng: ''In My Flesh''), in France.

==Death==
Katoucha lived in a [[houseboat]] on the [[Seine]], near the [[Pont Alexandre III|Alexander III bridge]] in [[Paris]]. On 1 February 2008, she returned to her houseboat from a party. This was the last time she was reportedly seen alive. On 4 February 2008, police opened a missing persons case for her. Her purse was found untouched outside the door to her boat. Police believed that no [[homicide|foul play]] was involved, and that she was likely intoxicated and fell into the Seine.&lt;ref name="spm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3345987.ece|title=Supermodel Campaigner Missing After Party|accessdate=2008-02-28|date=2008-02-11|author=Adam Sage|work=Times Online | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her body was found in the [[Seine River]] on 28 February 2008.  The 47-year-old model is believed to have died from an accidental drowning.  [[Fox News Channel]] reported the family suspected Niane may have been the victim of foul play.

The '''Kendayan''' (also known as '''Dayak Kenyan''' or '''Kanayatn''') are an Indonesian ethnic group native to [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]] in [[Borneo]]. The population of the group is around 366,000. 

==Language==
[[Kendayan language|Kanayatn languages]] encompass the Brahe, Badame, Jare, and Bang app languages. Socio-linguistically, it is very difficult to specify the language repertoire because it is used with various dialects and patois pronunciation. However, these languages are all considered a part of the [[Malayic languages|Malayic language]] family which also includes Indonesia's official language, [[Malay language|Malay]].

The increased adoption of Indonesian words by the Kanayatn has drastically changed Dayak Kanayatn dialects for modern speakers. With many speakers of traditional dialects in the older generations, this change has resulted in communication problems between generations.

==Weapons==
The Tangkitn is a unique weapon to the Kanayatn people and was used as their primary [[headhunting|head-hunting]] weapon in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Indonesia. Kementerian Percepatan Pembangunan Kawasan Timur Indonesia. Deputi Bidang Pengembangan Ekonomi, Sosial, dan Budaya|title=Potensi Seni Dan Budaya Serta Pariwisata Kawasan Timur Indonesia|year=2005|publisher=Deputi Bidang Pengembangan Ekonomi, Sosial, dan Budaya|oclc=215153223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Salako language]], the Tangkitn is also referred to as the [[Pandat|Parang Pandat]]. The Kanayatn tribe employed shields to deflect attacks from swords. According to the Kanayatn people in [[Mempawah Regency|Mempawah]] (Compaq-mem pa wah Hulu-mental-too-Sada Niang), there are two types of shields in Kanayatn culture: Gun amp and Jabakng. However, according to Kanayatn members in [[Landak Regency|Landak]] (including sea Ambawang and Kuala Mandor), there is just one type of shield, namely Gun amp.

==Religion==
The original religion of the Kanayatn people is not the [[Kaharingan]] as it is with the [[Dayak people]]. Kanayatn Dayak's indigenous religion is inseparable from their customs (Adat). It can even be said their customs assert their religious identity. In daily practice, Kanayatn Dayak people never mention religion as their normative, but Adat (custom). This religious system is not a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Kaharingan]] system.

Kanayatn people refer to God as Juba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mudiyono|title=Sistem Pengendalian Social Traditional Desa Tiang Tanjung, Propinsi Kalimantan Barat|year=1990|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Pembinaan Nilai-Nilai Budaya|oclc=555243328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juba is said to have passed down indigenous customs to the ancestors of Dayak Kanayatn located in Bukit Ba wang (now entering the district [[Bengkayang]]). In expressing belief in Jubata, they have a place of worship called "panyugu" or "padagi" (kadiaman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Vierling|title=Hermeneutik, Stammesreligion, Evangelium: interkulturelle Kommunikation bei den Kendayan|year=1990|publisher=Gütersloher Verlagshaus G. Mohn|isbn=3-5790-0243-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important for the ''panyangahatn'' priest to become a liaison between man and God (Jubata).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rohany|title=Peralatan Produksi Tradisional Dan Perkembangannya Daerah Kalimantan Barat|year=1990|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Kanwil Depdikbud Propinsi Kalimantan Barat, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Pembinaan Nilai-Nilai Budaya Kalimantan Barat|oclc=551341177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many Dayak Kanayatn have embraced other religions, including [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Kenanyatn people who have embraced another religion may no longer consider themselves as Dayak Kanayatn once they have abandoned their customary practices. Similarly, Kanayatn people who have embraced [[Islam]] will no longer regard themselves as Dayak, but as [[Malay people]] or [[Orang laut]].

==Ethnic origins (disputed)==
The Kanayatn were grouped into the category clump Land Dayak-Kalimantan by H. J. Mallinckrodt; but according to C. H. Duman, they are part of the Kanayatn [[Ot Danum people|Dayak Ot Danum]] Clump-[[Ma'anyan people|Maanyan]]-[[Ngaju people|Ngaju]]. However, research completed by W. Stohr conflicts with C. H. Duman's theory. Stohr's research suggests that when considering aspects of the region, language and customary law, the Dayak Kanayatn group appears to be more closely associated with the  [[Bidayuh|Land Dayak]]-Kalimantan group than the  [[Ot Danum people|Ot-Danum]]-[[Ma'anyan people|Maanyan]]-[[Ngaju people|Ngaju]] group. Landmark District names have been based on the majority Dayak community Kanayatn which is part of the clump [[Bidayuh|Land Dayak]] (or Land Djak in Dutch spelling). Kanayatn and [[Selako people|Salako]] are, in fact, one tribe and [[Selako people|Salako]] people assume that "Kanayatn" is not the real name of this tribe.

'''Kurt Grelling''' (2 March 1886 &amp;ndash; September 1942) was a German [[logician]] and  [[philosopher]], member of the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]].

== Life and work ==
Kurt Grelling was born on 2 March 1886 in Berlin. His father, the Doctor of Jurisprudence [[Richard Grelling]], and his mother, Margarethe (née Simon), were Jewish. Shortly after his arrival in 1905 at [[University of Göttingen]], Grelling began a collaboration with philosopher [[Leonard Nelson]], with whom he tried to solve [[Russell's paradox]], which had shaken the [[foundations of mathematics]] when it was announced in 1903. Their 1908 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. |last=Grelling |first2=L. |last2=Nelson |chapter=Bemerkungen zu den Paradoxien von Russell und Burali-Forti |title=Abhandlungen der Fries’schen Schule II |location=Göttingen |year=1908 |pages=301–334 }} Also in: {{cite book |first=Leonard |last=Nelson |title=Gesammelte Schriften III. Die kritische Methode in ihrer Bedeutung für die Wissenschaften |publisher=Felix Meiner Verlag |location=Hamburg |year=1974 |pages=95–127 |isbn=3787302220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included new [[paradox]]es, including a semantic paradox that was named the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]].

He received his doctorate in [[mathematics]] from the same university in 1910 with a [[dissertation]] on the development of [[arithmetics]] in [[axiomatic set theory]], advised by [[David Hilbert]]. In a recorded interview with [[Herbert Enderton]], [[Alfred Tarski]] mentions a meeting he had with Grelling in 1938, and says that Grelling was the author of the earliest textbook in [[set theory]], probably but wrongly referring to this dissertation, since [[William Henry Young]] and [[Grace Chisholm Young]]'s ''Set Theory'' was published in 1906.

As a skilled linguist, Grelling translated philosophical works from French, Italian and English to German, including four of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s works. He became a strong proponent of Russell's writings thereafter.

From 1911 to 1922 Grelling published exclusively journalistic articles in publications connected with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].

In 1915 his father, Richard Grelling, wrote the anti-war book ''J'Accuse'', condemning the actions of the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref name="roll"&gt;{{cite book | title=Because I Am a German | publisher=Constable and Co. | author=Fernau, Hermann | year=1916 | location=London | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It enjoyed huge sales outside Germany. Richard followed this success up with ''Das Verbrechen'' (''The Crime''), in which he attacked his critics, who included Kurt Grelling.&lt;ref name="les"&gt;{{cite book | title=Les causes de la Première Guerre mondiale | publisher=Éditions du Seuil | author=Droz, Jacques | year=1973 | pages=19.|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924 onwards Grelling's publications were exclusively in the field of [[Positivism|positivist philosophy]].

[[File:Stolperstein Königsberger Str 13 (Lichtf) Kurt Grelling.jpg|thumb|Memorial [[Stolperstein]] at Kurt Grelling's residence Königsberger Straße 13 in Berlin]]
Unable to find a university position in [[Göttingen]] or [[Berlin]], Grelling had to teach mathematics, [[philosophy]] and [[physics]] in secondary schools.  Nevertheless, he worked with [[Hans Reichenbach]] in planning the meetings of the Berlin Circle, which was closely associated with the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1933, Reichenbach emigrated to [[Turkey]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] forced Grelling to retire. But he struggled to keep the Berlin Circle active by organizing small seminars and colloquia.

Grelling collaborated with [[Kurt Gödel]] and in 1936 he published an article in which he defended Gödel's [[incompleteness theorem]] against an erroneous interpretation, according to which Gödel's theorem is a paradox as Russell's paradox (see ''References'').

Although many of his relatives and friends had fled Germany, he did not think seriously about leaving until 1937, in which year he went to [[Brussels]] to work with [[Paul Oppenheim]], this time writing several papers on the analysis of scientific explanation and on [[Gestalt psychology]].

On 10 May 1940, the first day of the German invasion in Belgium, Grelling was arrested. He was deported to southern France, where he was interned for over two years under the [[Vichy regime]]. Oppenheim and [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] tried to help Grelling by securing an appointment for him at the New School for Social Research in [[New York City]]. News of the position and a visa to the United States reached the camp where Grelling had been joined by his wife Greta, who had refused to divorce him for safety reasons. But U.S. immigration officials were perplexed by Grelling's alleged propensity towards Communism, so there was a delay that was fatal to Grelling. He and his wife were shipped to [[Auschwitz]], arriving there on September 18, 1942 and perishing in the [[gas chamber]]s that day or soon thereafter.&lt;ref name="Emmer"&gt;{{cite book|last= Emmer|first=Michele|title=Mathematics and Culture I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHRDnU29PO8C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22Robert+Remak%22+auschwitz&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qUAiTeiJBsH-8Aam98G4Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kurt%20Grelling%22%20auschwitz&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=[[Axel Springer AG]]|isbn=978-3-540-01770-7|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolpersteine-berlin.de/de/biografie/1357 Biography] (in German) at Berlin [[Stolperstein]] site&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laure Pigeon''' (1882 – 1965) was a French [[Mediumship|medium]] who produced an oeuvre of 500  [[drawing]]s related to her [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] practice. She is considered one of the foremost [[Outsider  art|Art Brut]] creators.&lt;ref name="Aloïse and Laure Pigeon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aloïse and Laure Pigeon.

==Life==
Laure Pigeon was born in 1882 in [[Paris]]. Laure’s mother Alida, a laundress, died when she was five years old. After her mother's death she lived in [[Brittany]] with her paternal grandmother, where she received a strict upbringing.  At twenty-nine she married a dentist against the wishes of her family.  Twenty-two years  later she separated from her husband, Edmond, after discovering his infidelity.  After their separation she lived in a boarding house where she was introduced to  [[Spiritualism]] by another woman tenant.  Fifteen years later, she moved into an apartment in the Paris region where she pursued a solitary practice of Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="Collection de l'art Brut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection de l'art Brut: Index des Auteurs: Laure|url=http://www.artbrut.ch/fr/21004/1012/auteurs/laure|publisher=Collection de l'art Brut|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Laure Pigeon made her first drawing at 52, under Spiritualist inspiration.&lt;ref name="Maclagan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclagan|first1=David|title=Outsider Art: From the Margins to the Marketplace|date=2010|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895216|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid 1930s onwards, Pigeon created hundreds of drawings, most featuring images of melancholy female silhouettes, others spelling out words, often embellished names: Laure, Edmond her husband, Alida her mother, Lili her sister, or the apostle Pierre to whom Laure claimed to have been married in a former life &lt;ref name="Cardinal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cardinal|first1=Roger|title=European Mediumistic Art in the Outsider Domain|journal=Raw Vision|volume=Winter 1989/90|issue=2|page=26|url=http://www.gallevery.com/assets/dynamic/documents/AZ_Roger_Cardinal_Article_-_Raw_Vision_1989.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Pigeon's work, 500 large drawings and additional notebooks, was discovered after her death in 1965. [[Jean Dubuffet]] acquired her work for his [[Jean Dubuffet|Collection de l'Art Brut]].&lt;ref name="Hidden Worlds"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curators of the De Stadshof &amp; Guislain Museums|title=Hidden Worlds: Outsider Art at the Museum Dr Guislain|date=2008|publisher=Lannoo Publishers|isbn=9020970232|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiZAFYWFZqYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22laure+pigeon%22+1965&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WK5XDlGgrm&amp;sig=dwlxMN74hTOMBnD8BxZzYii_Udo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs7Y3Z_OPLAhUJ-GMKHSP0DOoQ6AEITTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22laure%20pigeon%22%201965&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and exhibits==

Laure Pigeon's work is primarily held in the [[Collection de l'Art Brut]] museum in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]]. Her drawings have been lent to other institutions for exhibitions, including the 2011 ''Habiter poétiquement le monde'' exhibit at the [[Lille Métropole Musée d’art moderne]].&lt;ref name="LaM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Habiter poétiquement le monde EXPOSITION du 25 septembre 2010 au 30 janvier 2011|url=http://www.musee-lam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DP-Habiter-poétiquement-SV.pdf|publisher=Lille Métropole Musée d’art moderne|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20584">'''Grand Commanders''' of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] have been appointed by the Sovereign of the Royal Danish Orders of [[Chivalry]], i.e. the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish monarch]], since the general reorganization of the Order by [[letters patent|royal letters patent]] of June 28, 1808. The Grand Commanders form a special class above the three ordinary classes of the Order of the Dannebrog. Thus, they outrank the [[Grand Cross|Knights Grand Cross]] of the Dannebrog. Together with the Knights of the [[Order of the Elephant]] Grand Commanders constitute the Chapter of the Royal Danish Orders of Chivalry.

Grand Commanders are, or have been, either
* prominent members of the [[Danish Royal Family]],
* kings and emperors related to the Danish monarch, or,
* other close relations of royal or princely status who are not members of the Danish Royal Family

Presently seven persons wear the Grand Commander's insignia. They are the six Grand Commanders and [[Margrethe II of Denmark|HM Queen Margrethe II]], the Sovereign of the Order.
By [[decree|royal ordinance]] of October 10, 1951 women can be appointed Grand Commanders. Therefore, the women that appear in the list before that date were, strictly speaking, not appointed Grand Commanders as much as awarded the honour of wearing the insignia of a Grand Commander.

'''Melchor Gastón Ferrer'''&lt;ref&gt;Some sources spell his first name as MELCHIOR but this is incorrect based on Ferrer's records at Princeton University. Also he was named for his paternal grandfather, Melchor Ferrer. And the name MELCHOR G. FERRER was used on the cover of ''Tito's Hats'', a children's book that Ferrer wrote in 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; (August 25, 1917 – June 2, 2008) was an American [[actor]] and [[Film director|director]] of stage and screen, [[film producer]] and the first husband of [[Audrey Hepburn]].

==Early life==
Ferrer was born in the [[Elberon, New Jersey|Elberon]] section of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]], of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. His father, Dr. José María Ferrer (1857–1920), was born in [[Cuba]], of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry, and was an authority on pneumonia and served as chief of staff of [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Jose M. Ferrer", Obituaries, The New York Times, February 24, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; His American mother, Mary Matilda Irene (née O'Donohue; 1878–1967),&lt;ref&gt;"Weddings: Ferrer-O'Donohue", ''The New York Times'', October 19, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; was a daughter of coffee broker Joseph J. O'Donohue, New York's City Commissioner of Parks, a founder of the Coffee Exchange, and a founder of the Brooklyn-New York Ferry. An ardent opponent of [[Prohibition]], Irene Ferrer was named, in 1934, the New York State chairman of the Citizens Committee for Sane Liquor Laws.&lt;ref name="Mrs. J.M. Ferrer 1967"&gt;"Mrs. J.M. Ferrer, Civic Leader, 89", ''The New York Times'', February 21, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrer had three siblings. His elder sister was Dr. M. Irené Ferrer, a cardiologist and educator, who helped refine the cardiac catheter and [[electrocardiogram]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_110.html Changing the Face of Medicine – Dr. M. Irené Ferrer]&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2004 in Manhattan, New York at age 89 of pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

His brother, Dr. Jose M. Ferrer, born 1912, was a surgeon; he died in 1982 at age 70 after an abdominal surgery complication. His other sister, Teresa (Terry) Ferrer, was the religion editor of ''[[The New York Herald Tribune]]'' and education editor of ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref name="Mrs. J.M. Ferrer 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Terry Ferrer, 82, Education Editor", ''The New York Times'', April 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The family is not related to actors [[José Ferrer|José]] and [[Miguel Ferrer]].

His mother's family, the O'Donohues, were prominent Roman Catholics. Mel Ferrer's aunt, Marie Louise O'Donohue (Mrs. Joseph J. O'Donohue, Jr.) was named a [[Papal nobility|papal countess]],&lt;ref&gt;"Joseph O'Donohue, Real Estate Man, Dead", ''The New York Times'', October 31, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother's sister, Teresa Riley O'Donohue, a leading figure in American Catholic charities and welfare organizations, was granted permission by [[Pope Pius XI]] to install a private chapel in her New York City apartment.&lt;ref&gt;"Teresa O'Donohue, Charities Worker", ''The New York Times'', August 18, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrer was privately educated at the Bovée School in New York (one of his classmates was the future author [[Louis Auchincloss]]) and [[Canterbury School (New Milford, Connecticut)|Canterbury Prep School]] in Connecticut before attending [[Princeton University]] until his sophomore year, at which time he dropped out to devote more time to acting. He also worked as an editor of a small Vermont newspaper and wrote a children's book, ''Tito's Hats'' (Garden City Publishing, 1940).&lt;ref&gt;The book's illustrations were by [[Jean Charlot]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer 1955.jpg|thumb|240px|Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer on the set of ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' in 1955]]

===Early theatre work===
Ferrer began acting in [[summer stock]] as a teenager and in 1937 won the Theatre Intime award for best new play by a Princeton undergraduate; the play was called ''Awhile to Work'' and co-starred another college student, Frances Pilchard, who would become Ferrer's first wife that same year.&lt;ref&gt;"M.G. Ferrer Wins Prize Play Award", ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1937, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

At age twenty-one, he was appearing on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage as a chorus dancer, making his debut there as an actor two years later. He appeared as a chorus dancer in two unsuccessful musicals, [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[You Never Know (musical)]]'' and ''Everywhere I Roam''.

His first acting roles were in a revival of ''Kind Lady'' (1940) and ''Cue for Passion'' (1940) directed by [[Otto Preminger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/kind-lady-1009 |publisher=Internet Broadway Database |title=Kind Lady  |accessdate=November 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6v19ML5Zd?url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/kind-lady-1009 |archivedate=November 16, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/cue-for-passion-1042 |publisher=Internet Broadway Database |title=Cue for Passion  |accessdate=November 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6v19VdE9F?url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/cue-for-passion-1042 |archivedate=November 16, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a bout with [[polio]], Ferrer worked as a disc jockey in [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] and moved to Mexico to work on a novel, ''Tito's Hat'' published in 1940.

===Columbia Pictures===
Ferrer was contracted to [[Columbia Pictures]] as a director along with several other "potentials" who began as dialogue directors: [[Fred F. Sears|Fred Sears]], [[William Castle]], [[Henry Levin (film director)|Henry Levin]] and [[Robert Gordon (director)|Robert Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmsofthegoldenage.com/articles/2008/04/29/current_issue/klinekatzman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the films he worked on were ''[[Louisiana Hayride (film)|Louisiana Hayride]]'' (1944), ''[[They Live in Fear]]'' (1944), ''[[Sergeant Mike]]'' (1944), ''[[Together Again (film)|Together Again]]'' (1944), ''[[Meet Miss Bobby Socks]]'' (1944), ''[[Let's Go Steady]]'' (1944), ''[[Ten Cents a Dance (1945 film)|Ten Cents a Dance]]'' (1945), and ''[[A Thousand and One Nights (1945 film)|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' (1945). Some of these were Bs but others – such as 'Thousand and One Nights'' – were more prestigious.

Ferrer directed ''[[The Girl of the Limberlost]]'' (1945) a B movie with [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]].

===Broadway===
Eventually, he returned to Broadway, where he starred in ''[[Strange Fruit (novel)#Stage play|Strange Fruit]]'' (1945–46), a play based on the novel by [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]]. It was directed by [[Jose Ferrer]] (no relation).

Ferrer then directed Jose Ferrer in the 1946 stage production of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]''.&lt;ref name="yn1"/&gt;

He worked as an assistant on ''[[The Fugitive (1947 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1947), directed by John Ford in Mexico. Along with [[Gregory Peck]], [[Dorothy McGuire]] and [[Joseph Cotten]], he founded the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in Los Angeles.

===Screen actor===
Ferrer made his screen acting debut with a starring role in ''[[Lost Boundaries]]'' (1949), playing a black person who passes for white. The film was controversial but much acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-25/entertainment/ca-343_1_johnston-family&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard Hughes===
Ferrer had a support role in ''[[Born to Be Bad (1950 film)|Born to Be Bad]]'' (1950) at RKO, directed by [[Nicholas Ray]]. At that studio he directed [[Claudette Colbert]] in ''[[The Secret Fury]]'' (1950) and did some directing on ''[[Vendetta (1950 film)|Vendetta]]'' (1950), ''[[The Racket (1951 film)|The Racket]]'' (1951) and ''[[Macao (film)|Macao]]'' (1952).

Ferrer then starred as a bullfighter in ''[[The Brave Bulls (film)|The Brave Bulls]]'' (1951) for [[Robert Rossen]] at Columbia.

Ferrer fought with [[Arthur Kennedy]] over [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''[[Rancho Notorious]]'' (1952) directed by [[Fritz Lang]] at RKO.

===MGM===
Ferrer went over to MGM replacing [[Fernando Lamas]] as the villain in ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952). The film, particularly notable for a long climactic duel between Ferrer and [[Stewart Granger]], was a huge hit.

MGM kept him on for ''[[Lili]]'' (1953) playing the puppeteer loved by [[Leslie Caron]]. It was another large success; Ferrer and Caron also got a hit single out of it, "Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo". ''[[Saadia (film)|Saadia]]'' (1953), which Ferrer made with [[Cornel Wilde]] was a flop but ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1954) was a big hit; Ferrer played King Arthur.

Ferrer met [[Audrey Hepburn]] at a party and she wanted to do a play together. They appeared in ''Ondine'' (1954) on Broadway and later got married.

===Europe===
Ferrer went to Italy to make ''[[Proibito]]'' (1954) and England for ''[[Oh... Rosalinda!!]]'' (1955), directed by [[Powell and Pressburger]]. Neither film was widely seen, but ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' (1956) was a big success; Ferrer played Prince Andrei, co-starring with his then-wife, [[Audrey Hepburn]]. In France he supported [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Elena and Her Men]]'' (1956) directed by [[Jean Renoir]].

===United States===
Ferrer and Hepburn made ''[[Mayerling (1957 film)|Mayerling]]'' (1957) for American television; it was released theatrically in some countries.

Ferrer returned to MGM to make ''[[The Vintage]]'' (1957) with [[Pier Angeli]] which was a big flop. He made two films for [[20th Century Fox]]: their all star adaptation of ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) and ''[[Fräulein (1958 film)|Fräulein]]'' (1958) a war story with [[Dana Wynter]]. At MGM he was one of the last three people on Earth in ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1959), another flop.

Ferrer went to Italy to be star in [[Roger Vadim]]'s vampire movie ''[[Blood and Roses]]'' (1960). After an English horror film ''[[The Hands of Orlac (1960 film)|The Hands of Orlac]]'' (1960) he did an Italian adventure film ''[[Charge of the Black Lancers]]'' (1962).

Ferrer was one of several stars in ''[[The Devil and the Ten Commandments]]'' (1962) and ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962). He had a cameo in his wife's ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]'' (1964) and was [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander]] in ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1964).

Ferrer turned to television, doing some directing for the series ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'' (1963–1966) starring [[Inger Stevens]].

Ferrer had a support role in ''[[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|Sex and the Single Girl]]'' (1964).

===Producer===
Ferrer produced and starred in the biopic ''[[El Greco (1966 film)|El Greco]]'' (1966) playing the [[El Greco|famous painter]]. He also produced ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'' (1967) starring his wife; a big hit. He and Hepburn were divorced in 1968.

'''Mohammed Al-Kandari''' is a member of the [[National Assembly of Kuwait|Kuwaiti National Assembly]], representing the [[Kuwait's First District|first district]]. Born in 1971, Al-Kandari studied medicine before being elected to the National Assembly in 2008.  While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Al-Kandari affiliates with the [[Islamic Salafi Alliance (Kuwait)|Islamic Salafi Alliance]].  

==Against Celebrating Christmas in Kuwait==
On December 24, 2006, Al-Kandari told Al-Watan daily that Muslims should not wish their Christian friends "Merry Christmas."  Al-Kandari argued that to do so contradicts with Islam because Christians believe Jesus was the son of God.{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/24/africa/ME_GEN_Kuwait_Christmas_Greetings.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22803">During the [[First World War]] (1914&amp;ndash;1918), the '''Revolutionary Stewards''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Revolutionäre Obleute'') were [[shop stewards]] who were independent from the official unions and freely chosen by workers in various German industries. They rejected the war policies of the German Empire and the support which parliamentary representatives of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) gave to these policies. They also played a role during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]].

==Background==
The SPD, at the time the largest workers' party in Europe, voted for war credits for the imperial government in 1914. [[Karl Liebknecht]] was initially the only SPD member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] who publicly rejected the measure. He was absent for the vote in August and then voted against the measure in December 1914. With the split between the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]] and the "Majority" SPD there was a party in the Reichstag opposing the so-called policy of "party truce" (''[[Burgfriedenspolitik]]'') between the various political forces. The Stewards supported the USPD's outright opposition to the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Hoffrogge, ''Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard Müller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement'', Brill Publications 2014, {{ISBN|978-9-00421-921-2}}., pp. 21-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 1918: Anti-war strike==
Since most of the union functionaries supported the political truce, the Stewards created an opposition of industrial workers against the First World War in Germany. This was in part a reaction to the growing number of deaths on the front and the growing social need at home. Their most important speakers were [[Richard Müller (socialist)|Richard Müller]] and [[Emil Barth]]. The Revolutionary Stewards were especially strongly represented in the Berlin armament industry. They had already had experience with strikes, including the protest strike against the imprisonment of Karl Liebknecht in summer 1916 and the wave of strikes centered on [[Braunschweig]] and [[Leipzig]] in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Hoffrogge, ''Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard Müller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement'', Brill Publications 2014, pp. 35-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stewards were a crucial force in organizing the [[January Strike]] of 1918, which was centred on [[Berlin]], the [[Ruhr]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Kiel]]&lt;ref name="Reich"&gt;{{cite book|last = Dederke|first = Karlheinz|title = Reich und Republik, Deutschland 1917-1933 (German)|publisher = Klett-Cotta|year = 1996|isbn = 3-608-91802-7| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} and in which strikers demanded the end of the war through a negotiated peace and a democratisation of the empire. They were in part inspired by the success achieved by the [[Bolsheviks]]  under [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]] in the Russian [[October Revolution]] only a few months earlier. For this reason, the strikes were also directed against plans of annexation, which Central Powers [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] were pursuing in ongoing peace negotiations with Soviet Russia in [[Brest-Litovsk]]. The strikers demanded fundamental political changes within Germany as well as a just peace agreement with Russia that did not include territorial claims by the German Empire against the "New Russia". These demands were not met by the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] (or ''Oberste Heeresleitung'') and the imperial government of Chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]].

The strike was ended when the ''Oberste Heeresleitung'' declared an aggravated state of siege, put some factories under military protection and conscripted many of the striking workers for military service.&lt;ref name="Reich"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

==November Revolution and Council Movement==

===November 1918: revolution===
In the early days of November 1918, the Revolutionary Stewards were one of the few political groups demanding an end to the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Reich"/&gt;{{rp|24}} In addition, unlike the "Majority" SPD of [[Friedrich Ebert]] they were also in favour of [[Socialization (economics)|"socialisation"]] of industries and government by workers' (and soldiers') councils rather than a parliamentary system. On 2 November 1918 there was a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Stewards, also attended by Liebknecht, which voted 21 to 19 against initiating revolutionary action on 4 November as the workers were not yet disposed to act. They settled on 11 November.&lt;ref name="Reich"/&gt;{{rp|26}} In Berlin, the Stewards numbered around 80 to 100.&lt;ref name="BPB"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Sturm|first = Reinhard|authorlink = |title = Weimarer Republik, Informationen zur politischen Bildung, Nr. 261 (German)|url = http://www.bpb.de/shop/zeitschriften/informationen-zur-politischen-bildung/55943/weimarer-republik |accessdate = 17 June 2013 |year = 2011 |publisher = Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |location = Bonn |issn = 0046-9408 |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} The core group numbered only about a dozen.&lt;ref name="Haffner"&gt;{{cite book|last = Haffner|first = Sebastian|title = Die deutsche Revolution 1918/19 (German)|publisher = Kindler|year = 2002|isbn = 3-463-40423-0| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}}

On 8 November, driven by events to accelerate their plan, the Stewards called for a general strike in Berlin on the next day. The Spartacists, the SPD and the unions supported the call. On 9 November, workers' and soldiers' councils were formed, the headquarters of police was occupied and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators converged on the city centre.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Imperial Chancellor [[Max of Baden]] announced that Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] had abdicated and handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert. In the afternoon Ebert grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for the future government. Yet that evening a group of several hundred followers of the Stewards occupied the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] and held an impromptu debate. They called for the election of soldiers' and [[workers' council]]s the next day (one per battalion or 1,000 workers). They were to assemble at "Zirkus Busch" and elect a provisional revolutionary government—the ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten''.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|100–103}}

In order to keep control of events and against his own anti-revolutionary convictions, Ebert now decided that he needed to co-opt the workers' councils and thus—whilst the formal head of government—also become the leader of the revolution. On 10 November, the SPD, led by Ebert managed to ensure that a majority of the newly elected workers' and (especially) soldiers' councils came from among their own supporters. Meanwhile, the USPD agreed to work with him and share power in the ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'', the new revolutionary government. Ebert announced the pact between the two socialist parties to the assembled councils who were eager for a unified socialist front and approved the parity of three members each coming from SPD and USPD.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|109–119}} However, the Stewards had anticipated that they would fail to prevent the SPD from dominating the ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'' ("[[Council of the People's Deputies]]"). They thus called for an Executive Committee (''Aktionsausschuss'') of the workers' and soldiers' councils to be set up in parallel to the ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'' and that would be under the control of the stewards. Its powers were to be left deliberately vague.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|115}} Emil Barth, who was presiding over the assembly, then made a tactical error by giving a long-winded speech rather than moving directly to the vote. Listeners, including Ebert, were able to deduce the Stewards' intentions from what Barth said. Ebert made another speech, declaring that the committee was superfluous, but if it was to be set up, it must be made up equally of SPD and USPD just like the ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten''. When Barth said that no SPD delegate must sit on the committee, the assembly exploded with protest, in particular from the soldiers' councils. After an interruption, the session continued and Barth announced an Executive Committee of 20 members: ten soldiers and ten workers. Half of the latter would be supporters of the SPD, half supporters of the Stewards. The soldiers's delegates were to be elected on 11 November. The Stewards had lost.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|119}}

===December 1918: congress of councils and Christmas crisis===
From 16 to 21 December 1918, the ''Reichsrätekongress'' or ''Reichsversammlung der Arbeiter- und Soldatenräte'' (Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils) met in Berlin inside the [[Prussian Landtag]] building. There was one delegate for every 200,000 citizens and 100,000 soldiers. Out of 514 delegates, around 300 came from the SPD, about 100 from the USPD (of which ten were Spartacists) and the rest were liberals, not associated with any party or members of independent revolutionary groups. The Congress took some important decisions (in each case with a broad majority):
* It rejected a proposal by the USPD to retain the council system as the basis for a socialist republic and to give the councils the supreme legislative and executive power  
* It approved a proposal by the SPD to vest legislative and executive power with the "Council of the People's Deputies" until a National Assembly could make more permanent arrangements. Moreover, the Executive Committee created on 10 November was replaced with a "Central Council" (''Zentralrat''). The latter was made up of SPD members only as the USPD boycotted its election because the new institution would have no legislative powers. 
* Elections for a National Assembly were set for 19 January 1919, the earliest possible date.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|13}}
However, the Congress also passed two resolutions that went against the interests of the SPD leadership. First, it called on the "Council of the People's Deputies" to begin immediately with the socialisation of all "suitable" industries, especially mining. Secondly, it approved the so-called ''Hamburger Punkte'' that called for the election of officers, for disciplinary power to lie with the soldiers' councils, no insignia of rank and no rank off-duty. However, these demands were anathema to the leadership of the military, in particular those relating to the position of the soldiers' councils vis-à-vis the regular officer corps.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|137}}

These last two decisions of the Congress underscored a division regarding short-term changes to the economy, the bureaucracy and the military between a broad-based consensus across party lines of the democratic-socialist movement on the one hand, and the leadership of the SPD and the military on the other. The SPD members of the "Council of the People's Deputies" consequently dragged their feet over the implementation of these last two points, causing increasing resentment and anger among the labour movement and its more radical representatives like the Spartacists and the Stewards.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}}

On 29 December, the only representative of the Revolutionary Stewards, Emil Barth (also a member of the USPD) and two further representatives of the USPD finally left the "Council of the People's Deputies" in protest against the events of the ''Weihnachtskämpfe'' ([[Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss]]), in which government troops were deployed against the ''Volksmarinedivision'', a unit of leftist revolutionary soldiers established on 11 November 1918. The fighting caused many on the left to accuse the leadership of the SPD of having betrayed the revolution.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|139–154}}

Although the Revolutionary Stewards supported the idea of a council republic rather than a parliamentary democracy, they rejected the KPD, founded on 30/31 December 1918, which pursued the same goal. This was because the KPD was not ready to accept the five conditions set by Richard Müller on behalf of the Revolutionary Stewards: withdrawal of the anti-voting decision, a program committee with equal representation, condemnation of "putschism", taking part in party publicity and abandonment of the additional name "Spartacus League".

===January 1919: January uprising===
In the atmosphere of outrage created on the left by the military action against the ''Volksmarinedivision''—which Liebknecht called "Eberts Blutweihnacht" (Ebert's Bloody Christmas)—the Stewards were among the initiators of the so-called ''Spartakusaufstand'' ([[Spartacus Uprising]]) in January 1919. [[Emil Eichhorn]], a member of the USPD and head of the Berlin police (''Polizeipräsident''), had refused to act against the revolting sailors during the Christmas crisis. Some of his men from the ''Sicherheitspolizei'' had even actively supported the uprising. [[Paul Hirsch (politician)|Paul Hirsch]], Prussian Minister of the Interior, thus dismissed Eichhorn on 4 January. Notwithstanding their differences, the Stewards, the USPD and the Spartacists called for a protest demonstration in support of Eichhorn.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|156}}

On 5 January 1919, around half a million people gathered at a mass demonstration in Berlin. Armed demonstrators stormed the Berlin newspaper quarter, where they occupied the editorial office of the SPD paper ''Vorwärts'' as well as other publishing buildings. The main railway stations were also seized. However, the force of the popular response caught the organizers by surprise. At a meeting at the police headquarters attended by 70 Stewards, ten members of the USPD led by [[Georg Ledebour]], three representatives of the soldiers, Liebknecht and Karl Pieck for the KDP and Eichhorn. Caught up in the momentum of the hour, they lost sight of the real situation, overestimating the support for their actions from the military in the Berlin area. They voted 80 to six to topple the government. The Stewards' representative {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul Scholze|de}}, Karl Liebknecht (KPD) and  [[Georg Ledebour]] (USPD) now signed a proclamation demanding the toppling of Ebert's government. They wanted to prevent elections to the National Assembly and to continue with the revolution.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|157–158}} A "provisionary revolutionary committee" was set up. It numbered 53 members, including Scholze, Liebknecht and Ledebour, and declared that it had taken over the government. Its only action, though, was to issue a call for another demonstration on the next day.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|158}}

The masses reassembled on Sunday, 6 January. However, no orders came from the revolutionary leaders. In isolated actions, the ''Reichsdruckerei'' and a telegraph office were seized. No one occupied the government buildings—whilst some armed supporters of the Ebert government gathered around the Reichskanzlei. The masses started to disperse and by midnight the centre of Berlin had been vacated. During the day, the committee had relocated to the Marstall, the barracks of the ''Volksmarinedivision'', but had been asked to leave and thus returned to the police headquarters.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|159–160}}

There they remained, when Ebert accepted mediation by those of the USPD who had left the "Council of the People's Deputies" in late December. Ebert had just one condition: the occupation of the newspapers must end. On 7 January, the revolutionary committee declined. Whilst negotiations continued, Ebert prepared for a military response. He made [[Gustav Noske]], since the withdrawal of the USPD a member of the ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'', supreme commander of the ''Freikorps'' and rallied the regular troops of the Berlin area to his cause.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}

On the orders of Ebert, government forces commanded by [[Gustav Noske]] crushed the uprising between 9 and 12 January.&lt;ref name="BPB"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Its defeat came after intense struggles, especially around the Berlin police headquarters and the publishing building of Vorwärts, in which a reported 165 people lost their lives.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The dead included several prisoners who were summarily executed, some after they had approached the government forces under a flag of truce.&lt;ref name="Haffner"/&gt;{{rp|163–164}}

==Decline of the Revolutionary Stewards==
The January uprising led to the dissolution of the Revolutionary Steward´s network, because many of its members took part in the uprising while others such as [[Richard Müller (socialist)|Richard Müller]] opposed it. The organization of the Revolutionary Stewards dissolved, though many of its members continued to work in the council structures.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Hoffrogge, ''Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard Müller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement'', Brill Publications 2014, {{ISBN|978-9-00421-921-2}}., pp. 100-108.&lt;/ref&gt; The struggles, at times approaching the level of civil war, which took place in some regions of Germany in the following months put the council movement increasingly on the defensive. Various calls for regional council republics, for example in [[Bremen]] or, more famously, the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], were finally suppressed with military force by regular armed forces and right-wing [[Freikorps]] troops by mid-1919.

Under the [[Weimar Constitution]] which came into force in August 1919, the republic became a pluralistic parliamentary democracy. After the defeat of the council movement, the Revolutionary Stewards still had influence and called for and helped execute a general strike against the right-wing nationalist and anti-democratic [[Kapp Putsch]] of March 1920. The strike brought the economy to a virtual stand-still and, together with the refusal of the bureaucracy to cooperate with the new government, caused the putsch to fail in a matter of days. However, in some parts of Germany, the striking workers refused to return to work and offered armed resistance to the legitimate government of president Ebert and chancellor [[Gustav Bauer|Bauer]]. The most significant of these events was the [[Ruhr Uprising]], which was crushed by [[Reichswehr]] and ''Freikorps'' in April 1920.

After 1920, the former Stewards did not play a notable role in the German labour movement any more. Many former activists became members of the KPD, especially after the KPD merged with the left wing of the USPD when the latter split at the end of 1920. Occasionally it operated under the alternate name "United Communist Party of Germany" (VKPD). Other Stewards remained in the USPD and future related groups, or joined the SPD again, after a part of the remaining USPD returned to the SPD in 1922. Towards the end of 1922, the core of the local structures of the USPD in Berlin, which continued to exist as a small party, was composed largely of former Revolutionary Stewards.

Some Stewards who continued to follow a party-independent "antiauthoritarian" council model joined the anarcho-syndicalist [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]] (FAUD).

'''Rómulo Ernesto Betancourt Bello''' (22 February 1908 – 28 September 1981; {{IPA-es|ˈromulo betaŋˈkuɾ}}), known as "The Father of Venezuelan Democracy", was the 47th and 54th [[President of Venezuela]], serving from 1945 to 1948 and again from 1959 to 1964, as well as leader of [[Acción Democrática]], [[Venezuela]]'s dominant political party in the 20th century.

Betancourt, one of Venezuela's most important political figures, led a tumultuous and highly controversial career in Latin American politics. Periods of exile brought Betancourt in contact with various Latin American countries as well as the [[United States]], securing his legacy as one of the most prominent international leaders to emerge from 20th-century Latin America. Scholars credit Betancourt as the [[Founding Father]] of modern democratic Venezuela.

==Early years==
[[File:Rómulo Betancourt during his infancy.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rómulo Betancourt during his childhood]]
[[File:Betancourt, 1936.jpg|thumb|150px|Betancourt in 1936]]
Rómulo Betancourt was born in [[Guatire]], a town near [[Caracas]].  His parents were Luis Betancourt Bello (from [[Canary Islands|Canary origins]]) and Virginia Bello Milano.  He attended a private school in Guatire, followed by high school at the ''Liceo Caracas'' in Caracas. He studied law at the [[Central University of Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;Fundación para la Cultura Urbana. 2009. Rómulo Betancourt: crónica visual. page 16. Cronología RB.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man he was expelled from Venezuela for radical agitation and moved to Costa Rica where he founded, and led, a number of radical and [[Communist]] student groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Weyl. 1960. Red Star Over Cuba. page 3. OOC:60-53203.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s, while in [[Costa Rica]], he became at the young age of 22, the one of the main militants of that country's [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Weyl. 1960. Red Star Over Cuba. pages 3-5. OOC:60-53203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jackson Alexander Romulo Betancourt and the Transformation of Venezuela, Transaction Books, New Brunswick and London 1982 p.74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, after resigning from the Communist Party and returning to Venezuela, he founded the Partido Democrático Nacional, which became an official political party in 1941 as [[Acción Democrática]] (AD).

Colombian leader [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] claimed Betancourt had "offered him arms and money to launch a revolution in Colombia" which was part of Betancourt's alleged plan to build a solid phalanx of left-wing regimes in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Weyl. 1960. Red Star Over Cuba. page 4-5. OOC:60-53203.&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged by Azula Barrera and Colombian President [[Mariano Ospina Pérez]] that Betancourt had supported the armed rising at the 1948 Inter-American Conference ([[Bogotazo]]) that left more than a thousand people dead, among these the political assassination of [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Weyl. 1960. Red Star Over Cuba. page 25, 30-31. OOC:60-53203.&lt;/ref&gt; This started a new volatile political period in neighboring Colombia some claim continues to this day with [[FARC]].

[[File:RB, votando en los comicios del 27 de octubre de 1946.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rómulo Betancourt voting at the [[Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election, 1946]]]]
Betancourt became president in 1945 by means of a military coup d'état and, during his time in office, completed an impressive agenda.  His accomplishments included the declaration of universal [[suffrage]], the institution of social reforms, and securing half of the profits generated by foreign oil companies for Venezuela. His government worked closely with the [[International Refugee Organization]] to aid European refugees and displaced persons who could not or would not return home after World War II; his government assumed responsibility for the legal protection and resettlement of tens of thousands of refugees inside Venezuela. The refugee initiative was the subject of great controversies within his government with the winning side led by Betancourt's secretary of Agriculture, [[Eduardo Mendoza Goiticoa|Eduardo Mendoza]].

===Reform of the oil industry===
In 1941, before AD's entry into policymaking, Venezuela received 85,279,158 [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolívars]] from oil taxes, out
of a total oil value of 691,093,935 bolivars. Before Betancourt's changes in the taxing system, the state of Venezuela was making only a fraction of what foreign oil companies were making in profit.  President Betancourt had overthrown the [[Isaías Medina Angarita]] government which enacted a law to tax oil companies up to 60%, and reserved for the government the right to raise more taxes as needed.  Betancourt changed the law to "Fifty Fifty."
One of Betancourt's original objectives was the [[nationalization]] of the country's oil industry. Mexico had nationalized its oil industry in 1938, and because its economy was more [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]] than Venezuela's, there was little to no backlash. Though oil nationalization became one of AD's main objectives, Venezuela's economy was not stable enough to handle potential boycotts by foreign oil companies and would have left nation fiscally vulnerable.

Rationalizing the complications of nationalization at the time, Betancourt's government raised taxes on oil production instead accomplishing the same goal: Venezuela's oil riches to benefit Venezuelans. In the late 1940s Venezuela was producing close to {{convert|500000000|oilbbl}} annually and as production climbed, the tax followed. Venezuela was the Allies' top oil supplier during the wars occurring in the European continent. Betancourt identified this potential to play an important historical role, using the knowledge to his nation's advantage transforming Venezuela into a global player. Germany then lacked reliable access to oil limiting troop movements. Some historians identify this vulnerability a deciding factor in Hitler's defeat. Venezuelan oil played a key role.

According to Betancourt, a spike in taxes was just as effective as nationalizing the oil industry, "Tax income was increased from then to such a degree that nationalization was unnecessary to obtain maximum economic benefits for the people of the country". Oil companies were forced to cede to the demands of labor unions and no longer entitled to make larger profits than the Venezuelan government. As a result, Betancourt's government generally had full support of the labor unions as the administration openly encouraged workers to organize. In 1946, 500 labor unions were created. Another notable achievement of Betancourt's first administration include the termination of the [[Concession (contract)|concession]] policy, the initial development of [[Oil refinery|refineries]] within Venezuela, and tremendous improvement in worker conditions and pay. [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]] served as Minister of Development in Betancourt's first term.

==Third exile==
[[File:RB during his exile in Havana, 1949.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Rómulo Betancourt during his exile in Havana, Cuba, 1949]]
On 27 November 1948, [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] and Luis Felipe Llovera Páez launched the [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'état]] and overthrew the elected president [[Rómulo Gallegos]], and Betancourt went into exile in New York City. In exile he planned a political return sustained on democratic principles and open elections legitimizing his national leadership role. His forward vision and strategy was successful and Betancourt was elected president by his own people upon returning to Venezuela. He had been determined to expose to the world the political problems and dictatorships that plagued the country through most of its modern history – a risky proposition.

"Betancourt's third, and longest, period of exile was a time of enormous frustration. In the prime of his life --for roughly the decade of his forties-- he was forced into relative inactivity and obscurity. He traveled extensively, living in Cuba, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, and remained a leader of an opposition-in-exile to the Perez Jimenez dictatorship. And of course wrote 'Venezuela: Oil and Politics'. A beach home outside of San Juan (Puerto Rico) provided a quiet refuge for this work," wrote Franklin Tugwell in his Introduction to the 1978 English publication of Betancourt's book.

"The preparation of this book has been as hectic as the life of the author. I wrote it first between the years 1937–39 while I was underground hiding from the police. It could not be published then because no Venezuelan publisher would dare risk printing a book written by one who was in such compromising position. The only typewritten copy was among my personal papers and it disappeared with them when a military patrol plundered the house I was living in when the constitutional government was overthrown on 24 November 1948. Thus most of the material from the first draft was lost.

"I believe that 'the dead command,' although not in the sense that reactionaries have traditionally given the phrase. When they die they give the command for an ideal of human excellence, obliging those who survive to finish their work,"  wrote Romulo Betancourt in the Prologue to the first edition of "Venezuela: Oil and Politics".

The book published in Mexico City by Editorial Fondo de Cultura Economica in 1956 was prohibited from circulating in Venezuela.
Effectively censored; yet Betancourt persisted.

==Second term as president==

Video of this ceremony [[:File:Kennedy in Latin America 1961 USIS.ogv|can be seen here]].]]

A decade later, after Pérez Jiménez was ousted, Betancourt was elected president in the [[Venezuelan general election, 1958|general election of 1958]], becoming the first leader of the [[Punto Fijo Pact]]. Having inherited a well constructed country but with the need to give more education to its people, Betancourt nevertheless managed to return the state to fiscal solvency despite the rock-bottom petroleum prices throughout his presidency.

In 1960 two important institutions were created by [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]], Betancourt's minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons: the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Corporación Venezolana del Petróleo — [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|CVP]]), conceived to oversee the national petroleum industry, and the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] ([[OPEC]]), the international oil cartel that Venezuela established in partnership with [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]]. Considered a radical revolutionary idea at the time by its opponents, but essential to Venezuela's independence and fiscal solvency by a visionary nationalistic Betancourt.

At an annual oil convention in Cairo, Venezuela's envoy, fluent in Arabic, convinced oil producing Middle Eastern countries to sign a secret agreement that promoted unity and control of their own national oil resources; under the noses of the British and American corporations that dominated the oil industry globally and had funded the event. Planting the seed for [[OPEC]] that was founded in September 1960 at [[Baghdad]], Iraq. This movement was triggered by a 1960 law instituted by American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] that forced quotas for Venezuelan oil and favored Canada and Mexico's oil industries. Eisenhower cited national security, land access to energy supplies, at times of war. Betancourt reacted seeking an alliance with oil producing Arab nations as a pre-emptive strategy to protect the continuous autonomy and profitability of Venezuela's oil, establishing a strong link between the South American nation and the Middle East region that survives to this day.

===Agrarian reform===
AD's land reform distributed unproductive private properties and public lands to halt the decline in agricultural production. Landowners who had their properties confiscated received generous compensation.

===FALN guerrilla group===
[[File:Rómulo Betancourt 59.jpg|thumb|Betancourt's inaugural address in 1959]]

Betancourt also faced determined opposition from extremists and rebellious army units, yet he continued to push for economic and educational reform. A fraction split from the AD and formed the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Venezuela)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR). When leftists were involved in unsuccessful revolts at Barcelona (''[[El Barcelonazo]]'') in 1961 and in navy bases in 1962 (''[[El Carupanazo]]'', [[Carúpano]] and ''[[El Porteñazo]]'', [[Puerto Cabello]]), Betancourt suspended civil liberties. Elements of the left parties then formed the [[Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (Venezuela)|Armed Forces for National Liberation]] (FALN), a communist guerrilla army to fight him. This drove the leftists underground, where they engaged in rural and urban guerrilla activities, including sabotaging oil pipelines, bombing a [[Sears Roebuck]] warehouse, [[Alfredo Di Stefano]] kidnapping, and bombing the United States Embassy in Caracas. FALN failed to rally the rural poor and to disrupt the December 1963 elections

After numerous attacks, he finally arrested the MIR and [[Communist Party of Venezuela]] (PCV) members of [[National Assembly of Venezuela|Congress]]. It became clear that a leftist [[Fidel Castro]] had been arming the rebels, so Venezuela protested to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).

===Assassination attempt===
Betancourt had denounced the dictatorship of [[Dominican Republic]]'s [[Rafael Leonidas Trujillo]] supported by the United States government. In turn, Trujillo had developed an obsessive personal hatred of Betancourt and supported many plots by Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. This led the Venezuelan government to take its case against Trujillo to the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], turning to diplomacy first over armed response to resolve the political conflict.  That in turn infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his foreign agents to assassinate Betancourt in Caracas. The 24 June 1960 attempt, in which the Venezuelan president was badly burned, inflamed world public opinion against Trujillo, who was in turn assassinated by his own people in the Dominican Republic only a year later, May 30, 1961.

Photos of a wounded but still living Betancourt were distributed around the world as proof he survived the assassination attempt that killed his head of security, and severely injured the driver who later died. An incendiary [[car bomb]] that was in a parked vehicle was detonated as his presidential car drove by one of [[Caracas]]' main avenues, shocking the nation. With both burned hands wrapped in bandages, Rómulo Betancourt walked out of the hospital in front of photographers. This incident elevated him in the eyes of the public opinion, and helped to destroy one of his most ferocious Caribbean enemies at the same time.

===1963 elections===
Perhaps one of the greatest of Betancourt's accomplishments, however, was the successful 1963 elections. Despite threats to disrupt the process, nearly 90 percent of the electorate participated on 1 December in what was the most honest election in Venezuela to that date. 11 March 1964 was a day of pride for the people of Venezuela as for the first time the presidential sash passed from one democratically elected chief executive to another. It should be noted prior to Betancourt changing the law, all presidents in Venezuela were elected by Congress – in typical republic model.

He was Venezuela's first democratically-elected president to serve his full term, and was succeeded by [[Raúl Leoni]].  It was Romulo Betancourt who established a democratic precedent for the nation that had been ruled by dictatorships for most of its history.

It was 'revolution' by popular vote, without historical reference until then; Betancourt created the political model that had survived in Venezuela for many years afterward.

===Betancourt Doctrine===
{{Social democracy sidebar|}}
[[File:Rómulo y Militares.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Rómulo Betancourt during a speech to a group of officers]]
The Venezuelan president's antipathy for nondemocratic rule was reflected in the so-called Betancourt Doctrine, which denied Venezuelan diplomatic recognition to any regime, right or left, that came to power by military force. Betancourt always defended, and represented, democratic values and principles in Latin America. This put him at odds with the military strongmen who came to dominate and define political perception of the region.
During his first message to Congress as President of Venezuela, on 12 February 1959, Betancourt said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...Regimes disrespectful of human rights, violating their citizens´ freedom, tyrannizing them with the backing of totalitarian political police, should be submitted to a rigorous sanitary cordon and eradicated, through collective pacification, from the Inter-American juridical community"&lt;ref name="RBDOCTRINE"&gt;The Daily Journal, 16 May 1977. (Rómulo Betancourt, The) "Return of the Warrior"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was during the tense [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], between the United States and Cuba, the relationship between President Kennedy and President Betancourt became closer than ever. Establishing a direct phone link between the White House and Miraflores (Presidential Palace) since the Venezuelan president had ample experience on dealing, defeating and surviving, actions of Caribbean-based pro-soviet regimes against pro-US regimes.

These conversations between both presidents were translated by Betancourt's only child, [[Virginia Betancourt|Virginia Betancourt Valverde]], who served as interpreter and confidant to her father.

Later president [[Rafael Caldera]] rejected the doctrine, which he thought had
served to isolate Venezuela in the world. A thesis that continues to be debated among academics and intellectuals who see in Betancourt not an isolationist but a courageous defender of democratic principles in the midst of adversity and ferreous enemies.

==Later life==
[[File:Betancourt playing soccer.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Betancourt playing soccer, c. 1960s]]
In 1964, Betancourt was awarded a [[Senator for life|lifetime seat]] in Venezuela's [[National Assembly of Venezuela|senate]], due to status as a former president. His last days were dedicated to writing and to his wife Dr. Renee Hartmann.  He died on 28 September 1981 in Doctors Hospital in [[New York City]]. On his death US President [[Ronald Reagan]] made the following statement:
:{{cquote|I speak for all Americans in expressing our heartfelt sadness at the death of Romulo Betancourt. While he was first and foremost a Venezuelan patriot, Romulo Betancourt was an especially close friend of the United States. During the 1950s he considered the United States a refuge while he was in exile, and we were proud to receive him. We are honored that this courageous man whose life was dedicated to the principles of liberty and justice – a man who fought dictatorships of the right and the left – spent his final days on our shores. We join the Venezuelan people and those who love freedom around the world in mourning his death.&lt;ref name="Ronald Reagan: Statement on the Death of Former President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela, September 29, 1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=44313|title=Ronald Reagan: Statement on the Death of Former President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==
Betancourt was married to [[Carmen Valverde]],{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} who served as [[List of First Ladies of Venezuela|First Lady of Venezuela]] from 1945–1948,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}, and 1959–1964. Virginia Betancourt Valverde was the Betancourt's only child. Divorced he married Dr. Renee Hartmann.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Rómulo Betancourt was a very close friend of the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], visiting the island often and frequently exchanging political views with him, viewing him as a political advisor on democracy. Although they disagreed on certain issues they remained faithful friends. On one occasion in 1963, he refused to attend the inauguration of [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] as president of the Dominican Republic if Bosch did not extend an invitation to Muñoz Marín, who had provided a safe haven for Bosch and various members of his political party in Puerto Rico. Betancourt attended the funeral of his friend in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;gallery&gt;

'''Samir Radwan''' ({{lang-ar|سمير رضوان}}) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] politician who served in the government of Egypt as [[Ministry of Finance (Egypt)|Minister of Finance]] from January 2011 to July 2011. He is an economist with a liberal viewpoint, interested in employment and human development issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/6308/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-cabinet-The-old,-the-new-and-the-unknown.aspx Egyptian cabinet: The old, the new and the unknown], Bassem Abo al-Abass and Michael Gunn, ''[[Ahram Online]]'', 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Radwan received his BSc from [[Cairo University]], moving onto [[the School of Oriental and African Studies]] for an MSc in the economics of underdeveloped countries—his thesis was on [[import substitution industrialization]]—and [[the University of London]] for a PhD on capital formation in Egyptian industry and agriculture from 1882 to 1967, marking the British occupation of Egypt and the Arabs' defeat in the Six Day War with Israel, respectively. The process, as well as facilitating epistemological growth, enabled him to empathize with such figures as [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], ruler of Egypt, and the nationalist industrial entrepreneur [[Talaat Harb]].

==Career==
Radwan worked at the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), and the last position he held there was that of adviser to the director general on development policies and counsellor on Arab countries. This served the dual purpose of earning him an international professional standing while keeping him, through one project after another, in more or less direct contact with Egypt: "I never really thought of myself as an expatriate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/735/profile.htm:Samir Radwan: Evolution from within], ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'', 30 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a board member of Egypt’s General Authority for Investment.&lt;ref name=alaa/&gt;

On 31 January 2011, amidst mass protests against President [[Hosni Mubarak]], Radwan was appointed as Minister of Finance in the cabinet led by [[Ahmed Shafik]], replacing [[Youssef Boutros-Ghali]] in the post.&lt;ref name=alaa&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Names Radwan Finance Minister in New Cabinet, Replaces Boutros-Ghali|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-31/mubarak-names-new-cabinet-replaces-finance-minister-as-protests-continue.html|accessdate=5 September 2013|work=Bloomberg|date=31 January 2011|author=Alaa Shaahine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Broun-Ramsay, Marchioness of Dalhousie''' (13 March 1817 &amp;ndash; 6 May 1853), formerly Lady Susan Georgiana Hay, was the wife of [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie]].

She was the daughter of [[George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale]], and his wife, the former Lady Susan Montagu.

On 21 January 1836 she married James Broun-Ramsay, who became Earl of Dalhousie in 1838, making her a countess. They had two children:
*Lady Susan Georgiana Ramsay (died 1898), who was married twice: first, to [[Robert Bourke, 1st Baron Connemara]], from whom she was divorced in 1890,&lt;ref&gt; L. G. Pine, The New Extinct Peerage 1884-1971: Containing Extinct, Abeyant, Dormant and Suspended Peerages With Genealogies and Arms (London, U.K.: Heraldry Today, 1972), page 82. &lt;/ref&gt; and second, to Surgn.-Lt.-Col. William Hamilton Briggs, who took the surname Broun. There were no children from either marriage.
*Lady Edith Christian Ramsay (died 1871), who married Rt. Hon. [[Sir James Fergusson, 6th Baronet]], and had children

For a period in 1842, the then countess was a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] to Queen Victoria, a position also held by her sister [[Elizabeth Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington|Elizabeth]], whose husband was the heir to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]]. However, Susan was obliged to resign because of health problems.&lt;ref name="Reynolds1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. D. Reynolds|title=Aristocratic Women and Political Society in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCWQq7VTGZ0C&amp;pg=PA224|year=1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-820727-6|pages=224–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 the earl was made Governor-General of India and Governor of Bengal, and in the following year he was elevated to the rank of marquess.  He was accompanied by his wife, but her health deteriorated and in 1852 she moved to [[Ceylon]] in the hope that the climate would help. In 1853 she began the sea journey back to Britain but was taken ill and died before reaching home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Ramsay, James Andrew Broun|author=Alexander John Arbuthnot|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a male heir, the marquessate lapsed after the death of James Broun-Ramsay in 1860 and the earldom passed to a nephew.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, Charles, editor.

'''Truman Bethurum''' (August 21, 1898 – May 21, 1969) was the second of the well known 1950s ''[[contactees]]'', individuals who claimed to have spoken with people from other inhabited planets and entered or ridden in their spacecraft. His experiences led him to visit and discuss the issue with earlier  contactee [[George Adamski]].

Bethurum was born in Gavalin, California, and in the early 1950s worked as a mechanic on a road-building crew and as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] advisor. In 1953 Bethurum first published magazine and newspaper (Redondo Beach
''Daily Breeze'', September 25, 1953) accounts of being contacted on eleven separate occasions by the human crew of a landed space ship, and repeatedly conversing with its voluptuous female captain, Aura Rhanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theironskeptic.com/articles/clarion/clarion.htm A sketch of Aura Rhanes is included&lt;/ref&gt; Saucer and crew, who spoke colloquial English, came from the unknown [[planet]] Clarion (allegedly on the other side of our [[moon]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lteid47_0-kC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=clarion+planet+%22other+side+of+the+moon%22++Bethurum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v_i5Ub-xI9Dh4APcp4GQCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clarion%20planet%20%22other%20side%20of%20the%20moon%22%20%20Bethurum&amp;f=false Alien Worlds: Social and Religious Dimensions of Extraterrestrial Contact] edited by Diana G. Tumminia, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;), which, from the [[earth]], always remains out of sight. A 1954 book, ''Aboard a Flying Saucer'', gave many details of Bethurum's suffering at the hands of skeptics and a great deal of information about Clarion and its people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRHoKVTawnMC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=ufos+from+another+planet+behind+the+sun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1c6vUKOkBuSqyAHBv4GABg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ufos%20from%20another%20planet%20behind%20the%20sun&amp;f=false The Ufo Book of Lists]|  By STEPHEN J SPIGNESI, Stephen J. Spignesi|&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pyv7UIBojboC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=Aboard+a+Flying+Saucer%27%27+by+Truman+Bethurum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UdCvUK-5GaSuyQHV_IHYCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aboard%20a%20Flying%20Saucer%27%27%20by%20Truman%20Bethurum&amp;f=false Strange Secrets: Real Government Files on the Unknown] By Nick Redfern, Andy Roberts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most contactees of this period became (or already were) leaders in new paradigm movements to inform people of extraterrestrial intelligent life, including [[George Adamski]], [[George Van Tassel]], [[Daniel Fry]], [[Aetherius Society|George King]] and many others. Mr Bethurum made it known that the space people had asked him to consider creating a place of learning for those who were interested in considering the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligent life, with Mr Bethurum as facilitator. The ''Sanctuary of Thought'', a philosophical group, was subsequently created near Prescott, Arizona. Mr Bethurum claimed to possess physical evidence such as unique items given to him by Captain Aura Rhanes. 

Some of Bethurum's later books include ''The Voice of the Planet Clarion'' (1957),  ''Facing Reality'' (1958), and ''The People of the Planet Clarion'' (1970), published after his death in [[Landers, California]] in 1969. The first 44 pages of the final book are an autobiography of Bethurum covering his life up to 1953. [[Columba Krebs]] wrote the afterword. 

Mr Bethurum himself jokingly remarked in his many public lectures that his second wife had divorced him in 1955 mainly due to jealousy of Captain Rhanes.  He later married a third time, with the wedding taking place at one of Mr George Van Tassel's popular yearly ''Giant Rock Spacecraft Conventions''.

Kissing was a favorite pose encouraged by media photographers of service personnel during [[World War II|the war]],{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but Eisenstaedt was photographing a spontaneous event that occurred in Times Square soon before the announcement of the end of the [[Pacific War|war with Japan]] was made by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] at seven o'clock.

Because he was photographing rapidly changing events during the celebrations, Eisenstaedt did not have an opportunity to get the names and details.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The photograph does not clearly show the face of either person involved, and numerous people have claimed to be the subjects. The photograph was shot just south of 45th Street looking north from a location where [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] converge.

The photograph was taken at 5:51&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET, according to Donald W. Olson and his team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/14/story-behind--kiss-vj-day/31676791/ |title = Mystery Clouds Times Square kiss for 70 years |work = [[USA Today]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911134216/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/14/story-behind--kiss-vj-day/31676791/ |archivedate = September 11, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was taken with a [[Leica III]]a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://life.time.com/history/v-j-day-kiss-in-times-square-and-other-celebrations-august-14-1945/#1 |title = V-J Day, 1945: A Nation Lets Loose |work = Life |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130901154612/http://life.time.com/history/v-j-day-kiss-in-times-square-and-other-celebrations-august-14-1945/#1 |archivedate = September 1, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounts by Alfred Eisenstaedt==
In two different books he wrote, Alfred Eisenstaedt gave two slightly different accounts of taking the photograph and of its nature.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

From ''Eisenstaedt on Eisenstaedt'':

{{Quote|1=In Times Square on V.J. Day I saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight. Whether she was a grandmother, stout, thin, old, didn't make a difference. I was running ahead of him with my [[Leica Camera|Leica]] looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me. Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse. If she had been dressed in a dark dress I would never have taken the picture. If the sailor had worn a white uniform, the same. I took exactly four pictures. It was done within a few seconds.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Only one is right, on account of the balance. In the others the emphasis is wrong&amp;nbsp;— the sailor on the left side is either too small or too tall. People tell me that when I am in heaven they will remember this picture.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}}}

From ''The Eye of Eisenstaedt'':

{{quote|1=I was walking through the crowds on V-J Day, looking for pictures. I noticed a sailor coming my way. He was grabbing every female he could find and kissing them all&amp;nbsp;— young girls and old ladies alike. Then I noticed the nurse, standing in that enormous crowd. I focused on her, and just as I'd hoped, the sailor came along, grabbed the nurse, and bent down to kiss her. Now if this girl hadn't been a nurse, if she'd been dressed dark clothes, I wouldn't have had a picture. The contrast between her white dress and the sailor's dark uniform gives the photograph its extra impact.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}}}

It became a [[cultural icon]] overnight and by establishing his copyright, Eisenstaedt carefully controlled the rights to it, only allowing a limited number of reproductions which determined how it could be used.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Another photograph of the same scene==
[[File:Kissing the War Goodbye.jpg|thumb|right|Jorgensen's similar photograph]]
U.S. Navy [[Photojournalism|photo journalist]] [[Victor Jorgensen]] captured another view of the same scene, which was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' the following day.&lt;ref name="COLUMBIA-FORUM"&gt;{{cite web |date = March–April 2007 |url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/mar_apr07/forum.php |title = Everyman in Times Square |publisher = Columbia Forum |access-date = September 24, 2007 |first = Marshall |last = Berman |quote = They were also photographed at just about the same moment, from a slightly different (and less exciting) angle, by U.S. Navy photographer Victor Jorgensen; Jorgensen's photo was printed in the next day's ''New York Times''. |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070829024522/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/mar_apr07/forum.php |archivedate = August 29, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorgensen titled his photograph ''Kissing the War Goodbye''. It shows less of Times Square in the background, lacking the characteristic view of the complex intersection so that the location needs to be identified, it is dark and shows few details of the main subjects, and it does not show the lower legs and feet of the subjects.

Unlike the Eisenstaedt photograph, which is protected by [[copyright]], this Navy photograph is in the [[public domain]] as it was produced by a federal government employee on official duty. While the angle of the photograph may be less interesting than that of Eisenstaedt's photo, it clearly shows the actual location of the iconic kiss occurring in the front of the [[Chemical Bank|Chemical Bank and Trust]] building, with the [[Walgreens]] pharmacy signage on the building façade visible in the background.

The surprised woman on the left in Jorgensen's photograph has been positively identified as Kay Hughes Dorius of Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Natalie |last = Andrews |date = November 10, 2006 |url = http://www.heraldextra.com/news/the-other-woman-in-the-wwii-kiss-photo/article_5e1391d9-d15f-5039-aee5-174068647290.html |title = The other woman in the WWII 'kiss" photo |work = Daily Herald |access-date = September 14, 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150916092517/http://www.heraldextra.com/news/the-other-woman-in-the-wwii-kiss-photo/article_5e1391d9-d15f-5039-aee5-174068647290.html |archivedate = September 16, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity of the kissers==

===Greta Zimmer Friedman===

Lawrence Verria and George Galdorisi, authors of ''The Kissing Sailor'', a 2012 book about the identity of the couple, used interviews of claimants, expert photo analysis, identifying people in the background and consultations with forensic anthropologists and facial recognition specialists. They concluded that the woman was [[Greta Zimmer Friedman]] and that she was wearing her dental hygienist uniform in the photograph.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;

"It wasn't my choice to be kissed," Friedman stated in a 2005 interview with the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=consent&gt;{{cite web |url = http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.42863/transcript?ID=sr0001 |title = Interview Transcript: Greta Zimmer Friedman: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress) |website = American Memory |first = Patricia |last = Redmond |date = August 23, 2005 |accessdate = September 12, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160916153530/http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.42863/transcript?ID=sr0001 |archivedate = September 16, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The guy just came over and grabbed!" she said, adding, "That man was very strong.

===Edith Shain===
[[File:Edith Shain.jpg|thumb|Edith Shain at the 2008 Memorial Day parade in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

Edith Shain wrote to Eisenstaedt in 1980 claiming to be the woman in the picture.&lt;ref name=posed&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Lucas |first1 = Dean |work = Famous Pictures Magazine |title = VJday Times Square Kiss |date = April 17, 2007 |url = http://www.famouspictures.org/vjday-times-square-kiss/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130718145945/http://www.famouspictures.org/vjday-times-square-kiss/ |archivedate = July 18, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Wadler |first1 = Joyce |title = The Shot Seen Round the World |work = The Washington Post |date = August 16, 1980 |page = D1 |quote=Then, 35 years later, the nurse, a Mrs. Edith Shain, 62, from Beverly Hills, broke the silence. Contacted the photographer, Alfred Eisenstaedt, identified herself, and asked for a print. At Life, where the publisher keeps the picture on his wall, there was great jubilation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1945, Shain was working at [[Doctors Hospital (Manhattan)|Doctor's Hospital]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]] as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that [[World War II]] had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought she might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On June 20, 2010, Shain died at age 91 of [[liver cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/nyregion/24shain.html?ref=obituaries |title = Edith Shain, Who Said Famous Kiss Came Her Way, Dies at 91 |date = June 22, 2010 |accessdate = June 22, 2010 |work = The New York Times |first = Richard |last = Goldstein |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325060033/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/nyregion/24shain.html?ref=obituaries |archivedate = March 25, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verria and Galdorisi's 2012 book stated that Shain could not have been the woman because her height of just {{convert|4|ft|10|in|abbr=on}} was insufficient in comparison with the height of any of the men claiming to be the sailor.&lt;ref name=bell&gt;{{cite news |first = Diane |last = Bell |url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/apr/20/famous-kissing-sailor-photo-sparks-true-detective/?page=1#article |title = Famous 'kissing sailor' photo sparks true detective tale |work = U-T San Diego |date = April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claiming to be the U.S. Navy sailor===
Numerous men have claimed to be the sailor, including Donald Bonsack, John Edmonson, Wallace C. Fowler, Clarence "Bud" Harding, Walker Irving, James Kearney, Marvin Kingsburg, Arthur Leask, George Mendonça, Jack Russell, and Bill Swicegood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.life.com/Life/special/kiss03.html/ |title = Who is the Kissing Sailor? |work = Life |date = October 1980 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055308/http://www.life.com/Life/special/kiss03.html |archivedate = October 19, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====George Mendonsa====
[[File:George Mendonca and Greta Friedman.jpg|thumb|George Mendonsa and Greta Friedman, guests of honor at the Bristol, Rhode Island, July 4 parade in 2009]]
George Mendonsa of [[Newport, Rhode Island]], on leave from the {{USS|The Sullivans|DD-537}}, was watching a movie with his future wife, Rita,&lt;ref name="posed"/&gt; at [[Radio City Music Hall]] when the doors opened and people started screaming the war was over.&lt;ref name=whdh20130825/&gt; George and Rita joined the partying on the street, but when they could not get into the packed bars decided to walk down the street. It was then that George saw a woman in a white dress walk by and took her into his arms and kissed her, "I had quite a few drinks that day and I considered her one of the troops—she was a nurse."&lt;ref name="posed"/&gt; In one of the four pictures that Eisenstaedt took, Mendonsa claims that Rita is visible in the background behind the kissing couple.&lt;ref name="posed"/&gt;

In 1987, George Mendonsa filed a lawsuit against Time Inc. in Rhode Island state court, alleging that he was the sailor in the photograph and that both ''Time'' and ''Life'' had violated his right of publicity by using the photograph without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url = http://www.leagle.com/decision/19881645678FSupp967_11471 |litigants = Mendonsa v. Time Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123024610/http://www.leagle.com/decision/19881645678FSupp967_11471 |archive-date=November 23, 2014  |vol = 678 |reporter= F.Supp |opinion = 967  |court = D. R.I. |year = 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to match Time Inc.'s deep pockets, Mendonsa dropped his lawsuit in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Verria |first1=Lawrence |last2=Galdorisi |first2=George |year=2012 |title=The Kissing Sailor: The Mystery Behind the Photo That Ended World War II |location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=118 |isbn=9-781612-510781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendonsa was identified by a team of volunteers from the [[Naval War College]] in August 2005 as "the kisser". His claim was based on matching his scars and tattoos to scars and tattoos in the photograph.&lt;ref name="posed"/&gt; They made their determination after much study including photographic analysis by the [[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories]] (MERL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who were able to match scars and tattoo spotted by photograph experts, and the testimony of Richard M. Benson, a photograph analysis expert, professor of photographic studies, plus the former Dean of the [[School of Arts at Yale University]]. Benson stated that "it is therefore my opinion, based upon a reasonable degree of certainty, that George Mendonsa is the sailor in Mr. Eisenstaedt's famous photograph."&lt;ref name="posed"/&gt;

The identity of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa's account of the events of the day, the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows in the photographs suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, its minute hand near the 10 and its hour hand pointing virtually vertically downward, indicating a time of approximately 5:50, and to Victor Jorgensen's account of the circumstances of his own picture. They concluded that Mendonsa's version of events is untenable.&lt;ref name=skytelescope&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Olson |first1 = Donald W. |last2 = Doescher |first2 = Russell L. |last3 = Kawaler |first3 = Steven D. |title = Telltale Sun &amp; Shadow: Astronomy &amp; the VJ Day Kiss |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = August 2015 |pages = 30–35 |url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/VJDay.pdf |accessdate = January 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carl Muscarello====
Carl Muscarello is a retired police officer with the [[New York City Police Department]], now living in [[Plantation, Florida]]. In 1995, he claimed to be the kissing sailor. He claimed that he was in Times Square on August 14, 1945, and that he kissed numerous women. A distinctive birthmark on his hand enabled his mother to identify him as the subject. Edith Shain initially said she believed Muscarello's claim to be the sailor and they even dated after their brief reunion. But in 2005, Shain was much less certain, telling the ''New York Times,'' "I can't say he isn't. I just can't say he is.

Glenn McDuffie laid claim in 2007 and was supported by [[Houston Police Department]] forensic artist [[Lois Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Juan A. |last = Lozano |url = http://www.newsobserver.com/1565/story/659188.html |title = Forensic expert: N.C. native is sailor in famous wartime photo |work = The News and Observer |date = August 3, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=Imzadi1979 |fix-attempted=yes }} {{cite news |first = Juan A. |last = Lozano |url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070803/ap_on_re_us/kissing_sailor_1;_ylt=AtZvuKNpyW0vDj.Ywu_On9dsaMYA |title = Man says he's the sailor in famous photo |agency = Associated Press |date = August 3, 2007 |work = Yahoo! News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's forensic analysis compared the Eisenstaedt photographs with current-day photographs of McDuffie, analyzing key facial features identical on both sets. She measured his ears, facial bones, hairline, wrist, knuckles, and hand, and compared those to enlargements of Eisenstaedt's picture.

{{quote|1=I could tell just in general that yes, it's him.

In the August 14, 2007, issue of ''[[AM New York]]'' McDuffie said he passed five [[polygraph]] tests confirming his claim to be the man.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;Dispute over famed smooch&amp;nbsp;– AM New York&amp;nbsp;– August 14, 2007{{full citation needed|date = June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDuffie, a native of [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], who had lied about his age so he could enlist at the age of 15, went on after the war to play semi-pro [[baseball]] and work for the [[United States Postal Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.independenttribune.com/news/article_8214a1b2-abc5-11e3-9ae0-0017a43b2370.html |title = Kannapolis sailor in iconic WWII photo dies in Houston |work = [[Independent Tribune]] |accessdate = March 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ajc.com/news/news/national/kissing-sailor-famous-wwii-photograph-dies/nfDT3/ |title = 'Kissing sailor' from famous WWII photograph dies |work = [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate = March 15, 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140315155838/http://www.ajc.com/news/news/national/kissing-sailor-famous-wwii-photograph-dies/nfDT3/ |archivedate = March 15, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that on that day he was on the subway to Brooklyn to visit his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; He came out of the subway at Times Square, where people were celebrating in the streets. Excited that his brother, who was being held by the Japanese as a prisoner of war, would be released, McDuffie began hollering and jumping up and down. A nurse saw him, and opened her arms to him. In apparent conflict with Eisenstaedt's recollections of the event, McDuffie said he ran over to her and kissed her for a long time so that Eisenstaedt could take the photograph:

{{quote|1=I went over there and kissed her and saw a man running at us...I thought it was a jealous husband or boyfriend coming to poke me in the eyes. I looked up and saw he was taking the picture and I kissed her as long as took for him to take it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnlyinAmerica/story?id=3422191&amp;page=1/ |title = Man Claims He's the Mystery Sailor in ''The Kiss'' |publisher = ABC News |date = August 7, 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110521201917/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnlyinAmerica/story?id=3422191&amp;page=1%2F |archivedate = May 21, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gibson had also analyzed photographs of other men who have claimed to be the sailor, including Muscarello and Mendonça, reporting that neither man's facial bones or other features match those of the sailor in the photograph. On August 3, 2008, Glenn McDuffie was recognized for his 81st birthday as the "Kissing Sailor" during the [[seventh-inning stretch]] of the [[Houston Astros]] and [[New York Mets]] game at [[Minute Maid Park]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} McDuffie died on March 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/glenn-mcduffie-man-known-as-kissing-sailor-in-wwii-era-photo-dead-at-86-1.2573355 |title = Glenn McDuffie, man known as kissing sailor in WWII-era photo, dead at 86 |publisher = [[CBC News]].com |accessdate = March 15, 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140315034853/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/glenn-mcduffie-man-known-as-kissing-sailor-in-wwii-era-photo-dead-at-86-1.2573355 |archivedate = March 15, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other people====
''Life''{{'}}s October 1980 issue did not include Muscarello or Glenn McDuffie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/that-times-square-smooch-right-to-the-kisser/ |title = When a Kiss Isn't Just a Kiss |work = The New York Times |date = August 6, 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070825030813/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/that-times-square-smooch-right-to-the-kisser/ |archivedate = August 25, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have been made much more recently.

Mendonça and Friedman (both individually and together), as well as Shain, Muscarello, and McDuffie, were widely interviewed in the succeeding years by ''Life'', PBS, NBC, CBS, and others. Mendonça recognizes Friedman, to the exclusion of any other woman, as the "nurse" he kissed in the photographs (or, to be precise, the woman in the white uniform, as Friedman was a dental assistant—a nurse's uniform was customary in a dentist's office to be worn by female assistants and hygienists in that era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Christina |last = Bates |title = A Cultural History of the Nurse's Uniform |publisher = Canadian Museum of Civilization, |year = 2012 |isbn = 978-0660201849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of a World War II memorial at [[Battleship Cove]] in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], a new painting titled ''Victory Kiss'' by Jim Laurier of New Hampshire
was first unveiled on August 24, 2013, to honor the event captured in the photo.  George Mendonça was in attendance for the unveiling.&lt;ref name=whdh20130825&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/10011509847987/iconic-wwii-painting-unveiled-at-battleship-cove/ |title = Iconic WWII painting unveiled at Battleship Cove |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = August 25, 2013 |publisher = WHDH-TV |accessdate = August 25, 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130827125339/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/10011509847987/iconic-wwii-painting-unveiled-at-battleship-cove/ |archivedate = August 27, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate interpretations ==
The original interpretations of the photo centered around the jubilation of the V-J Day celebrations. Art critic Michael Kimmelman summarized the composition in 1997 as reflective of that mood: the sailor representing returning troops, the nurse to represent those who would welcome them home, and Times Square stood for home. Since then, bloggers in the 2010s have called the photo documentation of a type of normalized [[sexual assault]]. The people pictured in the photograph did not previously know one another. Drunk at the time of the photograph, the sailor is shown kissing an unwilling partner. The widely agreed upon identity of the female subject in the photo, dental assistant [[Greta Zimmer Friedman]], had also explicitly expressed that the kiss in question was not a consensual act. Combined with the humorous expressions on the bystanders and the sailor's firm grasp of the nurse, the situation has been described as emblematic of a time when women were "subordinated to men", or of a [[rape culture]].&lt;ref name=popcult&gt;{{Cite book|title=Popular Culture|last=Gronseth|first=Michael|publisher=Cognella|year=2015|isbn=978-1634872881|editor-last=Howell|editor-first=Mark|edition=1st|location=|pages=47–52|chapter=A Kiss Is Just A Kiss...

'''William Grose''' (sometimes spelled Gross) (1835 &amp;ndash; July 27, 1898) was an [[African-American]] pioneer of [[Seattle]]. He was that city's second black resident, and the wealthiest nineteenth-century member of Seattle's black community. His former ranch on the outskirts of town, along East Madison Street, eventually became the center of Seattle's black middle class.

==Biography==
Grose was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], to a free black restaurant owner. He enlisted into the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/393|title=Grose, William (1835-1898) - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the navy to settle in [[California]] and [[British Columbia]] before arriving in Seattle in 1861, as a ship's steward, followed shortly after by his wife, Sarah, and two children. Sarah Grose and their daughter Rebecca were Seattle's first female black residents. Grose was encouraged by the then Governor [[Isaac Stevens]] to settle in Washington Territory after finding and keeping safe the governor's watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/393|title=Grose, William (1835-1898) - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 Grose opened a restaurant and hotel on [[Yesler Way]] called "Our House", which was popular with Seattle's largely white population, and later added a barbershop. Restaurants and barber shops were two of the only occupations open to blacks in pioneer Seattle, which, though it did not have the explicitly racist laws of neighboring states like [[Oregon]] and [[Idaho]], offered black opportunity only in limited, usually menial positions. The important lumbering, mining, and shipping industries of early Seattle and environs were closed to blacks. Seattle's first black resident, [[Manuel Lopes (barber)|Manuel Lopes]] (who arrived in 1858, just seven years after the [[Denny Party]] landed on [[Alki Point, Seattle|Alki]]), also was a cook and a barber. Grose's hotel provided lodging for many of Seattle's earliest black residents, who arrived as [[transient laborer]]s in the latter part of the nineteenth century.

He was successful enough to buy, in 1882, twelve acres along East Madison Street from [[Henry Yesler]]. After Grose's hotel burned in the [[Great Seattle Fire]] in 1889, he moved his home to 2813 E Howell &lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. U.S. City Directories, 1822-1995. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; where he lived at the time of his death.  After his death his widow, Sara, lived at 1729 24th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;1910 Federal Census, Seattle Ward 3, King, Washington; Roll: T624_1659; Page: 3B; Enumeration District: 0093; FHL microfilm: 1375672&lt;/ref&gt;  The house next door at 1733 24th Avenue, is often credited with being his house but it was built in 1901 after his death. He gradually sold off house lots to other successful African-Americans in Seattle's small community, and this area became the northern anchor of what eventually became Seattle's [[Central District, Seattle, Washington|Central District]]. The southern anchor, Jackson Street, was poorer, more transient, and rowdier, being part of [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]].

By the 1890s, Grose was Seattle's wealthiest black resident. In 1891 Grose, along with Dr. Samuel Burdett and Conrad Rideout, formed the Cornerstone Grand Lodge of the York [[Freemasonry|Masons]], Seattle's first black Masonic chapter. Women relatives of the black Masons formed the Queen of Sheba Court. This lodge led annual parades down Madison Street from its inception until the 1940s.

Grose was a trustee of Seattle's first African-American church, the Jones Street African Methodist Episcopal Church (now First AME Church), which was founded in 1891, by Reverend L. S. Blakeney, Seaborn J. Collins, Alfred P. Freeman, and Grose's son George H. Grose.

Grose died on July 27, 1898 and is buried in [[Lake View Cemetery (Seattle)]].

'''Zookeeper''', a.k.a. Dr. Samuel Register, is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics.

==Publication history==
Zookeeper first appeared in ''Teen Titans'' #13-15 (Sep. - Nov. 2004) and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Tom Grummett]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Dr. Samuel Register''' worked with Mark and Marie Logan in Africa. He despised their rambunctious son [[Beast Boy|Garfield]] who constantly caused damage in his lab. He was (and still is) obsessed with people calling him "Dr. Register" and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #14 (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Logan's parents successfully cured Garfield of Sakutia, Register went on to try to finish their work. He became mad for results and inhumanly slaughtered animals in experiments which produced grotesque [[mutation]]s. This earned him the nickname "Zookeeper".&lt;ref name="TT13"&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #13 (September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Beast Boys and Girls" storyline, Register stole a sample of Sakutia to try to mutate it like Garfield's parents did. He accidentally infected himself and every kid in [[San Francisco]] where the infection turned his skin purple. When Beast Boy was infected, the virus in him was canceled out and he was cured.&lt;ref name="TT13"/&gt;

Zookeeper injected venom from the [[Australian venomous funnel-web spider|Sydney funnel-web spider]] into Garfield and attempted to dissect and extract the cure to Sakutia from him. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the other [[Teen Titans|Titans]] kept Register busy while [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] healed Beast Boy. Wanting to stop Zookeeper desperately, Garfield reinfected himself with Sakutia. His powers back to speed, Beast Boy fought and defeated Zookeeper in a shapeshifting battle. He also found a way to cure the kids that were infected. Apparently, Register is immune to Sakutia like Beast Boy.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #15 (November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Villains United]] [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'', [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] broke Zookeeper out of prison. He then joined [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].&lt;ref&gt;''Villains United: Infinite Crisis'' Special&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, Zookeeper was recruited by [[Superboy-Prime]] as part of a new version of the [[Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Zookeeper can turn into any animal at will, just like Beast Boy. However, his side effects are different from Garfield's. His skin is purple and scaly and his eyes and hair did not change color with his skin.
