[[File:simple stellar aberration diagram.svg|thumb|The apparent position of a star viewed from the Earth depends on the Earth's velocity. The effect is typically much smaller than illustrated.]]

The '''aberration of light''' (also referred to as '''astronomical aberration''', '''stellar aberration''', or '''velocity aberration''') is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] phenomenon which produces an [[apparent place|apparent motion]] of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer. Aberration causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary. The change in angle is typically very small — of the order of ''v/c'' where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''v'' the [[velocity]] of the observer. In the case of "stellar" or "annual" aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth's velocity changes as it [[orbital revolution|revolves]] around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s in [[right ascension]] or [[declination]].

The term ''aberration'' has historically been used to refer to a number of related phenomena concerning the propagation of light in moving bodies.&lt;ref name="schaffner"&gt;{{Citation

Aberration should not be confused with ''[[stellar parallax|parallax]]''. The latter is a change in the apparent position of a relatively nearby object, as measured by a moving observer, relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame. The amount of parallax depends on the ''distance'' of the object from the observer, whereas aberration does not. Aberration is also related to [[light-time correction]] and [[relativistic beaming]], although it is often considered separately from these effects.

Aberration is historically significant because of its role in the development of the theories of [[light]], [[electromagnetism]] and, ultimately, the theory of [[special relativity]]. It was first observed in the late 1600s by astronomers searching for stellar parallax in order to confirm the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the Solar System.  However, it was not understood at the time to be a different phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Williams, M. E.

which he used to make one of the earliest measurements of the speed of light. However, Bradley's theory was incompatible with 19th century theories of light, and aberration became a major motivation for the [[aether drag hypothesis|aether drag theories]] of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Augustin Fresnel]] (in 1818) and [[George Gabriel Stokes|G. G. Stokes]] (in 1845), and for [[Hendrik Lorentz]]'s [[Lorentz ether theory|aether theory]] of electromagnetism in 1892. The aberration of light, together with Lorentz's elaboration of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electrodynamics]], the [[moving magnet and conductor problem]], the [[Michelson–Morley experiment|negative aether drift experiments]], as well as the [[Fizeau experiment]], led [[Albert Einstein]] to develop the theory of special relativity in 1905, which presents a general form of the equation for aberration in terms of such theory.&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;{{Citation|author=Norton, John D. |date=2004 |first1=John D. |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |title=Einstein's Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics prior to 1905 |pages=45–105 |volume=59 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001743/ |doi=10.1007/s00407-004-0085-6 |bibcode=2004AHES...59...45N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111103932/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001743/ |archivedate=2009-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[File:Sun earth relativistic aberration.svg|thumb|300px|Light rays striking the earth in the Sun's rest frame compared to the same rays in the Earth's rest frame according to special relativity. The effect is exaggerated for illustrative purposes.]]

Aberration may be explained as the difference in angle of a beam of light in different [[inertial frames of reference]]. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.

The net effect is that light rays striking the moving observer from the sides in a stationary frame will come angled from ahead in the moving observer's frame. This effect is sometimes called the "searchlight" or "headlight" effect.

In the case of annual aberration of starlight, the direction of incoming starlight as seen in the Earth's moving frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame. Since the direction of motion of the Earth changes during its orbit, the direction of this tilting changes during the course of the year, and causes the apparent position of the star to differ from its true position as measured in the inertial frame of the Sun.

While classical reasoning gives intuition for aberration, it leads to a number of physical paradoxes observable even at the classical level (see [[#Historical_theories_of_aberration|history]]). The theory of [[special relativity]] is required to correctly account for aberration. The relativistic explanation is very similar to the classical one however, and in both theories aberration may be understood as a case of [[vector space|addition of velocities]].

===Classical explanation===
In the Sun's frame, consider a beam of light with velocity equal to the speed of light c, with x and y velocity components &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_y&lt;/math&gt;, at an angle &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) = u_y/u_x&lt;/math&gt;. If the Earth is moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in the x direction relative to the Sun, then by velocity addition the x component of the beam's velocity in the Earth's frame of reference is &lt;math&gt;u_x' = u_x + v&lt;/math&gt;, and the y velocity is unchanged, &lt;math&gt;u_y' = u_y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the angle of the light in the Earth's frame in terms of the angle in the Sun's frame is

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac{u_y'}{u_x'} = \frac{u_y}{u_x+v} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{v/c + \cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\theta = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, this result reduces to &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta - \phi) = v/c&lt;/math&gt;, which in the limit &lt;math&gt;v/c \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; may be approximated by &lt;math&gt;\theta - \phi = v/c&lt;/math&gt;. 
===Relativistic explanation===
The reasoning in the relativistic case is the same except that the [[Velocity-addition formula|relativistic velocity addition]] formulas must be used, which can be derived from [[Lorentz transformations]] between different frames of reference. These formulae are

:&lt;math&gt;u_x' = (u_x + v)/(1+u_x v/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u_y' = u_y / \gamma (1+u_x v/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;, giving the components of the light beam in the Earth's frame in terms of the components in the Sun's frame. The angle of the beam in the Earth's frame is thus &lt;ref name=Mould&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Relativity |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0-387-95210-1 |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |author=Richard A. Mould |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac{u_y'}{u_x'} = \frac{u_y}{\gamma(u_x+v)} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\gamma(v/c + \cos(\theta))}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\theta = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, this result reduces to &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta - \phi) = v/c&lt;/math&gt;, and in the limit &lt;math&gt;v/c \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; this may be approximated by &lt;math&gt;\theta - \phi = v/c&lt;/math&gt;. This relativistic derivation keeps the speed of light &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2} = c&lt;/math&gt; constant in all frames of reference, unlike the classical derivation above.

===Relationship to light-time correction and relativistic beaming===
[[File:aberrationlighttimebeaming.gif|thumb|400px|Aberration, light-time correction, and relativistic beaming can be considered the same phenomenon depending on the frame of reference.]]

Aberration is related to two other phenomena, [[light-time correction]], which is due to the motion of an observed object during the time taken by its light to reach an observer, and [[relativistic beaming]], which is an angling of the light emitted by a moving light source. It can be considered equivalent to them but in a different inertial frame of reference. In aberration, the observer is considered to be moving relative to a (for the sake of simplicity&lt;ref&gt;In fact, the light source doesn't need to be stationary, consider for example eclipsing binary stars: they are rotating with high speed —and ever changing and different velocity vectors— around each other, but they appear as '''one''' spot all the time.&lt;/ref&gt;) stationary light source, while in light-time correction and relativistic beaming the light source is considered to be moving relative to a stationary observer.

Consider the case of an observer and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.

The relationship between these phenomena is only valid if the observer and source's frames are inertial frames. In practice, because the Earth is not an inertial rest frame but experiences centripetal [[acceleration]] towards the Sun, many aberrational effects such as annual aberration on Earth cannot be considered light-time corrections. However, if the time between emission and detection of the light is short compared to the orbital period of the Earth, the Earth may be approximated as an inertial frame and aberrational effects are equivalent to light-time corrections.

==Types of aberration==
There are a number of types of aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's and observed object's motion:

* '''Annual aberration''' is due to the orbital [[orbit|revolution]] of the Earth around the Sun.
* '''Planetary aberration''' is the combination of aberration and light-time correction.
* '''Diurnal aberration''' is due to the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the Earth about its own axis.
* '''Secular aberration''' is due to the motion of the Sun and [[Solar System]] relative to other stars in our [[Galaxy]].

===Annual aberration===
[[File:Aberration3.svg|thumb|250px|Stars at the [[ecliptic pole]]s appear to move in circles, stars exactly in the ecliptic plane move in lines, and stars at intermediate angles move in ellipses. Shown here are the apparent motions of stars with the [[ecliptic latitude]]s corresponding to these cases, and with [[ecliptic longitude]] of 270°.]]
[[File:aberrationseasons.svg|thumb|250px|The direction of aberration of a star at the northern ecliptic pole differs at different times of the year]]
{{see also|Stellar parallax}}

Annual aberration is caused by the motion of an observer on [[Earth]] as the planet revolves around the [[Sun]]. Due to [[orbital eccentricity]], the [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of Earth (in the Sun's rest frame) [[Kepler orbit|varies]] periodically during the year as the planet traverses its [[elliptic orbit]] and consequently the aberration also varies periodically, typically causing stars to [[stellar parallax|appear to move]] in small [[ellipse]]s.

Approximating [[Earth's orbit]] as circular, the maximum displacement of a star due to annual aberration is known as the ''constant of aberration'', conventionally represented by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. It may be calculated using the relation &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \theta-\phi \approx v/c &lt;/math&gt; substituting the Earth's average speed in the Sun's frame for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Its accepted value is 20.49552 &amp;nbsp;[[minute and second of atc|arcseconds]] (at [[J2000]]).&lt;ref name="kovalevsky"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Kovalevsky |first2=P. Kenneth |last2=Seidelmann |last-author-amp=yes |date=2004 |title=Fundamentals of Astrometry
|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-64216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming a [[circular orbit]], annual aberration causes stars exactly on the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of Earth's orbit) to appear to move back and forth along a straight line, varying by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; on either side of their position in the Sun's frame. A star that is precisely at one of the [[ecliptic pole]]s (at 90° from the ecliptic plane) will appear to move in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; about its true position, and stars at intermediate [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitudes]] will appear to move along a small [[ellipse]].

For illustration, consider a star at the northern ecliptic pole viewed by an observer at a point on the [[Arctic Circle]]. Such an observer will see the star [[culmination|transit]] at the [[zenith]], once every day (strictly speaking [[sidereal day]]). At the time of the [[March equinox]], Earth's orbit carries the observer in a southwards direction, and the star's apparent [[declination]] is therefore displaced to the south by an angle of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. On the [[September equinox]], the star's position is displaced to the north by an equal and opposite amount. On either [[solstice]], the displacement in declination is 0. Conversely, the amount of displacement in [[right ascension]] is 0 on either [[equinox]] and at maximum on either solstice.

&lt;!-- In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the aberration's effect in [[right ascension]] (east-west) is larger than the effect in [[declination]] (north-south) except at the ecliptic poles. Despite this, its effect in declination was the first observed because very accurate clocks are needed to measure such a small variation in right ascension, but a [[transit telescope]] calibrated with a [[plumb bob|plumb line]] can detect very small changes in declination.
--&gt;
In actuality, Earth's orbit is slightly elliptic rather than circular, and its speed varies somewhat over the course of its orbit, which means the description above is only approximate. Aberration is more accurately calculated using  Earth's instantaneous velocity relative to the [[barycenter]] of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=kovalevsky/&gt;

Note that the displacement due to aberration is orthogonal to any displacement due to [[parallax]]. If parallax were detectable, the maximum displacement to the south would occur in December, and the maximum displacement to the north in June. It is this apparently anomalous motion that so mystified early astronomers.

====Solar annual aberration====
A special case of annual aberration is the nearly constant deflection of the Sun from its position in the Sun's rest frame by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; towards the ''west'' (as viewed from Earth), opposite to the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic (which is from west to east, as seen from Earth). The deflection thus makes the Sun appear to be behind (or retarded) from its rest-frame position on the ecliptic by a position or angle &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

This deflection may equivalently be described as a light-time effect due to motion of the Earth during the 8.3&amp;nbsp;minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. This is possible since the transit time of sunlight is short relative to the orbital period of the Earth, so the Earth's frame may be approximated as inertial. In the Earth's frame, the Sun moves by a distance &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = vt&lt;/math&gt; in the time it takes light to reach Earth, &lt;math&gt;t=R/c&lt;/math&gt; for the orbit of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. This gives an angular correction &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) \approx \theta = \Delta x/R&lt;/math&gt; which can be solved to give &lt;math&gt;\theta = v/c = \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, the same as the aberrational correction.

===Planetary aberration===
{{see also|Light-time correction}}
Planetary aberration is the combination of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and light-time correction (due to the object's motion and distance), as calculated in the rest frame of the Solar System. Both are determined at the instant when the moving object's light reaches the moving observer on Earth. It is so called because it is usually applied to planets and other objects in the Solar System whose motion and distance are accurately known.

===Diurnal aberration===
Diurnal aberration is caused by the velocity of the observer on the surface of the [[Earth's rotation|rotating Earth]]. It is therefore dependent not only on the time of the observation, but also the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the observer. Its effect is much smaller than that of annual aberration, and is only 0.32 [[minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] in the case of an observer at the [[Equator]], where the rotational velocity is greatest.&lt;ref name=newcomb/&gt;

===Secular aberration===
The Sun and Solar System are revolving around the center of the Galaxy. Aberration due to this motion is known as secular aberration and affects the apparent positions of distant stars and [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] objects. However, since the [[galactic year]] is about 230 million years, the aberration varies very slowly and this change is extremely difficult to observe. Therefore, secular aberration is usually ignored when considering the positions of stars. In other words, star maps show the observed apparent positions of the stars, not their calculated true positions after accounting for secular aberration.

For stars significantly less than 230 million [[light years]] away, the Solar System may be approximated as an inertial frame and so the effect of secular aberration is equivalent to a light-time correction. This includes stars in the [[Milky Way]], since the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. For these stars the true position of the star is then easily computed from its [[proper motion]] and its distance.

Secular aberration is typically a small number of [[arcminutes]], for example the stationary star [[Groombridge 1830]] is displaced by approximately 3&amp;nbsp;arcminutes,&lt;ref name="newcomb"&gt;

This is roughly 8 times the effect of annual aberration, as one would expect since the velocity of the Solar System relative to the center of the Galaxy is about 8 times the velocity of the Earth relative to the Sun.

==Discovery and first observations==
The discovery of the aberration of light was totally unexpected, and it was only by considerable perseverance and perspicacity that [[James Bradley|Bradley]] was able to explain it in 1727. It originated from attempts to discover whether stars possessed appreciable [[stellar parallax|parallaxes]].

===Search for stellar parallax===
The [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[heliocentricity|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System]] had received confirmation by the observations of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] and the mathematical investigations of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}} As early as 1573, [[Thomas Digges]] had suggested that parallactic shifting of the stars should occur according to the heliocentric model, and consequently if stellar parallax could be observed it would help confirm this theory.  Many observers claimed to have determined such parallaxes, but Tycho Brahe and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] concluded that they existed only in the minds of the observers, and were due to instrumental and personal errors. However, in 1680 [[Jean Picard]], in his ''Voyage d’[[Uraniborg|Uranibourg]],'' stated, as a result of ten [[year]]s' observations, that [[Polaris]], the Pole Star, exhibited variations in its position amounting to 40″ annually. Some astronomers endeavoured to explain this by parallax, but these attempts failed because the motion differed from that which parallax would produce. [[John Flamsteed]], from measurements made in 1689 and succeeding years with his mural quadrant, similarly concluded that the declination of Polaris was 40″ less in July than in September. [[Robert Hooke]], in 1674, published his observations of [[Gamma Draconis|γ Draconis]], a star of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; which passes practically overhead at the latitude of London (hence its observations are largely free from the complex corrections due to [[atmospheric refraction]]), and concluded that this star was 23″ more northerly in July than in October.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}}

===James Bradley's observations===
[[File:Bradley's observations of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis as reduced by Busch.jpg|thumb|Bradley's observations of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis as reduced by Busch to the year 1730.]]

Consequently, when Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]] entered this sphere of research in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and it was with the intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at [[Kew]].&lt;ref name="Hirshfeld"/&gt; They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical chimney stack in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}}

The instrument was set up in November 1725, and observations on γ Draconis were made starting in December. The star was observed to move 40″ southwards between September and March, and then reversed its course from March to September. {{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}} At the same time, [[HD 40873|35 Camelopardalis]], a star with a right ascension nearly exactly opposite to that of γ Draconis, was 19" more northerly at the beginning of March than in September.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, James; Rigaud, Stephen Peter (1832). Miscellaneous works and correspondence of the Rev. James Bradley, D.D., F.R.S. Oxford: University Press. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These results were completely unexpected and inexplicable by existing theories.

===Early hypotheses===
[[File:Hypothetical movement of γ Draconis caused by parallax.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical observation of γ Draconis if its movement was caused by parallax.]]

[[File:Hypothetical movement of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis caused by nutation.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical observation of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis if their movements were caused by nutation.]]

Bradley and Molyneux discussed several hypotheses in the hope of finding the solution. Since the apparent motion was evidently caused neither by parallax nor observational errors, Bradley first hypothesized that it could be due to oscillations in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon known as [[astronomical nutation|nutation]]. 35 Camelopardalis was seen to possess an apparent motion which could be consistent with nutation, but since its declination varied only one half as much as that of γ Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the answer{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=55}} (however, Bradley later went on to discover that the Earth does indeed nutate).&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; He also investigated the possibility that the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, but again obtained negative results.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=55}}

On August 19, 1727, Bradley embarked upon a further series of observations using a telescope of his own erected at the Rectory, [[Wanstead]]. This instrument had the advantage of a larger field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars over the course of about twenty years. During his first two years at Wanstead, he established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration beyond all doubt, and this also enabled him to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.

===Development of the theory of aberration===
Bradley eventually developed his explanation of aberration in about September 1728 and this theory was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in mid January the following year. One well-known story was that he saw the change of direction of a wind vane on a boat on the Thames, caused not by an alteration of the wind itself, but by a change of course of the boat relative to the wind direction.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;

However, there is no record of this incident in Bradley's own account of the discovery, and it may therefore be [[apocrypha]]l.

The following table shows the magnitude of deviation from true declination for γ Draconis and the direction, on the planes of the solstitial [[colure]] and ecliptic prime meridian, of the tangent of the velocity of the Earth in its orbit for each of the four months where the extremes are found, as well as expected deviation from true ecliptic longitude if Bradley had measured its deviation from right ascension:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

| June || zero || none || → (moving toward aphelion at slow velocity) || increase of less than 20.2"
|-
| September || → (moving toward perihelion) || 19.5" northward || zero || none
|}

Bradley proposed that the aberration of light not only affected declination, but right ascension as well, so that a star in the pole of the ecliptic would describe a little ellipse with a diameter of about 40", but for simplicity, he assumed it to be a circle. Since he only observed the deviation in declination, and not in right ascension, his calculations for the maximum deviation of a star in the pole of the ecliptic are for its declination only, which will coincide with the diameter of the little circle described by such star. For eight different stars, his calculations are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Star !! Annual Variation (") !! Maximum deviation in declination of a star in the pole of the ecliptic (")
|-
| γ Draconis || 39 || 40.4
|-
| β Draconis || 39 || 40.2

|-
| 35 Camel. || 19 || 40.2
|-
| Capella || 16 || 40.0
|-

|}

Based on these calculations, Bradley was able to estimate the constant of aberration at 20.2", which is equal to 0.00009793 radians, and with this was able to estimate the speed of light at {{convert|183300|mi|km}} per second.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=aberration, constant of|edition = 15th |date=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By projecting the little circle for a star in the pole of the ecliptic, he could simplify the calculation of the relationship between the speed of light and the speed of the Earth's annual motion in its orbit as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\frac{1}{2}\pi-0.00009793) = \sin(0.00009793) = \frac{v}{c} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the speed of light to the speed of the Earth's annual motion in its orbit is "10210 to one, from whence it would follow, that light moves, or is propagated as far as from the Sun to the Earth in 8' 12"."&lt;ref name=J_Bradley/&gt;

The discovery and elucidation of aberration is now regarded as a classic case of the application of [[scientific method]], in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but of course the existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.

==Historical theories of aberration==
The phenomenon of aberration became a driving force for many physical theories during the 200 years between its observation and the conclusive explanation by Albert Einstein.

The first classical explanation was provided in 1729, by James Bradley as described above, who attributed it to the finite [[speed of light]] and the motion of [[Earth]] in its orbit around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirshfeld"/&gt; However, this explanation proved inaccurate once the wave nature of light was better understood, and correcting it became a major goal of the 19th century theories of [[luminiferous aether]]. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] proposed a correction due to the motion of a medium (the aether) through which light propagated, known as [[Aether drag hypothesis|"partial aether drag"]]. He proposed that objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move, and this became the accepted explanation for aberration for some time. [[George Gabriel Stokes|George Stokes]] proposed a similar theory, explaining that aberration occurs due to the flow of aether induced by the motion of the Earth. Accumulated evidence against these explanations, combined with new understanding of the electromagnetic nature of light, led [[Hendrik Lorentz]] to develop an [[Lorentz ether theory|electron theory]] which featured an immobile aether, and he explained that objects contract in length as they move through the aether. Motivated by these previous theories, [[Albert Einstein]] then developed the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905, which provides the modern account of aberration.

===Bradley's classical explanation===
[[File:Stellar aberration.JPG|thumb|250px |Figure 2: As light propagates down the telescope, the telescope moves requiring a tilt to the telescope that depends on the speed of light. The apparent angle of the star ''φ'' differs from its true angle ''θ''.]]

Bradley conceived of an explanation in terms of a [[corpuscular theory of light]] in which light is made of particles unaffected by gravity.&lt;ref name="schaffner"/&gt; His classical explanation appeals to the motion of the earth relative to a beam of light-particles moving at a finite velocity, and is developed in the Sun's frame of reference, unlike the classical derivation given above.

Consider the case where a distant star is motionless relative to the Sun, and the star is extremely far away, so that parallax may be ignored. In the rest frame of the Sun, this means light from the star travels in parallel paths to the Earth observer, and arrives at the same angle regardless of where the Earth is in its orbit. Suppose the star is observed on Earth with a telescope, idealized as a narrow tube. The light enters the tube from the star at angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and travels at speed &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; taking a time &lt;math&gt;h/c&lt;/math&gt; to reach the bottom of the tube, where it is detected. Suppose observations are made from Earth, which is moving with a speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. During the transit of the light, the tube moves a distance &lt;math&gt;vh/c&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, for the particles of light to reach the bottom of the tube, the tube must be inclined at an angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; different from &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in an ''apparent'' position of the star at angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. As the Earth proceeds in its orbit it changes direction, so &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; changes with the time of year the observation is made. The apparent angle and true angle are related using trigonometry as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { h\sin(\theta)}{hv/c + h \cos (\theta)}=\frac { \sin(\theta)}{v/c +  \cos (\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\theta = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, this gives &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta - \phi) = v/c&lt;/math&gt;. While this is different from the more accurate relativistic result described above, in the limit of small angle and low velocity they are approximately the same, within the error of the measurements of Bradley's day. These results allowed Bradley to make one of the earliest measurements of the [[Speed of light#History|speed of light]].&lt;ref name=J_Bradley&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=35 |pages=637–661 |date=1729 |author =James Bradley |title=An account of a new discovered motion of the fixed stars |doi=10.1098/rstl.1727.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopædia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111091006/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links |date=2013-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aberration1.svg|frame|right|Figure 1. Diagram illustrating stellar aberration]]
On the left side of Figure 1, the case of infinite light speed is shown. '''S''' represents the '''s'''pot where the star light enters the telescope, and '''E''' the position of the '''e'''ye piece. If light moves instantaneously, the telescope does not move, and the true direction of the star relative to the observer can be found by following the line '''ES'''. However, if light travels at finite speed, the Earth, and therefore the eye piece of the telescope, moves from '''E''' to '''E′''' during the time it takes light to travel from '''S''' to '''E'''. Consequently, the star will no longer appear in the center of the eye piece. The telescope must therefore be adjusted. When the telescope is at position '''E''' it must be oriented toward spot '''S′''' so that the star light enters the telescope at spot '''S′'''. The star light will travel along the line '''SE′''' and reach '''E′''' exactly when the moving eye piece also reaches '''E′'''. Since the telescope has been adjusted by the angle '''SES′''', the star's apparent position is hence displaced by the same angle.

For the simple case where the direction of the light beam along the line '''SE''' is perpendicular to the motion of the observer then only light emitted at an angle equal to the arc cosine of the ratio of the observer's speed to the speed of light will reach the telescope. Consequently, the telescope too must be oriented at this same angle away from the light beam's trajectory in the direction of the motion to capture this emitted light.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, R.C., "The theory of the relativity of motion", University of California Press, Berkeley (1917), p.59&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[File:Stellar aberration versus the dragged aether.gif|thumb|250px|Young reasoned that aberration could only be explained if the aether were immobile in the frame of the Sun. On the left, stellar aberration occurs if an immobile aether is assumed, showing that the telescope must be tilted. On the right, the aberration disappears if the aether moves with the telescope, and the telescope does not need to be tilted.]]
In the early nineteenth century the wave theory of light was being rediscovered, and in 1804 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] adapted Bradley's explanation for corpuscular light to wavelike light traveling through a medium known as the luminiferous aether. His reasoning was the same as Bradley's, but it required that this medium be immobile in the Sun's reference frame and must pass through the earth unaffected, otherwise the medium (and therefore the light) would move along with the earth and no aberration would be observed.

{{Quote|Upon consideration of the phenomena of the aberration of the stars I am disposed to believe that the luminiferous aether pervades the substance of all material bodies with little or no resistance, as freely perhaps as the wind passes through a grove of trees.|Thomas Young|1804&lt;ref name="schaffner"/&gt;}}

However, it soon became clear Young's theory could not account for aberration when materials with a non-vacuum [[index of refraction]] were present. An important example is of a telescope filled with water. The velocity of the light in such a telescope will be slower than in vacuum, and is given by &lt;math&gt;c/n&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of refraction of the water. Thus, by Bradley and Young's reasoning the aberration angle is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { \sin(\theta)}{v/(c/n) +  \cos (\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;.

which predicts a medium-dependent angle of aberration. When refraction at the telescope's [[Objective (optics)|objective]] is taken into account this result deviates even more from the vacuum result. In 1810 [[François Arago]] performed a similar experiment and found that the aberration was unaffected by the medium in the telescope, providing solid evidence against Young's theory. This experiment was subsequently verified by many others in the following decades, most accurately by [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]] in 1871, with the same result.&lt;ref name="whittaker"/&gt;

===Aether drag models===
{{See also|Aether drag hypothesis}}

====Fresnel's aether drag====
In 1818, [[Augustin Fresnel]] developed a modified explanation to account for the water telescope and for other aberration phenomena. He explained that the aether is generally at rest in the Sun's frame of reference, but objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move. That is, the aether in an object of index of refraction &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is partially dragged with a velocity &lt;math&gt;(1-1/n^2)v&lt;/math&gt; bringing the light along with it. This factor is known as "Fresnel's dragging coefficient". This dragging effect, along with refraction at the telescope's objective, compensates for the slower speed of light in the water telescope in Bradley's explanation.{{efn|
More in detail, Fresnel explains that the incoming light of angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is first refracted at the end of the telescope, to a new angle &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; within the telescope. This may be accounted for by [[Snell's law]], giving &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta - \phi) = n \sin(\psi - \phi)&lt;/math&gt;. Then drag must be accounted for. Without drag, the x and y components of the light in the telescope are &lt;math&gt;(c/n) \sin(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c/n) \cos(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;, but drag modifies the x component to &lt;math&gt;(c/n) \cos(\psi) - (1-1/n^2)v&lt;/math&gt; if the Earth moves with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is angle and &lt;math&gt;v_l&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the light with these velocity components, then by Bradley's reasoning
&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { h \sin(\alpha)}{v t +  h \cos (\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the modified path length through the water and t is the time it takes the light to travel the distance h, &lt;math&gt;t = h/v_l&lt;/math&gt;. Upon solving these equations for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; one obtains Bradley's vacuum result.

&lt;!--Even more in detail: By trigonometry,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\alpha) = (c/n) \sin(\psi)/v_l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\alpha) = ((c/n) \cos(\psi) - (1-1/n^2)v)/v_l&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging these into the first equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { \sin(\psi)}{v/nc + \cos (\psi)}&lt;/math&gt;.
and then incorporating Snell's law gives Bradley's vacuum result.--&gt;

}}     With this modification Fresnel obtained Bradley's vacuum result even for non-vacuum telescopes, and was also able to predict many other phenomena related to the propagation of light in moving bodies. Fresnel's dragging coefficient became the dominant explanation of aberration for the next decades.

[[File:Stokes aether drag.svg|thumb|250px|Conceptual illustration of Stokes' aether drag theory. In the rest frame of the Sun the Earth moves to the right through the aether, in which it induces a local current. A ray of light (in red) coming from the vertical becomes dragged and tilted due to the flow of aether.]]

====Stokes' aether drag====
However, the fact that light is [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] (discovered by Fresnel himself) led scientists such as [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[George Green (mathematician)|Green]] to believe that the aether was a totally immobile elastic solid as opposed to Fresnel's fluid aether. There was thus renewed need for an explanation of aberration consistent both with Fresnel's predictions (and Arago's observations) as well as polarization.

In 1845, [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Stokes]] proposed a 'putty-like' aether which acts as a liquid on large scales but as a solid on small scales, thus supporting both the transverse vibrations required for polarized light and the aether flow required to explain aberration. Making only the assumptions that the fluid is [[Potential flow|irrotational]] and that the [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] of the flow are such that the aether has zero velocity far from the Earth, but moves at the Earth's velocity at its surface and within it, he was able to completely account for aberration.{{efn|
[[File:Stokes aether drag proof.svg|center|600px|The propagating wavefront moving through the aether.]]
Stokes' derivation may be summarized as follows: Consider a wavefront moving in the downwards z direction. Say the aether has velocity field &lt;math&gt;u,v,w&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt;. Now, motion of the aether in the x and y directions does not affect the wavefront, but the motion in the z direction advances it (in addition to the amount it advances at speed c). If the z velocity of the aether varies over space, for example if it is slower for higher x as shown in the figure, then the wavefront becomes angled, by an angle &lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha) = tdw/dx &lt;/math&gt;. Now, say in time t the wavefront has moved by a span &lt;math&gt;dz \approx c t&lt;/math&gt; (assuming the speed of the aether is negligible compared to the speed of light). Then for each distance &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; the ray descends, it is bent by an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx (dw/dx) (dz/c)&lt;/math&gt;, and so the total angle by which it has changed after travelling through the entire fluid is

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \approx \frac{1}{c} \int \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} dz&lt;/math&gt;

If the fluid is [[Potential flow|irrotational]] it will satisfy the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]], one of which is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting this into the previous result gives an aberration angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha = (u_2 - u_1)/c&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;s represent the x component of the aether's velocity at the start and end of the ray. Far from the earth the aether has zero velocity, so &lt;math&gt;u_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and at the surface of the earth it has the earth's velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we finally get

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \approx \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the known aberration result. 
}}
The velocity of the aether outside of the Earth would decrease as a function of distance from the Earth so light rays from stars would be progressively dragged as they approached the surface of the Earth. The Earth's motion would be unaffected by the aether due to [[D'Alembert's paradox]].

Both Fresnel and Stokes' theories were popular. However, the question of aberration was put aside during much of the second half of the 19th century as focus of inquiry turned to the electromagnetic properties of aether.

===Lorentz' length contraction===
{{See also|Lorentz ether theory}}
In the 1880s once electromagnetism was better understood, interest turned again to the problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow.&lt;ref name="schaffner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whittaker"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jan&gt;{{Citation|author=Janssen, Michel|author2=Stachel, John|last-author-amp=yes |editor=John Stachel |title=Going Critical |publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-1308-6|date=2010|chapter=The Optics and Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|chapter-url=http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P265.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws]].

Hendrik Lorentz spent considerable effort along these lines. After working on this problem for a decade, the issues with Stokes' theory caused him to abandon it and to follow Fresnel's suggestion of a (mostly) stationary aether (1892, 1895). However, in Lorentz's model the aether was ''completely'' immobile, like the electromagnetic aethers of Cauchy, Green and Maxwell and unlike Fresnel's aether. He obtained Fresnel's dragging coefficient from modifications of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, including a modification of the time coordinates in moving frames ("local time"). In order to explain the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] (1887), which apparently contradicted both Fresnel's and Lorentz's immobile aether theories, and apparently confirmed Stokes' complete aether drag, Lorentz theorized (1892) that objects undergo "[[length contraction]]" by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of their motion through the aether. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Lorentz' theory became the basis for much research in the next decade, and beyond. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory.&lt;ref name="whittaker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Special relativity===
{{See also|History of special relativity}}

Lorentz' theory matched experiment well, but it was complicated and made many unsubstantiated physical assumptions about the microscopic nature of electromagnetic media. In his 1905 theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein reinterpreted the results of Lorentz' theory in a much simpler and more natural conceptual framework which disposed of the idea of an aether. His derivation is given [[Aberration_of_light#Relativistic_explanation|above]], and is now the accepted explanation. [[Robert S. Shankland]] reported some conversations with Einstein, in which Einstein emphasized the importance of aberration:&lt;ref name=shank&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shankland, R. S.|title=Conversations with Albert Einstein|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=31|issue=1|date=1963|pages=47–57|doi=10.1119/1.1969236|bibcode = 1963AmJPh..31...47S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|He continued to say the experimental results which had influenced him most were the observations of stellar aberration and [[Fizeau experiment|Fizeau’s measurements]] on the speed of light in moving water. “They were enough,” he said.}}

Other important motivations for Einstein's development of relativity were the [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] and (indirectly) the negative aether drift experiments, already mentioned by him in the introduction of his first relativity paper. Einstein wrote in a note in 1952:&lt;ref name="norton" /&gt;

{{Quote|My own thought was more indirectly influenced by the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. I learned of it through Lorentz’ path breaking investigation on the electrodynamics of moving bodies (1895), of which I knew before the establishment of the special theory of relativity. Lorentz’ basic assumption of a resting ether did not seem directly convincing to me, since it led to an [struck out: to me artificial appearing] interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which [struck out: did not convince me] seemed unnatural to me. My direct path to the sp. th. rel. was mainly determined by the conviction that the electromotive force induced in a conductor moving in a magnetic field is nothing other than an electric field. But the result of Fizeau’s experiment and the phenomenon of aberration also guided me.}}

While Einstein's result is the same as Bradley's original equation except for an extra factor of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, in the sense that it gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with [[Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]]. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.

'''Bargeboards''' are pieces of [[Coachwork|bodywork]] on [[open-wheel car|open-wheel]] [[Auto racing|racing cars]], serving a purely [[aerodynamic]] (as opposed to structural) function. They are curved vertical planes situated longitudinally, between the front wheels and the [[sidepod]]s, held away from the chassis at the front on struts or other connectors, and connecting to the sidepods or extensions of the floor at the rear. In general, they are significantly taller at the front than at the rear making them trapezoidal in profile, and they curve outward in plan view, being closer to the centerline of the car at the front, and curving out towards the rear.

== Function ==

Aerodynamically, bargeboards act primarily as [[flow conditioning|flow conditioners]], smoothing and redirecting the turbulent or "dirty" air in the wake of the front wing, the front suspension links, and the rotating front wheels.

Part of their function is to direct the turbulent wakes of the front wing and spinning front wheels away from downstream aerodynamic surfaces. In this capacity, they separate different components of this mixture of flows, and direct them either outside and around the sidepods, or direct flow towards the radiator inlets. As such, the configuration of bargeboards can have significance with respect to cooling. They also help direct flow behind the front wheels, reducing the wake drag created by the wheel profile.

=== Vortex generators ===

Another important function of bargeboards is to act as [[vortex generators]], redirecting and energizing airflow. The upper, downward sloping edge can shed a large vortex downstream around the sidepods, where it can interact favorably with flip-ups, or aid in sealing the low pressure underbody flow from the ambient stream. The bottom edge of the bargeboard can also shed vortices that energize the airflow to the underbody, which can help delay flow separation and allow the use of more aggressive diffuser profiles. In recent years, these two edges have acquired relatively large serrations or protruding tabs to enhance this aspect of their performance.

== Turning vanes ==

Smaller, similar structures are often situated further forward, between the front wheels and the [[monocoque]]. These are typically called "turning vanes" rather than bargeboards, and are used in addition to, or sometimes in place of full bargeboards, depending on the aerodynamic approach of the car.

Initially relatively simple in their design, bargeboards and turning vanes became progressively more complex through the 2000s, integrating with the floor, mirror supports, suspension mounts, and other structures in more elaborate ways.

See '''[[HVAC turning vanes]]''' for turning vanes used inside of ductwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7984">A '''bash valve''' is a [[valve]] within a [[piston engine]], used to control the admission of the [[working fluid]].&lt;ref name="bashvalve"&gt;[http://www.firedragon.com/~kap/SteamTopics/bashvalve.html Bash Valve] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206204201/http://www.firedragon.com/~kap/SteamTopics/bashvalve.html |date=2013-12-06 }} - description&lt;/ref&gt; They are directly actuated valves, operated by contact between the piston and the valve tip.

Bash valves have the advantage of great simplicity, for manufacture and operation. Their disadvantages are that their opening and closing times are relatively crudely controlled, compared to other types of [[valve gear]].

The valve is usually constructed as a circular [[poppet valve]] with a conical seat, inserted into the cylinder from the outside. A protrusion on the inside is hit by the piston as it approaches [[top dead centre]], forcing the valve open.

Bash valves are usually held closed by the pressure of fluid in the reservoir behind them. There may be a light spring to assist closing when the reservoir is empty. For this reason they are used as inlet valves, not exhaust. An exhaust bash valve would have the cylinder pressure and the piston actuation both acting to open it, with nothing to close it.

== Steam engines ==
Bash valves are not widely used in [[steam engine]]s, although they are known. Most examples were applied to some form of [[uniflow steam engine]]; unlike the more common slide and piston-valved engines with their bidirectional-flow ports, uniflow engines use inlet ports at the cylinder ends and an exhaust near the centre.

Although the opening time of a bash valve is fixed, imprecisely controlled and always occurs near top dead centre, this is not a major drawback for a steam engine. A more important requirement is the ability to accurately control the closing time of the valve, and for its duration to be adjustable in order to 'drive' the engine, according to varying load. Some designs of uniflow engine have used a combined mechanical and electromagnetic valve to do this. The valve is opened mechanically, then held by an [[electromagnet]]. This requires less electrical power to merely hold the valve than to open it. A patent for such an engine was granted to Sturtevant in 1968.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant" &gt;{{Cite patent

  |pdate=20 August 1968

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Animation of Advanced Uniflow Steam Engine.gif|thumb|[[Advanced Uniflow Steam Engine]]&lt;br&gt;Red = high-pressure steam, controlled by the electromagnetically retained bash valve.]]
The same idea has recently been revived as the main feature of an [[Advanced Uniflow Steam Engine]]. In this engine, a second valve is used for exhaust purposes in the later part of the cycle too, although this one is bashed shut, rather than opened.

Bash valves have also been used for the ''ad hoc'' conversion of commonplace petrol [[small engine]]s, such as [[lawnmower]]s, into hobbyist steam engines. The original petrol engine sparkplug mounting hole is used as the location for a new piston-actuated bash valve, together with the original exhaust valve. Performance and efficiency are not a need of such projects.&lt;ref name="bashvalve" /&gt;

== Pneumatic motors ==
[[File:Arc valve tappet rock drill, section (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|Pneumatic [[rock drill]], with a bash valve above the working cylinder]]
[[File:Arc valve, tappet and valve chest (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|Valve chest, arc valve and tappet of a pneumatic rock drill]]
One successful application for bash valves has been to [[pneumatic motor]]s. Owing to the characteristics of compressed air [[pneumatic power]], their simplicity is valuable and their inefficiencies with other fluids are less important.

Compressed air is supplied cold to the motor.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;Although air becomes heated during compression, there is still little usable heat in the supplied air, compared to steam.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy is represented solely by the pressure of the air not, unlike steam, by the combination of pressure and temperature. Efficient operation of a steam engine relies upon expansion of the steam during the piston stroke, which relies upon accurate valve timing and an early closure of the valve. During the expansion phase of the steam it does not expand in a simple [[isothermal expansion|isothermal]] fashion, but does so [[adiabatic expansion|adiabatically]], much of the energy having been supplied as heat rather than pressure.

The compressed air motor is thermodynamically simpler. It uses simple isothermal expansion.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;Strictly this is an adiabatic expansion too, but it is approximately isothermal, at least compared to the steam engine.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that expansion is less important, valve timings are thus longer and less crucial and so a simple valve may be adequate.

To provide long opening times, the bash valve normally incorporates some form of [[tappet]] mechanism. Rather than a valve that is held open by the piston directly, the valve becomes double-acting and is opened by the piston's impact at one end of the stroke and closed by a further impact at the other end of the stroke. The tappet and valve are commonly separate, allowing the valve to remain in a well-defined fully open position throughout the stroke, however the tappet is bounced around by the piston.

Where a reciprocating action is produced, such as for a [[rock drill]], the valve may be actuated either by [[inertia]] of the frame or by the movement of the working piston. As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, rock drill" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One form of this, the arc tappet valve, was an important feature of the [[Ingersoll Rand|Ingersoll]] rock drill, the first successful compressed air rock drill for use in mining and tunneling.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, rock drill" /&gt; This used a valve that rotated in a slight arc, rather than sliding. The valve was double-acting, controlling the air supply for both the power and the return stroke. The innovation that made this valve so reliable, thus successful, was a separate tappet that was actuated by the piston in passing at the middle of the stroke, rather than being hammered by a jarring direct impact of the piston. The mid-stroke actuation also opened the valve passageways earlier, before top dead centre, allowing in air that provided a cushioning effect. This further improved the action of the drill, giving a powerful stroke on the working piston and drill rod, but with less damaging hammering to the frame of the drill.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, rock drill" /&gt;

== Internal combustion engines ==
Bash valves are not used in such engines. The cylinder peak pressures of an [[Otto cycle]] engine are too high for such a valve to remain on its seat.

== Single-shot valves ==
Bash valves are also used in a 'single-shot' situation, where a valve is opened once and then remains open until the contents of a [[pressure vessel]] are released. Such valves are used in some [[fire extinguisher]]s and [[pre-charged pneumatic|pre-charged air rifle]]s.

These valves are arranged so that once lifted off their seat, pressure underneath the valve becomes sufficient to keep the valve raised and so it remains open until the pressure reservoir is empty. The valve is then closed by a light spring.

'''Biofouling''' or '''biological fouling''' is the accumulation of [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s, [[alga]]e, or [[animal]]s on wetted surfaces. Such accumulation is referred to as '''epibiosis''' when the host surface is another organism and the relationship is not parasitic.

'''Antifouling''' is the ability of specifically designed materials and [[coatings]] to remove or prevent biofouling by any number of organisms on [[wetting|wetted]] surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yebra|first1=D.M.|last2=Kiil|first2=S.|last3=Johansen|first3=K.D.|year=2004|title=Antifouling technology-past,present and future steps toward efficient and environmentally friendly antifouling coatings|journal=Progress in Organic Coatings|volume=50|issue=2|pages=75–104|doi=10.1016/j.porgcoat.2003.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since biofouling can occur almost anywhere water is present, biofouling poses risks to a wide variety of objects such as medical devices and membranes, as well as to entire industries, such as paper manufacturing, food processing, underwater construction, and desalination plants.&lt;ref name=Vladkova/&gt;

Specifically, the buildup of biofouling on marine vessels poses a significant problem. In some instances, the hull structure and propulsion systems can be damaged.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.D.

A variety of [[biofouling#Anti-fouling|antifouling]] methods have historically been implemented to combat biofouling. Recently, scientists have begun researching antifouling methods inspired by living organisms. This type of design imitation is known as [[biomimicry]].

==Biology==
The variety among biofouling organisms is highly diverse, and extends far beyond the attachment of barnacles and seaweeds. According to some estimates, over 1,700 species comprising over 4,000 organisms are responsible for biofouling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Almeida|first=E|title=Marine paints: The particular case of antifouling paints|journal=Progress in Organic Coatings|year=2007|volume=59|issue=1|pages=2–20|doi=10.1016/j.porgcoat.2007.01.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300944007000124|accessdate=6 June 2011|last2=Diamantino|first2=Teresa C.|last3=De Sousa|first3=Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofouling is divided into '''microfouling''' — [[biofilm]] formation and bacterial adhesion — and '''macrofouling''' — attachment of larger organisms. Due to the distinct chemistry and biology that determine what prevents them from settling, organisms are also classified as hard- or soft-fouling types. [[Calcareous]] (hard) fouling organisms include [[barnacles]], encrusting [[bryozoa]]ns, [[Mollusca|mollusks]], [[polychaete]] and other [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]], and [[zebra mussels]]. Examples of non-calcareous (soft) fouling organisms are [[seaweed]], [[hydroids]], algae and biofilm "slime".&lt;ref name=stanczak&gt;{{citation|title=Biofouling: It's Not Just Barnacles Anymore|date=March 2004|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|first=Marianne|last=Stanczak|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/biofoul/overview.php|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these organisms form a [[fouling community]].

===Ecosystem formation===
[[File:Biofilm Formation.jpg|thumb|Biofouling initial process: (left) Coating of submerged "substratum" with polymers. (moving right) Bacterial attachment and [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS) matrix formation.]]

Marine fouling is typically described as following four stages of ecosystem development. The [[Chemistry of biofilm prevention#Composition of biofilm|chemistry of biofilm formation]] describes the initial steps prior to colonization. Within the first minute the [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals interaction]] causes the submerged surface to be covered with a conditioning film of organic polymers. In the next 24 hours, this layer allows the [[Bacterial adhesion in aquatic system|process of bacterial adhesion]] to occur, with both diatoms and bacteria (e.g. [[vibrio alginolyticus]], [[pseudomonas putrefaciens]]) attaching, initiating the formation of a [[biofilm]]. By the end of the first week, the rich nutrients and ease of attachment into the biofilm allow secondary colonizers of spores of macroalgae (e.g. [[enteromorpha intestinalis]], [[ulothrix]]) and protozoans (e.g. [[vorticella]], Zoothamnium sp.) to attach themselves. Within 2 to 3 weeks, the tertiary colonizers- the macrofoulers- have attached. These include [[tunicates]], mollusks and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[Cnidarians]].&lt;ref name=antifouling_review/&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:Antifouling 8212.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Dead biofouling, under a wood boat (detail)]]
Governments and industry spend more than US$5.7 billion annually to prevent and control marine biofouling.&lt;ref&gt;Rouhi (1998), http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v076n017.p041&lt;/ref&gt;
Biofouling occurs everywhere but is most significant economically to the [[shipping industry|shipping industries]], since fouling on a ship's hull significantly increases [[Drag (physics)|drag]], reducing the overall [[Hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] performance of the vessel, and increases the fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marine Fouling and its Prevention|year=1952|contribution=The Effects of Fouling|author=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute|publisher=United States department of the Navy, Bureau of Ships|url=https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/handle/1912/191/chapter%201.pdf?sequence=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofouling is also found in almost all circumstances where water-based liquids are in contact with other materials. Industrially important impacts are on the maintenance of [[mariculture]], membrane systems (''e.g.'', [[membrane bioreactors]] and [[reverse osmosis]] spiral wound membranes) and [[cooling water]] cycles of large industrial equipment and [[power station]]s. Biofouling can occur in oil pipelines carrying oils with entrained water, especially those carrying used oils, [[cutting oil]]s, oils rendered [[water-soluble]] through [[emulsification]], and [[hydraulic oil]]s.

Other mechanisms impacted by biofouling include [[Microelectromechanical systems|microelectrochemical]] drug delivery devices, papermaking and pulp industry machines, underwater instruments, fire protection system piping, and sprinkler system nozzles.&lt;ref name=Vladkova&gt;{{Citation|last=Vladkova|first=T.|year=2009|title=Surface Modification Approach to Control Biofouling|journal=Marine and Industrial Biofouling|volume=4|issue=1|pages=135–163|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69796-1_7|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w2201048t6115k63/|accessdate=2 June 2011|series=Springer Series on Biofilms|isbn=978-3-540-69794-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stanczak/&gt; In groundwater wells, biofouling buildup can limit recovery flow rates, as is the case in the exterior and interior of ocean-laying pipes where fouling is often removed with a [[tube cleaning process]]. Besides interfering with mechanisms, biofouling also occurs on the surfaces of living marine organisms, when it is known as epibiosis&lt;!-- do not wikilink- this term currently redirects to this article --&gt;.

Medical devices often include fan-cooled heat sinks, to cool their electronic components. While these systems sometimes include [[HEPA]] filters to collect microbes, some pathogens do pass through these filters, collect inside the device and are eventually blown out and infect other patients. Devices used in operating rooms rarely include fans, so as to minimize the chance of transmission. Also, medical equipment, high-end computers, swimming pools, drinking-water systems and other products that utilize liquid lines run the risk of biofouling as biological growth occurs inside them.

Historically, the focus of attention has been the severe impact due to biofouling on the speed of marine vessels. In some instances the hull structure and propulsion systems can become damaged.&lt;ref name="Chambers"/&gt; Over time, the accumulation of biofoulers on hulls increases both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the frictional effects leading to increased [[drag (physics)|drag]] of up to 60%&lt;ref name=V2/&gt; The additional drag can decrease speeds up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate.&lt;ref name=V2/&gt; With fuel typically comprising up to half of marine transport costs, biofouling methods are estimated to cost the shipping industry around $1 billion per year.&lt;ref name=V2/&gt; Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72 percent by 2020.&lt;ref name="Salta"/&gt;

Biofouling also impacts aquaculture, increasing production and management costs, while decreasing product value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitridge |first1=Isla |last2=Dempster |first2=Tim |last3=Guenther |first3=Jana |last4=de Nys |first4=Rocky |title=The impact and control of biofouling in marine aquaculture: a review |journal=Biofouling |date=9 July 2012 |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=649–669 |doi=10.1080/08927014.2012.700478}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Detection==
Shipping companies have historically relied on scheduled biofouler removal to keep such accretions to a manageable level. However, the rate of accretion can vary widely between vessels and operating conditions, so predicting acceptable intervals between cleanings is difficult.

[[Light-emitting diode|LED]] manufacturers have developed a range of [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|UVC]] (250-280 nm) equipment that can detect biofouling buildup, and can even prevent it.

Fouling detection relies on the biomass' property of fluorescence. All microorganisms contain natural intracellular fluorophores, which radiate in the UV range when excited. At UV-range wavelengths, such fluorescence arises from three aromatic amino acids - tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. The easiest to detect is tryptophan, which radiates at 350 nm when irradiated at 280 nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Hari |last= Venugopalan |title= Photonic Frontiers: LEDs - UVC LEDs reduce marine biofouling |journal= Laser Focus World |date= July 2016 |pages= 28-31 |volume= 52 |issue= 7 |url= http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/photonic-frontiers-leds-uvc-leds-reduce-marine-biofouling.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-fouling==
[[File:Fouling Coating.png|thumb|right|200px|(A) Untreated surface, (B) biocide loaded coating that repels or kills (C) Non stick surfaces]]
'''Anti-fouling''' is the process of preventing accumulations from forming. In [[industrial process]]es, [[dispersant|bio-dispersant]]s can be used to control biofouling. In less controlled environments, organisms are killed or repelled with coatings using biocides, thermal treatments, or pulses of energy. Nontoxic mechanical strategies that prevent organisms from attaching include choosing a material or coating with a slippery surface, creating an [[ultra-low fouling]] surface with the use of [[zwitterion]]s, or creating [[nanoscale]] surface topologies similar to the skin of sharks and dolphins, which only offer poor anchor points.&lt;ref name="antifouling_review"/&gt;

===Biocides===
{{main article|Biocide|Biomimetic antifouling coating}}
Biocides are chemical substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The chemical substances are incorporated into an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through [[physical adsorption]] or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with [[barnacle]] attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically [[bacteria]]. Once dead, they are unable to spread and can detach.&lt;ref name=antifouling_review&gt;{{citation|first1=Diego Meseguer|last1=Yebra|first2=Soren|last2=Kiil|first3=Kim|last3=Dam-Johansen|title=Antifouling technology--past, present and future steps towards efficient and environmentally friendly antifouling coatings|journal=Progress in Organic Coatings|volume=50|date=July 2004|pages=75–104|issn=0300-9440|doi=10.1016/j.porgcoat.2003.06.001|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the [[fungi]] and [[algae]]. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the [[tributyltin]] moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=TBT_review&gt;{{citation|first1=S.M.|last1=Evans|first2=T.|last2=Leksono|first3=P.D.|last3=McKinnell|title=Tributyltin pollution: A diminishing problem following legislation limiting the use of TBT-based anti-fouling paints|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=30|number=1|date=January 1995|pages=14–21|issn=0025-326X|doi=10.1016/0025-326X(94)00181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biocides are also added to [[Swimming pool|pool water]], drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.

The prevalence of TBT and other tin-based anti-fouling coatings on marine vessels was a major environmental problem. TBT has been shown to harm many marine organisms, specifically [[oysters]] and [[mollusks]]. Extremely low concentrations of [[tributyltin]] moiety (TBT) causes defective shell growth in the [[oyster]] ''Crassostrea gigas'' (at a concentration of 20&amp;nbsp;ng/l) and development of male characteristics in female genitalia in the [[dog whelk]] ''Nucella lapillus'' (where [[gonad|gonocharacteristic]] change is initiated at 1&amp;nbsp;ng/l).&lt;ref name=TBT_review/&gt;

The international maritime community has phased out the use of organtin-based coatings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Anti-foulingSystems/Pages/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This phase-out of toxic [[biocide]]s in marine coatings posed a severe problem for the shipping industry; it presents a major challenge for the producers of coatings to develop alternative technologies. Safer methods of biofouling control are actively researched.&lt;ref name=antifouling_review/&gt; [[Copper]] compounds have successfully been used in paints, heat sinks inside of medical electronics, and continue to be used as metal sheeting (for example [[Muntz metal]], which was specifically made for this purpose), though there is still debate as to the safety of copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Bob|last=Greenwood|url=http://www.sail-world.com/index.cfm?Nid=28929|journal=Sailing World|date=19 November 2006|title=Antifouling - Copper not so bad after all?|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-toxic coatings===
[[File:ProteinAdsorptionPrevention.png|thumb|300px|A general idea of non-toxic coatings. (Coating represented here as light pea green layer.) They prevent [[proteins]] and microorganisms from attaching, which prevents large organisms such as [[barnacles]] from attaching. Larger organisms require a [[biofilm]] to attach, which is composed of [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]], and [[microorganisms]].]]

Non-toxic anti-sticking coatings prevent attachment of microorganisms thus negating the use of biocides. These coatings are usually based on organic polymers, which allow researchers to add additional functions, such as [[antimicrobial]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Integrated Antimicrobial and Nonfouling Hydrogelsto Inhibit the Growth of Planktonic Bacterial Cells and Keep the Surface Clean|author=Gang Cheng et al.|journal=[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]|date=2 June 2010|volume=26|pages=10425–10428|doi=10.1021/la101542m|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two classes of non-toxic anti-fouling coatings. The most common class relies on low [[friction]] and low [[Surface energy|surface energies]]. Low surface energies result in [[hydrophobic]] surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface, which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, [[fluoropolymers]] and silicone coatings are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Clean Hulls Without Poisons: Devising and Testing Nontoxic Marine Coatings|first=R.F.|last=Brady|journal=Journal of Coatings Technology|volume=72|number=900|pages=44–56|date=1 January 2000|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59245245.html|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days [[biofilms]] (slime) can coat the surfaces, which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach.&lt;ref name=antifouling_review/&gt; The current standard for these coatings is [[polydimethylsiloxane]], or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Krishnan|first=S|title=Advances in polymers for anti-biofouling surfaces|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|year=2008|volume=12|issue=29|pages=3405–3413|doi=10.1039/B801491D|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2008/JM/b801491d|accessdate=6 June 2011|last2=Weinman|first2=Craig J.|last3=Ober|first3=Christopher K.|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows for the release of fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.&lt;ref name="Vladkova"/&gt;

The second class of non-toxic anti-fouling coatings are hydrophilic coatings. They rely on high amounts of hydration in order to increase the energetic penalty of removing water for proteins and microorganisms to attach. The most common examples of these coatings are based on highly hydrated [[zwitterion]]s, such as [[glycine betaine]] and [[sulfobetaine]]. These coatings are also low-friction, but are considered by some to be superior to hydrophobic surfaces because they prevent bacteria attachment, preventing biofilm formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=S.|last1=Jiang|first2=Z.|last2=Cao|title=Ultralow-Fouling, Functionalizable, and Hydrolyzable Zwitterionic Materials and Their Derivatives for Biological Applications|journal=Advanced Materials|year=2010|volume=22|pages=920–932|doi=10.1002/adma.200901407|issue=9|pmid=20217815}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coatings are not yet commercially available and are being designed as part of a larger effort by the [[Office of Naval Research]] to develop environmentally safe [[biomimetic]] ship coatings.&lt;ref name=V1/&gt;

====Mussel adhesive proteins====
One of the more common methods of antifouling comes from growing polymer chains from a surface, often by [[polyethylene glycol|poly(ethylene glycol)]] or PEG.&lt;ref name=Dalsin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalsin|first1=J.|last2=Messersmith|first2=P.|year=2005|title=Bioinspired antifouling polymers|journal=Materials Today|volume=8|issue=9|pages=38–46|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(05)71079-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702105710798|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, challenges exist in creating a functionalized surface to which PEG chains may be grown, especially in aqueous environments. Researchers have been able to study the methods by which the common blue [[mussel]] ''Mytilus edulis''' is able to adhere to solid surfaces in marine environments using mussel [[Bioadhesive|adhesive proteins]], or MAPs. MAPs typically comprise several proteins, of which the most common repeating sequence is Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser-Tyr-trans-2,3-cis-3,4-dihydroxyproline (DHP) -Hyp-Thr-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([[L-DOPA|DOPA]]) -Lys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor et al.|first=S.|title=trans-2,3-cis-3,4-Dihydroxyproline, a New Naturally Occurring Amino Acid, Is the Sixth Residue in the Tandemly Repeated Consensus Decapeptides of an Adhesive Protein from Mytilus edulis|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year=1994|volume=116|issue=23|pages=10803–10804|doi=10.1021/ja00102a063}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the [[hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] DHP and DOPA amino acids is thought to contribute to the adhesive nature of the MAPs. Recent studies have looked into using a short chain of DOPA residues as an adhesive end-group for antifouling PEG polymers, which show promise in adsorbing onto certain metal surfaces. Increasing the number of DOPA residues to three greatly improves the total amount of adsorbed DOPA-PEG polymers and exhibits antifouling properties exceeding most other 'grafting-to' polymeric functionalization methods.&lt;ref name=Dalsin/&gt;

The antifouling characteristics of PEG are well documented, but the service life of such coatings is debated due to the [[hydrolysis]] of PEG chains in air, as well as by the low concentrations of transition metal ions present in seawater.&lt;ref name=Vladkova/&gt; Using DOPA residues as attachment points, new polymers similar in structure to the polypeptide backbone of proteins are being investigated, such as [[peptidomimetic]] polymer (PMP1). PMP1 uses a repeat unit of N-substituted [[glycine]] instead of ethylene glycol to impart antifouling properties. The N-substituted glycine is structurally similar to ethylene glycol and is [[hydrophilic]], so easily dissolves in water. In controlled studies, PMP1-coated titanium surfaces were seen to be resistant to biofouling over a period of 180 days, even with continued addition and exposure to microfouling organisms.&lt;ref name=Dalsin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Statz et al.|first=A.|title=New Peptidomimetic Polymers for Antifouling Surfaces|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year=2005|volume=127|issue=22|pages=7972–7973|doi=10.1021/ja0522534|pmid=15926795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy methods===
Pulsed laser irradiation is commonly used against [[diatoms]]. Plasma pulse technology is effective against zebra mussels and works by stunning or killing the organisms with microsecond duration energizing of the water with high voltage electricity.&lt;ref name=stanczak/&gt;

There are several companies that offer alternatives to paint-based antifouling, using ultrasonic transducers mounted in or around the hull of small to medium-sized boats. Research has shown these systems can help reduce fouling, by initiating bursts of ultrasonic waves through the hull medium to the surrounding water, killing or denaturing the algae and other micro-organisms that form the beginning of the fouling sequence. The systems cannot work on wooden-hulled boats, or boats with a soft-cored composite material, such as wood or foam. The systems have been loosely based on technology proven to control algae blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ultrasonic irradiation for blue-green algae bloom control| pmid=11329801 | doi=10.1080/09593332208618270 | volume=22| issue=4 | journal=Environ Technol| pages=383–90 | last1 = Lee | first1 = TJ | last2 = Nakano | first2 = K | last3 = Matsumara | first3 = M| year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, another method shown to be effective against algae buildups bounced brief high-energy acoustic pulses down pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Walch|first1=M.|last2=Mazzola|first2=M.|last3=Grothaus|first3=M.|year=2000|title=Feasibility Demonstration of a Pulsed Acoustic Device for Inhibition of Biofouling in Seawater Piping|publisher=Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Div.|location=Bethesda, MD|id=NSWCCD-TR-2000/04|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA376166|format=pdf|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical industry utilizes a variety of energy methods to address [[bioburden]] issues associated with biofouling. [[Autoclave|Autoclaving]] typically involves heating a medical device to 121&amp;nbsp;°C (249&amp;nbsp;°F) for 15–20 minutes. Ultrasonic cleaning, UV light, and chemical wipe-down or emersion can also be used for different types of devices.

===Other methods===
Regimens to periodically use heat to treat exchanger equipment and pipes have been successfully used to remove mussels from power plant cooling systems using water at 105&amp;nbsp;°F (40&amp;nbsp;°C) for 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Oceans 86 Proceedings|contribution=Development of a Site Specific Biofouling Control Program for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant|first=David C.|last=Sommerville|pages=227–231|doi=10.1109/OCEANS.1986.1160543|date=September 1986|publisher=IEEE Conference Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical devices used in operating rooms, ICUs, isolation rooms, biological analysis labs, and other high contamination risk areas have negative pressure (constant exhaust) in the rooms, maintain strict cleaning protocols, require equipment with no fans, and often drape equipment in protective plastic.

As of 2016, researchers have shown that deep-ultraviolet [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|UVC]] irradiation, a noncontact, nonchemical solution that can be used across a range of instruments. Radiation in the UVC range prevents biofilm formation by deactivating the [[DNA]] in bacteria, viruses, and other microbes. Preventing biofilm formation prevents larger organisms from attaching themselves to the instrument and eventually rendering it inoperable.

==History==
Biofouling, especially of ships, has been a problem for as long as humanity has been sailing the oceans.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; The earliest written mention of fouling was by Plutarch who recorded this explanation of its impact on ship speed: "when weeds, ooze, and filth stick upon its sides, the stroke of the ship is more obtuse and weak; and the water, coming upon this clammy matter, doth not so easily part from it; and this is the reason why they usually calk their ships."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Plutarch|title=The Complete Works of Plutarch, Volume 3|contribution=Essays and Miscellanies|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3052/3052-h/3052-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of pitch and copper plating as anti-fouling techniques were attributed to ancient seafaring nations, such as the Phoenicians and Carthaginians (1500- 300BC). Wax, tar and [[Gilsonite|asphaltum]] have been used since early times.&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;{{citation|title=Marine Fouling and its Prevention|year=1952|contribution=The History and Prevention of Foulng|author=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute|publisher=United States department of the Navy, Bureau of Ships|url=https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/handle/1912/191/chapter%2011.pdf?sequence=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An Aramaic record dating from 412 B.C. tells of a ship's bottom being coated with a mixture of arsenic, oil and sulphur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Culver|first1=Henry E.|first2=Gordon|last2=Grant|title=The Book of Old Ships|isbn=978-0486273327|publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', [[Athenaeus]] described the anti-fouling efforts taken in the construction of the great ship of [[Hieron of Syracuse]] (died 467 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus of Naucratis, ''The deipnosophists, or, Banquet of the learned of Athenæus'', [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0334&amp;q1=Hiero&amp;pview=hide Volume I, Book V, Chapter 40] ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 18th century, various anti-fouling techniques were used, with three main substances employed: "White stuff", a mixture of [[train oil]] (Whale oil), [[rosin]] and [[sulfur]]; "Black stuff", a mixture of [[tar]] and [[resin|pitch]]; and "Brown stuff", which was simply sulfur added to Black stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lavery|first=Brian|year=2000|title=The Arming and Fitting of English Ships of War 1600-1815|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|isbn=0-85177-451-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many of these cases, the purpose of these treatments is ambiguous. There is dispute whether many of these treatments were actual anti-fouling techniques, or whether, when they were used in conjunction with lead and wood sheathing, they were simply intended to combat wood-boring [[shipworm]]s.

[[File:Lebreton engraving-07.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ships brought ashore on the [[Torres Strait]] and [[careening|careened]] in preparation for cleaning the hull]]
In 1708, Charles Perry suggested [[copper sheathing]] explicitly as an anti-fouling device but the first experiments were not made until 1761 with the sheathing of [[HMS Alarm (1758)|HMS Alarm]], after which the bottoms and sides of several ships' keels and false keels were sheathed with copper plates.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt;

The copper performed well in protecting the hull from invasion by worm, and in preventing the growth of weed, for when in contact with water, the copper produced a poisonous film, composed mainly of [[oxychloride]], that deterred these marine creatures. Furthermore, as this film was slightly soluble, it gradually washed away, leaving no way for marine life to attach itself to the ship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
From about 1770, the [[Royal Navy]] set about coppering the bottoms of the entire fleet and continued to the end of the use of wooden ships. The process was so successful that the term ''copper-bottomed'' came to mean something that was highly dependable or risk free.

With the rise of iron hulls in the 19th century, copper sheathing could no longer be used due to its [[galvanic corrosion|galvanic corrosive]] interaction with iron. Anti-fouling paints were tried, and in 1860, the first practical paint to gain widespread use was introduced in [[Liverpool]] and was referred to as "McIness" hot plastic paint.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; These treatments had a short service life, were expensive, and relatively ineffective by modern standards.&lt;ref name=antifouling_review/&gt;

The inventor of an antifouling paint was Captain (Schiffskapitan) Ferdinand Gravert, born 1847 in Glückstadt, Germany (then Denmark). He sold his formula in 1913 at Taltal, Chile.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

By the mid-twentieth century, copper oxide-based paints could keep a ship out of drydock for as much as 18 months, or as little as 12 in tropical waters.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; The shorter service life was due to rapid leeching of the toxicant, and chemical conversion into less toxic salts, which accumulated as a crust that would inhibit further leaching of active cuprous oxide from the layer under the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA134019|last=Dowd|first=Theodore|title=An Assessment of Ablative Organotin Antifouling (AF) Coatings|publisher=US Navy|id= ADA134019]|year=1983|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s brought a breakthrough, with self-polishing paints that used seawater's ability to [[hydrolysis|hydrolize]] the paint's [[copolymer]] bond and release the stored toxin at a slow, controlled rate. These paints employed [[organotin chemistry]] ("tin-based") biotoxins such as [[tributyltin oxide]] (TBT) and were effective for up to four years. The discovery that these biotoxins have severe impact on mariculture, with biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 [[nanogram]] per liter, led to their worldwide ban by the [[International Maritime Organization]] in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=7986&amp;filename=FOULING2003.pdf|year=2002|title=Focus on IMO - Anti-fouling systems|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Gajda|first1=M.|author2=Jancso, A.|year=2010|title=Organotins, formation, use, speciation and toxicology|journal=Metal ions in life sciences|publisher=RSC publishing|location=Cambridge|volume=7, Organometallics in environment and toxicology|isbn=9781847551771}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBT in particular has been described as the most toxic pollutant ever deliberately released in the ocean.&lt;ref name=TBT_review/&gt;

As an alternative to organotin toxins, there has been renewed interest in copper as the active agent in ablative or self polishing paints, with reported service lives up to 5 years. Modern adhesives permit application of copper alloys to steel hulls without creating galvanic corrosion. However, copper alone is not impervious to diatom and algae fouling. Some studies indicate that copper may also present an unacceptable environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Redefining Antifouling Coatings|first=Geoffrey|last=Swain|date=September 1999|publisher=Steel Structures Painting Council|url=http://www.paintsquare.com/library/articles/redefining_antifouling_coatings.pdf|volume=16|number=9|issn=8755-1985|accessdate=23 May 2012|pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Modern empirical study of biofouling began in the early 19th century with [[Humphry Davy|Davy's]] experiments linking the effectiveness of copper to its solute rate.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; Insights into the stages of formation grew in the 1930s when the microbiologist [[Claude ZoBell]] defined the sequence of events initiating the fouling of submerged surfaces. He showed that the attachment of organisms must be preceded by the [[adsorption]] of organic compounds now referred to as [[extracellular polymeric substances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=225|title=Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Probing the Oceans 1936 to 1976|location=San Diego, Calif|publisher=Tofua Press|year=1978|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt109nc2cj|first=Elizabeth Noble |last=Shor|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Claude E.

One trend of research is the study of the relationship between wettability and anti-fouling effectiveness. Another trend is the study of living organisms as the inspiration for new functional materials. An example of [[biomimetic antifouling coating|biomimetic antifouling]] research was conducted at the [[University of Florida]] into how marine animals such as dolphins and sharks are able to effectively deter biofouling on their skin. Researchers examined the nanoscale structure of sharks and designed an anti-fouling surface known commercially as [[Sharklet (material)|Sharklet]]. Studies show that the nanoscale topologies function not only due to the reduction of sites for macrofoulers to attach, but also due to the same thermodynamic barrier that any surface with low [[wetting|wettability]] presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Engineered antifouling microtopographies – correlating wettability with cell attachment|author=M.L.

Materials research into superior antifouling surfaces for [[fluidized bed reactor]]s suggest that low [[wetting|wettability]] plastics such as [[Polyvinyl chloride]] ("PVC"), [[high-density polyethylene]] and [[polymethylmethacrylate]] ("plexiglas") demonstrate a high correlation between their resistance to bacterial adhesion and their [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Hydrophobicity in Bacterial Adhesion|publisher=BioLine|title=Biofilm community interactions: chance or necessity?|author=R.

A study of the biotoxins used by organisms has revealed several effective compounds, some of which are more powerful than synthetic compounds.

==Background==
Although bioabsorbable polymers and other materials have come into widespread use in recent years, degradable metals have not yet had the same success in the medical industry.

===Driving force for development===
The driving force behind the development of bioresorbable metals is primarily due to their ability to provide metal-like mechanical properties while degrading safely in the body.&lt;ref name=kirklandbook/&gt; This is especially relevant in orthopaedic applications, where although many surgeries only require implants to provide temporary support (allowing the surrounding tissue to heal), the majority of current bio-metals are permanent (e.g. stainless steel, titanium). Degradation of the implant means that intervention or secondary surgery will not be necessary to remove the material at the end of its functional life, providing significant savings in both cost and time for the patient and health care system. In addition, the corrosion products of current bio-metals (which will still corrode in the body to some degree) can generally not be considered biocompatible.

==Potential applications==
There are a number of applications for biodegradable metals, including cardiovascular implants (i.e. stents) and orthopedics. It is in this latter category where these materials offer the greatest potential. Bioresorbable metals are able to withstand loads that would destroy any currently available polymers, and offer much greater plasticity than bioceramics, which are brittle and prone to fracture. A well-designed implant could provide the exact mechanical support needed for different areas (through alloying and metal working), and load would be transferred to the surrounding tissue over time, letting it heal and reducing the effects of [[stress shielding]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=H.|last2=Esfahani|first2=S. N.|last3=Poorganji|first3=B.|last4=Dean|first4=D.|last5=Elahinia|first5=M.|date=January 2017|title=Resorbable bone fixation alloys, forming, and post-fabrication treatments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092849311631534X|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: C|volume=70|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.msec.2016.09.069}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the primary benefits and drawbacks of magnesium biomaterials has been provided by Kirkland.&lt;ref na

==Considerations and issues facing bioresorbable metal development==

===Changing shape over time===
It is the same advantage that bioresorbable metals possess over non-degradable current materials, their biodegradability, that poses the greatest challenges to their development and wider use. The degradable nature of any implant means that their shape and thus mechanical properties will change through its lifetime. This means that lifecycle analysis must be performed on any implant, especially one designed for orthopedic applications where failure could result in death.

===Lack of standards===
Current standards for corrosion of metals have been found to not apply well to bioresorbable metals during in vitro testing.&lt;ref name=witte1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Witte | first1 = F. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = J. | last3 = Nellesen | first3 = J. | last4 = Crostack | first4 = H. A. | last5 = Kaese | first5 = V. | last6 = Pisch | first6 = A. | last7 = Beckmann | first7 = F. | last8 = Windhagen | first8 = H. | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.037 | title = In vitro and in vivo corrosion measurements of magnesium alloys | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 7 | pages = 1013–1018 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16122786| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a significant problem as the majority of tests performed in the research community are a mix of other standards from both the biomedical and the engineering (e.g. corrosion) communities, often making comparison between results difficult.

===Corrosion Product Toxicity===
Even though all elements in a bioresorbable metal may themselves be considered biocompatible, the morphology and elemental makeup (or combination of elements) of the degradation products may cause adverse reactions in the body. In addition, the rapid evolution of [[hydrogen gas]] that is concomitant with Mg-alloy degradation may cause addition problems [[in vivo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuhlmann | first1 = J. | last2 = Bartsch | first2 = I. | last3 = Willbold | first3 = E. | last4 = Schuchardt | first4 = S. | last5 = Holz | first5 = O. | last6 = Hort | first6 = N. | last7 = Höche | first7 = D. | last8 = Heineman | first8 = W. R. | last9 = Witte | first9 = F. | title = Fast escape of hydrogen from gas cavities around corroding magnesium implants | doi = 10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.008 | journal = Acta Biomaterialia | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 8714 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore crucial to intricately understand the corrosion of each implant and the products that are release, in light of their toxicity and the likelihood of inflammation. The majority of studies in the literature have focused on elements that are known to be biocompatible or abundant in the body, such as calcium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kirkland | first1 = N.

==Potential bioresorbable metal candidates==
Although all metals will degrade and eventually disappear inside the body through the processes of corrosion and wear, true bioresorbable metals must have an appreciable degradation rate to allow the implant to be absorbed in a practical amount of time in reference to their application. Also, any degradation product would have to be safely metabolized or excreted by the body to avoid toxicity and inflammation.

===Magnesium===
Perhaps the most widely investigated material in this category, magnesium was originally investigated as a potential biomaterial in 1878 when it was used by physician Edward C. Huse in wire form as a ligature to stop bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Edward C.|last = Huse|year = 1878|title = A New Ligature?|journal = Chicago Medical Journal and Examiner|volume = 37|pages = 171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development continued into the 1920s, after which Mg-based biomaterials fell out of general investigation due to their poor performance (likely due to impurities in the alloys drastically increasing corrosion). It was not until the late 1990s that interest started to pick up again, spurred by the availability of ultra-high purity Mg, which significantly increases its longevity inside the body.

Currently, most research on Mg is focused on reducing and controlling the rate of degradation, with many alloys corroding too rapidly (in vitro) for any practical application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kirkland | first1 = N. T. | last2 = Lespagnol | first2 = J. | last3 = Birbilis | first3 = N. | last4 = Staiger | first4 = M.

===Iron===
The majority of iron-based alloy research has been focused on cardiovascular applications, such as stents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moravej | first1 = M. | last2 = Mantovani | first2 = D. | doi = 10.3390/ijms12074250 | title = Biodegradable Metals for Cardiovascular Stent Application: Interests and New Opportunities | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 4250 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However this area receives much less interest in the research community than Mg-based alloys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Zinc===
To date little work has been published on the use of a primarily zinc-based biomaterial, with corrosion rates found to be very low and zinc within a tolerable toxicity range &lt;ref name=vojtech/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Biodegradable bulk metallic glasses===
Although strictly speaking a side-category, a related, relatively new area of interest has been the investigation of [[bioabsorbable metallic glass]], with a group at UNSW currently investigating these novel materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.materials.unsw.edu.au/research/bulk-metallic-glasses-for-biomedical-electronics-aerospace-and-advanced-structural-applications|title = BMGs for Electronic, Biomedical and Aerospace Applications|accessdate = 7 January 2013|author = University of New South Wales|year = 2010|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130105044106/http://www.materials.unsw.edu.au/research/bulk-metallic-glasses-for-biomedical-electronics-aerospace-and-advanced-structural-applications|archivedate = 5 January 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[physics]], '''cold dark matter''' ('''CDM''') is a hypothetical form of [[dark matter]] whose particles moved slowly compared to the [[speed of light]] (the ''cold'' in CDM) since the universe was approximately one year old (a time when the cosmic [[particle horizon]] contained the mass of one typical galaxy); and interact very weakly with ordinary matter and [[electromagnetic radiation]] (the ''dark'' in CDM). It is believed that approximately 84.54% of matter in the [[universe]] is dark matter, with only a small fraction being the ordinary [[baryonic matter]] that composes [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and living organisms.

== History ==

The theory of cold dark matter was originally published in 1982 by three independent groups of cosmologists; [[Jim Peebles|James Peebles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peebles|first1=P. J. E.|title=Large-scale background temperature and mass fluctuations due to scale-invariant primeval perturbations|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=December 1982|volume=263|pages=L1|doi=10.1086/183911|bibcode = 1982ApJ...263L...1P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

A review article in 1984 by Blumenthal, [[Sandra M. Faber|Sandra Moore Faber]], Primack, and [[Martin Rees]] developed the details of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Structure formation ==

In the cold dark matter theory, structure grows hierarchically, with small objects collapsing under their self-gravity first and merging in a continuous hierarchy to form larger and more massive objects. In the [[hot dark matter]] paradigm, popular in the early 1980s, structure does not form hierarchically (''bottom-up''), but rather forms by fragmentation (''top-down''), with the largest [[supercluster]]s forming first in flat pancake-like sheets and subsequently fragmenting into smaller pieces like our galaxy the [[Milky Way]]. Predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm are in general agreement with observations of cosmological [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large scale structure]].

=== Lambda CDM model===
{{main|Lambda-CDM model}}

Since the late 1980s or 1990s, most [[cosmology|cosmologists]] favor the cold dark matter theory (specifically the modern [[Lambda-CDM model]]) as a description of how the universe went from a smooth initial state at early times (as shown by the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation) to the lumpy distribution of [[galaxy|galaxies]] and their [[galaxy cluster|clusters]] we see today—the [[observable universe|large-scale structure]] of the universe. The theory sees the role that [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] played as crucial, as they are thought to be natural building blocks that form larger structures, created by small-scale density fluctuations in the early [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Composition ==
Dark matter is detected through its gravitational interactions with ordinary matter and radiation. As such, it is very difficult to determine what the constituents of cold dark matter are. The candidates fall roughly into three categories:

* [[Axion]]s, very light particles with a specific type of self-interaction that makes them a suitable CDM candidate.&lt;ref name="Axion, first CDM candidate"&gt;{{cite news | last= e.g. M. Turner

| title=  Axion Cosmology
| publisher=  Lect. Notes Phys. 741, 19-50
| year=  2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axions have the theoretical advantage that their existence solves the [[Strong CP problem]] in [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]], but have not been detected.

* MACHOs or [[Massive Compact Halo Object]]s, large, condensed objects such as [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[white dwarf]]s, very faint [[star]]s, or non-luminous objects like [[planet]]s. The search for these consists of using [[gravitational lensing]] to see the effect of these objects on background galaxies. Most experts believe that the constraints from those searches rule out MACHOs as a viable dark matter candidate.&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first=B.

* WIMPs, or [[Weakly interacting massive particles|Weakly Interacting Massive Particles]]. There is no currently known particle with the required properties, but many extensions of the [[standard model of particle physics]] predict such particles. The search for WIMPs involves attempts at direct detection by highly sensitive detectors, as well as attempts at production by [[particle accelerator]]s. WIMPs are generally regarded as the most promising dark matter candidates.&lt;ref name=Peter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olive/&gt; The [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] have claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many scientists remain skeptical, as no results from similar experiments seem compatible with the DAMA results.

== Challenges ==
Several discrepancies between the predictions of the particle cold dark matter paradigm and observations of galaxies and their clustering have arisen:

* The [[cuspy halo problem]]: the density distributions of dark matter halos in cold dark matter simulations are much more peaked than what is observed in galaxies by investigating their rotation curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The cored distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies|year=2004|last1=Gentile|first1=G.|first2=Salucci|last2=P.|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=351|pages=903–922|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07836.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0403154 |bibcode = 2004MNRAS.351..903G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[missing satellites problem]]: cold dark matter simulations predict much larger numbers of small dwarf galaxies than are observed around galaxies like the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=Klypin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klypin | first1 = Anatoly | last2 = Kravtsov | first2 = Andrey V. | last3 = Valenzuela | first3 = Octavio | last4 = Prada | first4 = Francisco | year = 1999 | title = Where Are the Missing Galactic Satellites? | url = | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 522 | issue = | pages = 82–92 | doi = 10.1086/307643 | bibcode=1999ApJ...522...82K|arxiv = astro-ph/9901240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disk of satellites problem: dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] galaxies are observed to be orbiting in thin, planar structures whereas the simulations predict that they should be distributed randomly about their parent galaxies.&lt;ref name=Pawlowski&gt;Marcel Pawlowski et al., "Co-orbiting satellite galaxy structures are still in conflict with the distribution of primordial dwarf galaxies" MNRAS (2014) https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1799&lt;/ref&gt;
* Galaxy morphology problem: If galaxies grew hierarchically, then massive galaxies required many mergers. [[Galaxy merger|Major mergers]] indelibly create a classical [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]. On the contrary, about 80% of observed galaxies are bulgeless, and giant pure disc galaxies are commonplace.&lt;ref name="kormendy2010"&gt;

[[File:Crowbar Circuit.jpg|thumb]]
A '''crowbar circuit''' is an [[electrical circuit]] used for preventing an overvoltage condition of a [[power supply]] unit from damaging the circuits attached to the power supply. It operates by putting a [[short circuit]] or low resistance path across the [[voltage]] output (V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;), quite like were one to drop a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] across the output terminals of the power supply. Crowbar circuits are frequently implemented using a [[thyristor]], [[TRIAC]], [[trisil]] or [[thyratron]] as the shorting device. Once triggered, they depend on the [[current (electricity)|current]]-limiting circuitry of the [[power supply]] or, if that fails, the blowing of the line [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or tripping the [[circuit breaker]].

An example crowbar circuit is shown to the right. This particular circuit uses an LM431 adjustable [[Zener_diode|zener]] regulator to control the gate of the [[TRIAC]]. The [[Voltage_divider|resistor divider]] of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provide the reference voltage for the LM431. The divider is set so that during normal operating conditions, the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is slightly lower than V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; of the LM431. Since this voltage is below the minimum reference voltage of the LM431, it remains off and very little current is conducted through the LM431. If the cathode resistor is sized accordingly, very little voltage will be dropped across it and the TRIAC gate terminal will be essentially at the same potential as MT1, keeping the TRIAC off. If the supply voltage increases, the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will exceed V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; and the LM431 [[cathode]] will begin to draw current. The voltage at the gate terminal will be pulled down, exceeding the gate trigger voltage of the TRIAC and latching it on.

A '''crowbar circuit''' is distinct from a [[Clamp (circuit)|clamp]] in pulling, once triggered, the voltage below the trigger level, usually close to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. A clamp prevents the voltage from exceeding a preset level. Thus, a crowbar will not automatically return to normal operation when the overvoltage condition is removed; power must be removed entirely to stop its conduction.

An '''active crowbar''' is a crowbar that can remove the short circuit when the transient is over thus allowing the device to resume normal operation. Active crowbars use a transistor, gate turn off (GTO) thyristor or forced commutated thyristor instead of a thyristor to short the circuit. Active crowbars are commonly used to protect the frequency converter in the rotor circuit of [[Doubly-fed electric machine|doubly fed generators]] against high voltage and current transients caused by the voltage dips in the [[power network]]. Thus the generator can [[low voltage ride through|ride through the fault]] and quickly continue the operation even during the [[voltage dip]].

The advantage of a crowbar over a clamp is that the low holding voltage of the crowbar lets it carry higher [[fault current]] without dissipating much power (which could otherwise cause overheating). Also, a crowbar is more likely than a clamp to deactivate a device (by blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker), bringing attention to the faulty equipment.

The term is also used as a verb to describe the act of short-circuiting the output of a power supply, or the malfunction of a [[CMOS]] circuit -- the PMOS half of a pair lingering in a near on-state when only its corresponding NMOS is supposed to be on (or the NMOS when the PMOS is supposed to be on) -- resulting in a near short-circuit current between supply rails.

== Applications ==
High voltage crowbars are used for HV tube ([[Klystron]] and [[Inductive output tube|IOT]]) protection.

Many bench top [[Power supply|power supplies]] have a crowbar circuit to protect the connected equipment.

Microwave ovens often use a [[microswitch]] that acts as a crowbar circuit in the door latch assembly. This will absolutely prevent the magnetron from being energized with the door open. Activation will blow the main fuse and ruin the microswitch. {{cn|date=December 2017}}

The term '''cryostasis''' was introduced to name the reversible preservation technology for live biological objects which is based on using [[clathrate]]-forming gaseous substances under increased [[hydrostatic pressure]] and hypothermic temperatures.

Living tissues cooled below the freezing point of water are damaged by the dehydration of the cells as ice is formed between the cells. The mechanism of freezing damage in living biological tissues has been elucidated by Renfret.&lt;ref&gt;Renfret (1968) (Renfret A.P. Cryobiology: some fundamentals in surgical context. In: Cryosurgery. Rand R.W., Rinfret A.P., von Lode H., Eds. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 1968) and by Mazur (1984): ice formation begins in the intercellular spaces&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vapor pressure of the ice is lower than the vapor pressure of the solute water in the surrounding cells and as heat is removed at the freezing point of the solutions, the ice crystals grow between the cells, extracting water from them. As the ice crystals grow, the volume of the cells shrinks, and the cells are crushed between the ice crystals. Additionally, as the cells shrink, the solutes inside the cells are concentrated in the remaining water, increasing the intracellular ionic strength and interfering with the organization of the proteins and other organized intercellular structures. Eventually, the solute concentration inside the cells reaches the eutectic and freezes. The final state of frozen tissues is pure ice in the former extracellular spaces, and inside the cell membranes a mixture of concentrated cellular components in ice and bound water. In general, this process is not reversible to the point of restoring the tissues to life.

Cryostasis utilizes using [[clathrate]]-forming gases that penetrate and saturate the biological tissues causing [[clathrate hydrates]] formation (under specific pressure-temperature conditions) inside the cells and in the [[extracellular matrix]]. [[Clathrate hydrates]] are a class of solids in which gas molecules occupy "cages" made up of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. These "cages" are unstable when empty, collapsing into conventional ice crystal structure, but they are stabilised by the inclusion of the gas molecule within them. Most low molecular weight gases (including CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, Ar, Kr, and Xe) will form a hydrate under some pressure-temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Clathrates formation will prevent the biological tissues from [[dehydration]] which will cause irreversible inactivation of intracellular enzymes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20271">'''Crystal engineering''' is the design and synthesis of molecular solid state structures with desired properties, based on an understanding and use of [[Intermolecular force|intermolecular interactions]]. The two main strategies currently in use for crystal engineering are based on [[hydrogen bond]]ing and coordination bonding. These may be understood with key concepts such as the supramolecular [[synthon]] and the secondary building unit.[[Image:Crystal Engineering JACS 2007 vol129 page4306 commons.jpg|thumbnail|300px|An example of crystal engineering using [[hydrogen bonding]] reported by Wuest and coworkers in ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]'', 2007, 4306–4322.]]

==History of term==
The term ‘crystal engineering’ was first used in 1971 by Gerhard Schmidt&lt;ref&gt;G. M. J. Schmidt, ''Photodimerization in the solid state'', ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', 1971, ''27'', 647.&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with photodimerization reactions in crystalline [[cinnamic acid]]s. Since this initial use, the meaning of the term has broadened considerably to include many aspects of solid state [[supramolecular chemistry]]. A useful modern definition is that provided by [[Gautam Radhakrishna Desiraju|Gautam Desiraju]], who in 1988 defined crystal engineering as "the understanding of intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing and the utilization of such understanding in the design of new solids with desired physical and chemical properties."&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Desiraju, ''Crystal Engineering: The design of Organic Solids'', Elsevier, 1989, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; Since many of the bulk properties of molecular materials are dictated by the manner in which the molecules are ordered in the solid state, it is clear that an ability to control this ordering would afford control over these properties.

==Non-covalent control of structure==
Crystal engineering relies on [[Non-covalent interactions|noncovalent bonding]] to achieve the organization of molecules and ions in the solid state. Much of the initial work on purely [[Organic chemistry|organic]] systems focused on the use of hydrogen bonds, though with the recent extension to [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] systems, the coordination bond has also emerged as a powerful tool. In addition to this, especially through studies during the last decade, the use of [[halogen bond]]s has proved beneficial in providing additional control in crystal design.&lt;ref&gt;P. Metrangolo, H. Neukirch, T. Pilati and G. Resnati,  ''Halogen Bonding Based Recognition Processes:  A World Parallel to Hydrogen Bonding'', ''Acc. Chem. Res.'' 2005, ''38'', 386-395.&lt;/ref&gt; Other intermolecular forces such as π…π and Au…Au interactions have all been exploited in crystal engineering studies, and [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] interactions can also be important. However, the two most common strategies in crystal engineering still employ only hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds.

[[Molecular self-assembly]] is at the heart of crystal engineering, and it typically involves an interaction between complementary hydrogen bonding faces or a metal and a [[ligand]]. By analogy with the [[Retrosynthetic analysis|retrosynthetic]] approach to [[organic synthesis]], Desiraju coined the term "supramolecular synthon"&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Desiraju,  ''Supramolecular Synthons in Crystal Engineering—A New Organic Synthesis'', ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' 1995, ''34'', 2311-2327.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe building blocks that are common to many structures and hence can be used to order specific groups in the solid state.&lt;ref&gt;A. Nangia and G. R. Desiraju, ''Supramolecular Structures - Reason and Imagination, Acta Crystallogr.'' 1998, ''A54'', 934-944.&lt;/ref&gt; The carboxylic acid dimer represents a simple supramolecular synthon, though in practice this is only observed in approximately 30% of crystal structures in which it is theoretically possible. The [[Cambridge Structural Database]] (CSD) provides an excellent tool for assessing the efficiency of particular synthons. The supramolecular synthon approach has been successfully applied in the synthesis of one dimensional tapes, two dimensional sheets and three dimensional structures. The CSD today contains atomic positional parameters for nearly 800 000 [[crystal structure]]s, and this forms the basis for heuristic or synthon based or "experimental" crystal engineering.

== Design of multi-component crystals ==
[[File:Five component crystal.jpg|thumb|321x321px|A five component crystal was designed by Desiraju and co workers by a rational retrosynthetic strategy (''IUCrJ'', 2016, 3, 96–101).]]
A major development in the field of crystal engineering in the last decade is related to the development of design strategies for bi-component and higher multi-component crystals (also known as [[cocrystal]]s). The design of cocrystals is a difficult task as it involves recognition between different molecules which might be completely different in shape and size. Therefore, the more the number of components in a crystal, the more challenging it is to synthesize. Initially, the synthesis of cocrystals was centered on the design of binary ones. This is most often achieved with strong heteromolecular interactions. Ternary ones were designed mainly by interaction insulation, interaction hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;C. B. Aakeröy, A. M. Beatty and B. A. Helfrich, ''“Total Synthesis” Supramolecular Style: Design and Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Assembly of Ternary Supermolecules'', ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' 2001, ''40'', 3240-3242.&lt;/ref&gt; or by shape-size mimicry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tothadi, A. Mukherjee and G. R. Desiraju, ''Shape and size mimicry in the design of ternary molecular solids: towards a robust strategy for crystal engineering'', ''Chem. Commun.'' 2011, ''47'', 12080-12082.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it has been shown recently that it is possible to synthesize up to five-component crystals by choosing a suitable retrosynthetic strategy.&lt;ref&gt;N. A. Mir, R. Dubey and G. R. Desiraju,  ''Four- and five-component molecular solids: crystal engineering strategies based on structural inequivalence'', ''IUCrJ'' 2016, ''3'', 96-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The main relevance of multi-component crystals, apart from the synthetic challenge, arises from the advantage of tuning a particular property by changing the components. The main development in this front is focused upon designing pharmaceutical cocrystals.&lt;ref&gt;O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko,  ''Crystal engineering of the composition of pharmaceutical phases. Do pharmaceutical co-crystals represent a new path to improved medicines?'', ''Chem. Commun.'' 2004, 1889-1896&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical cocrystals are generally composed of one API ([[Active ingredient|Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient]]) with other molecular substances that are considered safe according to the guidelines provided by WHO ([[World Health Organization]]). It has been shown that various properties (such as solubility, bioavailability, permeability) of an API can be modulated through the formation of pharmaceutical cocrystals.

==In two dimensions==
The study and formation of 2D architectures (i.e., molecularly thick architectures) has rapidly emerged as a branch of engineering with molecules.&lt;ref&gt;J. V. Barth, G. Constantini, K. Kern, ''Engineering atomic and molecular nanostructures at surfaces, Nature'', 2005, ''437'', 671–679.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation (often referred as [[molecular self-assembly]] depending on its deposition process) of such architectures lies in the use of solid interfaces to create adsorbed monolayers. Such monolayers may feature spatial crystallinity in an investigated time window, and thus the terminology of 2D crystal engineering is well suited.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Palma, M. Bonini, T. Breiner, P. Samori, ''Supramolecular Crystal Engineering at the Solid– Liquid Interface from First Principles: Toward Unraveling the Thermodynamics of 2D Self- Assembly, Adv. Mat.'', 2009, ''21'', 1383–1386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. A. A. W. Elemans, S.B. Lei S. De Feyter, ''Molecular and Supramolecular Networks on Surfaces: From Two Dimensional Crystal Engineering to Reactivity,'' ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'', 2009, ''48'', 7298–7332&lt;/ref&gt; However the dynamic and wide range of monolayer morphologies ranging from amorphous to network structures have made of the term (2D) supramolecular engineering a more accurate term. Specifically, supramolecular engineering refers to "(The) design (of) molecular units in such way that a predictable structure is obtained"&lt;ref&gt;J. Simon, P. Bassoul, ''Design of molecular materials: supramolecular engineering'', 2000 WileyVCH&lt;/ref&gt; or as "the design, synthesis and self-assembly of well defined molecular modules into tailor-made supramolecular architectures".&lt;ref&gt;A. Ciesielski, C.A. Palma, M. Bonini, P. Samori, ''Towards Supramolecular Engineering of Functional Nanomaterials: PreProgramming MultiComponent 2D SelfAssembly at Solid Liquid Interfaces, Adv. Mat.'', 2010, ''22'', 3506–3520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of 2D crystal engineering has advanced over the years especially through the advent of [[Scanning probe microscopy|scanning probe microscopic techniques]] which enable one to visualize networks with sub-molecular precision. Understanding the mechanism of these two dimensional assemblies may provide insights to the bottom up fabrication processes at the interfaces. The many aspects of developments in this field include the understanding of interactions, studies on polymorphism, design of nanoporous networks. Engineering the size and symmetry of the cavities and performing [[Host–guest chemistry|host guest chemistry]] inside the pores under nano confinement remains an attractive interest of this field. More recently, multicomponent networks are also studied that are formed by the application of crystal engineering principles. Although, there is a very high influence of the underlying substrate on the formation of the two dimensional assemblies, at least in a few cases, a relation was found between 2D assemblies and the bulk crystal structures.

==Polymorphism==
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the phenomenon wherein the same chemical compound exists in different crystal forms. In the initial days of crystal engineering, polymorphism was not properly understood and incompletely studied. Today, it is one of the most exciting branches of the subject partly because polymorphic forms of drugs may be entitled to independent patent protection if they show new and improved properties over the known crystal forms. With the growing importance of generic drugs, the importance of crystal engineering to the pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;D. Braga, F. Grepioni, L. Maini and M. Polito in ''Crystal Polymorphism and Multiple Crystal Forms'', ''Vol.''  (Ed. W. M. Hosseini), Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2009, pp. 87-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymorphism arises due to the competition between kinetic and thermodynamic factors during crystallization. While long-range strong intermolecular interactions dictate the formation of kinetic crystals, the close packing of molecules generally drives the thermodynamic outcome. Understanding this dichotomy between the kinetics and thermodynamics constitutes the focus of research related to the polymorphism.
[[File:Kinetics and thermodynamics.tif|thumb|The pathways to kinetically favoured and thermodynamically favoured crystals.]]
In organic molecules, three types of polymorphism are mainly observed. Packing polymorphism arises when molecules pack in different ways to give different structures. Conformational polymorphism, on the other hand is mostly seen in flexible molecules where molecules have multiple conformational possibilities within a small energy window. As a result, multiple crystal structures can be obtained with the same molecule but in different conformations. The rarest form of polymorphism arises from the differences in the primary synthon and this type of polymorphism is called as synthon polymorphism. With the growth in research in the cocrystals in recent times, it is observed that cocrystals are also prone to polymorphism.

== Crystal structure prediction ==
[[Crystal structure prediction]] (CSP) is a computational approach to generate energetically feasible crystal structures (with corresponding space group and positional parameters) from a given molecular structure. The CSP exercise is considered most challenging as “experimental” crystal structures are very often kinetic structures and therefore are very difficult to predict. In this regard, many protocols have been proposed and are tested through several blind tests organized by [[Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre|CCDC]] since 2002. A major advance in the CSP happened in 2007 while a hybrid method based on tailor made force fields and density functional theory (DFT) was introduced. In the first step, this method employs tailor made force fields to decide upon the ranking of the structures followed by a dispersion corrected DFT method to calculate the lattice energies precisely.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Neumann, F. J. J. Leusen and J. Kendrick, ''A Major Advance in Crystal Structure Prediction'', ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' 2008, ''47'', 2427-2430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the ability of predicting crystal structures, CSP also gives computed energy landscapes of crystal structures where many structures lie within a narrow energy window.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Price, ''Computed Crystal Energy Landscapes for Understanding and Predicting Organic Crystal Structures and Polymorphism'', ''Acc. Chem. Res.'' 2009, ''42'', 117-126.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of computed landscapes lend insights into the study on polymorphism, design of new structures and also help to design crystallization experiments.

== Property design ==
The design of crystal structures with desired properties is the ultimate goal of crystal engineering. While major advances towards this have been made in [[coordination polymer]]s, the application of successful strategies to design properties in purely organic solids is still limited. Most of the initial studies related to the crystal engineering of organic molecular solids were concentrated upon understanding the intermolecular interaction and identification of supramolecular synthons. In recent years, considerable attention has been given to the design the organic solids with specific properties. The early attempts to apply of crystal engineering principles to design the functional solids were focused upon the synthesis of non-linear optical materials, especially those with second harmonic generation (SHG) properties.
[[File:LRM photodimer.gif|thumb|A resorcinol based templating strategy described by Macgillivray and co workers to illustrate the control of photodimerization outcome, ''J. Am.'' ''Chem. Soc.'', 2000, 122, 7817-7818.]]
Another major development in this area is related to the control of photodimerization reactions through templates by application of crystlal engineering strategies. The importance of topochemical control in solid-state reactions was first realized by Schmidt. However, with the advent of cocrystals, multiple strategies have been discovered over the years to get photodimerization products from the molecules which are otherwise photo inactive with precise stereochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. MacGillivray, J. L. Reid and J. A. Ripmeester,  ''Supramolecular Control of Reactivity in the Solid State Using Linear Molecular Templates'', ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 2000, ''122'', 7817-7818.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent development in property design is linked with the mechanical properties in relation with the crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Reddy, R. C. Gundakaram, S. Basavoju, M. T. Kirchner, K. A. Padmanabhan and G. R. Desiraju, ''Structural basis for bending of organic crystals'', ''Chem. Commun.'' 2005, 3945-3947.&lt;/ref&gt; Various mechanical properties such as bending, shearing or brittleness have been explained on the basisy of crystal packing. It has also been shown that solids of desired mechanical properties can be designed through the precise control of packing features. More recently, nanoindentation techniques are used in quantification of some of these properties in terms of hardness and elasticity.&lt;ref&gt;S. Varughese, M. S. R. N. Kiran, U. Ramamurty and G. R. Desiraju,  ''Nanoindentation in Crystal Engineering: Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals'', ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' 2013, ''52'', 2701-2712.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these properties, significant efforts have been made to control the photophysical properties as well. Despite all the developments made so far, this area of property design, especially in the purely organic solids, is still at an evolving stage and needs more directed approaches to understand the connectivity between the crystal structures and their respective properties.

== A holistic view ==
Crystallization mechanism forms the core of all the problems in crystal engineering. A proper understanding of crystallization mechanisms will enable us to sort among the various possibilities generated by say CSP. Moreover, it will help a crystal engineer to design a solid with particular function.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Desiraju, ''Crystal Engineering: A Holistic View'', ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' 2007, ''46'', 8342-8356.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore of immense importance to understand the progression from solution to the nucleus to the crystal structures, in other terms, how the entropy dominated situation in solution converts to an enthalpy driven one in the crystals through the nucleation step. As the nucleus is difficult to identify, the approaches made towards this end can be generally divided into two categories. The first type centers on the studies in solution through various spectroscopic techniques to understand the structure of the assembly in the solution and these studies give an idea about the initial stages of crystallization.&lt;ref&gt;S. Parveen, R. J. Davey, G. Dent and R. G. Pritchard,  ''Linking solution chemistry to crystal nucleation: the case of tetrolic acid'', ''Chem. Commun.'' 2005, 1531-1533.&lt;/ref&gt; The second type of approach take into account all the relevant crystal structures of a given compound and this constitutes a ''structural landscape''.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Desiraju, ''Crystal Engineering: From Molecule to Crystal'', ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 2013, ''135'', 9952-9967.&lt;/ref&gt; Each structure in a structural landscape is considered as an individual data point and while taken together it provides a holistic viewpoint towards the crystallization mechanism. A special situation happens when multiple components are observed in an asymmetric unit (Z′&gt;1). These structures result from the interrupted crystallization and therefore shed lights on the intermediate stages of crystallization.

==Specialized journals==
Crystal engineering is a rapidly expanding discipline as revealed by the recent appearance of several international [[scientific journal]]s in which the topic plays a major role. These include ''[[CrystEngComm]]'' from the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] and ''[[Crystal Growth &amp; Design]]'' from the [[American Chemical Society]]. The new open access journals IUCrJ from the [[International Union of Crystallography]] and ''[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/crystals Crystals]'' from [[MDPI]] have crystal engineering as one of their main sections, reflecting the importance of this  subject in modern structural chemistry.

The DWF depends on the [[scattering vector]] '''q'''. For a given '''q''', DWF('''q''') gives the fraction of [[elastic scattering]]; 1 - DWF('''q''') correspondingly gives the fraction of inelastic scattering. (Strictly speaking, this probability interpretation is not true in general.&lt;ref name="Lipkin2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lipkin |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry J. Lipkin |arxiv=cond-mat/0405023v1 |title=Physics of Debye-Waller Factors |pages=cond-mat/0405023 |year=2004 |bibcode=2004cond.mat..5023L }}&lt;/ref&gt;) In [[diffraction]] studies, only the elastic scattering is useful; in crystals, it gives rise to distinct [[Bragg reflection]] peaks. Inelastic scattering events are undesirable as they cause a diffuse background &amp;mdash; unless the energies of scattered particles are analysed, in which case they carry valuable information (for instance in [[inelastic neutron scattering]] or [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]]).

The basic expression for the DWF is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \text{DWF} = \left\langle \exp\left(i \mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{u}\right) \right\rangle^2&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the displacement of a scattering center,
and &lt;math&gt;\langle \ldots \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes either thermal or time averaging.
 
Assuming [[harmonic oscillator|harmonicity]] of the scattering centers in the material under study, the [[Boltzmann distribution]] implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] with zero mean. Then, using for example the expression of the corresponding [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]], the DWF takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; \text{DWF} = \exp\left( -\langle [\mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{u}]^2 \rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that although the above reasoning is classical, the same holds in quantum mechanics.

Assuming also [[isotropy]] of the harmonic potential, one may write

:&lt;math&gt; \text{DWF} = \exp\left( -q^2 \langle u^2 \rangle / 3  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'', ''u'' are the magnitudes (or absolute values) of the vectors '''q''', '''u''' respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\langle u^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean squared displacement]]. In crystallographic publications, values of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are often given where &lt;math&gt;U = \langle u^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that if the incident wave has wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and it is elastically scattered by an angle of &lt;math&gt;2\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{4\pi \sin(\theta)}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In the context of [[protein structure]]s, the term B-factor is used. The B-factor is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;B = 8\pi^2 \langle u^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

It is measured in units of [[Angstrom|Å]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The B-factors can be taken as indicating the relative vibrational motion of different parts of the structure. '''Atoms with low B-factors belong to a part of the structure that is well ordered. Atoms with large B-factors generally belong to part of the structure that is very flexible.''' Each ATOM record ([[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB file format]]) of a crystal structure deposited with the [[Protein Data Bank]] contains a B-factor for that atom.

'''Ecotoxicity''', the subject of study of the field of [[ecotoxicology]] (a [[portmanteau]] of [[ecology]] and [[toxicology]]), refers to the potential for [[biological]], [[chemical]] or physical [[stressor]]s to affect [[ecosystems]]. Such stressors might occur in the natural environment at densities, concentrations or levels high enough to disrupt the natural biochemistry, physiology, behavior and interactions of the living organisms that comprise the ecosystem.

Ecotoxicology has been defined as, "the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truhaut R | year = 1977 | title = Eco-Toxicology - Objectives, Principles and Perspectives | url = | journal = Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 151–173 | doi=10.1016/0147-6513(77)90033-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common environmental toxicants == 
# [[Diethyl phthalate]], that enter environments through industries manufacturing cosmetics, plastic and many other commercial products.
# [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), found in many mass-produced products such as, medical devices, food packaging, cosmetics, children's toys, computers, CD's, etc.
# Pharmaceuticals such as [[Climbazole]], a fungicide found in [[anti-dandruff shampoo]]s.
# [[Pesticide]]s
# Some but not all; [[Cleaning agent|cleaning products]], [[laundry detergent]]s, [[fabric softener]]s, [[oven cleaner]]s, [[disinfectant]]s
# [[Phosphate]]s
# [[Oil]]

== Everyday hazards ==

In Canada, there is no law requiring manufactures to state the health and [[environmental hazard]]s associated with their cleaning products. Many people buy such products to support a clean and healthy home, often unaware of the products ability to harm both their own health and the surrounding environment. "Canadians spend more than $275 million on household [[cleaning product]]s in a year" &lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/the-dirt-on-toxic-chemicals-in-household-cleaning-products/ |title=The dirt on toxic chemicals in household cleaning products |last=Suzuki |first=David |publisher= The David Suzuki Foundation |date=  |website=David Suzuki Foundation, Solutions are in our nature |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals from these cleaners enter our bodies through air passageways and [[skin absorption|absorption through the skin]] and when these cleaning products are  washed down the drain they negatively affect [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. There are also no regulations in place stating that the ingredients be listed on labels of cleaning products leading the users to be ultimately unaware of the chemicals they expose themselves and their surrounding environments to.

=== 2-Butoxyethanol === 
The organic compound [[2-Butoxyethanol]], commonly found in [[glass cleaner]]s, laundry [[stain remover]]s, windshield wiper fluid, [[oven cleaner]]s, and [[rust remover]]s has been proven to cause [[reproductive problems]] in laboratory experiments.

=== Ammonia === 
The compound [[ammonia]] is found in many window cleaners, drain cleaners, bathroom cleaners, oven cleaners, [[car polish]], and all-purpose cleaners. Its vapour is particularly harmful to people with [[asthma]] and it may also cause kidney and [[liver damage]]. When ammonia is mixed with products containing [[chlorine bleach]], highly poisonous [[chloramine]] gas is formed. This poisonous gas often forms when cleaners are mixed in the home forming strong irritants.

=== Fragrance chemicals ===

[[Fragrance]] chemicals are found in most cleaning products, perfumes, and [[personal care]] products. More than 3000 chemicals are used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in [[detergent]]s accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible [[endocrine disruptor]]s that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.

=== Phosphates ===

[[Phosphates]] are found in many dishwasher detergents, laundry detergents, and bathroom cleaners. They act as a fertilizer in water and in high concentrations can promote algae blooms and increase weed growth. When water containing phosphates are washed into water areas they carry with them [[fertilizer]]s, nutrients, and wastes from the land. [[Phytoplankton]] and algae flourish at the surface due to increased phosphates. Dead phytoplankton and other organisms sink to the bottom giving rise to large numbers of decomposers due to increased food supply (dead organisms, phytoplankton). Due to the increased number of decomposers that use more oxygen, fish and shrimp at the lower layers of the ocean become oxygen-starved and [[hypoxic zone]]s become apparent.

=== Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) ===

[[Quats]] are [[anti-microbial]] agents that are found in bathroom cleaners, [[fabric softener]]s, and degreasers. They are a class of irritants and [[Allergy|sensitizers]] that negatively affect people who suffer from asthma. Chemicals in this class are persistent in aquatic environments, and toxic to the organisms that live in these environments. Many researchers are concerned that their widespread use in everyday household [[disinfectant]]s and cosmetics are contributing to [[antibiotic resistant]] bacteria, thus limiting microbial infection treatment options.

===Trisodium nitrilotriacetate===

Trisodium [[nitrilotriacetate]] is found in bathroom cleaners and possibly some laundry detergents although more actively used in industrial formulations. Small amounts add up in the environment and add to an overall toxic issue. In aquatic ecosystems these chemicals cause [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] in [[sediment]] to redisolve and many of these metals are toxic to fish and other wildlife.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

== Plasticizers ==
[[Phthalates]] and [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] date back to the 1920s and 1930s. Phthalates have been applied as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) additives since 1926, but were also used for health care purposes as [[insect repellent]]s and [[cercaricides]]. BPA is present in most aquatic environments, entering water systems through [[landfill]]s and [[sewage treatment plant]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] allowing for [[bioaccumulation]] in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=Oehlmann2009&gt;{{cite journal|author = Oehlmann, J. | author2 = Oehlmann, U.S. | author3 = Kolas, W. | author4 = Jagnytsch, O. |author5=Lutz, I. | author6 = Kusk, K.O. | author7 = Wollenberger, L. | author8 = Santos E.M. | author9 = Paull, G.C. | author10 = Van Look, K.J.W. | author11 = Tyler, C.R. | date = 2009| title = A critical analysis of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife. |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume= 364| issue = | pages = 2047–2062 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0242 | pmid=19528055 | pmc=2873012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These endocrine disrupters are a large group of chemicals that enter into the aquatic environment through the manufacturing of various industrial and consumer products, agriculture and food/drug processing, waste water treatment plants and human wastes. Phthalate esters are common additives that soften and make PVC more flexible.&lt;ref name=Barse2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Barse, A. V.| author2 = Chakrabarti, T. | author3 = Ghosh, T.K. | author4 = Pal, A.K. |author5=Jadhao, S.B.| date = 2007| title = Endocrine disruption and metabolic changes following exposure of Cyprinus carpio to diethyl phthalate |journal= Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology |volume= 88| issue = | pages = 36–42 | doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2006.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in many everyday items such as medical devices, packaging for fragrances and cosmetics, ropes and varnishes, in plastic used to wrap food, and shower curtains. These Phthalate esters have been found in areas of water, air, sediment, and in gulfs and rivers around the world, Giam et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; Phalates and BPA affect reproduction in animal groups such as Molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians and fish. Most of these plasticizers affect hormone systems, and some phthalates have even larger pathways of disruption. Phthalates and BPA have been proven to affect development and reproduction in a variety of species. Disturbances include changes in the number of offspring produced and reduced hatching success. In amphibians for example, phthalates and BPA disrupt thyroid functioning which in turn impacts larval development. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be more responsive than fish, with most effects being induced in low concentration ranges with the exception of disrupted [[spermatogenesis]] in fish in the low range.&lt;ref name="Oehlmann2009"/&gt; 
A Phthalate referred to as [[diethyl phthalate]] (DEP) enters the aquatic environment through industries that manufacture cosmetics, plastics and many commercial products that pose hazards to aquatic organisms and human health. Through exposing an adult male common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) to [[LC50]] doses it was evident that a bioaccumulation of DEP in testis, liver, brain, gills and muscle tissue was present. Fish exposed to 20 ppm of DEP became drowsy and discolored during the onset of the fourth week.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; 
Sources of DEP contamination and accumulation in humans include cosmetic products and dietary meat of fish, Persky et al.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; This DEP acts as a cosmetic ingredient and vehicle for fragrances, both which come in contact with the skin. 
Many countries around the world including India practice sewage fed fisheries where waste waters are used for the purpose of culturing fish. Endocrine disruption and a presence of phthalate residue is highly likely to be observable in these sewage fed fish. This is the case as waste water from various industries and garbage containing DEP are released into these waters. Through a DEP treatment with [[Cyprinus carpio]], liver size was observed to increase and testis size decreased. In fish, muscle ALT and AST activities decreased as it was effected by DEP treatment.  Like many toxic chemicals DEP has been known to affect metabolic enzyme profiles and activities of phosphatases and transaminases, Ghorpade et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Barse2007"/&gt; A decrease in immunity of [[M. rosenbergii]] after exposure to DEP was also noted. 
Given that biological effect concentrations for plasticizers used in the laboratory coincide with concentrations present in the environment, it seems that some wildlife species must be negatively impacted.

== Personal hygiene products ==
Personal care products can reach the environment through drainage from waste water treatment plants and digested sludge. Recently, the anti-dandruff and [[antimycotic]], [[Climbazole]], was detected in waste water treatment drainages. Climbazole is readily used in cosmetics, and is an ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos. Shampoos contain formulations of up to 2.0% which is the equivalent of approximately 15g/L. Climbazole is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae [[Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata]] at very low concentrations. [[Zebrafish]] experienced lethal effects after exposure to climbazole in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Richter2013&gt;{{cite journal|author = Richter, E. | author2 = Wick, A. | author3 = Ternes, T.A. | author4 = Coors, A. | date = 2013| title = Ecotoxicity of Climbzole, a fungicide contained in Antridandruff shampoo. |journal= Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry  |volume= 32| issue = | pages = 2816–2825 | doi=10.1002/etc.2367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Danio rerio]], [[Lemna minor]], [[Navicula pelliculosa]], Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and [[Daphnia magna]] were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by climbazole in a concentration-dependant manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of climbazole on [[oats]] and [[turnip]] included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of climbazole can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.&lt;ref name="Richter2013"/&gt;

== Pesticides == 
[[Pesticides]] often pose serious problems as they kill not only targeted organisms but also non-targeted organisms in the process. They are released into the natural environment intentionally by people who are often unaware that the chemicals will travel further than anticipated, Hatakeyama et al. as cited in.&lt;ref name=Hanazato2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hanazato T. | date = 2001 | title = Pesticide effects on freshwater zooplankton: an ecological perspective | url = | journal = Environmental Pollution  | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00110-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the pesticides largely affect the natural communities in which they are used. They negatively effect multiple levels ranging from molecules to tisues to organs to individuals to populations and onto communities. In the natural environment, a combination of pesticide exposure and natural stressors such as fluctuating temperature, food shortage or decreased oxygen availability are worse than when presented alone. Pesticides can affect the feeding rates of zoo-plankton. In the presence of pesticides zoo-plankton display lower feeding rates which result in reduced growth and reproduction. Swimming may also be affected by pesticides which poses a life-threatening issue for zoo-plankton as they swim to obtain food and nutrients and avoid predators. Such changes may alter predator-prey relationships. A spinning behavior became apparent in Daphnia induced by carbaryl which increased the probability of the Daphnia being eaten by other fish, Dodson et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt; The toxicant [[pentachlorophenol]] increases swimming speed in the rotifer [[Brachionus calyciflorus]], in turn increasing the encounter rate of the prey with their predators, Preston et al. as cited by.&lt;ref name="Hanazato2001"/&gt;

== Oil spills == 
One of the major environmental impacts of oil exploration on the environment is the contamination of aquatic ecosystems from [[oil spill]]s and oil seepages from pits. Oftentimes, as is the case in the [[Ecuadorian Amazon]], oil is used to control [[dust]] on roadways, causing the precipitation [[surface runoff|runoff]] from these roads to also be contaminated. Direct human health hazards occur since many people, including children walk barefoot on these oiled roads putting them in direct contact with the crude oil. Other hazards to humans include [[seepage]]s into ponds that provide drinking water for the population. 
During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Environmental concerns are primarily focused on a group of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs). “PAHs accumulate on particles and sediments, which tend to protect them from biodegrading processes", Green and Trett as cited in.&lt;ref name=Wernersson2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wernersson A.S. | date = 2004 | title = Aquatic ecotoxicity due to oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon. | url = | journal = Aquatic Ecosystem Health &amp; Management | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 127–136 | doi=10.1080/14634980490281470}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. 
Samples were collected from four sites (13 stations) in the Ecuadorian Amazon where crude oil was the main pollutant. The water collected from Site B, a drinking water pond located 100m from an in use pit, had the highest [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (THP) concentration. Sediments were found to be acutely [[phototoxic]]. This area which has poorly developed infrastructure is one where residents collect water for drinking, cooking and bathing from the rivers and ponds nearby. “A recent study observed excess [[cancer rate]]s in a village in this region” Sebastian et. Al, as cited in.&lt;ref name="Wernersson2004"/&gt; Not only were excess cancer rates apparent but many people in this area that were consuming the water for drinking purposes became ill.
In Wernersson’s study, toxicity of water and sediment samples were studied on Daphnia magna (a crustacean zoo-plankton species) and [[Hyalella azteca]] (an amphipod). These samples were collected from four sites where crude oil was the main source of pollution. 1-4 day old organisms of both species were used in the tests. Immobility of D. magna was recorded after 24 hours of exposure indoors. They were then moved outdoors where they were exposed to sunlight. After 1–2 hours the samples were removed from the sunlight and it was found that D. Magna often recovered within an hour after UV exposure.
Hyalella azteca was cultured in the same medium as was used for the D. Magna species. To minimize stress shade was provided. 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness were provided. [[Lethality]] was recorded after 96 hours of exposure.

'''Energy consulting''' is a sub-discipline of [[environmental consulting]] that focuses on optimizing a [[business]]' [[energy usage]], as well as the sources from which the actual [[energy]] is derived. Energy consulting is often centered on reducing [[operating cost|operational cost]]s, though this is not always the main goal. With the increasing importance of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) in the minds of the general public, enterprise level businesses may contract an '''energy consultant''' to include more [[environmentally friendly]] energy sources into their energy mix.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powercall.nl/werken-bij/ |title=Power Call |accessdate=November 5, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lnCfmbKv?url=http://www.powercall.nl/werken-bij/ |archivedate=November 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

With the recent volatility in the [[energy industry]],&lt;ref&gt;http://solution105.com/BlogArticles/blog/default.aspx?id=34&amp;t=Energy-Market-Update-November-2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/power-struggle-making-the-most-of-generation-assets-in-turbulent-times.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; energy consulting is quickly becoming a main component of business operations for enterprises worldwide.

== Role of hedging and financial analysis ==
As a result of the volatility in the modern energy industry, many enterprise level businesses are turning to [[financial analyst]]s, specifically through the use of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] to minimize exposure to the unstable energy industry.

'''Gjika Amplification''' was founded in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in the early 1980s, by Robert (Bob) Gjika. Gjika amplifiers are original designs, and are completely hand-wired.

==Origins==
Robert Gjika was born in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], in 1960.  At a young age began building his own guitars and amplifiers. His father was an electrician, giving him an early start in electronics. By 1979, he had established himself in the local Boston area as a luthier, repairing and building guitars and amplifiers for [[E.U. Wurlitzer Music and Sound]]. After a year+ working there, he opened up his own shop in Boston, where he was soon in-demand for all things related to guitars and amplifiers. Some of the musicians and bands he did work for included popular Boston bands at the time, guitarists such as [[Reeves Gabrels]], guitar wizard [[Joe Stump]], and other guitarists from the [[Berklee College of Music]] scene.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Relocations==
Gjika moved his business from Boston to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1987, where he met the late [[Shawn Lane]], and introduced Shawn to his guitars and single-ended amp designs. In 1989 he relocated to [[Los Angeles, California]], to focus on producing the "Gold" amps, with a new business partner, Bill Walker, under the brand name "Gjika-Walker". In 1990, after the business partnership was dissolved, Gjika left Los Angeles to go to [[Austin, Texas]], where the music scene was flourishing, and at that time, transitioned from his Gold Amps to his 3-Channel KT90 amplifier.  In 1996 he again relocated, to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjika Custom Guitar &amp; Amplifiers|url=https://www.manta.com/c/mtmqcm6/gjika-custom-guitar-amplifiers|website=Manta|publisher=Manta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During these years he continued his amp designing and building, on a smaller scale, until in 2000 he went back to California, where he currently resides and builds his amplifiers in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]].

==Public reception==
In Memphis, Gjika's Quality Guitars, on Union Avenue, was featured in a local music publication, in which Tim O'Shea said of Gjika's skills: "His technical expertise is most impressive, especially his "diagnosis to repair" knowledge of another rock necessity, the electric PA and amp... Gjika also builds and sells his custom, "Hot Box" amplifiers, perhaps the finest available anywhere." Of Bob's custom guitar designs: "Gjika builds three or four of his custom 'Wild Thing' guitars each year, at a cool five grand apiece.  The prototype guitars are truly wonders to behold at any stage of construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Shea|first1=Tim|title=The Custom Guitar and Mother Memphis|journal=Memphis Star - The Voice of Memphis Music|date=July 1988|page=52|url=http://memphislibrary.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/pageflip/collection/p13039coll5/id/2280/type/compoundobject/show/2250/cpdtype/document/pftype/image#page/1/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on his own playing, as well as designing and building guitars and amps, Gjika acquired a reputation for being reclusive, resulting in many believing that he had retired from amp building. It was noted by Dave Hunter in his [[reverb.com]] article, "Dave's Corner: Guide to Boutique Amps", in which he wrote "This enigmatic amp maker and all-round tech extraordinaire goes to few (if any) lengths to promote his own work." As to the quality of the guitar tone produced by Bob's original design amps, he assessed that "Characteristics of Gjika amps include their thick, rich, harmonically saturated tone and fast playing response." Further, "Bob Gjika has worked with [[Eric Johnson]], but might be best known for the scorching single-ended EL34-based amp that the late and largely underappreciated fusion virtuoso [[Shawn Lane]] used on his [[Powers of Ten (album)|''Powers of Ten'']]...a massive beast with four EL34s (or eight in its stereo configuration) and possibly the largest transformers I’ve seen on a guitar amp, giving it earth-shaking body and tremendous gain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Dave|title=Dave's Corner: Boutique Amp Guide Part VIII|url=https://reverb.com/news/daves-corner-boutique-amp-guide-part-viii|website=Reverb|publisher=reverb.com|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview by ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, Shawn Lane referred to his use of his Gjika Gold amp on his album ''Powers of Ten'' in glowing terms: "It's class-A power, all-tube, and just one of the most amazing amplifiers I've ever heard. It has a harmonic richness that really responds to a certain kind of touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olbrecht|first1=Jas|title=Shawn Lane, A Cult Hero Surfaces|journal=Guitar Player Magazine|date=October 1992|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Premier Guitar'' covered the [[Premier Builder's Guild]]'s [[NAMM]] booth featuring Gjika Amps, with highly positive reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammond|first1=Shawn|title=NAMM '11 - Fano TC6 &amp; Gjika Amps SE-30 Demos|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/NAMM_11_Fano_TC6_Gjika_Amps_SE_30_Demos|website=Premier Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TRseries}}
The '''Great White Fleet''' was the popular nickname for the powerful [[United States Navy]] battle fleet that completed a journey around the globe from 16 December 1907, to 22 February 1909, by order of United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].  Its mission was to make friendly courtesy visits to numerous countries, while displaying new U.S. naval power to the world.

It consisted of 16 [[battleship]]s divided into two [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]], along with various [[Task force|escorts]].&lt;ref name=GWF-H-00&gt;{{cite web |author=JO2 [Journalist Second Class] Mike McKinley |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/c/cruise-great-white-fleet-mckinley.html |title=Cruise of the Great White Fleet |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] |accessdate=11 November 2015 |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GWF-H-01&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq42-1.htm The Great White Fleet] by Department of the Navy-- Naval History and Heritage Command [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120204131704/http%3A//www%2Ehistory%2Enavy%2Emil/faqs/faq42%2D1%2Ehtm Archived copy] at the [[Library of Congress]] (4 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt sought to demonstrate growing American military power and [[blue-water navy]] capability. Hoping to enforce treaties and protect overseas holdings, the [[United States Congress]] appropriated funds to build American naval power. Beginning in the 1880s with just 90 small ships, over one-third of them wooden and therefore obsolete, the navy quickly grew to include new modern steel fighting vessels. The hulls of these ships were painted a stark white, giving the armada the nickname "Great White Fleet".&lt;ref&gt;John Mack Faragher [et al.] ''Out of Many: a history of the American People''. Prentice Hall, 2012. p. 574.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and purpose==
[[File:PostcardUSSConnecticutBB18No1268.jpg|thumb|Flagship {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|2}}: one of a set of commemorative postcards of the ships of the Great White Fleet]]

In the twilight of his administration, United States President Theodore Roosevelt dispatched 16 U.S. Navy battleships of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United States)|Atlantic Fleet]] on a worldwide voyage of circumnavigation from 16 December 1907 to 22 February 1909.&lt;ref name=GWF-H-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=GWF-H-01/&gt; The hulls were painted white, the Navy's peacetime color scheme, decorated with gilded scrollwork with a red, white, and blue banner on their [[Bow (ship)|bows]]. These ships would later come to be known as the Great White Fleet.

The purpose of the fleet deployment was multifaceted. Ostensibly, it served as a showpiece of American goodwill, as the fleet visited numerous countries and harbors. In this, the voyage was not unprecedented. Naval courtesy calls, many times in conjunction with the birthdays of various monarchs and other foreign celebrations, had become common in the 19th century. Port calls showcased pomp, ceremony, and militarism during a period of rising pre-war nationalism. In 1891, a large French fleet visited [[Kronstadt]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], in conjunction with negotiations between the two nations. Although [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had been hostile to each other for at least three decades prior, the significance of the call was not lost on Russia, and [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] signed a treaty of alliance with France in 1894. As navies grew larger, naval pageants grew longer, more elaborate, and more frequent. The United States began participating in these events in 1902 when Roosevelt invited [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] to send a squadron for a courtesy call to [[New York City]]. Invitations for U.S. Navy ships to participate in fleet celebrations in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany followed.{{sfn|Hart|1965|pp=15–21}}

Additionally, the voyage of the Great White Fleet demonstrated both at home and on the world stage that the U.S. had become a major sea power in the years after its triumph in the [[Spanish–American War]], with possessions that included [[Guam]], the [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=GWF-H-03&gt;[http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/battleswars1900s/p/greatwhitefleet.htm Circling the Globe: The Voyage of the Great White Fleet] by Kennedy Hickman, About.com&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the first flexing of U.S. naval muscle since that war, however; during the [[Algeciras Conference]] in 1906, which was convened to settle a diplomatic crisis between France and Germany over the fate of [[Morocco]], Roosevelt had ordered eight battleships to maintain a presence in the [[Mediterranean|Mediterranean Sea]].{{sfn|Hart|1965|p=21}} Since [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had arisen as a major sea power with the 1905 annihilation of the Russian fleet at [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], the deployment of the Great White Fleet was therefore intended, at least in part, to send a message to Tokyo that the American fleet could be deployed anywhere, even from its Atlantic ports, and would be able to defend American interests in the Philippines and the Pacific.&lt;ref name=peacefulsea&gt;{{cite web |author=The Peaceful Sea |title=The Great White Fleet Visits Japan 1908 |url=http://www.thepeacefulsea.com/great-white-fleet.html |date= |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Global Security Org |title=Great White Fleet (16 December 1907 – 22 February 1909) |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/great-white-fleet.htm |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That gesture capitalized on diplomatic trouble that had resulted from [[Pacific Coast race riots of 1907|anti-Japanese riots in San Francisco]].  Those problems had been resolved by the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]] and the fleet visit was a friendly gesture to Japan.  The Japanese welcomed it.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Neu, ''An Uncertain Friendship; Theodore Roosevelt and Japan, 1906-1909'' (1968) pp 116-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt saw the deployment as one that would encourage patriotism, and give the impression that he would teach Japan "a lesson in polite behavior", as historian Robert A. Hart phrased it.{{sfn|Hart|1965|p=24}}  After the fleet had crossed the Pacific, Japanese statesmen realized that the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in the East had changed since the [[Root–Takahira Agreement]] that defined relevant spheres of interest of the United States and Japan.&lt;ref name=peacefulsea/&gt;

The voyage also provided an opportunity to improve the sea- and battle-worthiness of the fleet. While earlier capital ship classes such as the {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Illinois|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Maine|battleship|5}} were designed primarily for coastal defense, later classes such as the {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Connecticut|battleship|5}} incorporated lessons learned from the Spanish–American War and were conceived as ships with "the highest practicable speed and the greatest radius of action", in the words of the appropriation bills approved by the [[United States Congress]] for their construction. They were intended as modern warships capable of long-range operations. Nevertheless, the experience gained in the recent war with Spain had been limited.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=12}}

==Concerns and preparations==
Roosevelt's stated intent was to give the navy practice in navigation, communication, coal consumption and fleet maneuvering; navy professionals maintained, however, that such matters could be served better in home waters. In light of what had happened to the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]], they were concerned about sending their own fleet on a long deployment, especially since part of the intent was to impress a modern, battle-tested navy that had not known defeat. The fleet was untested in making such a voyage, and Tsushima had proven that extended deployments had no place in practical strategy.{{sfn|Hart|1965|pp=23–24}} The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] was close to coaling and repair facilities; while American ships could coal in the Philippines, docking facilities were far from optimal. An extended stop on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the United States during the voyage for overhaul and refurbishment in dry dock would be a necessity. Planning for the voyage, however, showed a dearth of adequate facilities there, as well. The main sea channel of the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]] near San Francisco was too shallow for battleships, which left only the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]], for refit and repair. The [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard|Hunter's Point civilian yard]] in San Francisco could accommodate capital ships, but had been closed due to lack of use and was slated for demolition. President Roosevelt ordered that Hunter's Point be reopened, facilities be brought up to date, and the fleet to report there.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|pp=30–31}}

Also, the question of adequate resources for coaling existed. This was not an issue when the Atlantic Fleet cruised the Atlantic or Caribbean, as fuel supplies were readily available. However, the United States did not enjoy a worldwide network of coaling stations like that of Great Britain, nor did it have an adequate supply of [[Auxiliary vessel|auxiliary vessels]] for resupply. During the Spanish–American War, this lack had forced Admiral [[George Dewey]] to buy a collier-load of British coal in Hong Kong before the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] to ensure his squadron would not run out of steam at sea. The need had been even more pressing for the Russian Baltic Fleet during its long deployment during the Russo-Japanese War, not just for the distance it was to steam, but also because, as a belligerent nation in wartime, most neutral ports were closed to it due to international law. While the lack of support vessels was pointed out and a vigorous program of building such ships suggested by Rear Admiral [[George W. Melville]], who had served as chief of the Bureau of Equipment, his words were not heeded adequately until World War II.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|pp=31–34}}

Federal regulations that restricted supply vessels for Navy ships to those flying the United States flag, complicated by the lack of an adequate [[United States Merchant Marine]], proved another obstacle. Roosevelt initially offered to award Navy supply contracts to American skippers whose bids exceeded those of foreign captains by less than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Reckner, ''Teddy Roosevelt's Great White Fleet'', 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Many carriers declined this offer because they could not obtain enough cargo to cover the cost of the return trip. Two months before the fleet sailed, Roosevelt ordered the Navy Department to contract 38 ships to supply the fleet with the 125,000 tons of coal it would need to steam from [[Hampton Roads]], Virginia, to [[San Francisco]]. Only eight of these were American-registered; most of the other 30 were of British registry. This development was potentially awkward, since part of the mission was to impress Japan with the perception of overwhelming American naval power. Britain had become a military ally of Japan in 1905 with the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], which obliged it to aid Japan should a foreign power declare war against it. Technically, the list of potential combatants included the United States. The British government decided to play both sides of the political fence with the intent of moderating any Japanese-American friction that might arise.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|pp=34–35}}

==Voyage==

[[File:Reuterdahl Fleet Passing Through Magellan Straits.jpg|thumb|''The Fleet Passing Through the Magellan Straits'' by naval artist [[Henry Reuterdahl]], who traveled with the fleet on USS ''Culgoa'']]

As the [[Panama Canal]] was not yet complete, the fleet had to pass through the [[Straits of Magellan]]. The scope of such an operation was unprecedented in U.S. history, as ships had to sail from all points of the compass to rendezvous points and proceed according to a carefully orchestrated, well-conceived plan. It involved almost the entire operational capability of the U.S. Navy. Unlike the formidable obstacles that had faced the Russian fleet{{refn|The Russian fleet had no coaling stations and foreign coaling stations were off limits to them during their voyage. The fleet had to refuel at sea via German contractor coaling vessals or on the sly at French ports.(Busch 86, 87)|group=nb}} on its voyage from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], which eventually led to its destruction [[Battle of Tsushima|by the Japanese]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Busch p. 86, 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semenov p. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. effort benefited from a peaceful environment which aided the coordination of ship movements. 

In port after port, citizens in the thousands turned out to see and greet the fleet. In 1908, the Great White Fleet visited [[Monterey, California]], from 1–4 May. The nearby [[Hotel Del Monte]] in [[Del Monte, California]], hosted a grand ball for the officers of the fleet. 

In Australia, the arrival of the Great White Fleet on 20 August 1908 was used to encourage support for the forming of [[Royal Australian Navy|Australia's own navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |title=Great White Fleet revisits Sydney Harbour |work=Afloat |pages=40 |publisher=Afloat Publications Pty Ltd |date=1 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fleet sailed into [[Yokohama]], the Japanese went to extraordinary lengths to show that their country desired peace with the U.S.; thousands of Japanese schoolchildren waved [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] to greet navy officials as they came ashore.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In [[Sicily]], the sailors helped in recovery operations after the [[1908 Messina earthquake]].

In February 1909, Roosevelt was in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], to witness the triumphant return of the fleet from its long voyage, and what he saw as a fitting finish for his administration. To the officers and men of the fleet, Roosevelt said, "Other nations may do what you have done, but they'll have to follow you." This parting act of [[grand strategy]] by Roosevelt greatly expanded foreign respect for the United States, as well as its role in the international arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The fourteen-month-long voyage was a grand pageant of American naval power. The squadrons were manned by 14,000 sailors. They covered some {{convert|43000|nmi|km}} and made twenty port calls on six continents. The fleet was impressive, especially as a demonstration of American industrial prowess (all eighteen ships had been constructed since the [[Spanish–American War]]), but already the battleships represented the suddenly outdated '[[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]]' type of capital ship, as the first battleships of the revolutionary {{sclass-|Dreadnought|battleship|4}} had just entered service, and the U.S. Navy's first [[dreadnought]], {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}, was already fitting out. The two oldest ships in the fleet, {{USS|Kearsarge|BB-5|2}} and {{USS|Kentucky|BB-6|2}}, were already obsolete and unfit for battle; two others, {{USS|Maine|BB-10|2}} and {{USS|Alabama|BB-8|2}}, had to be detached at San Francisco because of mechanical troubles and were replaced by the {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|2}} and the {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-9|2}}. (After repairs, ''Alabama'' and ''Maine'' completed their "own, more direct, circumnavigation of the globe" via Honolulu, Guam, Manila, Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Naples, Gibraltar, the Azores, and finally back to the United States, arriving on 20 October 1908, four months before the remainder of the fleet, which had taken a more circuitous route.)

The battleships were accompanied during the first leg of their voyage by a "Torpedo Flotilla" of six early [[destroyer]]s, as well as by several auxiliary ships. The destroyers and their tender did not actually steam in company with the battleships, but followed their own itinerary from [[Hampton Roads, Virginia|Hampton Roads]], Virginia to San Francisco, California.  Also of note is that the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|2}} preceded the Fleet itinerary for its first and second legs by about a month, perhaps making arrangements to later receive the Fleet.

With {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|2}}&lt;ref name=GWF-H-04&gt;[http://www.countyhistory.org/gwf/gwf/index.html Great White Fleet] USS Connecticut, Battleship BB-18&lt;/ref&gt; as flagship under the command of Rear Admiral [[Robley Dunglison Evans|Robley D. Evans]], the fleet sailed from Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907 for [[Trinidad]], [[British West Indies]], thence to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil; [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], Chile; [[Callao]], Peru; [[Magdalena Bay]], Mexico, and up the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], arriving at San Francisco, 6 May 1908.

At San Francisco, Rear Admiral [[Charles S. Sperry]] assumed command of the fleet, owing to the poor health of Admiral Evans. Also at San Francisco, the squadrons were slightly rearranged, bringing the newest and best ships in the fleet up to the First Squadron. {{USS|Glacier|AF-4|2}} was detached and later became the supply ship of the Pacific Fleet. At this time also, {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|2}}, under Captain [[Reginald F. Nicholson]], and {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-9|2}}, under Captain [[Frank E. Beatty]], were substituted for {{USS|Maine|BB-10|2}} and {{USS|Alabama|BB-8|2}}. In San Francisco, {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22|2}} was brought forward into First Squadron, First Division and {{USS|Louisiana|BB-19|2}} took her place as flagship, Second Squadron.

Leaving that port on 7 July 1908 the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] visited [[Honolulu]]; [[Auckland]], New Zealand; [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], Australia;&lt;!--map shows another stop in Australia; who's right?--&gt; [[Manila]], Philippines; [[Yokohama]], Japan; and [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]]; then arriving at [[Suez]], Egypt, on 3 January 1909.

While the fleet was in Egypt, word was received of an earthquake in [[Sicily]], thus affording an opportunity for the United States to show its friendship to Italy by offering aid to the sufferers. ''Connecticut'', {{USS|Illinois|BB-7|2}}, {{USS|Culgoa|AF-3|2}}, and {{USS|Yankton|1893|2}} were dispatched to [[Messina, Italy]], at once. The crew of ''Illinois'' recovered the bodies of the American [[Consul (representative)|consul]], Arthur S. Cheney, and his wife, entombed in the ruins.

{{USS|Scorpion|PY-3|2}}, the fleet's station ship at [[Constantinople]], and {{USS|Celtic|AF-2|2}}, a refrigerator ship fitted out in [[New York (state)|New York]], were hurried to Messina, relieving ''Connecticut'' and ''Illinois'', so that they could continue on the cruise.

Leaving Messina on 9 January 1909, the fleet stopped at [[Naples]], Italy, thence to [[Gibraltar]], arriving at Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. There, President Roosevelt reviewed the fleet as it passed into the roadstead.

==Experience gained==
The cruise of the Great White Fleet provided practical experience for US naval personnel in sea duty and ship handling. It also showed the viability of US warships for long-range operations as no major mechanical mishaps occurred. However, while the cruise uncovered design flaws, it did not test the abilities to engage in battle fleet action. In fact, the success of the deployment might have helped obscure design deficiencies that were not addressed until [[World War I]]. These included excessive draft, low armor belts, large turret openings and exposed ammunition hoists.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=6}}

==Effects on US capital ship design==
While the capital ships of the Great White Fleet were already obsolescent in light of the "big gun" revolution ushered in by the construction of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, their behavior at sea furnished valuable information that affected future construction. For instance, in terms of seaworthiness, all the capital ships in the fleet proved wet in all but the calmest seas, which led to the flared bows of subsequent U.S. battleships, increased freeboard forward and such spray-reducing measures as the elimination of billboards for anchors and gun [[sponson]]s. Increased freeboard was needed; this and related considerations demanded increases in beam and overall size. Between the {{sclass-|Florida|battleship|1}}s, the last American capital ships completed before data from the cruise became available, and the {{sclass-|Wyoming|battleship|4}}, the first designed after this data was received, displacement (and, as a result, cost) per ship increased by one third.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=75–85}}

[[File:Kosmos esquadra americana 2.jpg|thumb|12 January 1908 – Arrival at Rio de Janeiro – Fleet enters Guanabara Bay]]Deficiencies in seaworthiness in turn reduced the battle-worthiness of the fleet. Turret heights for main armament proved too low and needed to be raised. Secondary armament was useless at speed and especially in tradewind conditions (with the wind moving over the sea at {{convert|10|kn|km/h}} or greater) and needed to be moved much higher in the hull. Improved placement began with the ''Wyoming''-class battleships and was further refined in the {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}. Casemates for the bow 3-inch guns in the newer pre-dreadnoughts were untenable due to wetness and were removed. Another discovery was that, even when fully loaded, the bottom of the battleships' side armor was visible—and the ships thus vulnerable to shells that might hit beneath it to reach their machinery and magazines—in smooth to moderate seas. The profile of crests and troughs in some ships contributed to this problem. Admiral Evans concluded that the standard {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} width of belt armor was inadequate.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=75–9}}

One other necessity the cruise outlined was the need for tactical homogeneity. Before the cruise, critics such as then-Captain [[William Sims]] (to whom President Roosevelt listened) had argued that American warship design had remained too conservative and precluded the level of efficiency needed for the fleet to function as an effective unit. The cruise proved the charge true. This would eventually lead to the building of [[standard type battleship]]s in the U.S. Navy. When President Roosevelt convened the 1908 Newport Conference of the [[Naval War College]], he placed responsibility for U.S. battleship design on the [[General Board of the United States Navy]]. This gave line officers and planners direct input and control over warship design, a pattern which has persisted to the present day.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=75, 82}}

==Effects on fleet operations==
Experience gained by the cruise led to improvements in formation steaming, coal economy and morale. Gunnery exercises doubled the fleet's accuracy. However, the mission also underlined the fleet's dependence on foreign colliers and the need for coaling stations and auxiliary ships for coaling and resupply.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=6}}

Early estimates on the volume spilled ranged around {{convert|11000000|USbbl|m3|sigfig=2}}..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.

The slick reached a maximum size of {{convert|101|mi|km|sigfig=2}} by {{convert|42|mi|km|sigfig=2}} and was 5&amp;nbsp;inches (13&amp;nbsp;cm) thick in some areas. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the size of the spill, figures place it several times &lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/47965000/gif/_47965679_oil_spills_comp_466.gif&lt;/ref&gt; the size (by volume) of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]].

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that a 1993 study sponsored by [[UNESCO]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and the [[United States]] found the spill did "little long-term damage": About half the oil evaporated, {{convert|1000000|USbbl|m3|sigfig=2}} were recovered and {{convert|2000000|USbbl|m3|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|3000000|USbbl|m3|sigfig=2}} washed ashore, mainly in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

More recent scientific studies have tended to disagree with this assessment. Marshlands and mud tidal flats continued to contain large quantities of oil, over nine years later, and full recovery is likely to take decades.

Dr. [[Jacqueline Michel]], US geochemist (2010 interview – transcript of radio broadcast):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/node/11782/popout |title=Lessons learned from Gulf War oil spill|publisher=[[Public Radio International]]|work=[[The World (radio program)]]|date= |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The long term effects were very significant.  There was no shoreline cleanup, essentially, over the 800 kilometers that the oil – - in Saudi Arabia.  And so when we went back in to do quantitative survey in 2002 and 2003, there was a million cubic meters of oil sediment remained then 12 years after the spill.... [T]he oil penetrated much more deeply into the intertidal sediment than normal because those sediments there have a lot of crab burrows, and the oil penetrated deep, sometimes 30, 40 centimeters, you know a couple of feet, into the mud of these tidal flats.  There’s no way to get it out now.  So it has had long term impact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Hans-Jörg Barth, German geographer (2001 research report):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_III/Geographie/phygeo/downloads/barthcoast.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Gulfreport.d |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609023739/http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_III/Geographie/phygeo/downloads/barthcoast.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The study demonstrated that, in contrary to previously published reports e.g. already 1993 by [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]], several coastal areas even in 2001 still show significant oil impact and in some places no recovery at all. The salt marshes which occur at almost 50% of the coastline show the heaviest impact compared to the other ecosystem types after 10 years. Completely recovered are the rocky shores and mangroves. Sand beaches are on the best way to complete recovery. The main reason for the delayed recovery of the salt marshes is the absence of physical energy (wave action) and the mostly anaerobic milieu of the oiled substrates. The latter is mostly caused by [[cyanobacteria]] which forms impermeable mats. In other cases tar crusts are responsible. The availability of oxygen is the most important criteria for oil degradation. Where oil degrades it was obvious that benthic intertidal fauna such as crabs re-colonise the destroyed habitats long before the [[halophytes]]. The most important paths of regeneration are the tidal channels and the adjacent areas. Full recovery of the salt marshes will certainly need some centuries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'', in reference to the April 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in the Gulf of Mexico, cited the 1993 optimistic assessment of the Gulf War oil spill as evidence that "Initial warnings of catastrophic environmental damage from oil spills can turn out to be overdone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Iron(II) oxide''' or '''ferrous oxide''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula FeO.  Its mineral form is known as [[wüstite]]. One of several [[iron oxide]]s, it is a black-colored powder that is sometimes confused with [[rust]], the latter of which consists of hydrated [[iron(III) oxide]] (ferric oxide). Iron(II) oxide also refers to a family of related [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, which are typically iron deficient with compositions ranging from Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.84&lt;/sub&gt;O to Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
FeO can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of [[iron(II) oxalate]]. 
:FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   FeO  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CO
The procedure is conducted under an inert atmosphere to avoid the formation of [[ferric oxide]].  A similar procedure can also be used for the synthesis of [[manganous oxide]] and [[stannous oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Lux "Iron (II) Oxide" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 1497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Practical Chemistry for Advanced Students, Arthur Sutcliffe, 1930 (1949 Ed.), John Murray - London&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoichiometric FeO can be prepared by heating Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O with metallic iron at 770&amp;nbsp;°C and 36&amp;nbsp;kbar.&lt;ref name = "Wells"&gt;Wells A.F. (1984) ''Structural Inorganic Chemistry'' 5th edition Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-855370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
FeO is thermodynamically unstable below 575&amp;nbsp;°C, tending to disproportionate to metal and [[iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]:&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;
:4FeO &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Fe + Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

==Structure==
Iron(II) oxide adopts the cubic, [[sodium chloride|rock salt]] structure, where iron atoms are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms and the oxygen atoms octahedrally coordinated by iron atoms. The non-stoichiometry occurs because of the ease of oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; effectively replacing a small portion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; with two thirds their number of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, which take up tetrahedral positions in the close packed oxide lattice.&lt;ref name="Wells" /&gt;

Below 200&amp;nbsp;K there is a minor change to the structure which changes the symmetry to rhombohedral and samples become [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]].&lt;ref name="Wells" /&gt;

==Occurrence in nature==
Iron(II) oxide makes up approximately 9% of the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Within the mantle, it may be electrically conductive, which is a possible explanation for perturbations in Earth's rotation not accounted for by accepted models of the mantle's properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/01/electric-material-in-mantle-coul.html?ref=hp ''Science'' Jan 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124011327/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/01/electric-material-in-mantle-coul.html?ref=hp |date=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Limestone building with pollution.jpg|thumb|left|Iron III hydroxide staining caused by oxidation of dissolved iron II and precipitation, [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]].]]
Iron dissolved in [[groundwater]] is in the reduced iron II form. If this groundwater comes in contact with oxygen at the surface, e.g. in natural [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], iron II is oxidised to iron III and forms insoluble hydroxides in water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lenntech.com/groundwater/iron.htm lenntech.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Iron(II) oxide is used as a [[pigment]]. It is [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved for use in cosmetics and it is used in some [[tattoo]] inks.  It can also be used as a phosphate remover from home aquaria.

The '''Las Cruces Biological Station / Wilson Botanical Garden''' is located in the southern [[Puntarenas]] [[province]] of [[Costa Rica]],  and is the newest of the three [[research station]]s operated by the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] (OTS).  Las Cruces includes a biological research station, tourist facilities, and the botanical gardens started by Robert and Catherine Wilson, and bequeathed to OTS.&lt;ref name="CRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson Botanical Gardens from CostaRicaGuide.com|url=http://costa-rica-guide.com/parks/wilson.htm|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heliconia hirsuta 1zz.jpg|thumb|A ''Heliconia hirsuta'' in the botanical garden of the station]]

Las Cruces is located in a mountainous region at an elevation of approximately 1,000 [[meters above sea level]] (m.a.s.l.).  Surrounded mostly by [[pastures]], [[Coffee_in_the_global_economy#Coffee_and_the_environment|coffee plantation]]s and other [[Farmland (farming)|agricultural areas]], Las Cruces includes a relatively small 270 Ha [[forest fragmentation|forest fragment]] that ranges from 900–1300 m.a.s.l.  As such, much of the research conducted here focuses on [[agroecology]] or studies of [[forest fragmentation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14727">Below is a list of [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag beaches and marinas]] in Wales, sorted by regulatory body. As of July 2013, 38 locations had been designated by the internationally recognised [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] based in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueflag.org/menu/awarded-sites/2013/northern-hemisphere/wales The Welsh page on the Blue Flag website]&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation awards, or removes, beaches and marinas from their list each July.

The 2013 figure is down from 41&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwrcymru.com/en/Environment/Green-Sea-Partnership.aspx A mention of the 2011 awards on the Welsh Water website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130121231803/http://www.dwrcymru.com/en/Environment/Green-Sea-Partnership.aspx |date=2013-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; beaches in 2011 and 43 beaches in 2012. The reduced number was due to stricter [[water quality]] criteria being used, coupled with the fact that 2012 was a wet year in the country meaning that there were more naturally occurring [[bacteria]] present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22529782 A BBC news article on the decline]&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the larger countries of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] had 55&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-22614601 A BBC news article announcing England's Blue Flag beaches]&lt;/ref&gt; and 3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/only-three-scottish-beaches-are-blue-flag-winners-1-2960807 Article from The Scotsman about the awards]&lt;/ref&gt; beaches listed and no marinas. The Welsh organisation [[Keep Wales Tidy]] helps to keep the beaches in good condition as well as running two separate sets of awards - the Green Coast Award and the Seaside Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepwalestidy.org/welsh-beaches Keep Wales Tidy's beach page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the beaches and marinas are located on the [[Wales Coast Path]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walescoastpath.gov.uk/about_the_path.aspx Information about the Coast Path on its official page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first of what would become many notable '''mountain lists''' around the world was [[Sir Hugh Munro]]’s catalogue of the [[Munro]]s, the peaks above 3,000’ in [[Scotland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Munros|publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Trust|editor-first=Donald|editor-last=Bennet|isbn=0-907521-13-4|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once defined the list became a popular target for what became known as [[peak bagging]], where the adventurous attempted to summit all of the peaks on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=95 Peak Lists from around the world|url=http://peakery.com/peaks/lists/|publisher=Peakery|accessdate=2015-05-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426105835/http://peakery.com/peaks/lists/|archivedate=2015-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over time the peaks on such lists grew more challenging.  An example is the [[Seven Summits]], defined as the highest peaks on each of the seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bass|first1=Dick|last2=Wells|first2=Frank|last3=Ridgeway|first3=Rick|title=Seven Summits|publisher=Warner Books|year=1986|isbn=0-446-51312-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable lists of mountains are shown below.

'''Marine Well Containment Company''' (MWCC) is an independent company with headquarters in [[Houston, Texas]]. The company provides well containment equipment and technology in the deepwater U.S. [[Gulf of Mexico]] and "is committed to advancing its capabilities and technologies to keep pace with its members' evolving needs". MWCC's mission is to be continuously ready to respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

==History==

In response to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] of 2010, [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[ConocoPhillips]] and [[Shell Oil]] committed to providing a new containment response capability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drillingcontractor.org/expanded-system-to-enhance-mwcc-containment-capacity-26588 Expanded system to enhance MWCC containment capacity] Retrieved 2016-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; These founding companies of MWCC recognized the need to be better prepared in the event of a deepwater well control incident. As a result of unprecedented industry collaboration, MWCC introduced the Interim Containment System in February 2011, improving previous response capabilities and helping the industry get back to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015, MWCC accepted its Expanded Containment System forming the MWCC Containment System which builds upon the past system capabilities.

==Capabilities==
The Containment System is available for use in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico in depths from 500 feet to 10,000 feet, temperatures up to {{convert|350|°F|°C}} and pressures up to 15k psi. The system can cap or cap and flow an incident well and has the capacity to process up to 100,000 barrels of liquid per day and up to 200&amp;nbsp;million cubic feet of gas per day. Additionally, it is able to store up to 700,000 barrels of liquid in each of its two Modular Capture Vessels. The liquid is then brought onshore for further processing via shuttle tankers.

MWCC maintains components of the Containment System in a ready state at two shore base locations along the U.S. Gulf Coast and conducts drills and training sessions on a regular basis to ensure personnel and equipment are ready to respond. TechnipFMC and Kiewitt Offshore Services (KOS) are MWCC's two main contractors. TechnipFMC manages and operates the subsea containment system at SURF shore base in Theodore, Alabama.  KOS operates the MCV shore base at Ingleside, Texas. The Containment System is designed to be flexible, adaptable and ready to be mobilized upon incident notification.

==Member companies==

MWCC currently has 10 member companies: [[Anadarko Petroleum]], [[Apache Corporation]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[BP]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Hess Corporation]], [[Shell Oil]], and [[Statoil]]. Member companies are committed to deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and a majority of wells drilled in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico are operated by these members. Membership remains open to all oil and gas operators in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="993">In [[petroleum engineering]], a '''minipermeameter''' is a [[gas]]-based device for measuring [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] in [[Porosity|porous]] rocks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5373727.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Minipermeametry has been used in the oil industry since the late 1960s (Eijpe and Weber, 1971) without becoming in any way a standard experimental method in core analysis or reservoir characterisation. The laboratory minipermeametry can make important contributions both as an improved methodology within experimental petrophysics and as a source of data invaluable in routine reservoir characterisation (C. HALVORSEN AND A. HURST, 1990)

The values obtained from the minipermeameter should possibly be calibrated by a [[Klinkenberg correction]]

Any action or influence that [[species]] have on each other is considered a [[Biological interactions| biological interaction]]. These interactions between species can be considered in several ways. One such way is to depict interactions in the form of a network, which identifies the members and the patterns that connect them. Species interactions are considered primarily in terms of [[food chain|trophic interactions]], which depict which species feed on others.

Currently, [[ecological network]]s that integrate non-trophic interactions are being built. The type of interactions they can contain can be classified into six categories: [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], neutralism, [[amensalism]], [[predation|antagonism]], and [[competition (biology)|competition]].

Observing and estimating the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs and benefits of species interactions can be very problematic. The way interactions are interpreted can profoundly affect the ensuing conclusions.

==Interaction characteristics==
Characterization of interactions can be made according to various measures, or any combination of them.

*Prevalence
Prevalence identifies the proportion of the population affected by a given interaction, and thus quantifies whether it is relatively rare or common. Generally, only common interactions are considered.
*Negative/ Positive
Whether the interaction is beneficial or harmful to the species involved determines the sign of the interaction, and what type of interaction it is classified as. To establish whether they are harmful or beneficial, careful observational and/or experimental studies can be conducted, in an attempt to establish the cost/benefit balance experienced by the members.
*Strength
The sign of an interaction does not capture the impact on [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of that interaction. One example of this is of antagonism, in which [[predation|predators ]]  may have a much stronger impact on their prey species (death), than [[parasite|parasites ]] (reduction in fitness). Similarly, positive interactions can produce anything from a negligible change in fitness to a life or death impact.
*Relationship in space and time
The relationship in space and time is not currently considered within a network structure, though it has been observed by [[natural history|naturalists ]] for centuries. It would be highly informative to include geographical proximity, duration, and seasonal patterns of interactions into network analysis.

==Importance of interactions==
In the same way that a [[trophic cascade]] can occur, it is expected that 'interaction cascades' take place. Thus, it should be possible to construct 'effect' networks which parallel in many ways the energy or matter networks common in the literature. By assessing the network topology and constructing models, we might better understand how interacting species affect each other and how these effects spread through the network. In certain instances, it has been shown that indirect trophic effects tend to dominate direct ones (Patten, 1995)—perhaps this pattern will also emerge in non-trophic interactions.

==Keystone species==
By analyzing network structures, one can determine [[keystone species]] that are of particular importance.
A different class of keystone species is what are termed 'ecosystem engineers'. Certain organisms alter the environment so drastically that it affects many interactions that take place within a habitat. This term is used for organisms that "directly or indirectly modulate availability of resources (other than themselves) to other species, by causing physical state changes in [[biotic factors|biotic]] or [[abiotic components|abiotic]] materials". [[beaver|Beavers ]] are an example of such engineers. Other examples include earthworms, trees, coral reefs, and planktonic organisms. Such 'network engineers' can be seen as "interaction modifiers", meaning that a change in their [[population density]] affects the interactions between two or more other species.

==Interesting examples==
Certain interactions may be particularly problematic to understand. These may include
*[[Wolbachia]]
*Beneficial [[endosymbionts]]
*[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vectors]]
*[[Virus]]es

==Criticisms==
*Can the complexities of biology ever be captured in schematics?
*How do we accurately detect and evaluate non-visible interactions?
*How much predictive power do these networks have for population dynamics?

'''Photoluminescence excitation''' (abbreviated '''PLE''') is a specific type of [[photoluminescence]] and concerns the interaction between [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[matter]]. It is used in [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic measurements]] where the frequency of the excitation light is varied, and the [[luminescence]] is monitored at the typical emission frequency of the material being studied. Peaks in the PLE spectra often represent absorption lines of the material. PLE spectroscopy is a useful method to investigate the electronic level structure of materials with low absorption&lt;ref name="Photoluminesence excitation application IGaPh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=A.M.|title=Applications of photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy to the study of indium gallium phosphide alloys|journal=J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.|year=1970|volume=3|issue=9|pages=1322|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3727/3/9/312|bibcode = 1970JPhD....3.1322W |doi = 10.1088/0022-3727/3/9/312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the superior [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of the method compared to absorption measurements.

==Physical process==
In a quantum-mechanical description of matter, the electrons confined to a material (such as those in individual atoms, molecules or crystals) are limited to a discrete set of energy values. The ground state of such a material system is such that the most energetic electron has its minimal energy. In photoluminescence, energy is transferred from light incident on the material and absorbed to electrons. The light is absorbed in minimal "quanta" or "packets" of energy of the electromagnetic radiation called [[photon]]s. The amount of energy carried by a photon is proportional to its frequency. The electron is then in an excited state of higher energy. Such states are not stable and with time the material system will return to its ground state and the electron will lose its energy. Luminescence is the process whereby light is emitted when the electron drops to a lower energy level.

Often when a photon is absorbed, the system is excited in the corresponding excited state, then it relaxes in an intermediate lower energy state, with a "non-radiative relaxation" (a relaxation that doesn't involve the emission of a photon, but e.g. involves the emission of vibrational energy) and then there is the emission of a photon with a lower energy than the absorbed one, because of the relaxation from the intermediate, lower energy state to the "ground state". Usually the strongest luminescence of the material is from the lower levels to the ground state. This process is called [[fluorescence]]. For instance, in [[semiconductors]], most of the light emitted is at the frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy, i.e. from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band. In such systems, more light absorbed by the material, results in more electrons decaying non-radiatively to the lower states, and more luminescence in the emission wavelength.

&lt;!---- SHOULD ADD ==Experimental arrangement==
A typical experimental setup for PLE spectroscopy has either a tunable laser or a broadband light source (such as a halogen lamp) followed by a [[monochromator]], which select the frequency of the excitation light. Light is then usually focused onto a sample, and a collection lens collects the luminescence. The luminescence is then spectrally filtered at the emission wavelength of the material with a spectrometer or an additional monochromator and detector.----&gt;

The '''Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act''' ('''PURPA''', {{USStatute|95|617|92|3117|1978|11|9}}) is a [[United States]] [[Act of Congress|Act]] passed as part of the [[National Energy Act]]. It was meant to promote energy conservation (reduce demand) and promote greater use of domestic [[energy]] and [[renewable energy]] (increase supply). The law was created in response to the [[1973 energy crisis]], and one year in advance of a [[1979 energy crisis|second energy crisis]].

Upon entering the White House, President Jimmy Carter made energy policy a top priority. The law started the energy industry on the road to restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/past/history4.htm|title=The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act|website=Smithsonian Museum of American History|accessdate=12 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) encouraged 
* creating a market for power from non-utility power producers
* increased efficiency by making use of cogeneration
* ending promotional rate structures
* encouraging the development of hydroelectric power 
* the conservation of electric energy and natural gas

==Non-utility power producers==

Energy companies were classified as [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]], and for this reason, most were established with vertically integrated structures (that is, they undertook all the functions of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to the customer). Utilities became protected as regulated monopolies because it was thought that a company could produce power more efficiently and economically as one company than as several.

PURPA started the industry on the road to restructuring and is one of the first laws that began the [[NERC Tag#Electric Deregulation in North America|deregulation]] of energy companies. The provision which enabled non-utility generators ("NUGs") to produce power for use by customers attached to a utility's grid broke the previous monopoly in the generation function.&lt;ref name="smithpow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/dereg/dereg1.htm|title=	
Restructuring or Deregulation?|website=Smithsonian Museum of American History|accessdate=12 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ending Promotional Rate Structure==

Utilities offered customers a "rate structure" that decreased the cost per kWh price of electricity with increasing usage, with subsequent increments costing less per unit. PURPA eliminated promotional rate structures except when they could be justified by the cost structure of utility companies.&lt;ref name="smithpow" /&gt;

==Cogeneration==
One provision of PURPA is the requirement for increased use of energy [[cogeneration]]. The law forced [[Electric utility|electric utilities]] to buy power from other more efficient producers, such as cogeneration plants, if that cost was less than the utility's own "avoided cost" rate to the consumer; the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself, or if available, could purchase its demand requirements from another source.  At the time generally, where demand was growing, this "avoided cost" was considered to be the construction and [[fossil fuel]] costs incurred in the operation of another [[thermal power plant]].

As an effect, the number of cogeneration plants, which produce electric power and steam, increased. These plants are encouraged by the law, on the basis that they harness thermal energy (in the form of usable steam) that would be otherwise wasted if electricity alone was produced. PURPA also became the basic legislation that enabled renewable energy providers to gain a toehold in the market, particularly in California, where state authorities were more aggressive in their interpretation of the statute. The portion of the act dealing with cogeneration and small power production appears in US code in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050724153509/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/16C12.txt Title 16 – Conservation], Chapter 12 – Federal Regulation and Development of Power, Subchapter II – Regulation of Electric Utility Companies Engaged in Interstate Commerce, Sec 824a-3 – Cogeneration and Small Power Production.

This led to the establishment of a new class of generating facilities, which would receive special rate and regulatory treatment. Generating facilities in this group are known as '''''qualifying facilities (QFs)''''', and fall into two categories: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/gen-info/qual-fac/what-is.asp Link text], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable Energy and Hydropower==

PURPA provided favorable terms to companies that produced electricity from renewable (non-fossil-fuel) resources.&lt;ref name="smithpow" /&gt;

==Implementation==

Although a Federal law, PURPA's implementation was left to the [[States Rights|individual states]], because needs varied; a variety of regulatory regimes developed in states where renewable power resources were needed, available for development, or the generated power could be [[Electric power transmission|transmitted]]. Little was done in many states where such resources were unavailable, where the demand growth was slower or previously accommodated in planning.

==Legacy==
PURPA is becoming less important, as many of the contracts made under it during the 1980s are expiring.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Another reason for PURPA's reduced significance is that [[NERC Tag#Electric Deregulation in North America|electric deregulation]] and open access to electricity transportation by utilities has created a vast market for the purchase of energy and State regulatory agencies have therefore stopped forcing utilities to give contracts to developers of non-utility power projects.  However, it is still an important piece of legislation promoting renewable energy because it exempts the developers of such projects from numerous State and Federal regulatory regimes.

This [[free market]] approach presented investment opportunity and government encouragement for more development of environment-friendly, renewable energy projects and technologies; the law created a market in which non-utility [[Independent Power Producer]]s developed, and some energy market players [[Enron scandal|failed]].

Critics of PURPA cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high. When oil prices went down, utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts, leading to high power prices.&lt;ref name="conc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/strengthen-policy/public-utility-regulatory.html|title=Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA)|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=12 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PURPA was the only existing federal law that requires competition in the utility industry and the only law that encourages renewables, if it is cost competitive with conventional polluting resources.&lt;ref name="conc" /&gt;

==Amendment proposals and new legislation==
In February 2005, Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] from [[Vermont]] introduced an [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-427 amendment] to PURPA calling for a [[Renewable portfolio standard]].

PURPA was amended in 2005 by the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] by sections 1251 through 1254. There is pending legislation{{When|date=August 2009}} in the US Senate that would amend PURPA to require FERC to develop standards for interconnection of [[distributed generation]] facilities, and that would require "electric utilities" meeting the PURPA size requirement (retail sales of more than 500 million kw hrs) to implement those standards.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

One proposed law that would amend PURPA is the [[Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (H.R. 267; 113th Congress)|Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (H.R. 267)]].  The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] of the [[113th United States Congress]] on January 15, 2013, and it passed the House on February 13, 2013 by a vote of 422-0.  If enacted, the bill would change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding [[hydropower]] by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created.  According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants.  H.R. 267 would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly.  Section 3 of H.R. 267 amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to increase from 5,000 to 10,000 [[Kilowatt#Kilowatt|kilowatts]] the size of small [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] projects which the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] may exempt from its license requirements.&lt;ref name=267text&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Text – H.R. 267 – 113th Congress|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:H.R.267.RFS:/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the [[National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners]] (NARUC) made suggestions in a report that FERC should modernize PURPA for the energy sector. NARUC's paper "proposes that FERC exempt from PURPA’s mandatory purchase obligation those utilities which are subject to state competitive solicitation requirements and other best practices that ensure all technologies access to the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/reports/15536-naruc-urges-ferc-to-support-expanding-competitive-practices-under-purpa/|title=NARUC urges FERC to support expanding competitive practices under PURPA|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-10-22|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A pulsed energy weapon''' is any weapon that:
* uses pulses of electricity to fire a projectile, or
* operates by transferring electric current to its target.
These weapons often use large [[capacitor]]s to build up a charge which is released when the weapon is fired. Large high-end systems sometimes use [[compulsator]]s which store energy using rotational inertia. Weapons which do not use projectiles, such as the stun gun and laser gun, do not need any ammunition other than a power source.

== Common pulsed energy weapons ==

* [[Taser]] - A combination of a conventional weapon &amp; electrical weapon
* [[Electroshock weapon|Stun gun]]

== Experimental pulsed energy weapons ==

* [[Railgun]]
* [[Coilgun]]
* Certain [[laser]]s

== Fictional pulsed energy weapons ==

* Some [[raygun]]s and [[plasma rifle]]s
* [[Leyden ball]] rifles, of [[Jules Verne]] origin
* Weapons mounted on space ships in the [[Star Trek universe]]
* Most weapons used by advanced species in the [[Stargate|Stargate universe]]
* The most common weapon type in the ''[[Farscape]]'' television series

'''Qantas Flight 1''' (QF1, QFA1) was a [[Qantas]] passenger flight between Sydney and London that was involved in a runway overrun accident at [[Don Mueang International Airport]] in Bangkok on 23 September 1999 as it was landing for a stopover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ATSB Boeing 747-438, VH-OJH Bangkok, Thailand | url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/1999/AAIR/pdf/aair199904538_001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flight ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[Qantas]] flights travel between London and Australia on a route known as the "[[Kangaroo Route]]". The Kangaroo Route traditionally refers to air routes flown between Australia and the United Kingdom, via the Eastern Hemisphere.

This flight was operated by a [[Boeing 747-400|Boeing 747-438]]{{efn|The aircraft was a Boeing 747-400 model; Boeing assigns a unique code for each company that buys one of its aircraft, which is applied as an [[infix]] to the model number at the time the aircraft is built, hence "747-438" denotes a 747-400 built for Qantas.}} [[manufacturer's serial number|S/N]] 24806, delivered new to Qantas in August 1990 and registered VH-OJH. It departed Sydney earlier that day at 16:45 local time, and after more than eight hours' flying was approaching [[Don Mueang International Airport]] at 22:45 local time.

== Accident ==
{{Citations missing|section|date=January 2018}}
During the approach to Bangkok the weather conditions deteriorated significantly, from 5 statute mile visibility half an hour before landing to nearly one half statute mile visibility at the time of landing.&lt;ref name="TMWK QANTAS"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Benns| first=Matthew| title=The Men Who Killed Qantas| publisher=William Heinemann:Australia| place=Sydney| year=2009| isbn=978-1-74166-891-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The flight crew observed a storm cloud over the airport and ground reports were that it was raining heavily. However, these conditions are common at Bangkok. Seven minutes prior to Flight 1's landing a [[Thai Airways International|Thai Airways]] [[Airbus A330]] landed normally, but three minutes before Flight 1's landing another Qantas Boeing 747 (QF15, a Sydney-Rome via Bangkok service), conducted a [[go-around]] due to poor visibility during final approach.&lt;ref name="TMWK QANTAS"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The crew of Qantas Flight 1, however, were unaware of this.

The first officer was flying the aircraft during final approach. The aircraft's altitude and airspeed were high, but were within company limits. The rain was now heavy enough that the runway lights were visible only intermittently after each windscreen wiper stroke. Just before touchdown the captain, concerned about the long touchdown point (over 3000 feet past the runway threshold) and unable to see the end of the runway, ordered the first officer to perform a "go-around" and the first officer advanced the throttles but did not engage the [[takeoff/Go-around switch]] (TO/GA). At this point visibility improved markedly and the landing gear contacted the runway, although the aircraft continued to accelerate. The captain then decided to cancel the go-around by retarding the thrust levers, even though he was not flying the aircraft. This caused confusion as he did not announce his actions to the first officer who still had formal control. When over-riding the first officer's actions, the captain inadvertently left one engine at TO/GA power and as a result cancelled the preselected auto-brake settings.

The landing continued, but manual braking did not commence until the aircraft was over 5,200 feet down the runway. The aircraft then began to [[Aquaplaning|aquaplane]] and skid its way down the runway, departing substantially from the runway centreline. Company [[standard operating procedure]]s mandated that idle reverse thrust should be used for landings and that flaps should be set at 25 degrees,&lt;ref name="TMWK QANTAS"/&gt;{{rp|17}} not the maximum of 30 degrees. The combination of flaps 25, no auto-braking, no reverse thrust, a high and fast approach, a late touch down, poor [[Cockpit Resource Management]], and the standing water on the runway led to a runway overshoot.

The aircraft gradually decelerated, ran off the end of the runway over a stretch of boggy grassland, colliding with a ground radio antenna as it did so, and came to rest with its nose resting on the perimeter road. The ground on the other side of the road forms part of a golf course.

There were no significant passenger injuries during an orderly evacuation of the aircraft carried out some 20 minutes after the rough landing. Thirty-eight passengers reported minor injuries. 

===Damage===
The collision with the antenna caused the nose and right wing landing gear to collapse, the nose landing gear being forced back into the fuselage. The aircraft slid along in a nose-down, right wing low attitude, causing some further damage to the nose and damage to the two right engines and their mountings. The intrusion of the nose landing gear also caused the failure of the cabin intercom and public address system.

The damage was such that the aircraft was initially a write-off, but to preserve its reputation Qantas had it repaired at a cost of [[Australian dollar|$]]100 million.&lt;ref name=Nancarrow&gt;{{cite book |last=Nancarrow |first=Doug |date=2015 |title=Game Changer |location=Sydney |publisher=HarperCollins Australia |page=163 |isbn=978 1 4607 5044 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luck |first=Geoffrey |url=http://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2011/01-02/how-qantas-became-the-safest-airline/|title=How Qantas Became the Safest Airline|website=Quadrant |publisher=''Quadrant'' Magazine Ltd |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By returning the aircraft to service, Qantas was able to retain its record of having no [[hull-loss]] accidents since the advent of the [[Jet Age]].&lt;ref name=Nancarrow/&gt;{{efn|There have been several [[List of Qantas fatal accidents|fatal crashes of Qantas aircraft]], all of them propeller-driven.

The '''Ram pickup''' (formerly the '''Dodge Ram pickup''') is a full-size [[pickup truck]] manufactured by [[Chrysler|FCA US LLC]] (formerly Chrysler Group LLC) and marketed as of 2011 onwards under the '''[[Ram Trucks]]''' brand. The current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|'''fifth-generation Ram''']] debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan.

Previously, Ram was part of the [[Dodge]] line of light trucks. The name ''Ram'' was first used in 1932–1954 Dodge Trucks, then returned on the redesigned 1981 Ram and Power Ram, following the retiring and rebadging of the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks as well as B-series vans.

Ram trucks have been named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] five times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram ''Heavy Duty'' won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014.

The first-generation Ram trucks and vans introduced in 1981 featured a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 to 1954.&lt;ref name="ED-DRG"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram - Generations |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=John |last=DiPietro |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on [[four-wheel-drive]] models. Dodge kept the previous generation's model designations: "D" or ''Ram'' indicated [[two-wheel drive]] while "W" or ''Power Ram'' indicated [[four-wheel drive]]. Just like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Dodge used 150 to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, "Club" extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with {{convert|6.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} bed lengths and "Utiline" and "Sweptline" styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]], dual rectangular [[headlamp]]s, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|225 Slant-6]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|360 V8s]]. The interior was updated and included a new bench seat and a completely new dashboard and instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design - a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the Sno Commander).

The "Club Cab" was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 [[Dodge Dakota]], and were never reintroduced in this generation.

Basic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous "Miser" trim level available on the Ram 150. A "Ram-Trac" shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985's Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine was replaced by a {{convert|3.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler LA engine#239|V6]] engine. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine also received [[electronic fuel injection]] in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new "message center" with four small rectangular light spots, contained the [[check engine light]] and other [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tales]] including one for the parking brake and the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included "Wait to Start" and "Water in Fuel" lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/80s-codes.html |title=Retrieving fault codes |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became standard equipment in 1989.

The Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the [[ammeter]] was replaced by a [[voltmeter]] while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also in 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991-1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver's doors, as there were no rear doors for this configuration.

These trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the [[Ford F-Series]] and the [[Chevrolet C/K|General Motors C/K Trucks]], with just under 100,000 units sold most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, there was no powerful diesel option until 1989, and there was no big-block gas V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since 1981.

===Engines &amp; transmissions===
For 1989, the 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 received throttle-body [[fuel injection]] for a 20&amp;nbsp;hp (15&amp;nbsp;kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new [[Torqueflite|overdrive automatic transmission]] for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 and 5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8. An "O/D Off" pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The [[TorqueFlite#A727 .2836RH.2F37RH.29|A727 automatic]] saw continued use for some 5.2&amp;nbsp;L engines, all 5.9&amp;nbsp;L engines, and heavy-duty applications.

The grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular [[headlamp]]s and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially [[Chrysler LA engine|upgraded]] for 1992 (3.9&amp;nbsp;L and 5.2&amp;nbsp;L) 1993 and 1994 (5.9&amp;nbsp;L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly-revised engines were marketed under the "Magnum" name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the [[TorqueFlite#A518 .2846RH.2F46RE.29|A518]] was offered with the 5.2&amp;nbsp;L and 5.9&amp;nbsp;L engines. As part of Chrysler's overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial "4" signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission's relative torque capacity, the letter "R" in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter "H" signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.

====5.9 Cummins====
[[File: 1993 Dodge Ram W250 Club Cab 4x4 Cummins td.jpg|thumb|1993 W250 Club Cab]]
A [[Cummins B Series engine]] was also added to the engine lineup in 1989.&lt;ref name="AllparCummins"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/cummins-diesel.html |title=Cummins 5.9-liter and 6.7-liter inline six-cylinder diesel engines |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Dodge saw sales increase. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the [[TorqueFlite#A727|A727 automatic]] or a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option was different from the optional diesels in Ford and GM trucks. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature [[indirect injection]]; this also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on [[glowplug]]s. The Cummins is a [[straight-six engine]], whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], while the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.2&amp;nbsp;L GM/DDC]] and [[International Harvester IDI|7.3 IDI Ford/IH]] are [[naturally aspirated]].&lt;ref name="AllparCummins"/&gt;

Pre-1994 Cummins-engined Dodge pickups are often termed a "1st Gen Cummins".

This was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option. The 1978 and 1979 D-Series models were available with a Mitsubishi naturally-aspirated diesel, but it was seldom ordered.&lt;ref name="AllparCummins"/&gt;

In the middle of 1991, Dodge started using 350 frames in Ram 250 diesels, club cabs and crew cabs. http://1stgen.org/viewtopic.php?t=5143

*'''Prospector''' - Prospector was a package available throughout the 1980s that usually included a different fuel tank, cloth seat and carpeting. In the late 80s, a light package as well as the large 6x9 mirrors were added to the list of options.

The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the "Louisville Slugger" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.&lt;ref name="Jalopnik"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modular design was scrapped in 1987 and was replaced with a more conventional truck design when the design was moved to the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] design studio.&lt;ref name="Jalopnik"/&gt; The more conventional design, dubbed "Phoenix", was originally scheduled for a 1991 production; when Bob Lutz showed it to the new styling designers, chief designer Phillip E. Payne told him, "It looks like nothing more than a rehash of everybody else's truck." At that, Lutz told him he had six months to come up with something better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/07/21/design-notes-1994-dodge-ram-truck/ |title=Design Notes: 1994 Dodge Ram Truck |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior styling of the truck that was eventually released was the result of design concepts by Payne during 1988-1990. A review by the Dodge pick-up truck studio designers felt that modern pick-ups looked "too flat and sedan-like", while the [[Studebaker E-series truck|early 50's Studebaker pick-up]] and the [[semi-trailer truck]]s had just the right "macho" look to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=29&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=%22dodge+ram%22&amp;OS=%22dodge+ram%22&amp;RS=%22dodge+ram%22 |title=U.S. Patent D396,828 - Body Styling of 1994 Dodge Ram |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=August 11, 1998 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was nothing like the current Ford or Chevy/GMC pickups in design. The Dodge Ram Pick-up was selected as "Truck of the Year" for 1994.

The redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success, with sales rocketing from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures were below those of Ford and Chevy trucks.

Engine offerings continued over from the first-generation Ram and were the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6, 5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8, 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8, and 5.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] Cummins turbo diesel. Added to the line up was a new 488 cubic inch 8.0L V10 engine designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel. The new [[V10 engine|V10]] and Cummins turbo diesel could only be had in the 2500 and higher designation models. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel one-ton in both 2- and 4-wheel drive. 1500 Rams offered both 6.5- and 8-foot (2 and 2.4 m, respectively) boxes. 2500 Rams offered {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} boxes with club or quad Cabs.

Dodge offered the 2500 series in two different gross-vehicle-weight ratings for the first few years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]], while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full-floating]].

On the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat. The dash and gauge cluster were a far cry from the previous model Ram and were far more modern as well. A redesign of the dashboard and instrument cluster was introduced in 1998 along with the introduction of the quad cab, and rounded black plastic side-view mirrors replaced the previous rectangular design.

===1998 updates===
In 1998, Dodge introduced the "Quad Cab", which uses smaller, "suicide" doors directly behind the main doors. This was offered as an option on the "Club Cab" for this model year. Other changes for 1998 included rounded mirrors replacing the classic square ones, a revised interior, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights/ and a digital [[odometer]]. The [[OBD II]] System was also standard, with a computer port near the driver's-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital [[odometer]] readout.

In late 1998 Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens [[headlamp]]s, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel variants in late 2000 for the 2001 model year.
A small percentage of the diesel engines for 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems within the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the "53" stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself.
The 2000 models became optional with heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Offroad Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17x8 wheels, 275/70/17 all terrain tires, 4.10 gears, trussed Dana 44 in the front, limited slip differential, and skid plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/ram1.html |title=200 Dodge Ram specifications |publisher=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Offroad Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional decal on the tailgate under the 4x4 decal that says "Offroad."

Although Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the old second-generation style Ram was carried over for the 2002 model year heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not appear in the 2500/3500 variants until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then new 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi engine not being ready for production.

===Drivetrain===

====Transmissions====
Transmissions for the Ram
*[[TorqueFlite|A500/42RH-RE]] lower geared light duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6
*[[TorqueFlite|A518/46RH-RE]] for more heavy duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines.
*[[TorqueFlite|A618/47RH-RE]] for heavy duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002.
[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]] was offered in 1500 Rams and light-duty 2500 Rams.
[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission|NV4500]] was standard in 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models (''except the uncommon, light-duty 2500 rams'').
A [[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission|NV5600]] was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.

====Transfer cases====
There was a total of five [[transfer case]]s available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured a NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 2500 Rams. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured a NP241DLD from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 the NP241DHD became an option for 2500 Rams and was standard on 3500 Rams from 1998 to 2002.

====Axles====
The Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a [[Dana 44]] was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use [[Dana 60]] front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A [[Dana 60]] rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A [[Dana 70]] rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A [[Dana 80]] rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they did not have [[locking hubs]], but featured a [[center axle disconnect]]. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.

===Engines===
A [[natural gas|natural-gas-powered]] engine debuted for 1995 but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a very limited production run. The [[Cummins B Series engine]] was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled injection pump, 24-valve head design, and an electronic injection pump.

===Special editions===
*'''Limited Edition Indy Pace and SS/T Package''' - The Dodge Ram Indy Pace Truck was available in 1996. It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating "Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500". These trucks had a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine with upgraded exhaust and {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} more power. These also included {{convert|17|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R-17 tires. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 to 1998 and included all the same upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had "SS/T" designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes. The SS/Ts were available in white/blue, red/silver, black/silver, and green/silver. All include a specialty sticker on the inner door stating, "Built with pride in the U.S.A." A real Pace truck is a metal plate on the driver's side frame rail, with a raised number 19 on it. However, the SS/Ts do not have this.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
*'''High Output''' - The Ram trucks started offering a diesel High Output package for 2001 models. 2001/2002 H.O. engines were rated 10 horsepower higher than the standard engine. 2013 models H.O. are rated 15 horsepower higher than the standard automatic transmission models and 35 horsepower higher than the manual models.
*'''Off-Road Edition''' - The Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Off-Road "Edition" (package)&lt;ref name="Geno's Garage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram Pickup Info |url=http://dodgeram.info/2001/models/1500.html |website=DodgeRam.info |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was available in the latter portion of the third generation. It included 17" alloy wheels (1 inch larger than the standard 16"), added 4X4 transfer case skid plate, 4.10 rear axle gear ratio, limited-slip rear differential, heated dual-power side mirrors, fog lamps, and tow hooks in the front mounted to the frame.

In development from 1996 (styling by Cliff Wilkins finalized in 1998), the third-generation Ram was unveiled on February 7, 2001 at the [[Chicago Auto Show|2001 Chicago Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/07/news/hw-21967 |title=2002 Dodge Ram Gets a Dose of Steroids - lattices |newspaper=LA Times |first=John |last=O'Dell |date=2001-02-07 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debuted for 2002 model year on 1500 models and 2003 on 2500 and 3500 models. This was a major update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their [[live axle]]s in favor of an [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability. This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.

The redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could not keep up with the eleventh-generation [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|F-150]] in 2004.

===2006 Facelift===

[[File:2006-2008 Dodge Ram 1500 -- 03-16-2012.JPG|thumb|left|2006–2008 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab]]

The Dodge Ram was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the "Mega Cab", featuring a {{convert|6.25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} cargo box and {{convert|22|in|mm}} of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners, a full screen mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the [[headlamp]]s were redesigned to a more modern design.

For 2006, the [[steering wheel]] design was changed to one from the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Dodge Durango]]. [[Bluetooth]] [[U Connect]] was now available as an option, and a front facelift was given to all Ram models. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was available, as well was a rear seat [[DVD]] entertainment system with wireless [[headphones]]. The [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] model, with the 8.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] from the [[Dodge Viper]] SRT/10, was discontinued after the 2006 [[model year]].

For 2007, Dodge changed the tail lights.

===Chassis Cab===
In 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] rated at {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} was also available. Automatic transmissions used were the [[Chrysler RFE transmission|545RFE]] with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} the [[List of Aisin transmissions|AS68RC]] with the {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.

For 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class-4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class-5]] trucks with a gross weight of {{convert|16500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] as the 3500 chassis-cab model. [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]], who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the [[Sterling Bullet]] with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of [[Freightliner LLC]] which, like Dodge, was owned by the former [[DaimlerChrysler]]. [[Sterling Trucks]] was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand was phased out by [[Chrysler Corporation]], the Bullet was discontinued.

Models built after January 1, 2007 offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L. It produced {{convert|350|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Unlike the 5.9 L which was backed by the 4-speed [[TorqueFlite|48RE]] Transmission, the 6.7 L was equipped with the new 6-speed [[Chrysler RFE transmission|68RFE]] transmission.

2005 was the last year for the first version of the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Hemi V8. 2006 half-ton models offered the [[Multi-Displacement System]] Hemi V8 engine that also became available in Chrysler and Dodge sedans. This engine featured the same performance but had a cylinder-deactivating feature enabled under light loads to increase fuel economy by 3 MPG city and 4 MPG hwy. This new Hemi still delivered {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

===Axles===
For the 2003 model year, AAM axles replaced the Dana Corp axles. In the front all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM (often referred to as "corporate") [[10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|10.5]]" and [[10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5]]". Rear axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5" has a gear ratio "carrier split" at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different [[metallurgy]].

===Special editions===
* '''HemiSport''' - The HemiSport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004. It was available in black, red, or silver, and with either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. It was equipped similarly to the Rumble Bee, but without the number plaque. The HemiSport was discontinued for 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* '''Dodge Ram VTS Concept''' - This concept from Dodge was meant to be a design study highly inspired by Viper GTS-inspired bumpers, mirrors, 17-inch wheels, Blue Paint, dual white stripes and Viper GTS sourced 415&amp;nbsp;bhp V10. VTS was vital in the development of 500&amp;nbsp;bhp Ram SRT10 that were built from 2004 to 2006.&lt;ref name="thecarwallpapers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarwallpapers.com/history-dodge-ram-1|title=The History of Dodge Ram - Part 1|publisher=theCARwallpapers.com | accessdate=2013-09-29|work=thecarwallpapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2005 Dodge RAM SRT-10 8.3 Front.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2005 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Crew cab]]
* '''[[Dodge Ram SRT 10]]''' - This is a regular or quad-cab body with the [[Dodge Viper]]'s [[Chrysler LA engine#8.0 Viper V10|V10 engine]] 8.3L, 22" wheels and [[Pirelli]] tires, lowered suspension, bucket seats, body modifications, and a spoiler. The 2004 version was available only in a single cab with a 6-speed [[manual transmission]] and a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter. For 2005, Dodge released a Quad Cab version of the Viper-V10-powered truck with a modified 48RE four-speed automatic transmission from the Ram with the Cummins turbodiesel engine. In 2004, the truck held the Guinness World Record for "World's Fastest Production Pickup Truck" with a speed of 154.587&amp;nbsp;mph (247.3&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trucks.about.com/cs/2004dodgetrucks/a/gaughn_srt10.htm |title=Dodge Ram SRT-10 is World's Fastest Production Truck |work=About.com: Trucks |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record stood until overtaken by the Australian [[HSV Maloo]] R8, a sport utility coupe, in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.hspn.com/articles/519/1/HSV-sets-new-World-Land-Speed-Record-for-PickupUtility-Truck/Page1.html |title=HSV sets new World Land Speed Record for Pickup/Utility truck |date=June 28, 2006 |work=HSPN News |accessdate=2010-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116142535/http://news.hspn.com/articles/519/1/HSV-sets-new-World-Land-Speed-Record-for-PickupUtility-Truck/Page1.html |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRT-10 production ended on June 30, 2006.
* '''[[Dodge Power Wagon#|Power Wagon]]''' - This model, introduced for 2005, is an off-road focused version of the Ram. The name is drawn from Dodge's line of 4-wheel-drive trucks made from the early 1940s through the 1980s. It comes with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]] engine,(changed to the 6.4L hemi model year 2014 to present) electronic locking differentials, electronic disconnecting front sway bar, 285/70R17 off-road tires mounted on power wagon specific 17" wheels with dual safety beads, factory lift springs with power wagon specific spring rates, fender flares, full under body skid plates, "Power Wagon" nameplates instead of the standard Ram badging, and a 12,000 pound winch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/0807_4wd_dodge_ram_power_wagon_off_road_truck/index.html |title=Dodge Power Wagon - Off Road Truck |journal=4 Wheel Drive &amp; Sport Utility Magazine |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This truck was built on the 2500 platform.

[[File:2005 Dodge Ram Rumble Bee.jpg|thumb|right|2005 Dodge Ram Rumble Bee]]
* '''Rumble Bee''' - The Rumble Bee package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. It was available only on regular-cab/short-box pickups; however, some other versions of the Ram were modified to look like Rumble Bees. It includes lower body cladding, 20" wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a "Rumble Bee" emblem, similar to that of the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]]. All Rumble Bees are either black with "solar yellow" trim or yellow with black trim.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 4,858 were produced in 2004, and 5,174 in 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* '''HemiGTX''' - The Hemi GTX package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar's Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20" American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl "blacked-out" hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a "hockey-stick" stripe with "HEMI GTX" that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005. A certificate of authencity was given to all original owners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
[[File:'02-'05 Dodge Ram Daytona Crew Cab 1500.JPG|thumb|2005 Dodge Ram Daytona]]
* '''Daytona''' - Introduced for 2005, the Ram Daytona was a new sport-truck edition of the Ram. It was available as a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in Regular or Quad-Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20-inch chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or "Go Mango" paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge's "high impact" colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional [[hood scoop]]. The most noticeable feature is the large [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which is attached at the rear of the cargo box. The {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} spoiler lined up with the flat black stripe that ran along the back of the bed side with the word 'Daytona' written in the middle. This spoiler is reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
*'''Contractor's Special hybrid''' - Dodge announced a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] version of the Ram, dubbed the ''Contractor's Special'', in 2003. However, the schedule for delivery slipped as Dodge backed away from the vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical outlet panel for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with [[General Motors]] and [[BMW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/ram/special-rams.html |title=Specialty Dodge Rams |work=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''NightRunner''' - 2000 of these were assembled from January 2006 to December 2006. The Limited Edition NightRunner trim includes Brilliant Black Paint, 20-inch (510&amp;nbsp;mm) black chrome wheels, Black chrome grill, the 5.7 L (345 cu in) Hemi engine, dark shaded headlamps, NightRunner graphics, and the NightRunner logo on the speedometer and embroidered on the head rests on two tone seats, carbon look dash. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Motorsport===
The truck won the [[2003 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2003]] and [[2004 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] Manufacturers' Championship. It also won the [[San Felipe 250]] in 2008 and 2009.

[[File:2011 Dodge Power Wagon.jpg|thumb|2011 Dodge Ram [[Power Wagon]]]]
The fourth generation Dodge Ram was introduced at the 2008 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name=Vlasic&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Vlasic |date=January 14, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/business/14truck.html |title=Ford and Chrysler Unveil Their Redesigned Pickups |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This latest generation was sold as the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 starting in Fall 2008. The 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500 models were later added to the lineup. In 2010, the [[Ram Trucks]] brand was separated from Dodge.

[[Chrysler LLC]] attempted to keep the Ram competitive in the market through various developments for the 2009 model, including a new four-door cab style offering, new suspension, a new [[hemi engine]] option, and the Rambox, a new storage system that allows secure storage inside the truck's bed walls. Later models have the Rambox system tied in with the [[remote keyless system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/industry-economic-report.aspx?ID=106597245&amp;pu=1&amp;rd=globalinsight_com |title=NAIAS 2008: Pick-Up Trucks Debut Amid Green Technologies |first=Candida |last=Scott |first2=Roger |last2=Kranenburg |first3=Deborah |last3=Mann |first4=Andrew |last4=Day|publisher=Global Insight |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class exclusive manual transmission===
Since 2011, Ram trucks are marketed as having "class-exclusive" [[manual transmission]]s. This is because the competitors stopped making manual transmissions available in the domestic market. [[Chevrolet Silverado]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2006. [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2010. This applies to [[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]], [[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] trucks. 2011 and 2012 models make {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Horsepower remained the same for 2013 models, torque however, was increased to {{convert|660|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Engine output remained the same for 2014 models.

===Cab options===
The Mega Cab option was deleted, at least on the 1500 model, replaced by a true four-door [[crew cab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/14499/2009-dodge-ram.html |title=2009 Dodge Ram - Auto Shows |journal=Car And Driver |date=January 2008 |first=Mark |last=Gillies |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cab options are [[regular cab]] and [[quad cab]]. The mega cab option remains on the 2500/3500 models. Like the previous generation, the mega cab uses the same wheelbase and overall length as the crew cab/long bed configuration, but instead of using a long bed, the rear cab is extended. Legroom remains unchanged, but the rear seats are able to recline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/2006truckintrosspecs/ss/06_ram_megacab_5.htm |title=2006 Dodge Ram Mega Cab Review |author=Colin Hefferon |accessdate=2014-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070929/http://trucks.about.com/od/2006truckintrosspecs/ss/06_ram_megacab_5.htm |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling===
A coil spring five-link rear suspension replaces the leaf-springs for the 1500.

===Payload capacities===
The 2009 model's towing capacity was originally rated at {{convert|9100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for 2WD Ram 1500 with regular cab, long-bed, 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi engine, 3.92 differential and 17-inch wheels, but the rating increased to {{convert|10450|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} without changing the setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2009/07/29/dodge-increases-towing-capacity-of-2010-ram-on-paper-no-hardwar/ |title=Dodge increases towing capacity of 2010 Ram on paper with no hardware changes |date=July 29, 2009 |work=Autoblog.com |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2010 model, payload was increased by {{convert|50|lb|kg||abbr=on}} to {{convert|1900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for the regular cab 2WD model with the 3.7 litre V6 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2009/07/2010-dodge-ram-1500-towing-rating-increases-to-10450-pounds.html |title=Update 1: 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 Towing Rating Increases |date=July 28, 2009 |work=PickupTruck.com |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towing capacity for the regular cab Ram 1500 with 3.21 differential is rated at {{convert|6100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} with 17-inch wheels and {{convert|5900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} with 19-inch wheels. Crew Cab and Quad Cab models are rated at {{convert|5700|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} respectively.

Gross Combined Weight Ratings is {{convert|11000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for all Ram 1500s with 3.21 axles; max {{convert|15500|lb|kg||abbr=on}} for 2WD Ram 1500 with long bed, 5.7&amp;nbsp;L hemi engine, and a 3.92 differential.

[[File:2011RAM55004x4.jpg|thumb|left|A late model, 2011 Ram 5500 truck]]
Chassis Cab versions were made for the Ram 3500, 4500, and 5500 models. The 3500 Heavy Duty model was unveiled at the 2009 Chicago Auto Show.

Engine choices include 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi V8 rated at {{convert|383|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|542|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, 6.7 l Cummins turbo diesel rated at {{convert|350|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,013 rpm and {{convert|880|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, 5500. Late-model 2011 diesel trucks were up-rated to {{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

Transmission choices included a standard 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed [[Aisin]] automatic. Both transmissions support the Power Takeoff option.

The 3500 model has regular or crew cab, single-rear-wheel or dual-rear-wheel. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108 and 120&amp;nbsp;inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84&amp;nbsp;inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT and Laramie).

The Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a [[Dana S 110]]. The front axle on 4x4 models is manufactured by [[Magna International|Magna]], while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.

====Concept truck====
The Ram concept truck "Long Hauler" is based mostly on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a "Mega Cab" optional on the lighter Rams. The [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] for this truck is 37,500&amp;nbsp;lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/ram/long-hauler.html|title=Long Hauler |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The Ram comes standard with four-wheel [[anti-lock brakes|anti-lock disc brakes]], side curtain airbags, and an [[electronic stability program]] or ESP. In [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) crash tests, the 2009 Ram received a ''Good'' overall score in the frontal crash test, and a ''Marginal'' score in the [[Side collision|side impact]] test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=401 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Ram 1500 |publisher=Iihs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004213035/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=401 |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the roof strength test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?70 |title=Roof strength evaluations: Large pickups |publisher=Iihs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916144033/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?70 |archivedate=2012-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It received a 5-star frontal crash test rating from the NHTSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid=c95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD |title=2009 Dodge Ram 1500 Regular Cab |work=SaferCar.gov |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012005034/http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid=c95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD |archivedate=2008-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however under later testing methods it received an overall 3-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=6592 |title=2012 Ram 1500 Regular PU/RC 4WD &amp;#124; Safercar - NHTSA |publisher=Safercar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the side-pole test it was given a single star rating, because of excessive forces to the thoracic region. While the Ram 1500 features standard side-curtain airbags it does not include [[side torso airbag]]s. The vehicle was redesigned and retested, and received a 5-star rating.

===2013 changes===
[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 01 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]
[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 02 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]
[[File:'13 Ram 2500 Crew Cab (SDLDQ '13).jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 2500 at the 2013 [[ExpoCité|Quebec City Auto Show]]]]
The 1500 gets a minor restyling. It features new front fascia, optional projector beam halogen headlamps with [[Light-emitting_diode|LED]] turn signals/parking lamps, wheels and interior, where the "DODGE" name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with "RAM".

All models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new trim, the Laramie, Longhorn, Limited. (Tradesman, Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn). The Rambox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013. For 2013, the base ST model becomes the Tradesman model.

2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE Automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. New to the lineup is Chrysler's corporate 3.6&amp;nbsp;L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic. It achieves best in class fuel efficiency and makes {{convert|305|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L HEMI V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making {{convert|395|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed Automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic optional.

[[Air suspension]] is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. [[Electronic stability control]] becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer [[Smart key|keyless ignition]].

New infotainment systems are available for the RAM 1500 for 2013:

The base U Connect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.

The "up-level" U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.

The "top-of-the-line" radios are the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio, the U Connect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 9-1-1 emergency call buttons on the rear-view mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible [[smartphone]], and the ability to add GPS navigation from [[Garmin]] for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, [[HD Radio]] SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in [[3G]] internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add additional features that will be available in the future via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.

Options such as a CD Player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio  and a Rearview Backup Camera can be added to any radio.

====3500====
The 2013 models move up to an 18-inch standard wheel, with 18-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a [[heat sink]].

====4x4====
Ram, once again, put the [[Center axle disconnect]] in 3500 4x4 models. 2500 Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until 2014 models. Ram claims this technology to improve fuel efficiency by 1 MPG, although [[EPA]] tests do not include class 2 and class 3 trucks in the [[Miles per gallon|MPG]]/fuel efficiency tests. The 4x4 saw additional changes with the [[transfer case]] now being made by [[BorgWarner]] instead of [[New Venture Gear]].

====High Fuel Efficiency====
A new model offered for the 2013 Ram is the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offers 18/25 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] out of its [[Pentastar]] V6 engine and eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which has nothing in common with the original Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite]]. It is available only in the six-foot bed, two-door, regular cab model with two-wheel-drive only. Standard features include a 220 amp [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternator]] and an 800 amp battery to assist with the [[Start-stop system]]. 3.21:1 axle gearing is also standard.

===2014 changes===
[[File:2014RAM3500.jpg|thumb|2014 Ram 3500 crew cab, 4×4, DRW]]
The option of [[air suspension]] became available on the rear of 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pick up trucks. 1500 models added the option of a [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|Eco-Diesel V6]]. 2500 models now feature coil spring suspension, instead of leaf spring. The cast iron, flex fuel, 4.7 V8 [[Chrysler PowerTech engine]] was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex fuel 3.6 V6 [[Pentastar]] is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The 3.6&amp;nbsp;L Pentastar V6 was available on Laramie and Longhorn trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Mark|title=Ram Will Offer Pentastar V6 in Top Trim Levels|url= http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2014/03/ram-will-offer-pentastar-v-6-in-top-trim-levels.html |work=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ram heavy-duty series of trucks (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) received a new interior design and revised exterior styling from the Ram 1500, which was restyled in 2013.

===2016 changes===
[[File:Rebel1.jpg|thumb|2016 Ram Rebel]]
For 2016, the all-new Ram 1500 '''Rebel''' debuted, offering off-road suspension with a {{convert|1.0|in|cm|1}} higher ride height, larger tires, and a unique interior to add to the Ram 1500 '''Big Horn''' and '''Lone Star''' trim levels. It features a unique blacked-out grille with [[Powder coating|powder coated]] front bumper and exclusive aluminum hood, [[skid plate]]s, and [[Towing|tow hooks]].&lt;ref name=RebelPR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-2015-ram-1500-rebel-makes-a-statement-300018786.html |title=New 2015 Ram 1500 Rebel Makes a Statement |author= |date=13 January 2015 |website= |publisher=PR Newswire Association LLC |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available with either a {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Pentastar]] VVT FlexFuel-Capable V6 engine or a {{convert|395|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[HEMI]] V8 engine.&lt;ref name=WilliamsCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sc-2016-ram-rebel-autoreview-1224-20151218-story.html |title=2016 Ram Rebel yells for off-road adventure |author=Casey Williams |date=21 December 2015 |website= |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four-wheel drive is available with either powertrain, but the two-wheel drive model is V8-only. The sole body configuration offered is a crew cab with a short pickup bed.&lt;ref name=RebelPR/&gt;

'''SLT''' models of all Ram trucks now receive the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio as standard equipment, adding steering wheel-mounted remote phone controls, [[Bluetooth]] hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming, [[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio, a USB port and 3.5 mm auxiliary input jack, Radio Data System (RDS), voice control, in-radio vehicle customization, and a full-color five-inch LCD touch-screen display. This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram '''SLT'''.

===2017 changes===
For 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and "RAM" emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.

In mid-2017, the RAM 1500's 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by [[VM Motori]], was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine will be re-introduced in early 2018, as re-certification by the [[EPA]] has been obtained.

The 1500 SLT model loses the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However. all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models will still offer the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.

The Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously-optional U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.

The Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.

Three new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:

* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in [[Texas]] and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 [[Texas State Fair]].
* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.
* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level, and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems to the model.

There is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.

The mid-level SLT trim level of the RAM 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and are still available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.

For customers wanting a less expensive [[Bluetooth]] option for the Ram truck, a new U Connect 3.0BT (RA2) radio is available for an additional $200.00, which includes an A/M-F/M radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), U Connect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port and 3.5 mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0") monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0") color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.

The RAM 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4&amp;nbsp;L [[HEMI]] gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires and black aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L HEMI gasoline V8 engine.

===2018 changes===
Changes to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of [[HD Radio]] to all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless hot-spot provided by [[AT&amp;T Wireless]], an AT&amp;T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&amp;T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the U Connect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new [[User Interface]] design for easier navigation of menus and applications.

The [[VM Motori]]-produced 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the [[EPA]] after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.

Most upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large 'RAM' emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM "Cross-Hair" front grille.

The Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.

For 2018, there are two new special editions:
* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4X4 models, the U Connect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver's seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.
* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone blue-and-beige interior color scheme.

===2019 changes===

For 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 will be sold alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500. Virtually identical to 2018 models, 2019 trucks will be given a new name, '''Ram 1500 Classic''', to distinguish them from their all-new fifth-generation successors. The Ram 1500 Classic will offer a 2-Door Regular Cab model, whereas the fifth-generation Ram 1500 will not. In addition, Quad and Crew Cab models are also expected to be offered.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;https://www.allpar.com/news/2018/01/ram-classic-tries-chevy-trick-39384&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the current-generation '''Ram 2500''', '''Ram 3500''', and '''Ram 3500/4500/5500 Chassis Cab''' models will continue for 2019, and will be virtually unchanged from 2018 models. A redesign of these trucks is due for the 2020 [[model year]].

===Production===
The Ram 1500, Ram Mega Cab, Ram 2500/3500, DX Chassis Cab (Mexico Market), Ram 4500/5500 are assembled at FCA's Saltillo Assembly Plant in Coahuila, Mexico; the Ram 1500 (DT) is assembled at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] (SHAP) in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chrysler Group LLC Manufacturing Operations |url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=9117&amp;mid=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ram 1500 (DS) was previously assembled at [[Warren Truck Assembly]] in [[Warren, Michigan]].

===Plug-in hybrid===
A two-mode [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version was planned to begin production in 2010, but Chrysler decided to cancel it in favor of a smaller test fleet of 140 [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) Rams developed with support from a {{USD|48}} million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] financed through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

[[File:Ram Pickup plug-in hybrid WAS 2011 1199.JPG|thumb|The Ram 1500 pickup PHEV was introduced at the 2011 [[Washington Auto Show]]]]
The Ram 1500 PHEV demonstrator has a 345&amp;nbsp;hp 5.7L [[Hemi]] V8 gasoline engine mated to a two-mode hybrid transmission and a 12.9 [[kWh]] 355V [[lithium-ion battery]] from [[Electrovaya]]. This setup allows an [[all-electric range]] of more than {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}}, but as a [[blended mode|blended]] plug-in hybrid, the RAM PHEV does not run exclusively all-electric during [[EV mode]]. The fully charged plug-in starts off with [[charge-depleting|charge depletion]] with limited regeneration at the high end of the [[state of charge]] (SoC). That ramps up to a full regenerative capability somewhere in the 70 to 95% range and depletes down to about 20%.

===Issues===
====Fire incident, Hybrid, 2012====
{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents}}
In September 2012, Chrysler temporarily suspended the demonstration program. All 109 Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Town &amp; Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town &amp; Country plug-in hybrid]]s deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.&lt;ref name=Chrysler&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries|title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429 |title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat |first=Bryce G. |last=Hoffman |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled.

The [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation Ram]] made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] on January 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ramtrucks.com/2019/ram-1500.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Ram 1500 will reach Ram Truck dealers in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018 as an early 2019 [[model year]] vehicle. The starting manufacturer's suggested retail price will be $31,695 plus $1,645 destination fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=18753&amp;fIId=18914&amp;mid=70&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Ram 1500 pickup truck will offer just seven trim levels, compared to the previous 11 different trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2018/01/2019-ram-1500-gets-simplified-trim-lineup.html 2019 Ram 1500 Gets Simplified Trim Lineup]. ''pickuptrucks.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World markets==
As of 2016, Ram trucks are available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Europe, and several Middle Eastern countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Find your country - Site Locator - Ram Trucks|url = http://www.ramtrucks.com/crossbrand/intl_site_locator/|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ram trucks officially sold in many Latin American countries are outfitted with [[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations|UNECE WP.29]] lighting equipments, including the taillights with separate amber turn signal indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FOTOS - RAM 1500|url = http://www.ram.com.ar/images/full/02.jpg|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306060222/http://www.ram.com.ar/images/full/02.jpg|archivedate = 2016-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No right-hand-drive version has been built for the United Kingdom, South Africa, and other countries where the rule of road is on the left. In 2016, FCA commenced selling the Ram 2500 and Ram 3500 in Australia. These are [http://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/2016-asv-ram-2500-laramie-review-first-drive-39681 converted] to right hand drive in Australia before sale. Pricing commences from $139,500AUD (approx $100,000USD).

Ram trucks are provided for the European market by the Swiss company AutoGlobal Trade in cooperation with FCA. Germany and Scandinavian countries are some of the largest European markets for the Ram. A thriving cottage industry in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom has imported and converted Ram trucks to right-hand-drive and to meet the local regulations, being more common in Australia since LHD cars less than 30 years old (or 15 years old if registered in Western Australia) cannot be legally driven on Australian public roads unless they are granted a diplomatic or a research and development exception to the rule. In the United Kingdom there is no such restriction, so a stock LHD Ram (or any other LHD vehicle) is not required to undergo the costly and time-consuming process of an RHD conversion in order to be compliant with EU regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Sculptured stones''' is a name applied to commemorative monuments of [[early Christian]] date found in various parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]].

They are usually rough-hewn slabs or boulders, and in a few cases well-shaped crosses, bearing lettered and symbolic inscriptions of a rude sort and ornamental designs resembling those found on [[Celt]]ic scriptures of the [[Gospels]]. Their lettered inscriptions are in [[Latin]], [[Ogam]] or [[Viking|Scandinavian]] and [[Angles|Anglican]] [[runes]], while some are uninscribed. Sculptured stones are usually found near ancient [[Church (building)|ecclesiastical]] sites, and their date is approximately fixed according to the character of the ornamentation. Some of these stones date as late as the 11th century. The [[Pictish stones]] from [[Scotland]] are particularly remarkable for their elaborate decoration and for certain symbolic characters to which as yet no satisfactory interpretation has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pictishstones.org.uk/

'''Sea silk''' is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable [[textile|fabric]] that is made from the long silky filaments or [[byssus]] secreted by a gland in the foot of [[Pinnidae|pen shells]] (in particular ''[[Pinna nobilis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=The Last Surviving Sea Silk Seamstress |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170906-the-last-surviving-sea-silk-seamstress |quote= |newspaper=[[BBC]] |date=6 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The byssus is used by the clam to attach itself to the sea bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's |edition=Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) |year=1976 |publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. |page=307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea silk was produced in the [[Mediterranean]] region from the large marine [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]] ''Pinna nobilis''  until early in the 20th century. The shell, which is sometimes almost a metre long, adheres itself to rocks with a tuft of very strong thin fibres, pointed end down, in the [[intertidal zone]]. These byssi or filaments (which can be up to 6&amp;nbsp;cm long) are spun and, when treated with [[lemon]] juice, turn a  golden colour, which never fades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Chiara Vigo: The Last Woman Who Makes Sea Silk |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33691781 |quote= |newspaper=[[BBC]] |date=2 September 2015
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cloth produced from these filaments can be woven even finer than silk, and is extremely light and warm; it was said that a pair of women's gloves made from the fabric could fit into half a [[walnut]] shell and a pair of stockings in a [[snuffbox]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1971), under '''Byssus'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In ''Spirals in Time,'' Scales puts forward the idea that "a pair of women's gloves made from the fabric could fit into half a walnut shell" actually refers to Limerick gloves made from a fine kid leather that were sold inside walnut shells as a marketing stunt. Over time, the walnut packaging and beliefs about byssus cloth were conflated. (151–152.)&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth attracts [[clothes moth]]s, the larvae of which will eat it.

In addition, ''Pinna nobilis'' is also sometimes gathered for its flesh (as food) and occasionally has [[pearl]]s of fair quality.

==History==

===Egypt===
The Greek text of the (196 BCE) [[Rosetta Stone]] records that [[Ptolemy V]] reduced taxes on priests, including one paid in ''byssus'' cloth. This is thought to be fine [[linen]] cloth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/rosettastone.htm Translation of the Greek section of the Rosetta Stone].&lt;/ref&gt; not sea silk. In [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs]], ''byssus'' was used to wrap [[mummy|mummies]]; this was also linen and not sea silk.

===Greece===
The [[sophist]] author [[Alciphron]] first records "sea wool" in his (c. 2nd century CE) "Galenus to Cryton" letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinspell.com/Alciphron1.html|title=Elfinspell: Book I, Alciphron, Literally and Completely Translated From the Greek, with Introduction and Notes, Greek sophist, online text, Athenian Society Publications III, anonymous translator English translation, 2nd-5th century A.D.: Early Christian Era, satire, prose, literature, online text; 13th century poetry, literature,|author=|date=|website=www.elfinspell.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christian [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–220 CE) mentions it when justifying his wearing a [[Pallium (Roman cloak)|pallium]] instead of a [[toga]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor was it enough to comb and to sew the materials for a tunic. It was necessary also to fish for one's dress; for fleeces are obtained from the sea where shells of extraordinary size are furnished with tufts of mossy hair.&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Laufer 1915:109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sea silk has been suggested as an interpretation of the nature of the [[golden fleece]] that was sought by [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Verrill |first=A. Hyatt |year=1950 |title=Shell Collector’s Handbook |location=New York |publisher=Putnam |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars refute this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKinley |first=Daniel |year=1999 |title=Pinna And Her Silken Beard: A Foray Into Historical Misappropriations |journal=Ars Textrina |volume=29 |issue= |pages=9–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
Several sources mention ''lana pinna'' "pinna wool". Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s (301 CE) ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' lists it as a valuable textile.&lt;ref&gt;Maeder 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Byzantine historian [[Procopius]]'s (c. 550 CE) ''Persian War'', "stated that the five hereditary [[satrap]]s (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given [[chlamys]] (or cloaks) made from ''lana pinna''. Apparently only the ruling classes were allowed to wear these chlamys."&lt;ref&gt;Turner and Rosewater 1958, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabia===
The [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] name for "sea silk" is ''ṣūf al-baḥr'' "sea wool". The 9th-century Persian geographer [[Estakhri]] notes that a sea-wool robe cost more than 1000 gold pieces and records its mythic source.

&lt;blockquote&gt;At a certain period of the year an animal is seen running out of the sea and rubbing itself against certain stones of the littoral, whereupon it deposes a kind of wool of silken hue and golden colour. This wool is very rare and highly esteemed, and nothing of it is allowed to waste.&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Laufer 1915:111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two 13th-century authors, [[Ibn al-Baitar]] and [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]], repeat this inaccurate "sea wool" story.

===China===
Beginning in the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty (25–220 CE), Chinese histories document importing sea silk. [[Chinese language]] names include "cloth from the west of the sea" and "mermaid silk".

The (3rd century CE) ''[[Weilüe]]'' "Brief Account of the Wei", which was an unofficial history of the [[Cao Wei]] empire (220-265 CE), records ''[[Roman Egypt|haixi]]'' 海西 "West of the Sea" cloth made from ''shuiyang'' 水羊 "water sheep".&lt;ref&gt;In [[Modern Standard Chinese]] usage, ''Haixi'' denotes "western; foreign" names such as [[Haixi Jurchens]] and [[Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They have fine brocaded cloth that is said to be made from the down of "water-sheep". It is called ''Haixi'' ("Egyptian") cloth. This country produces the six domestic animals [traditionally: horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs and pigs], which are all said to come from the water. It is said that they not only use sheep's wool, but also bark from trees, or the silk from wild silkworms, to make brocade, mats, pile rugs, woven cloth and curtains, all of them of good quality, and with brighter colours than those made in the countries of Haidong (''East of the Sea'').&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Hill 2004; probably referring to the region of [[Persis]] in modern-day Iran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The (c. 5th century CE) ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' "Book of the Eastern Han" expresses doubt about "water sheep" in the "Products of [[Daqin]] (the Roman Empire)" section. "They also have a fine cloth which some people say is made from the down of 'water sheep,' but which is made, in fact, from the cocoons of [[wild silk]]worms".&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Hill  2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] (398–445 CE), author of the ''Hou Hanshu'', notes this section's information comes from the report that General [[Ban Yong]] 班勇 (son of General [[Ban Chao]] 班超, 32-102 CE) presented to the Emperor in 125. Both Bans administered the [[Western Regions]] on the [[Silk Road]].

The (945 CE) ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang shu]]'' "Book of Tang" mentioned ''Haixi'' cloth from Folin 佛菻 "[[Byzantine Syria|Syria]]", which [[Emil Bretschneider]] first identified as sea silk from Greece. "There is also a stuff woven from the hair of sea-sheep, and called ''hai si pu'' (stuff from the western sea)". He notes, "This is, perhaps, the ''Byssus'', a clothstuff woven up to the present time by the Mediterranean coast, especially in Southern Italy, from the thread-like excrescences of several sea-shells, (especially ''[[Pinna nobilis]]'')."&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Bretschneider 1871, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The (early 6th century CE) ''Shuyiji'' 遹異記 "Records of Strange Things" mentions silk woven by ''Jiaoren'' 蛟人 [[Jiaolong|''jiao'']]-dragon people", which [[Edward H. Schafer]] identifies as sea silk.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the midst of the South Sea are the houses of the ''kău'' people who dwell in the water like fish, but have not given up weaving at the loom. Their eyes have the power to weep, but what they bring forth is pearls.&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Schafer 1967:220-1.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This aquatic type of raw silk was called ''jiaoxiao'' 蛟綃, i.e. "mermaid silk" or ''jiaonujuan ''蛟女絹, "mermaid women's silk".

===Modern===
The earliest usage of the English name ''sea silk'' remains uncertain, but the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''sea-silkworm'' as "a bivalve mollusc of the genus ''Pinna''."&lt;ref&gt;''OED2'', under '''Sea''', ''n''. 23 (d).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Serov]]'s 1863 opera ''[[Judith (Serov)|Judith]]'' includes an aria "I shall don my robe of byssus" (Я оденусь в виссон).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belcanto.ru/udif.html|title=Опера Серова «Юдифь» (Judith) - Belcanto.ru|author=|date=|website=www.belcanto.ru|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gM5PLdW2H4|title=Natalija Ermolenko-Yuzhina, "I shall don my robe of byssus",  Serov: Judith (rec. 1909)|first=|last=dtshu|date=8 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jules Verne]]'s 1870 novel ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', the crew of the Nautilus wear clothes made of byssus (alternately translated as "seashell tissue" or "fan-mussel fabric").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Verne |first=Jules |date=1870 |title=Vingt mille lieues sous les mers |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vingt_mille_lieues_sous_les_mers/Partie_1/Chapitre_15 |location=Paris |publisher=[[Pierre-Jules Hetzel|Hetzel]] |chapter=Chapter 15: Une invitation par lettre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pinna nobilis'' has become threatened with extinction, partly due to overfishing, the decline in [[seagrass]] fields, and pollution. As it has declined so dramatically, the once small but vibrant sea silk industry has almost disappeared, and the art is now preserved only by a few women on the island of [[Sant'Antioco]] near [[Sardinia]]. Chiara Vigo claimed on various media to be the sole person living today to master the art of working with byssus &lt;ref&gt;Maeder, Hänggi, and Wunderlin 2004, pp. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Max |last=Paradiso |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33691781 |title=Chiara Vigo: The last woman who makes sea silk |website=[[BBC News]] |date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the local people 
helped her to open the Sea Silk Museum in Sant'Antioco which was closed following a building code dispute with the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Eliot |last=Stein |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170906-the-last-surviving-sea-silk-seamstress |title=The last surviving sea silk seamstress |website=[[BBC News]] |date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Project Sea-Silk' from the [[Natural History Museum of Basel]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muschelseide.ch/en/projekt.html|title=Muschelseide - Project Sea-silk|author=|date=|website=www.muschelseide.ch|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is collecting extensive data and studies on the subject, and informs the public that a couple of other women still produce and work today with byssus in Sant'Antioco in Sardinia, such as the sisters Assuntina e Giuseppina Pes which contradicts the claims of Chiara Vigo who is credited as having "invented with an extraordinary imagination her own story of sea-silk and [spinning] it tirelessly and to the delight of all media on and on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muschelseide.ch/en/geschichte/20--Jahrhundert.html|title=Muschelseide - 20th century|author=|date=|website=www.muschelseide.ch|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Efisia Murroni, a 100 year old sea-silk master weaver nicknamed "la signora del bisso" (born in 1913) died and her work is now shown in the Museo Etnografico di Sant'Antioco, with other artefacts being already on display in various museums throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muschelseide.ch/it/aktuell.html|title=Muschelseide - Attualità|author=|date=|website=www.muschelseide.ch|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thallium ''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Tl''' and [[atomic number]] 81. It is a gray [[post-transition metal]] that is not found free in nature. When isolated, thallium resembles [[tin]], but discolors when exposed to air. Chemists [[William Crookes]] and [[Claude-Auguste Lamy]] discovered thallium independently in 1861, in residues of [[sulfuric acid]] production. Both used the newly developed method of [[flame spectroscopy]], in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line. Thallium, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|θαλλός}}, {{lang|el-Latn|thallós}}, meaning "a green shoot or twig", was named by Crookes. It was isolated by both Lamy and Crookes in 1862; Lamy by electrolysis, and Crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder. Crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by zinc at the International exhibition, which opened on 1 May that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044103134011;view=1up;seq=7 The Mining and Smelting Magazine]. Ed. Henry Curwen Salmon. Vol. iv, July–Dec 1963, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thallium tends to oxidize to the +3 and +1 oxidation states as ionic salts. The +3 state resembles that of the other elements in [[Boron Group|group 13]] ([[boron]], [[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]]). However, the +1 state, which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of [[alkali metal]]s, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) by ion pumps in living cells.

Commercially, thallium is produced not from potassium ores, but as a byproduct from refining of heavy-metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production is used in the [[electronics industry]], and the remainder is used in the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and in [[glass|glass manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="sl2001"/&gt; It is also used in [[infrared detector]]s. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a [[nuclear medicine]] scan, during one type of nuclear [[cardiac stress test]].

Soluble thallium salts (many of which are nearly tasteless) are [[toxic]], and they were historically used in [[rat poison]]s and [[insecticide]]s. Use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries, because of their nonselective toxicity. Thallium poisoning usually results in hair loss, although this characteristic symptom does not always surface. Because of its historic popularity as a [[murder]] weapon, thallium has gained notoriety as "the poisoner's poison" and "inheritance powder" (alongside [[arsenic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Boron Elements: Boron, Aluminum, Gallium, Indium, Thallium |page = 14 |first = Heather |last = Hasan |date = 2009 |isbn = 978-1-4358-5333-1 |publisher = Rosen Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A thallium atom has 81 electrons, arranged in the electron configuration [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;6p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; of these, the three outermost electrons in the sixth shell are valence electrons. Due to the [[inert pair effect]], the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and it is more difficult to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[lead]], and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 222–224&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reaction under study,&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible92nd|page=8.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are reported for thallium, reflecting the greatly decreased stability of the +3 oxidation state:&lt;ref name=Greenwood222/&gt;
{|
|-
| +0.73 ||Tl&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;|| ↔ Tl
|-
| −0.336 ||Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;|| ↔ Tl
|}

Thallium is the first element in group 13 where the reduction of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222/&gt; Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons.&lt;ref name=Greenwood224&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 224–7&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;

Thallium is [[Ductility|malleable]] and [[Sectility|sectile]] enough to be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium [[hydroxide]] is formed. Sulfuric and [[nitric acid]] dissolve thallium rapidly to make the [[thallium(I) sulfate|sulfate]] and [[thallium(I) nitrate|nitrate]] salts, while [[hydrochloric acid]] forms an insoluble [[thallium(I) chloride]] layer.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 892–893|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|author2 = Wiberg, Egon|author3 = Wiberg, Nils|chapter =Thallium|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of thallium}}
Thallium has 25 [[isotope]]s which have [[atomic mass]]es that range from 184 to 210. &lt;sup&gt;203&lt;/sup&gt;Tl and &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. &lt;sup&gt;204&lt;/sup&gt;Tl is the most stable [[radioisotope]], with a [[half-life]] of 3.78 years.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729| issue = 1|pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 =

It is the most popular isotope used for thallium nuclear [[cardiac stress test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CqQgnHrDxrUC&amp;pg=PA173|chapter = Detection, Evaluation, and Risk Stratification of Coronary Artery Disease by Thallium-201 Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy 155|first1 = Jamshid|last1 = Maddahi|first2 = Daniel|last2 =Berman|title = Cardiac SPECT imaging|edition = 2nd|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2001|isbn = 978-0-7817-2007-6|pages = 155–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Thallium compounds}}

===Thallium(III)===
Thallium(III) compounds resemble the corresponding aluminium(III) compounds. They are moderately strong oxidizing agents and are usually unstable, as illustrated by the positive reduction potential for the Tl&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Tl couple. Some mixed-valence compounds are also known, such as Tl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and TlCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which contain both thallium(I) and thallium(III). [[Thallium(III) oxide]], Tl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a black solid which decomposes above 800&amp;nbsp;°C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

The simplest possible thallium compound, [[thallane]] (TlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is too unstable to exist in bulk, both due to the instability of the +3 oxidation state as well as poor overlap of the valence 6s and 6p orbitals of thallium with the 1s orbital of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrew|first=L.|author2=Wang, X. |title=Infrared Spectra of Thallium Hydrides in Solid Neon, Hydrogen, and Argon|journal=J. Phys. Chem. A|year=2004|volume=108|issue=16|pages=3396–3402|doi=10.1021/jp0498973|bibcode=2004JPCA..108.3396W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trihalides are more stable, although they are chemically distinct from those of the lighter group 13 elements and are still the least stable in the whole group. For instance, [[thallium(III) fluoride]], TlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has the [[bismuth(III) fluoride|β-BiF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] structure rather than that of the lighter group 13 trifluorides, and does not form the {{chem|Tl|F|4|-}} complex anion in aqueous solution. The trichloride and tribromide [[disproportionation|disproportionate]] just above room temperature to give the monohalides, and [[thallium triiodide]] contains the linear [[triiodide]] anion ({{chem|I|3|-}}) and is actually a thallium(I) compound.&lt;ref name=Greenwood239&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Thallium(III) sesquichalcogenides do not exist.&lt;ref name=Greenwood254&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thallium(I)===
The [[thallium halides|thallium(I) halides]] are stable. In keeping with the large size of the Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation, the chloride and bromide have the [[caesium chloride]] structure, while the fluoride and iodide have distorted [[sodium chloride]] structures. Like the analogous silver compounds, TlCl, TlBr, and TlI are [[photosensitive]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood241&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; The stability of thallium(I) compounds demonstrates its differences from the rest of the group: a stable [[thallium(I) oxide|oxide]], [[thallium(I) hydroxide|hydroxide]], and [[thallium(I) carbonate|carbonate]] are known, as are many chalcogenides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood246&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 246–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[double salt]] {{chem|Tl|4|(OH)|2|CO|3|}} has been shown to have hydroxyl-centred triangles of thallium, {{chem|[Tl|3|(OH)]|2+}}, as a recurring motif throughout its solid structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Hydroxocentered {{chem|[(OH)Tl|3|]|2+}} triangle as a building unit in thallium compounds: synthesis and crystal structure of {{chem|Tl|4|(OH)|2|CO|3}}|first1 = Oleg I.|last1 = Siidra|first2 = Sergey N.|last2 = Britvin|first3 = Sergey V.|last3 = Krivovichev|journal = [[Z.

===Organothallium compounds===
Organothallium compounds tend to be thermally unstable, in concordance with the trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also the lowest in the group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TlX. Thallium forms the stable [Tl(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in aqueous solution; like the isoelectronic [[dimethylmercury|Hg(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [Pb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium [[cyclopentadienyl]] compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).&lt;ref name=Greenwood262&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 262–4&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen|pages = 337–381|author = G. Kirchhoff|author2 = R.

[[William Crookes]] and [[Claude-Auguste Lamy]] both started to use the new method. William Crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for [[tellurium]] on selenium compounds deposited in the [[Lead chamber process|lead chamber]] of a sulfuric acid production plant near [[Abberode|Tilkerode]] in the [[Harz|Harz mountains]]. He had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann|August Hofmann]] years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Preliminary Researches on Thallium|first = William|last = Crookes|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume = 12|date = 1862–1863|pages = 150–159|jstor = 112218|doi = 10.1098/rspl.1862.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = On Thallium|first = William|last = Crookes|journal =Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume = 153|date = 1863|pages =173–192|jstor = 108794|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1863.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1862, Crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds.&lt;ref name="DeKosky"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Spectroscopy and the Elements in the Late Nineteenth Century: The Work of Sir William Crookes|first = Robert K.|last = DeKosky|journal = The British Journal for the History of Science|volume = 6|issue = 4|date = 1973|pages = 400–423|jstor = 4025503|doi = 10.1017/S0007087400012553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude-Auguste Lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to Crookes' to determine the composition of a selenium-containing substance which was deposited during the production of [[sulfuric acid]] from [[pyrite]]. He also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present. Lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend Fréd Kuhlmann and this by-product was available in large quantities. Lamy started to isolate the new element from that source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = De l'existencè d'un nouveau métal, le thallium|journal = Comptes Rendus|date = 1862|first = Claude-Auguste|last = Lamy|volume = 54 |pages = 1255–1262|url = http://gallica2.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30115.image.r=Comptes+Rendus+Hebdomadaires.f1254.langFR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by remelting thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts.

As both scientists discovered thallium independently and a large part of the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his own priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: ''For the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium'' and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: ''thallium, for the discovery of the new element.'' The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in June 1863.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite journal|title =Of 'Medals and Muddles' the Context of the Discovery of Thallium: William Crookes's Early|first = Frank A.

The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) estimates that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10&amp;nbsp;metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores.&lt;ref name="USGS-CS2010"/&gt; Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as [[slag]] that are collected at the end of the smelting process.&lt;ref name="USGS-CS2010"/&gt; The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by [[electrolysis]] on [[platinum]] or [[stainless steel]] plates.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15&amp;nbsp;metric [[tonne]]s to about 10&amp;nbsp;tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing [[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductor]], becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Gerald R.|last = Smith| title = Mineral commodity summaries 1996: Thallium|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/thallium/thallmcs96.pdf| accessdate = 2010-05-13|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Historic uses===
The [[odor]]less and [[taste]]less [[Thallium(I) sulfate|thallium sulfate]] was once widely used as [[rat poison]] and [[ant]] killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the [[United States]] due to safety concerns.&lt;ref name="USGS1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sl2001"/&gt; Many other countries followed this example in subsequent years. Thallium salts were used in the treatment of [[ringworm]], other [[skin infection]]s and to reduce the [[night sweat]]ing of [[tuberculosis]] patients. This use has been limited due to their narrow [[therapeutic index]], and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1930.tb09395.x|pages =59–69|title = The Treatment of Ringworm of The Scalp with Thallium Acetate|date = 1930|issue = 2|last1 = Percival|first1 = G.

===Optics===
[[Thallium(I) bromide]] and [[thallium(I) iodide]] [[crystal]]s have been used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name [[KRS-5]] refers to this material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages = 338–346|doi = 10.1364/JOSA.46.000956|title = Refraction and Dispersion of Thallium Bromide Iodide|date = 1956|last1 = Rodney|issue = 11|first1 = William S.|last2 = Malitson|first2 = Irving H.|journal = [[Journal of the Optical Society of America]]|volume = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thallium(I) oxide]] has been used to manufacture [[glass]]es that have a high [[refractive index|index of refraction]]. Combined with [[sulfur]] or [[selenium]] and [[arsenic]], thallium has been used in the production of high-[[density]] glasses that have low [[melting point]]s in the range of 125 and 150 [[Celsius|°C]]. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique [[refractive indices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jOOSKQHEJdwC&amp;pg=PA52| publisher =[[CRC Press]]|title = Glasses for infrared optics|isbn = 978-0-8493-3785-7|date = 1996|first = Valentina F. |last = Kokorina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-temperature superconductivity===
Research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop high-temperature [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] materials for such applications as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], storage of magnetic energy, [[linear motor|magnetic propulsion]], and [[electric power generation]] and transmission. The research in applications started after the discovery of the first [[thallium barium calcium copper oxide]] superconductor in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Nature|volume = 332|issue = 6160|pages = 138–139|date = 1988|doi = 10.1038/332138a0|title = Bulk superconductivity at 120 K in the Tl–Ca/Ba–Cu–O system|first = Z.

===Medical===
Before the widespread application of [[technetium-99m]] in [[nuclear medicine]], the [[radioactive]] isotope [[thallium-201]], with a half-life of 73 hours, was the main substance for [[Myocardial perfusion imaging|nuclear cardiography]]. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Essential cardiology: principles and practice|chapter = Nuclear imaging in cardiovascular medicine |first1 = Diwakar |last1 = Jain |first2 = Barry L. |last2 = Zaret |editor = Clive Rosendorff |pages = 221–222 |isbn = 978-1-58829-370-1 |publisher = Humana Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cY182J9q5NoC&amp;pg=PA222 |date = 2005 |edition = 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wramc.amedd.army.mil/departments/nuclear/PatientInfo/Thallium.htm|title=Thallium Test] from [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4743 Thallium Stress Test] from the [[American Heart Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator, which is similar to the [[technetium-99m generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = An integrally shielded transportable generator system for thallium-201 production |journal = International Journal of Applied Radiation and Isotopes |date = 1982 |volume = 33 |issue = 12 |pages = 1439–1443 |last = Lagunas-Solar |first = M.

====Thallium stress test====
A thallium stress test is a form of [[scintigraphy]], where the amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion-exchange pumps]]. The Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation binds the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or [[dipyridamole]] induces widening ([[vasodilation]]) of arteries in the body. This produces [[coronary steal]] by areas where arteries are maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or [[Ischemia|ischemic tissue]] will remain "cold". Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas that will benefit from myocardial [[revascularization]]. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_A5BSqsb20C&amp;pg=PA100 |page=100 |title=Primary care cardiology |author=Taylor, George J. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2004 |isbn= 1-4051-0386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thallium and its compounds are extremely toxic, and should be handled with care. There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/thallium_is_favored_method_of.html A 15-year-old case yields a timely clue in deadly thallium poisoning].

'''Uranyl carbonate''', UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),  is a [[carbonate]] of [[uranium]] that forms the backbone of several uranyl mineral species such as [[andersonite]], [[mckelveyite-(Y)]] and [[wyartite]] and most importantly [[rutherfordine]]. It is also found in both the mineral and organic fractions of [[coal]] and its [[fly ash]] and is the main component of uranium in mine tailing seepage water.

Uranium like other [[actinide]]s readily forms a [[Uranium dioxide|dioxide uranyl]] core (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the environment, this uranyl core readily complexes with carbonate to form charged complexes.  Although uranium forms insoluble solids or adsorbs to mineral surfaces at [[alkaline]] [[pH]]{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- is it insoluble at high pH? Or is it generally insoluble, but becomes soluble by forming these complexes at high pH? --&gt; it is these soluble carbonate complexes that increase its [[solubility]], availability, and mobility with low affinities to soil. Uranium(VI) generally forms a pH-dependent suite of uranyl carbonate and various hydrated complexes in ground water solutions.

*UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;
*UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;
*UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

A common method for concentrating uranium from a solution uses solutions of uranyl carbonates, which are passed through a resin bed where the [[complex ion]]s are transferred to the resin by [[ion exchange]] with a negative ion like chloride. After build-up of the uranium complex on the resin, the uranium is eluted with a [[salt|salt solution]] and the uranium is [[precipitate]]d in another process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2719">'''WASH-740''' was a report published by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] (USAEC) in 1957. This report, called "Theoretical Possibilities and Consequences of Major Accidents in Large Nuclear Power Plants" (also known as "The Brookhaven Report"), estimated maximum possible damage from a [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] with no [[containment building]] at a large [[nuclear reactor]].

The conclusions of this study estimated the possible effects of a "maximum credible accident" for [[nuclear reactor]]s then envisioned as being 3400 deaths, 43,000 injuries and property damage of $7 billion ($57bn adjusted for inflation in 2012 since 1957).  The estimate of probability was one in a hundred thousand to one in a billion per reactor-year.  When WASH-740 was revised in 1964-65 to account for the larger reactors then being designed, the new figures indicated that there could be as many as 45,000 deaths, 100,000 injuries, and $17 billion in property damage ($125bn adjusted for inflation since 1964).

However, the assumptions underlying the results were unrealistic (including the worst meteorological conditions, no [[containment building]], and that half the reactor core is released into the atmosphere as micrometre-sized pellets without any examination of how this might occur).  These were due to conservatism (estimating the maximum possible damage) and the need to use [[atomic bomb]] [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] data, which had been collected from tests (computers in 1955 being greatly insufficient to do the calculations).

As knowledge, models and computers improved the conclusions of this report were replaced by those of first [[WASH-1400]] (1975, The Rasmussen Report), then [[CRAC-II]] (1982), and most recently [[NUREG-1150]] (1991).  Now all of these studies are considered obsolete (see the disclaimer to NUREG-1150), and are being replaced by the [[State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses]] (SOARCA) study.

A '''wood-decay fungus''' is any species of fungus that digests moist [[wood]], causing it to [[decomposition|rot]]. Some [[species]] of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as ''[[Armillaria]]'' (honey fungus), are [[parasitic]] and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the [[fibre saturation point]] in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.&lt;ref name="Harris 2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Samuel Y. |title=Building Pathology: Deterioration, Diagnostics, and Intervention |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ClnQtqipTtsC&amp;pg=PA106 |year=2001 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-33172-8 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called '''lignicolous''' fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to return nutrients to the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr_nrs97.pdf |title=Wood Decay in Living and Dead Trees: A Pictorial Overview |deadurl=no |accessdate=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the [[carbohydrate]]s in wood and some others decay [[lignin]]. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.&lt;ref name="Towards modelling of decay risk of wooden materials"&gt;Viitanen, T. et al. (2010). Towards modelling of decay risk of wooden materials. European Journal of Wood and Wood Products 68:303-313.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wood-decay fungi can be classified according to the type of decay that they cause. The best-known types are '''brown rot''', '''soft rot''', and '''white rot'''.&lt;ref name="deacon-www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesota"/&gt; Each produce different enzymes, can degrade different plant materials, and can colonise different environmental niches.&lt;ref name="Decay of cultivated apricot wood"&gt;Vane, C. H., et al. (2005). "Decay of cultivated apricot wood (Prunus armeniaca) by the ascomycete Hypocrea sulphurea, using solid state 13C NMR and off-line TMAH thermochemolysis with GC–MS." International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation 55(3): 175-185.&lt;/ref&gt; The residual products of decomposition from fungal action have variable pH, solubility and redox potentials. Over time this residue will become incorporated in the soil and sediment, so can have a noticeable effect on the environment of that area.&lt;ref name="Decay of cultivated apricot wood" /&gt;

==Brown rot==
[[File:Cubical rot checked quercus bialowieza 1 beentree.jpg|thumb|right|Cubical brown rot on [[oak]]]]

Brown-rot fungi break down [[hemicellulose]] and [[cellulose]] that form the wood structure. Cellulose is broken down by [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that is produced during the breakdown of hemicellulose.&lt;ref name="deacon-www"/&gt; Because hydrogen peroxide is a small [[molecule]], it can diffuse rapidly through the wood, leading to a decay that is not confined to the direct surroundings of the fungal [[hypha]]e. As a result of this type of decay, the wood shrinks, shows a brown discoloration, and cracks into roughly cubical pieces, a phenomenon termed cubical fracture. The [[fungi]] of certain types remove [[cellulose]] compounds from wood and hence the wood becomes brown [[colour]].

Brown rot in a dry, crumbly condition is sometimes incorrectly referred to as ''dry rot'' in general. The term ''brown rot'' replaced the general use of the term ''dry rot'', as wood must be damp to decay, although it may become dry later. [[Dry rot]] is a generic name for certain species of brown-rot fungi.

Brown-rot fungi of particular economic importance include ''[[Serpula lacrymans]]'' (true dry rot), ''[[Fibroporia vaillantii]]'' (mine fungus), and ''[[Coniophora puteana]]'' (cellar fungus), which may attack [[timber]] in buildings. Other brown-rot fungi include the [[Laetiporus sulphureus|sulfur shelf]], ''[[Phaeolus schweinitzii]]'', and ''[[Fomitopsis pinicola]]''.&lt;ref name=stamets/&gt;

Brown-rot fungal decay is characterised by extensive demethylation of lignins whereas white-rot tends to produce low yields of molecules with demethylated functional groups.&lt;ref name="the effect of fungal decay on wheat straw lignin"&gt;Vane, C. H., et al. (2001). "The effect of fungal decay (''Agaricus bisporus'') on wheat straw lignin using pyrolysis–GC–MS in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH)." Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis 60(1): 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are very few brown rot fungi in [[tropical climate]]s or in southern [[temperate climate|temperate]] zones. Most brown rot fungi have a [[range (biology)|geographical range]] north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] (23.5° latitude), and most of these are found north of the 35° latitude, corresponding to a roughly [[subarctic climate|boreal]] distribution. Those brown rot fungi between latitudes 23.5° and 35° are typically found at high elevations in pine forest regions, or in [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forest]] regions such as the [[Rocky Mountains]] or the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name="SymposiumIsaac1993"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Isaac, Susan |chapter=Tropical polypores |author=Ryvarden, Leif |series=British Mycological Society. Symposium |title=Aspects of Tropical Mycology |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48nns90V3h8C&amp;pg=PA159 |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-45050-8 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soft rot==

Soft-rot fungi secrete [[cellulase]] from their [[hypha]]e, an [[enzyme]] that breaks down [[cellulose]] in the wood.&lt;ref name="deacon-www"/&gt; This leads to the formation of microscopic cavities inside the wood, and sometimes to a discoloration and cracking pattern similar to brown rot.&lt;ref name="deacon-www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesota"/&gt; Soft-rot fungi need [[Nitrogen#Biological role|fixed nitrogen]] in order to synthesize enzymes, which they obtain either from the wood or from the environment. Examples of soft-rot-causing fungi are ''[[Chaetomium]]'', ''[[Ceratocystis]]'', and ''[[Kretzschmaria deusta]]''.

Soft-rot fungi are able to colonise conditions that are too hot, cold or wet for brown or white-rot to inhabit. They can also decompose woods with high levels of compounds that are resistant to biological attack. Bark in woody plants contains a high concentration of [[tannin]], which is difficult for fungi to decompose, and [[suberin]] which may act as a microbial barrier.&lt;ref name="bark decay"&gt;Vane, C. H., et al. (2006). "Bark decay by the white-rot fungus Lentinula edodes: Polysaccharide loss, lignin resistance and the unmasking of suberin." International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation 57(1): 14-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The bark acts as form of protection for the more vulnerable interior of the plant.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt;
Soft-rot fungi do not tend to be able to decompose matter as effectively as white-rot fungi: they are less aggressive decomposers.&lt;ref name="Decay of cultivated apricot wood" /&gt;

==White rot==

White-rot fungi break down the [[lignin]] in wood, leaving the lighter-colored cellulose behind; some of them break down both lignin and cellulose.&lt;ref name="minnesota"/&gt; As a result, the wood changes texture, becoming moist, soft, spongy, or stringy; its colour becomes white or yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74109.html|title=Wood Decay Fungi in Landscape Trees Management Guidelines--UC IPM|author=|date=|website=www.ipm.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because white-rot fungi are able to produce enzymes, such as [[laccase]], needed to break down lignin and other complex [[organic molecule]]s, they have been investigated for use in [[mycoremediation]] applications.&lt;ref name=cohen02/&gt;

There are many different enzymes that are involved in the decay of wood by white-rot fungi, some of which directly oxidize lignin.&lt;ref name="biodegradation of oak wood"&gt;Vane, C. H., et al. (2003). "Biodegradation of Oak (''Quercus alba'') Wood during Growth of the Shiitake Mushroom (''Lentinula edodes''): A Molecular Approach." Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 51(4): 947–956.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative abundance of [[phenylpropane]] alkyl [[side chain]]s of lignin characteristically decreases when decayed by white-rot fungi.&lt;ref name="the effect of fungal decay on wheat straw lignin" /&gt; It has been reported that the oyster mushroom (''Pleurotus ostreatus'') preferentially decays lignin instead of polysaccharides.&lt;ref name="degradation of lignin in wheat straw during growth of the oyster mushroom"&gt;Vane, C. H., et al. (2001). "Degradation of Lignin in Wheat Straw during Growth of the Oyster Mushroom (''Pleurotus ostreatus'') Using Off-line Thermochemolysis with Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide and Solid-State 13C NMR." Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 49(6): 2709–2716.&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from some other white-rot fungi, e.g., ''[[Phanerochaete chrysosporium]]'', which shows no selectivity to lignocellulose.&lt;ref name="degradation of lignin in wheat straw during growth of the oyster mushroom" /&gt;

[[Honey mushroom]] (''Armillaria spp.'') is a white-rot fungus notorious for attacking living trees. ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'' and other [[oyster mushroom]]s are commonly cultivated white-rot fungi,&lt;ref name=cohen02/&gt; but ''P.&amp;nbsp;ostreatus'' is not [[parasitic]] and will not grow on a living tree, unless it is already dying from other causes.&lt;ref name="Stamets2000" /&gt; Other white-rot fungi include the [[Trametes versicolor|turkey tail]], [[Ganoderma applanatum|artist's conk]], and [[Fomes fomentarius|tinder fungus]].&lt;ref name=stamets/&gt;

White-rot fungi are grown all over the world as a source of food – for example the [[shiitake mushroom]], which in 2003 comprised approximately 25% of total mushroom production.&lt;ref name="monitoring decay of black gum"&gt;Vane, C. H. (2003). "Monitoring Decay of Black Gum Wood (''Nyssa sylvatica'') During Growth of the Shiitake Mushroom (''Lentinula edodes'') Using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy." Applied Spectroscopy 57(5): 514–517.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yttre Stengrund''' was an offshore wind farm in [[Sweden]], operated by [[Vattenfall]]. The wind farm was commissioned in 2001, using five 2 MW [[NEG Micon]] turbines. 
All turbines in Yttre Stengrund were decommissioned by November 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE END IS NEAR FOR YTTRE STENGRUND|url= http://news.vattenfall.com/en/article/end-near-yttre-stengrund |website=NEWS FROM VATTENFALL|publisher=Vattenfall|accessdate=25 October 2016|date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first offshore wind farm to be decommissioned in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vattenfall to scrap Yttre Stengrund|url= http://renews.biz/75899/vattenfall-to-scrap-yttre-stengrund/ |accessdate=25 October 2016|work=reNEWS - Renewable Energy News|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.offshorewind.biz/2016/01/25/vattenfall-wraps-up-first-ever-offshore-wind-farm-decommissioning/ |title=Vattenfall Wraps Up First Ever Offshore Wind Farm Decommissioning|publisher= |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4188">The ''' ZKZM-500'''  is a [[Directed-energy weapon|laser gun]] developed in [[China]] since 2018 by the Xian Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in [[Shaanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2153310/china-brings-star-wars-life-laser-ak-47-could-set-fire China brings Star Wars to life with ‘laser AK-47’ that can set fire to targets a kilometre away]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can reportedly destroy a target 800 meters away by charring skin and [[human]] tissue. The frequency of the laser makes it invisible to the human eye and it does not produce noise. It is powered by a rechargeable [[lithium battery]] and can shoot more than 1,000 shots per charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/inventions/china-has-reportedly-made-a-laser-gun-powerful-enough-to-destroy-a-target-from-almost-1km-away/news-story/4a295cdd89318df43f7c973087991b42 China has reportedly made a laser gun powerful enough to destroy a target from almost 1km away]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now ready for mass production and the first units are likely to be given to anti-terrorism squads in the [[People's Armed Police]].

==Legality==
There is no specific international regulation for the development or use of this type of laser weapon. The [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]], signed by more than 100 nations, focuses on previous generations of weapons and prohibits the use of weapons that can cause blindness. It is classified as a [[non-lethal weapon]] on a Chinese government website.

==Skepticism==

Skeptics have noted that the ZKZM-500 would require a battery weighing several hundred pounds in order to achieve the rifle's described capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://bigthink.com/news/we-call-bullshit-on-that-chinese-army-laser-gun-thats-making-the-rounds |publisher=[[Big Think]] |first=Ned |last=Dymoke |date=July 2, 2018 |title=Science calls bullshit on China's 'AK-47 laser gun' |quote=Realistically, the battery alone would have to weigh several hundred pounds to provide the energy needed to fire a hot laser beam a kilometer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/chinese-company-claims-its-laser-ak-47-can-set-you-on-fire-from-half-a-mile-away/ |quote=There’s just no way that a laser powered by a lithium-ion battery that a person could carry would be capable of producing the kind of heat described at point blank range, let alone at 800 meters. |title=Chinese company claims its ‘laser AK-47’ can set you on fire from half a mile away |first=Devin |last=Coldewey |date=July 2, 2018 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.c4isrnet.com/electronic-warfare/2018/07/02/chinas-prototype-laser-rifle-is-a-dangerous-gimmick-at-best/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ebb%207/3/18&amp;utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief |title=China’s prototype laser rifle is a dangerous gimmick at best |first=Kelsey |last=Atherton |date=July 2, 2018 |publisher=[[C4ISRNET]] |quote=“To make this work, you need a serious battery pack, some even more serious capacitors, optics that can take all this without turning back into sand at these energy densities, and rugged enough that you can treat this like military hardware,” says Broughton. “This is a ‘best case scenario operation only’ weapon if there ever was one.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
The manufacturer of the ZKZM-500 has since released a video demonstration of the weapon's effects against cardboard, pork, and a rubber tire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/video/offbeat/2153779/chinese-star-wars-laser-weapon-appears-set-fire-objects-distance/ |quote=Chinese scientists have released a live test video of a long-range, portable laser weapon that has drawn the world’s attention.|title= Chinese ‘Star Wars’ laser weapon appears to set fire to objects at a distance|date=July 4, 2018 |publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
