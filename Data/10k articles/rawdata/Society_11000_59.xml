== History ==
{{see_also|History of abortion}}

In 1931, fourteen years after the writing of the national [[Mexican Constitution|Constitution]], the Mexican Government addressed abortion by making it illegal, except in the cases when the abortion is caused by the negligence of the mother, continuation of the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, or in pregnancy resulting from rape.&lt;ref name=Jelen&gt;{{cite web|last=Jelen|first=Ted G.|title=Abortion Opinion in Emerging Democracies: Latin America and Central Europe|url=http://wpsa.research.pdx.edu/meet/2012/jelenandbradley.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2014|author2=Jonathan Doc Bradley|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haussmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassmann|first=Melissa|title=Abortion Politics in North America|year=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishing, Inc.|location=Boulder, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN Report"&gt;{{cite web|last=department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat|first=Policy Data Bank|title=UN Report-Mexico|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/mexico.doc|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Mexico introduced the ''Ley General de Población'', a law requiring the government to provide free family planning services in all public health clinics and a National Program for Family Planning to coordinate it.&lt;ref name="Juarez et al"&gt;{{cite book|last=Juarez|first=F|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Mexico: Causes and Consequences|year=2013|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|location=New York|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Unintended-Pregnancy-Mexico.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Mexico amended its Constitution to recognize every Mexican citizen's "right to freely decide, in a responsible and informed manner, on the number and spacing of their children".&lt;ref name="Juarez et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mexico Constitution 1974"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gobierno de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos |title=Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, Capítulo I de los Derechos Humanos y sus Garantías, Artículo 4 |language=Spanish |url=http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/tcfed/9.htm?s |accessdate=March 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317082931/http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/tcfed/9.htm?s |archivedate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the 1990s, the Mexican government considerably expanded its [[Family planning|family planning services]] to rural areas and less-developed parts of the country, reducing inequalities in family planning services and contraceptive provision.&lt;ref name="Juarez et al" /&gt; Contraceptive use doubled from 1976, but the annual rate of increase slowed down in 1992, and has come to a standstill in recent years.&lt;ref name="Juarez et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fuentes&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuentes|first=M Urbina|title=Política de población y los programas de planificación familiar, en: Valdés L ed., La ley de población a treinta años de distancia: reflexiones, análisis y propuestas|year=2005|publisher=UNAM|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|pages=339–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data provided by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], in 1996, Mexico had the lowest percentage of women in [[Latin America]] who underwent an abortion procedure –1 in 40– a rate of 2.5%.&lt;ref name="Guttmacher 1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of Clandestine Abortion in Latin America|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib12.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=12 March 2014|date=December 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317075817/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib12.html|archive-date=2014-03-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mexico’s national abortion rate was at about 38 abortions per 1,000 for women between the ages of 15–44, which is at 3.8%. These rates are important to consider because of Mexico’s stringent anti-abortion laws, and therefore might not be the most accurate representation of the actual data.&lt;ref name="Juarez et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttmacher 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion In Mexico|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=15 March 2014|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Mexico.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2007, the ''Asamblea Legislativa de Distrito Federal'' or the [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District]] (LAFD) reformed Articles 145 through 148 of the Criminal Code and Article 14 of the Health Code, all dealing with abortion. Forty-six out of the 66 members (from five distinct parties) of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District]] approved the new legislation.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanchez Fuentes|first=Maria Luisa|author2=Jennifer Paine |author3=Brook Elliott-Buettner |title=The Decriminalisation of Abortion in Mexico City: How Did Abortion Rights Become a Political Priority?|journal=Gender and Development|date=July 2008|volume=16|issue=2|pages=345–360|jstor=20461278}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes expanded the previous law, which had allowed legal abortions in four limited circumstances.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Thea B.|title=GUARANTEED ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTIONS: THE TRUE REVOLUTION OF MEXICO CITY'S LEGAL REFORMS REGARDING ABORTION|journal=COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW|year=2013|volume=44|series=2|issue=437|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r30937.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Mexico, abortion proceedings fall under local state legislation. A landmark [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court]] decision in 2008 found no legal impediment to it in the [[Constitution of Mexico|federal Constitution]] and stated that, "to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women".&lt;ref name="cs-monitor-supreme-court"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0829/p25s22-woam.html|title=Mexico's Supreme Court upholds abortion law|last=Miller Llana|first=Sara|date=2008-08-28|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=2009-10-17|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All states' [[penal code]]s permit abortions in cases of [[rape]], and all but [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Querétaro]]'s permit it to save the mother's life. Fourteen out of thirty-one expand these cases to include severe fetal deformities, and the state of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] includes economic factors when the mother has previously borne three or more children.&lt;ref name="gire-states"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gire.org.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=409&amp;Itemid=1154&amp;lang=en |title=State Legislation |year=2012 |publisher=Grupo de Información en Reproducción Elegida, A.C |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227155216/https://www.gire.org.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=409&amp;Itemid=1154&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2014-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to Jo Tuckman of ''[[The Guardian]]'', in practice, almost no state provides access to abortions in the cases listed. They also prosecute neither the doctors who offer safe illegal abortions nor the cheaper life-threatening backstreet practitioners.&lt;ref name="guardian-supreme-court"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/mexico.humanrights |title=Judges uphold abortion rights in Mexico City |last=Tuckman|first=Jo|date=2008-08-29|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, some exceptions. Since 2007, [[Mexico City]], where approximately 7.87% of the national population lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=total+population+of+Mexico+City+%2F+total+population+of+Mexico|title=Population of Mexico City as a percentage of the national population of Mexico|year=2007|publisher=Wolfram Alpha|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers abortion on request to any woman up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy,&lt;ref name="latimes-supreme-court"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/29/world/fg-mexabortion29|title=Mexican Supreme Court upholds legalized abortion law|last=Ellingwood|first=Ken|date=2008-08-29|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-10-18|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, along with [[Cuba]] and [[Uruguay]], is one of the most liberal legislations on this matter in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="guardian-supreme-court" /&gt; In contrast, recent political lobbying on behalf of the dominant [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[pro-life]] organizations has resulted in the amendment of more than half of the state constitutions, which now define a [[fertilized egg|fertilized human egg]] as a person with a right to legal protection.&lt;ref name="anti-abortion-laws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=221256&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|title=Temen se extienda prohibición al aborto en el país |date=2009-10-13|newspaper=El Financiero en línea|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-10-19|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009|10|15}}, none of those states removed its exceptions to abortion to reflect the changes in its constitution,&lt;ref name="gire-states" /&gt; but according to [[Human Rights Watch]] and a local [[NGO]], over the past eight years, the conservative-leaning state of [[Guanajuato]] "has denied every petition by a pregnant rape victim for abortion services", and about 130 of its residents have been sentenced for seeking or providing illegal abortion.&lt;ref name="hrw-gto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49b4d2241a.html|title=Mexico: Stop Blocking Abortions for Rape Victims|date=2009-03-05|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-10-19|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these days the government is aware of the existence of the institution called 'Las Libres de Guanajuato' which provides abortions and support for women in need, and ignores its existence.&lt;ref name="jornada-gto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Abortion-Mexico-examples-Guanajuato/dp/3659527661|title=The Politics of Abortion in Mexico: A study based on the examples of the states of Distrito Federal and Guanajuato|last=Lysakowska|first=Anna|date=2014|work=|newspaper=|location=|language=English|isbn=978-3659527661|author-link=Anna Lysakowska|access-date=|via=|accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the decriminalization of abortions in the ''Distrito Federal'', also known as [[Mexico City]], the states of [[Baja California]] and [[San Luis Potosí]] enacted laws in 2008 bestowing “personhood” rights from the moment of conception.&lt;ref name=CNNMex&gt;{{cite web|last=CNN: Mexico|title=La legalidad del aborto en México a discusión en la Suprema Corte|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/09/26/la-legalidad-del-aborto-en-mexico-a-discusion-en-la-suprema-corte|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 March 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court]] rejected two actions to overturn the laws enacted by the states of Baja California and San Luis Potosí for unconstitutionality. The Court recognized "the power of the state legislature" to enact laws on the subject. However, their decision does not criminalize or decriminalize abortion in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Jelen /&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes-supreme-court /&gt;

[[File:Map of Mexico, abortion laws.svg|thumbnail|left|Map of Mexico demonstrating Abortion Laws by State]]

===Influence from CEDAW===
The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) recognizes "the need for access to abortion services in cases where abortion is legal, and calls for a review of the laws where abortion is illegal". &lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; The CEDAW Committee's recommendations to the Mexican State in 2006 specifically mention these issues.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; CEDAW "encourages states to enact measures that ensure access to health care for women as a matter of gender equality". &lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Since Mexico signed the [[United Nations]] treaties and conventions, it is bound to above-mentioned standards.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

===Effects of legislation===
With the new legislation, the law redefines the term ‘abortion’.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; An abortion is the legal termination of a pregnancy of 13 weeks of gestation or more.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; During the first 12 weeks of gestation, the procedure is labeled the ‘legal termination of pregnancy’.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; In addition, the term ‘pregnancy’ was officially defined as beginning when the embryo is implanted in the endometrium.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; This helps to determine gestational age, and, according to the research team of Maria Sanchez Fuentes, "implicitly legitimizes any post-coital contraceptive method, including emergency contraception ... and assisted reproduction (including infertility treatments such as IVF) and stem-cell research". &lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Women charged with having an illegal abortion have their sentences reduced, and the penalty for forcing a woman to have an abortion against her own will, which includes her partner or a physician, is increased.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; If physical violence is involved, the penalty is even higher.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Furthermore, the law explicitly states that sexual and reproductive health are a priority in health services, with the goal of preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

According to an unofficial report by the organization ''Grupo de Información en Reproducción Elegida'' (GIRE), between 2009 and 2011, 679 women have charged with the crime of abortion in the interior of the country.&lt;ref name=GIRE /&gt;&lt;ref name=Montalvo&gt;{{cite news|last=Montalvo|first=Tania|title=Una de cada 3 mujeres que interrumpe su embarazo en el DF es ama de casa|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2013/04/24/una-de-cada-3-mujeres-que-interrumpe-su-embarazo-en-el-df-es-ama-de-casa|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=CNN: Mexico|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, GIRE states that having legislation for each entity makes "access to abortion a matter of social injustice and gender discrimination."&lt;ref name=GIRE /&gt;&lt;ref name=Montalvo /&gt; According to the ''Omisión e Indiferencia: Derechos reproductivos en México'' (known as Omission and Indifference: Reproductive Rights in Mexico) presented by GIRE, only women with economic resources and information can travel to Mexico City to have an abortion "without the risk of being persecuted for committing a crime or do it in precarious conditions."&lt;ref name=GIRE /&gt;&lt;ref name=Montalvo /&gt;&lt;ref name="GIRE 2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Grupo de Informacion en Reproduccion Elegida |title=Aborto: Capitulo Uno |url=http://informe.gire.org.mx/caps/cap1.pdf |publisher=GIRE |accessdate=15 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317092501/http://informe.gire.org.mx/caps/cap1.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no official figures on [[Secrecy|clandestine]] abortions in the country, GIRE estimated that in 2009 159,000 women rushed to a hospital for complications of unsafe and illegal abortions.&lt;ref name=GIRE /&gt;&lt;ref name=Montalvo /&gt;&lt;ref name="GIRE 2013" /&gt;

In addition, restrictive abortion policies not only limit women's individual agency and autonomy, but force poor women to choose between an unsafe illegal medical procedure, and bearing unwanted children.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Thus, such policies create structural social and economic inequality.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

====Impact on health and the economy====
Research done by Maria Sanchez Fuentes et al. concludes that the health and economic costs of unsafe abortion are very high, in common with other preventable illnesses.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Moreover, those costs are higher for poor women, because only women with economic means and sufficient information can access abortion under safe medical conditions in Mexico, or travel to foreign countries where abortion is legal throughout.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; After the amendments to the abortion law in 2007, abortion services are now free of charge in public hospitals for Mexico City residents, which account for approximately one quarter of the country’s population, and available for a moderate fee for women from other states or countries.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

Before the passage of the amendments to the abortion law, many Mexican women would buy herbs from the market and try dangerous home versions of abortion in order to end their unwanted pregnancies &lt;ref name=Ford&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Allison|title=MEXICO CITY LEGALIZES ABORTION|journal=LAW AND BUSINESS REVIEW OF THE AMERICAS|date=2010|volume=16|issue=1|pages=119–127|url=http://studentorgs.law.smu.edu/getattachment/International-Law-Review-Association/Resources/LBRA-Archive/16-1/Article7.pdf.aspx|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also resorted to buying prescription drugs, obtained from pharmacists without a doctor’s signature, that would induce an abortion.&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; Moreover, some women even ingested huge doses of drugs for arthritis and gastritis, available over the counter, which can cause miscarriages.&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; All of these methods are significantly dangerous, and most are illegal.

The fifth leading cause of maternal mortality in Mexico is illegal, unsafe abortion.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kate S.|author2=Sandra G. Garcia|author3=Cudia Diaz Olvarrieta|author4=Aremic Villalobos-Hernandez|author5=Jorge Valencia Rodriguez|author6=Patricio Sanhueza Smith|author7= Courtney Burks|title=Public Opinion on Abortion in Mexico City after the Landmark Reform|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=September 2011|volume=42|issue=3|pages=175–182|jstor=41310727}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge proportion of poor and young women are forced to risk their health and lives in the conditions under which many clandestine abortions are practiced.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; 
This highlights the costs of unsafe abortion to the public-health system.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; In addition, women who undergo unsafe abortions and suffer complications or death represent the fourth highest cause of hospital admissions in Mexico’s public hospitals.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Health]] statistics show that in Mexico City, maternal mortality has been reduced significantly since the passage of the new law.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;

During 2008, the public health sector, under Mexico City's Ministry of Health, carried out 13,057 legal abortions, compared to 66 abortions between 2002 and 2007, when the legal indications were restricted to the four circumstances of rape, danger to the woman's life and health and congenital
malformations.&lt;ref name="Schiavon et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiavon|first=Rafael|author2=Maria E. Collado |author3=Erika Troncoso |author4=Jose E. Soto Sanchez |author5=Gabriela Otero Zorrilla |author6=Tia Palermo |title=Characteristics of private abortion services in Mexico City after legalization|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|date=November 2010|volume=18|issue=36|pages=127–135|jstor=25767368}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April 2007, the city's Ministry of Health started providing first trimester abortions free of charge to the estimated 43 percent of women residing in Mexico City with no public health insurance.&lt;ref name="Schiavon et al" /&gt;

A 2008 study funded by the National Population Council (''CONAPO''), [[El Colegio de México]] and the [[Guttmacher Institute]] estimated 880,000 abortions carried out annually, with an average of 33 abortions a year for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44.&lt;ref name="ips"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46946 |title=Avalanche of Anti-Abortion Laws |last=Cevallos |first=Diego |date=2009-05-22 |publisher=Inter Press Service |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726150317/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46946 |archivedate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such studies are speculative —as abortion is highly restricted and reliable data is not readily available— with some estimates ranging as low as 297,000 abortions per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html|title=The Incidence of abortion Worldwide|last=Henshaw|first=Stanley|date=1999-01-01 |publisher=International Family Planning Perspectives|accessdate=2010-04-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511193214/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html| archivedate= 11 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political community===
In the presidential election of 2006, a conservative candidate from the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] won the election by an "infinitesimal percentage, and the progressive [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]] candidate claimed fraud."&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; An article by Sanchez Fuentes et al., suggested that this caused polarization between the two parties and within Mexican society in general.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Since the PRD lost the presidential election, but maintained control of the local legislature and Mayor's Office in Mexico City, they demonstrated the differences between the left- and right-wing parties in the reproductive-rights context by supporting the change in the law.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

In 2007, the legal proposal to decriminalize abortion, led by the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]], was introduced in the [[Mexico City Legislative Assembly]] (LAFD).&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; In this Mexico City abortion reform, "the policy community (including the center-left political parties; the Mexico City government, represented by the Mayor's Office; the local Ministry of Health; and the local Human Rights Ombudsman), along with academics, opinion leaders, and leading scientists, was very much united, and vocal in support of decriminalization".&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Mexico City's then-mayor [[Marcelo Ebrard]], from the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]], declared, "This is a women's cause, but it is also the city's cause."&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Manifestations of support for the bill came in the form of public announcements by public figures, printed in national newspapers, which are a key means of influencing public opinion and debate in Mexico, as well as via press declarations, and interviews, as suggested by.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; A public announcement published on April 17, 2007, by the Academy of Bioethics, which outlined why the decriminalization of up to 12 weeks was not contradictory to scientific evidence, affirmed that, "an embryo at this stage has not developed a cerebral cortex or nerve endings, does not feel pain, and is not a human being or person".&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Sanchez Fuentes et al. concluded that this bioethics perspective influenced the discourse surrounding the debate.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

===Anti-abortion movement by the Catholic Church===
Knowing the potential involvement of the Catholic church on this reform, LAFD pitched the debate as a necessary protection for women-particularly poor women.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; This justification was meant to resonate especially with the largely Catholic population, religious interest groups, and the Catholic healthcare professionals.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; While public opinion in Mexico City is largely in favor of legal abortion, the negotiation with religious as well as conscientiously objecting doctors and nurses was proven difficult.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KS Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kate S.|author2=García SG|author3=Díaz Olavarrieta C|author4=Villalobos-Hernández A|author5=Rodríguez JV|author6=Smith PS|author7= Burks C.|title=Public opinion on abortion in Mexico City after the landmark reform|journal=Studies in family planning|date=September 2011|volume=42|issue=3|pages=175–182|pmid=21972670|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2011.00279.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their religious faith had a major impact on the negotiation, because of Catholic's view on abortion as a sin.

The anti-abortion movement in Mexico has been led by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; The Church remains influential in Mexico, and in any discussion of abortion, the government must discuss the reactions and policies of the Church.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; It is also the Church's influence that has guided the debate towards a health rationale rather than a choice rationale – staying away from a pro-choice stance.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; After the law was passed in April 2007, the Catholic Church collected
70,000 signatures supporting an abortion referendum.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;

Under Articles 6 and 24, the Mexican constitution protects citizens with freedom of religion in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; During the first few weeks after the law passed in 2007, many doctors and nurses did not partake in abortions due to their faith.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times Malkin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico City Struggles With Law on Abortion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/world/americas/25mexico.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 August 2008|author=ELISABETH MALKIN|author2=NACHA CATTAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobar&gt;{{cite news|last=Tobar|first=Hector|title=In Mexico, abortion is out from shadows|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/03/world/fg-abortion3|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LAFD dealt with the Church's influence on public hospitals and their employees by reinforcing the reforms made in the Robles law (the law permitting abortion to be legal in [[Federal District (Mexico)]] and requiring, in Article 14 Bis 6 of the Health Law, that once again hospitals must have non-objecting doctors on call for abortions).&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; The Robles Law uses language that makes it clear that the right to object on religious grounds is not absolute and that the woman's right to receive the abortion trumps the doctor's right to object where no non-objecting doctor can be located.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; Furthermore, Article 14 Bis 3 established the Clinical Commission for Evaluation to ensure that doctors were performing abortions and that every time a woman requests information about an abortion, it is recorded by an independent, centralized body of the government.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; Former Secretary of Health, Manuel Mondragon, under the Mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, worked to make sure that abortions were readily available to women who sought them under the legal circumstances.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt; Essentially, the law incorporates a conscientious objection exemption for health care providers, and similarly requires that hospitals then provide a woman with an alternate provider, who will perform the abortion.&lt;ref name="Thea B Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times Malkin" /&gt; Furthermore, the separation of church and state is enshrined in the Mexican Reform Laws of 1859.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; Therefore, the attempt by the Church to influence politics was illegal, and their threat of excommunication was invalid.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt; The major separation of the church and state did not permit for religious reasoning to be the major influence on policies, but the Catholic church threatened to prohibit the individuals supporting the policy from attending any religious sanctions and ceremonies.

According to Sanchez Fuentes et al., more than 80 percent of the women who have sought services are Catholic, and formally educated, claiming to help destigmatize abortion, influencing public opinion.&lt;ref name="Sanchez Fuentes" /&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Airport racial profiling in the United States''' is U.S. government activity directed at a [[suspect]] or group of suspects because of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]] or [[ethnicity]]. Under analysis [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], objective factors measure whether [[law enforcement]] action is constitutional, and under the Fourteenth Amendment challenges to the practice are assessed under the customary [[strict scrutiny]] test for [[racial classifications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Santa Clara University|title=Racial Profiling in an Age of Terrorism|author=Peter Siggins|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/resources/racial-profiling-in-an-age-of-terrorism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], there have been reports on increases in [[Race (human categorization)|racial profiling]] at [[airport]]s, particularly targeting people who [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|appear to be Muslim or of Middle Eastern descent]]. It has been a routine practice by law enforcement officials to stop individuals who are profiled because of their race and religious and ethnic appearance or who may appear to be "suspicious".&lt;ref&gt;Testimony from Amnesty International USA's hearing on racial profiling through airports&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the weeks following September 11, 2001, [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal]], state and local law enforcement officials investigated those responsible for the September 11 attacks during which nearly 3,000 people died. They assessed the United States's vulnerability to future acts of [[terrorism]]. Investigations showed the suspects of the crime to be of Middle Eastern origin.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, US officials responded to the fears of air travelers by reinforcing [[Airport security|security]]. Despite more thorough investigation of [[baggage]] and increased security staffing, there were so many vast open spaces, exits and entrances at airport hubs that prevention of incidents was problematic.

[[Los Angeles International Airport]] was recently found to be the most vulnerable to infiltration in the US when it comes to smuggling weapons. [[Knife|Knives]], [[gun]]s, and [[explosives]] carried by federal undercover inspectors were missed by LA International airport screeners at checkpoints 41% of the time in an airport security test. The test, which checked security at America's 32 biggest airports, was carried out in June by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), which assumed responsibility for airport security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=BBC News|title=Attack shows limits to airport security|date=July 5, 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2096081.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A 2009 study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] asserted that, due to terrorists being vastly outnumbered by innocents, racial profiling is no more effective than random profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Press|first=William|title=Strong profiling is not mathematically optimal for discovering rare malfeasors|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=23 December 2008|doi=10.1073/pnas.0813202106|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/study-racial-profiling-no-more-effective-than-random-screen.ars|accessdate=12 May 2011|volume=106|pages=1716–1719|pmc=2634801}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that any form of profiling is less secure than random profiling, because a terrorist cell can simply have a number of members go through airport security, until one is reliably not profiled, then use that individual to perform an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chakrabarti |first=Samidh |title=Carnival Booth: An Algorithm for Defeating the Computer-Assisted Passenger Screening System |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/spring02-papers/caps.htm |accessdate=12 May 2011 |author2=Aaron Strauss |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ycaf0zz0?url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/spring02-papers/caps.htm |archivedate=12 May 2011 |date=16 May 2002 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the 19 successful hijackers in the [[September 11 attacks]] were reported or even remembered by checkpoint supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahlers |first=Mike M. |title=TSA security looks at people who complain about ...

[[Michael Kinsley]] asked in a 2001 article for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine if a rational reason exists to single out [[Arabic]]-looking men at airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Slate Magazine|title=Discrimination we're afraid to be against|author=Michael Kinsley|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/readme/2001/09/racial_profiling_at_the_airport.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Downing, the national coordinator of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Campaign Against Airport Racial Profiling, says he was the victim of profiling by police at [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], MA. He was going to the federal court to challenge a screening technique used around the country that looks at suspicious behavior patterns to identify potential terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22087842/ns/travel-news/t/aclu-official-alleges-racial-profiling-airport/|work=MSNBC Travel News|title=ACLU official alleges racial profiling at airport|author=Michael Dwer/AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Downing alleges he was stopped and questioned by [[state police]] after arriving on a flight to attend a meeting on racial profiling. He has sued the [[Massachusetts Port Authority]], which operates the airport, and the [[Massachusetts State Police]], citing they violated his [[constitutional right]]s. Downing, who is black and wears a short beard, believes he was targeted because of his race. In his [[lawsuit]], Downing alleges the behavioral screening system used at Logan Airport encourages racial profiling. His lawsuit also seeks a ruling to declare airport racial profiling as unconstitutional.

In 2002, after the September 11 attack on the US, Logan Airport began a program called "Behavior Assessment Screening System" which allows police to question passengers whose behavior appears to be "suspicious". Logan was the first airport in the country to use the system.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  The plausibility of any benefit from "Behavior Assessment" has been questioned in a 2012 study by G. Stuart Mendenhall and Mark Schmidhofer of the [[Cato Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendenhall|first=G. Stuart|title=Screening Tests for Terrorism|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2013/1/v35n4-4.pdf|journal=[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]|date=December 2012|author2=Mark Schmidhofer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

The Fourth Amendment provides that "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated". In its 1968 Fourth Amendment ruling, [[Terry v. Ohio]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found that reasonable, articulable suspicion was sufficient grounds for a police officer to briefly stop and question a citizen. They ruled that such suspicion must not be based on the officer's "inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch,' but on the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience". Terry employed a "totality of circumstances" test to determine the reasonableness of police investigatory stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feder|first1=Jody|title=Racial Profiling: Legal and Constitutional Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31130.pdf|website=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US support==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]]'s decision to heighten airport security for passengers while traveling to the US from 14 nations triggered a backlash of complaints from Muslim and [[privacy]] groups{{which|date=September 2016}} who say President [[Barack Obama]]'s response to terror threats amounted to little more than racial profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Nancy|title=Obama and the global war on terror|journal=Race &amp; Class|date=2011|volume=53|issue=2|pages=84–93|doi=10.1177/0306396811413046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Cilluffo, former special assistant for Homeland Security under then-President [[George W. Bush]], said "airports need to be 'profiling' based on behavior even though it's a 'dirty word.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fox News|title=Airport Security Measures Draw Accusations of 'Profiling'|work=www.foxnews.com|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/06/airport-security-measures-draw-accusations-profiling.html|date=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 poll by ''[[USA Today]]'' showed Americans were in favor of more intensive security check for people who fit a profile of a terrorist based on age, ethnicity and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=USA Today|author=Susan Page|title= Poll: Most support ethnic profiling in air security|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-01-12-poll-terrorism-obama_N.htm|date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">'''Al-Mahdi Ali bin Mohammed''' (September 25, 1305 - 1372) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1349-1372.

==Acquiring the Zaidi imamate==

The Yemeni [[imamate]] in the highlands was often contested by rival claimants in this era. Ali bin Muhammad al-Hosni was born in the village al-Ahani in the [[Sa'dah]] area in northern Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidi biographies, in http://www.al-aalam.com/personinfo.asp?pid=636 (in Arabic).&lt;/ref&gt; He was not closely related to the recent imams, but an 11th-generation descendant of the imam [[ad-Da'i Yusuf]].&lt;ref&gt;Imam Zaid bin Ali Cultural Foundation, {{cite web|url=http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726200212/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=48 |archivedate=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic). The line of descent is ad-Da'i Yusuf - al-Qasim - Yahya - Ali - al-Hajjaj - al-Mufaddal - al-Mansur - Yahya - al-Mansur - Ali - Muhammad - al-Mahdi Ali.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Ali received a good deal of instruction in the religious sciences. In 1346, the learned and powerful Imam [[al-Mu'ayyad Yahya]] died, and no politically strong figure emerged in his stead. Under these circumstances, Ali rose to power from his base in the mountain fortress [[Thula]] in 1349. In the presence of a numerous congregation of Zaidi scholars, he adopted the title al-Mahdi Ali and took possession of [[Sa'dah]] and [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]. At this time, [[San'a]] was dominated by two Zaidi [[emir]]s and brothers called Ibrahim bin Abdallah and Da'ud bin Abdallah. Al-Mahdi Ali laid siege to the city. However, the brothers held firm and after six months he had to lift the siege and return to Thula.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Sergeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for Nur ad-Din==

During his 23 years long reign, al-Mahdi Ali was nevertheless able to amass considerable political influence in Yemen. The powerful [[Rasulid Dynasty]] ruled the lowlands, but its grip on the northern inland had been shattered since some time. The Rasulid [[emir]] of Hadar, Nur ad-Din Muhammad bin Mika'il, turned rebellious against Sultan al-Mujahid Ali in 1359. In the next year, he sought support from the Zaidi elite of Sa'dah. Nur ad-Din entertained plans to take over the sultanate. Over the following years, he organized several raids into Rasulid territory with Zaidi assistance, with mixed success. Al-Mahdi Ali bestowed the fortress Miftah as an [[appanage]], and the rebel resided there until his demise in 1377.&lt;ref&gt;El-Khazreji, ''The Pearl-Strings; A History of the Resuli Dynasty'', Vol. II. Leiden 1907, pp. 92, 96, 144-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mahdi Ali himself died in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] in 1372, after his authority had begun to recede. His body was carried to Sa'dah to be buried there. He was succeeded by his son [[al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din|an-Nasir Muhammad Salah ad-Din]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 996; H.C.

The '''Altai Uriankhai''' ({{lang-mn|Алтайн Урианхай}}, ''Altain Urianhai'' or ''Altai-yn Urianhai''; {{zh|t=阿爾泰烏梁海|s=阿尔泰乌梁海|p=Ā'ěrtài Wūliánghǎi}}) refer to a [[Mongols|Mongolian]] tribe around the [[Altai Mountains]] that were organized by the [[Qing dynasty]]. They now form a subgroup in western [[Mongolia]] and eastern [[Xinjiang]]. 
[[File:AltaiUrianhaiJutgeltGunHoshuu.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Jütgelt Gün's hoshuu (banner) of the Altai Urianhai in western [[Mongolia]].]]
The [[Uriyangkhai]] or Uriankhai people first appeared in the 7th century as one of the people in [[Mongolia]] (Legend of the Erkune kun). The Mongolian term [[Uriankhai]] (Uriyangkhai) had been applied to all [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] or [[Mongol]] people to the north-west of Mongolia in the 17th century. The Uriyangkhai in this sense were first subjugated by the [[Khotgoid]] [[Khalkha]] and then by the [[Dzungars]].

In the mid 14th century, they lived in [[Liaoyang province]] of modern [[China]]. After the rebellion of the northern Uriankhai people, they were conquered by [[Dayan Khan]] in 1538 and mostly annexed by the northern [[Khalkha]]. 

Second group of Uriankhai (Uriankhai of the [[Khentii Mountains]]) lived in central Mongolia and they started moving to the [[Altai Mountains]] in beginning 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.Ochir, Ts.Baasandorj "Custom of the Oirat wedding". 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups migrated to [[Khövsgöl Province]] during the course of the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] (1368-1691).&lt;ref name="Crossley"&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Introduction to the Qing Foundation Myth|first=Pamela Kyle|last=Crossley|authorlink=Pamela Kyle Crossley|journal=Late Imperial China|volume=6|number=2|date=December 1985|pages=13–24|doi=10.1353/late.1985.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Dzungar Khanate]], the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1757 organized the far northern frontier into a series of Uriankhai banners: the [[Khövsgöl Lake|Khövsgöl Nuur]] Uriyangkhai, [[Tannu Uriankhai]], [[Kemchik]], Salchak, and Toju and [[Altay people|Altan-nuur Uriyangkhai]].

In the [[Altai Range]], 7 Altai Uriankhai banners were established into two wings attached to Qing [[amban]]s. Their territory included eastern [[Khovd Province]] and [[Khövsgöl Province]]. Most were Oirat Mongolian speakers with [[Oirats|Oirat]], [[Buryat people|Buriat]], or [[Mongols|Mongolian]] clan names, but some were [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]] speakers. 

In the aftermath of the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]] (1864-77), the [[Kazakhs]] migrated into Altai Uriankhai territory. In 1906, the Qing court transferred Altai Uriankhai banner from Khovd's jurisdiction to the new Altai district, with its capital Chenghua. In 1913, the district was divided between [[Boghda Khaanate of Mongolia]] and the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]], leaving some Uriankhais in far northwestern Xinjiang. The Altai Uriankhai in Mongolia were attached to the [[Dorbed]]s. However, the Altai Uriankhai and the Kazakhs formed [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]] in 1940. Notable Altayin Uriyankhgai people include Damchaa .B, the movie actor and the specialist in [[Esperanto]] of Mongolia.

'''Armenian Sign Language''' is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Armenia]]. It is not known if it bears any relationship to [[Caucasian Sign Language]], which was used by Armenian women during periods of mourning because of [[speech taboo]]s.

==Classification==
Wittmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; posits that ArSL is a [[language isolate]] (a 'prototype' sign language).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">'''Aymeric Picaud''' was a 12th-century French scholar, monk and [[pilgrim]] from [[Parthenay|Parthenay-le-Vieux]] in [[Poitou]]. He is most widely known today as being the suspected author of the [[Codex Calixtinus]], an [[illuminated manuscript]] giving background information for pilgrims travelling the [[Way of St. James]]. In essence, he wrote one of the earliest known tourist guidebooks.

==Aymeric's Basque material==
Among [[Basque language|Basque]] scholars, Amyeric's account of his journey to [[Santiago de Compostela]] (around the year 1140) is considered as highly important because it contains some of the earliest Basque words and phrases of the post-Roman period.

The words and phrases he recorded are:&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reports of CTP came simultaneously from the labs of Yokozawa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Yokoyama, A. |author2=Miyakoshi, R| author3= Yokozawa, T|journal=Macromolecules| doi=10.1021/ma035396o | title=Chain-Growth Polymerization for Poly(3-hexylthiophene) with a Defined Molecular Weight and a Low Polydispersity | year = 2004 | volume = 37 | pages=1169-1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McCullough&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Elena E. Sheina |author2=Jinsong Liu| author3= Mihaela Corina Iovu|author4=Darin W. Laird|author5=Richard D. McCullough| journal=Macromolecules| doi=10.1021/ma0357063 | title=Chain Growth Mechanism for Regioregular Nickel-Initiated Cross-Coupling Polymerizations | year = 2004 | volume = 37 | pages=3526-3528}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004, with the recognition that [[polythiophene]] can be synthesized with low dispersity and control over molecular weight when a grignard thiophene monomer was polymerized with Nickel(1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane)dichloride. This recognition sparked interest in the system, and its expansion to other monomers. Despite major advances in the field, relatively few polymers can be synthesized via CTP because the lack of a "universal CTP catalyst" means that every monomer must be paired with a different catalyst in order to obtain ideal living chain-growth behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Amanda K. Leone |author2=Anne J. McNeil|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research| doi=10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00488 | title=Matchmaking in Catalyst-Transfer Polycondensation: Optimizing Catalysts based on Mechanistic Insight | year = 2016 | volume = 49 | pages=2822-2831}}&lt;/ref&gt; This need to pair monomers to catalysts means most conjugated polymers are synthesized via palladium catalyzed step-growth polycondensation [[cross-coupling reaction|cross-coupling reactions]].

==Characteristics==
CTP is exclusively performed on [[arene]] monomers to give conjugated polymers. The polymers obtained from a true CTP are often low dispersity and contain consistent end groups (two on each chain, one put on the polymer chain end during initiation, and the other put on during termination). These result from the fact that CTP is a living, chain growth polymerization, and mean that the average molecular weight of the polymers from a CTP reaction can be tuned by changing the relative amounts of catalyst and monomer at the start of the reaction. 

CTP is thought to be important in that control over molecular weight (imparted by CTP) means control over conjugation length in conjugated polymers. Average conjugation length of a conjugated polymer can have a large impact in applications such as [[solar cells]] and [[transistors]], both fields that are starting to use organic electronics. 

==Types==
CTP is closely related to many group 10 metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions (see ''Mechanism'' below), and often, monomers used in CTP contain magnesium-, zinc-, boron-, and tin-based transmetallating groups, giving rise to [[Kumada coupling|Kumada]] CTP (K-CTP), [[Negishi coupling|Negishi]] CTP (N-CTP), [[Suzuki coupling|Suzuki]] CTP (B-CTP), and [[Stille coupling|Stille]] CTP (S-CTP) reactions, respectively. 

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of CTP has been debated. The living chain-growth nature of CTP can be explained by the existence of a π-complex (as described in this section) but can also be explained via polymer reactivity. A common feature of both pathways is their similarity to other nickel and palladium catalyzed [[cross-coupling reaction|cross-coupling reactions]].

===Initiation===
[[File:Initiationpicomplex.png|frameless|center|640px|]]
Initiation from a nickel(II) species involves two monomers transmetalating onto the nickel center to form a complex that can easily undergo reductive elimination. The complex formed after reductive elimination is characterized by the metal, now nickel(0), bound to the π system of the monomer. This π-complex means that the catalysts is not free to dissociate and start polymer chains, forcing monomers to add to the growing chain. The catalyst migrates, via ring-walking, to the π-bond adjacent to the C-X bond at the end of the dimer, allowing oxidative addition to occur, forming the active polymer-nickel(II)-bromide catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Zachary J. Bryan |author2=Anne J. McNeil| journal=Macromolecules| doi=10.1021/ma401314x | title=Conjugated Polymer Synthesis via Catalyst-Transfer Polycondensation (CTP): Mechanism, Scope, and Applications | year = 2013 | volume = 46 | pages=8395-8405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propagation===
[[File:Propagation copy.png|framless|center|700px]]
The propagation steps of CTP occurs through a similar cycle of transmetalation, reductive elimination, ring walking, and oxidative addition. The existence of a π-complex allows for the polymerization to be controlled as it ensures that the catalyst cannot dissociate from the polymer chain (and start new chains). This means that the number of polymer chains at the end of the polymerization should be equal to the number of catalysts in solution and that the average degree of polymerization in the sample at the end of polymerization should be equal to the ratio of monomers to catalysts in solution (e.g. if there are 50 equivalents of monomer to one equivalent of catalyst, most of the polymers at the end of polymerization will have 50 repeat units).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Zachary J. Bryan |author2=Anne J. McNeil| journal=Macromolecules| doi=10.1021/ma401314x | title=Conjugated Polymer Synthesis via Catalyst-Transfer Polycondensation (CTP): Mechanism, Scope, and Applications | year = 2013 | volume = 46 | pages=8395-8405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===
A characteristic of a true CTP is living growth character, meaning that once all monomer has been converted, addition of more monomer to the polymerization should result in monomers being added to the end of polymer chains (rather than starting new chains). This should be true of CTP, but the [[organometallic]] nature of the polymer chain end (being capped with the nickel catalyst after C-X oxidative addition), means that if the polymerization is allowed to go to high conversion, [[disproportionation]] occurs between two chain ends forming polymers with an integer multiple of the expected molecular weight. For this reason, when CTP is used to make polymers of a specific molecular weight, the polymerization is terminated early by addition of strong acid, iodine, or bromine.

[[File:Disproportionation.png|frameless|center|1000px]]

Additionally, if the π-complex is too weakly bound, termination of polymer chains can occur if a chain transfer agent (i.e. solvent, monomer, polymer, any species that can bind to the catalyst) displaces the catalyst from its polymer chain, poisoning the catalyst or starting new chains. This gives polymers with lower than expected average molecular weight.
 
[[File:Chaintransfertomonomer.png|frameless|center|650px]]

Current research into CTP focuses on finding catalysts that form strong catalyst-polymer π-complexes such that the polymerization remains living.

==Analysis==
Success of CTP is often evaluated using [[gel permeation chromatography]], [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], and [[gas chromatography]]. GPC characterization allows for determination of average molecular weight and whether disproportionation has occurred (evidenced by multiple peaks in the GPC trace at different, integer multiple molecular weights of the lowest molecular weight peak). MALDI and NMR allow for identification of end groups of the polymer chain, which can help to elucidate if the polymerization is living. And GC allows for determination of conversion, and can be used in conjunction with other methods to create a molecular weight vs. monomer conversion plot. 

==Polymer Reactivity versus π-complex==
In theory, the chain growth nature of CTP can be described without invoking a catalyst-polymer π-complex. If we assume that no π-complex forms and instead every time a monomer was added to a polymer, the polymer becomes more reactive, we would also see chain growth since the largest polymers in the reaction would be the most reactive and would react with monomers preferentially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Zachary J. Bryan |author2=Ariana O. Hall|author3=Carolyn T. Zhao|author4=Jing Chen|author5=Anne J.

The difference between these two explanations of chain-growth can be elucidated by studying the presence of end groups of the polymers using mass spectrometry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Kendra D.

'''Chechens in France''' is a small diaspora in [[France]] but one of the most important groups in the [[Chechen people|Chechen diaspora]].

== History ==
The Chechen immigrants came in [[France]] at the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], because of the two [[Chechen Wars (disambiguation)|Chechen Wars]]. They came as [[political refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/country,,,,AUT,,5139cf902,0.html&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are approximately 30,000 [[Chechens]] in [[France]], and 60,000 in the [[European Union]].

The '''combined oral contraceptive pill''' ('''COCP'''), often referred to as the '''birth control pill''' or colloquially as "'''the pill'''", is a type of [[birth control]] that is designed to be taken orally by women. It includes a combination of an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] (usually [[ethinylestradiol]]) and a [[progestogen]] (specifically a [[progestin]]). When taken correctly, it alters the [[menstrual cycle]] to eliminate [[ovulation]] and prevent [[pregnancy]].

They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are currently used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million women in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mosher WD, Martinez GM, Chandra A, Abma JC, Willson SJ | title = Use of contraception and use of family planning services in the United States: 1982–2002 | journal = Adv Data | issue = 350 | pages = 1–36 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15633582 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad350.pdf | format = PDF }} all US women aged 15–44&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, 16% of U.S. women aged 15–44 reported being on the birth control pill, making it the most widely used contraceptive method among women of that age range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states#5|title=Contraceptive Use in the United States|date=2004-08-04|newspaper=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use varies widely by country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = UN Population Division| title = World Contraceptive Use 2005| url = https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/contraceptive2005/2005_World_Contraceptive_files/WallChart_WCU2005.pdf| format = PDF| year = 2006| publisher = United Nations| location = New York| isbn = 92-1-151418-5 }} women aged 15–49 married or in consensual union&lt;/ref&gt; age, education, and marital status.

For the first 21 days of the cycle, users take a daily pill that contains hormones (estrogen and progestogen). The last 7 days of the cycle are hormone free days. Some packets only contain 21 pills and users are then advised to take no pills for the following week. Other packets contain 7 additional [[placebo]] pills, or biologically inactive pills. Some newer formulations have 24 days of active hormone pills, followed by 4 days of placebo (examples include Yaz 28 and Loestrin 24 Fe) or even 84 days of active hormone pills, followed by 7 days of placebo pills ([[Seasonale]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A woman on the pill will have a withdrawal bleed sometime during her placebo pill or no pill days, and is still protected from pregnancy during this time. Then after 28 days, or 91 days depending on which type a person is using, users start a new pack and a new cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://youngwomenshealth.org/birth-control-pills-all-guides/ Birth Control Pills All Guides]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effectiveness ===
If used exactly as instructed, the estimated risk of getting pregnant is 0.3%, or about 3 in 1000 women on COCPs will become pregnant within one year.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use|publisher=|others=World Health Organization.

Several factors account for typical use effectiveness being lower than perfect use effectiveness:
* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the user
* conscious user non-compliance with instructions.
For instance, someone using oral forms of hormonal birth control might be given incorrect information by a health care provider as to the frequency of intake, forget to take the pill one day, or simply not go to the pharmacy on time to renew the prescription.

COCPs provide effective contraception from the very first pill if started within five days of the beginning of the [[menstrual cycle]] (within five days of the first day of [[menstruation]]). If started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, COCPs provide effective contraception only after 7 consecutive days use of active pills, so a backup method of contraception (such as condoms) must be used until active pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days. COCPs should be taken at approximately the same time every day.&lt;ref name="Speroff 20052"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Clinical Guide for Contraception|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7817-6488-9|edition=4th|location=Philadelphia|pages=21–138|chapter=Oral Contraception}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FFPRHC COC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffprhc.org.uk/admin/uploads/FirstPrescCombOralContJan06.pdf|title=Clinical Guidance: First Prescription of Combined Oral Contraception|author=[[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|FFPRHC]]|year=2007|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704044305/http://www.ffprhc.org.uk/admin/uploads/FirstPrescCombOralContJan06.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-04|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the combined oral contraceptive pill appears to be similar whether the active pills are taken continuously for prolonged periods of time or if they are taken for 21 active days and 7 days as placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Jul 29, 2014|title=Continuous or extended cycle vs. cyclic use of combined hormonal contraceptives for contraception.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|issue=7|pages=CD004695|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004695.pub3|pmid=25072731|vauthors=Edelman A, Micks E, Gallo MF, Jensen JT, Grimes DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraceptive efficacy may be impaired by:

# missing more than one active pill in a packet,
# delay in starting the next packet of active pills (i.e., extending the pill-free, inactive or placebo pill period beyond 7 days),
# [[Intestine|intestinal]] [[malabsorption]] of active pills due to [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]],
# drug interactions with active pills that decrease contraceptive estrogen or progestogen levels.&lt;ref name="Speroff 20052" /&gt;

In any of these instances, a back up method should be used until consistent use of active pills (for 7 consecutive days) has resumed, the interacting drug has been discontinued or illness has been resolved.

According to CDC guidelines, a pill is only considered 'missed' if 24 hours or more have passed since the last pill taken. If less than 24 hours have passed, the pill is considered "late."&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

===Role of placebo pills===
The role of the [[placebo]] pills is two-fold: to allow the user to continue the routine of taking a pill every day and to simulate the average [[menstrual cycle]]. By continuing to take a pill everyday, users remain in the daily habit even during the week without hormones. Failure to take pills during the placebo week does not impact the effectiveness of the pill, provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthline.com/health/birth-control/last-week-of-birth-control-pills#1 Last Week of Birth Control Pills]&lt;/ref&gt;

The placebo, or hormone-free, week in the 28-day pill package simulates an average menstrual cycle, though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. Because the pill suppresses ovulation (to be discussed more in the Mechanism of Action section), birth control users do not have true menstrual periods. Instead, it is the lack of hormones for a week that causes a withdrawal bleed.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The withdrawal bleeding that occurs during the break from active pills has been thought to be reassuring, a physical confirmation of not being pregnant.&lt;ref name="gladwell2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|date=2000-03-10|title=John Rock's Error|url=http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm|journal=The New Yorker|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511133811/http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm|archivedate=11 May 2013|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The withdrawal bleeding is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/birth-control-pill/WO00098|title=Birth control pill FAQ: Benefits, risks and choices|last=Mayo Clinic staff|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it is not uncommon for menstruating women to become anemic, some placebo pills may contain an [[iron]] supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6451778/description.html|title=US Patent:Oral contraceptive:Patent 6451778 Issued on September 17, 2002 Estimated Expiration Date: July 2, 2017.|publisher=PatentStorm LLC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613020809/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6451778/description.html|archivedate=June 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Serge Herceberg|author2=Paul Preziosi|author3=Pilar Galan|title=Iron deficiency in Europe|url=http://www.idpas.org/pdf/1174IronDeficiencyinEurope.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=Public Health Nutrition|volume=4|issue=2B|pages=537–545|doi=10.1079/phn2001139|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170714/http://www.idpas.org/pdf/1174IronDeficiencyinEurope.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-26|accessdate=2010-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This replenishes iron stores that may become depleted during menstruation.

===No or less frequent placebos===
{{Main|Extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pill}}
If the pill formulation is monophasic, meaning each hormonal pill contains a fixed dose of hormones, it is possible to skip withdrawal bleeding and still remain protected against conception by skipping the placebo pills altogether and starting directly with the next packet. Attempting this with bi- or tri-phasic pill formulations carries an increased risk of [[breakthrough bleeding]] and may be undesirable. It will not, however, increase the risk of getting pregnant.

Starting in 2003, women have also been able to use a three-month version of the pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01251.html|title=FDA Approves Seasonal Oral Contraceptive|author=FDA|date=2003-09-25|work=|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007101134/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01251.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2006-10-07|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the effect of using a constant-dosage formulation and skipping the placebo weeks for three months, [[Seasonale]] gives the benefit of less frequent periods, at the potential drawback of breakthrough bleeding. Seasonique is another version in which the placebo week every three months is replaced with a week of low-dose estrogen.

A version of the combined pill has also been packaged to completely eliminate placebo pills and withdrawal bleeds. Marketed as Anya or Lybrel, studies have shown that after seven months, 71% of users no longer had any breakthrough bleeding, the most common side effect of going longer periods of time without breaks from active pills.

While more research needs to be done to assess the long term safety of using COCP's continuously, studies have shown no difference in short term adverse effects when comparing continuous use versus cyclic use of birth control pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Continuous or extended cycle vs. cyclic use of combined oral contraceptives for contraception|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004695/full|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-contraceptive use===
The hormones in the pill have also been used to treat other medical conditions, such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), [[endometriosis]], [[adenomyosis]], acne, hirsutism, [[amenorrhea]], menstrual cramps, menstrual migraines, menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), menstruation-related or fibroid-related anemia and [[dysmenorrhea]] (painful menstruation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/med-uses-ocp.html|title=Medical Uses of the Birth Control Pill|last=CYWH Staff|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Besides acne, no oral contraceptives have been approved by the U.S. FDA for the previously mentioned uses despite extensive use for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm450624.htm|title=Information for Consumers (Drugs) - Find Information about a Drug|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== PCOS ====
PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, is a syndrome that is caused by hormonal imbalances. Women with PCOS often have higher than normal levels of estrogen all the time because their hormonal cycles are not regular.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Over time, high levels of uninhibited estrogen can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, or overgrowth of tissue in the uterus. This overgrowth is more likely to become cancerous than normal endometrial tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Barakat RR, Park RC, Grigsby PW, et al. Corpus: Epithelial Tumors. In: Principles and Practice of Gynecologic Oncology, 2nd, Hoskins WH, Perez CA, Young RC (Eds), Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia 1997. p.859&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the data varies, it is generally agreed upon by most gynecological societies that due to the high estrogen levels that women with PCOS have, they are at higher risk for endometrial hyperplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardiman|first=Paul|last2=Pillay|first2=Ouma C.|last3=Atiomo|first3=William|date=2003-05-24|title=Polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial carcinoma|journal=Lancet|volume=361|issue=9371|pages=1810–1812|issn=0140-6736|pmid=12781553|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13409-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce this risk, it is often recommended that women with PCOS take hormonal contraceptives to regulate their hormones. Both COCPs and progestin-only methods are recommended. COCPs are preferred in women who also suffer from uncontrolled acne and symptoms of hirsutism, or male patterned hair growth, because COCPs can help treats these symptoms.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

==== Endometriosis ====
For pelvic pain associated with endometriosis, COCPs are considered a first-line medical treatment, along with NSAIDs, GnRH agonists, and aromatase inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-acog-org.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/Patients/FAQs/Endometriosis#treated|title=ACOG Endometriosis FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; COCPs work to suppress the growth of the extra-uterine endometrial tissue. This works to lessen its inflammatory effects.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; COCPs, along with the other medical treatments listed above, do not eliminate the extra-uterine tissue growth, they just reduce the symptoms. Surgery is the only definitive treatment. Studies looking at rates of pelvic pain reoccurrence after surgery have shown that continuous use of COCPs is more effective at reducing the recurrence of pain than cyclic use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorbas|first=Konstantinos A.|last2=Economopoulos|first2=Konstantinos P.|last3=Vlahos|first3=Nikos F.|date=2015-07-01|title=Continuous versus cyclic oral contraceptives for the treatment of endometriosis: a systematic review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-015-3641-1|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|language=en|volume=292|issue=1|pages=37–43|doi=10.1007/s00404-015-3641-1|issn=0932-0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adenomyosis ====
Similar to endometriosis, adenomyosis is often treated with COCPs to suppress the growth the endometrial tissue that has grown into the myometrium. Unlike endometriosis however, levonorgetrel containing IUDs are more effective at reducing pelvic pain in adenomyosis than COCPs.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

==== Acne ====
Oral contraceptives are sometimes prescribed as medication for mild or moderate acne, although none are approved by the U.S. FDA for that sole purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Treating acne with oral contraceptives: Use of lower doses|journal=Contraception|volume=73|issue=1|pages=23–9|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2005.07.010|pmid=16371290|vauthors=Huber J, Walch K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three different oral contraceptives have been FDA approved to treat moderate acne if the person is at least 14 or 15 years old, have already begun menstruating, and need contraception.  They include [[Ortho Tri-Cyclen]], [[Estrostep]], and [[Drospirenone|YAZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/birth-control-for-acne-treatment|title=Birth Control of Acne|last=Chang, MD|first=Louise|publisher=WebMD, LLC|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=384e7a40-dcbd-4908-bf5e-65abc9932973#section-1.1|title=DailyMed - ORTHO TRI CYCLEN- norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol  ORTHO CYCLEN- norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol|website=dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Amenorrhea ====
Although the pill is sometimes prescribed to induce menstruation on a regular schedule for women bothered by irregular menstrual cycles, it actually suppresses the normal menstrual cycle and then mimics a regular 28-day monthly cycle.

Women who are experiencing menstrual dysfunction due to [[female athlete triad]] are sometimes prescribed oral contraceptives as pills that can create menstrual bleeding cycles.&lt;ref name="AMSSMfive2"&gt;{{Citation|title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question|date=24 April 2014|url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-medical-society-for-sports-medicine/|author1=American Medical Society for Sports Medicine|author1-link=American Medical Society for Sports Medicine|work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]|page=|publisher=American Medical Society for Sports Medicine|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the condition's underlying cause is energy deficiency and should be treated by correcting the imbalance between calories eaten and calories burned by exercise. Oral contraceptives should not be used as an initial treatment for female athlete triad.&lt;ref name="AMSSMfive2" /&gt;

==Contraindications==
While combined oral contraceptives are generally considered to be a relatively safe medication, they are contraindicated for people with certain medical conditions. Estrogen in high doses can increase a person's risk for blood clots. Current formulations of COCP's do not contain doses high enough to increase the absolute risk of thrombotic events in otherwise healthy people, but people with any pre-existing medical condition that also increases their risk for blood clots makes using COCPs more dangerous.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; These conditions include but are not limited to high blood pressure, pre-existing [[cardiovascular disease]], history of thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, [[migraine]] with aura, a familial tendency to form blood clots (such as familial [[factor V Leiden]]), and in [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] over age 35.&lt;ref name="webmdbcp2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills?page=5#1|title=Can Any Woman Take Birth Control Pills?|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COCPs are also contraindicated for people with advanced diabetes, liver tumors, [[hepatic adenoma]] or severe [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.&lt;ref name="webmdbcp2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; COCPs are metabolized in the liver and thus liver disease can lead to reduced elimination of the medication. People with known or suspected [[breast cancer]] or unexplained uterine bleeding should also not take COCPs.

Women who are known to be pregnant should not take COCPs. Postpartum women who are [[breastfeeding]] are also advised not to start COCPs until 4 weeks after birth due to increased risk of blood clots.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Severe [[hypercholesterolemia]] and [[hypertriglyceridemia]] are also currently contraindications, but the evidence showing that COCP's lead to worse outcomes in this population is weak.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Obesity]] is not considered to be a contraindication to taking COCPs .&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Side effects==
It is generally accepted that the health risks of oral contraceptives are lower than those from pregnancy and birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Crooks, Robert L.  |author2=Karla Baur | title=Our Sexuality | year=2005 | publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA | isbn=0-534-65176-3}}{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the health benefits of any method of contraception are far greater than any risks from the method".&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO]] (2005). ''[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/family_planning/counselling.htm Decision-Making Tool for Family Planning Clients and Providers] Appendix 10: Myths about contraception''&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations have argued that comparing a contraceptive method to no method (pregnancy) is not relevant—instead, the comparison of safety should be among available methods of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holck |first=Susan |title=Contraceptive Safety |work=Special Challenges in Third World Women's Health |publisher=1989 Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association |url=http://www.users.interport.net/i/w/iwhc/sc_cs.html |accessdate=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common===
Different sources note different incidences of side effects. The most common side effect is [[breakthrough bleeding]]. A 1992 French review article said that as many as 50% of new first-time users discontinue the birth control pill before the end of the first year because of the annoyance of side effects such as breakthrough bleeding and [[amenorrhea]].&lt;ref name="serfaty"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01849448 |title=Medical aspects of oral contraceptive discontinuation |year=1992 |last1=Serfaty |first1=D. |journal=Advances in Contraception |volume=8 |pages=21–33}}&lt;br /&gt;

Nausea, vomiting, headache, bloating, breast tenderness, swelling of the ankles/feet (fluid retention), or weight change may occur. Vaginal bleeding between periods (spotting) or missed/irregular periods may occur, especially during the first few months of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-17518-115/apri-oral/progestin-estrogen-contraceptive---oral/details|title=Apri oral : Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings &amp; Dosing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart and blood vessels===
Combined oral contraceptives increase the risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] (including [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE)).&lt;ref name="VTE10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanco-Molina A, Monreal M | title = Venous thromboembolism in women taking hormonal contraceptives | journal = [[Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–5 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20136607 | doi = 10.1586/erc.09.175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

COC pills with more than 50&amp;nbsp;µg of estrogen increase the risk of ischemic [[stroke]] and [[myocardial infarction]] but lower doses appear safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roach|first1=RE|last2=Helmerhorst|first2=FM|last3=Lijfering|first3=WM|last4=Stijnen|first4=T|last5=Algra|first5=A|last6=Dekkers|first6=OM|title=Combined oral contraceptives: the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=27 August 2015|volume=8|pages=CD011054|pmid=26310586|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011054.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These risks are greatest in women with additional risk factors, such as smoking (which increases risk substantially) and long-continued use of the pill, especially in women over 35 years of age.&lt;ref name="Rang 2012"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Rang| first1 = Humphrey P.| last2 = Dale| first2 = Maureen M.| last3 = Ritter| first3 = James M.| last4 = Flower| first4 = Rod J.| last5 = Henderson| first5 = Graeme| title = Rang and Dale's pharmacology| edition = 7th| year = 2012| publisher = Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone| location = Edinburgh| isbn = 978-0-7020-3471-8| page = 426| chapter = The reproductive system }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman-years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared with 30 in non-users.&lt;ref name=eshre2013/&gt; The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills; compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with [[norethisterone]] is 0.98, with [[norgestimate]] 1.19, with [[desogestrel]] (DSG) 1.82, with [[gestodene]] 1.86, with [[drospirenone]] (DRSP) 1.64, and with [[cyproterone acetate]] 1.88.&lt;ref name=eshre2013/&gt; In comparison, venous thromboembolism occurs in 100–200 per 100.000 pregnant women every year.&lt;ref name=eshre2013&gt;{{cite journal | title = Venous thromboembolism in women: A specific reproductive health risk | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 471–482 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23825156 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
A [[systematic review]] in 2010 did not support an increased overall cancer risk in users of combined oral contraceptive pills, but did find a slight increase in [[breast cancer]] risk among current users, which disappears 5–10 years after use has stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cibula D, Gompel A, Mueck AO, La Vecchia C, Hannaford PC, Skouby SO, Zikan M, Dusek L | title = Hormonal contraception and risk of cancer | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 631–650 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20543200 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===
Low levels of [[serotonin]], a neurotransmitter in the brain, have been linked to [[Clinical depression|depression]]. High levels of estrogen, as in first-generation COCPs, and progestin, as in some progestin-only contraceptives, have been shown to lower the brain serotonin levels by increasing the concentration of a brain enzyme that reduces serotonin. A growing body of research evidence has suggested that hormonal contraception may have an adverse effect on women's psychological health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Jayashri|date=July 2007|title=Depression as a side effect of the contraceptive pill|journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Safety|volume=6|issue=4|pages=371–374|doi=10.1517/14740338.6.4.371|issn=1744-764X|pmid=17688380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skovlund|first=Charlotte Wessel|last2=Mørch|first2=Lina Steinrud|last3=Kessing|first3=Lars Vedel|last4=Lidegaard|first4=Øjvind|date=2016-11-01|title=Association of Hormonal Contraception With Depression|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=73|issue=11|pages=1154–1162|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2387|issn=2168-6238|pmid=27680324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zettermark|first=Sofia|last2=Vicente|first2=Raquel Perez|last3=Merlo|first3=Juan|date=2018-03-22|title=Hormonal contraception increases the risk of psychotropic drug use in adolescent girls but not in adults: A pharmacoepidemiological study on 800 000 Swedish women|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=e0194773|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773|pmid=29566064|pmc=5864056|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a large Danish study of one million women (followed-up from January 2000 to December 2013) showed that use of COCPs, especially among adolescents, was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of subsequent depression, although the sizes of the effects are small (for example, 2.1% of the women who took any form of oral birth control were prescribed anti-depressants for the first time, compared to 1.7% of women in the control group).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, in 2018, the findings from a large nationwide Swedish cohort study investigating the effect of hormonal contraception on [[mental health]] amongst women (n=815,662, aged 12–30) were published, highlighting an association between hormonal contraception and subsequent use of [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic drugs]] for women of reproductive age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This association was particularly large for young adolescents (aged 12–19).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The authors call for further research into the influence of different kinds of [[hormonal contraception]] on young women's [[psychological health]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Hypertension===
Bradykinin lowers blood pressure by causing blood vessel dilation.  Certain enzymes are capable of breaking down bradykinin (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Aminopeptidase P).  Progesterone can increase the levels of Aminopeptidase P (AP-P), thereby increasing the breakdown of bradykinin, which increases the risk of developing hypertension.&lt;ref name="Cilia La Corte AL, Carter AM, Turner AJ, Grant PJ, Hooper NM 2008 221–5"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cilia La Corte AL, Carter AM, Turner AJ, Grant PJ, Hooper NM | title = The bradykinin-degrading aminopeptidase P is increased in women taking the oral contraceptive pill | journal = J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–5 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19126663 | doi = 10.1177/1470320308096405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug interactions==
Some [[Medication|drug]]s reduce the effect of the pill and can cause [[breakthrough bleeding]], or increased chance of pregnancy. These include drugs such as [[rifampicin]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]]. In addition cautions are given about broad spectrum antibiotics, such as [[ampicillin]] and [[doxycycline]], which may cause problems "by impairing the [[Human flora|bacterial flora]] responsible for recycling [[ethinylestradiol]] from the large bowel" ([[British National Formulary|BNF]] 2003).&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on Combined contraceptive pills is not found on systematic interaction metanalysis (Archer, 2002), although "individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol when they take certain other antibiotics" (Dickinson, 2001). "...experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction" (DeRossi, 2002) and this remains current (2006) UK [http://www.fpa.org.uk/information/leaflets/documents_and_pdfs/detail.cfm?contentID=130#17 Family Planning Association advice].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

The traditional medicinal herb [[St John's Wort]] has also been implicated due to its upregulation of the [[P450]] system in the [[liver]].

==Mechanism of action==
Combined oral contraceptive pills were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. Combined hormonal contraceptives, including COCPs, inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Nelson| first1 = Anita L.| last2 = Cwiak| first2 = Carrie| editor1-last = Hatcher| editor1-first = Robert A.| editor2-last = Trussell| editor2-first = James| editor3-last = Nelson| editor3-first = Anita L.| editor4-last = Cates| editor4-first = Willard Jr.| editor5-last = Kowal| editor5-first = Deborah| editor6-last = Policar| editor6-first = Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.&lt;br /&gt;Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Speroff| first1 = Leon| last2 = Darney| first2 = Philip D.| title = A clinical guide for contraception| edition = 5th| year = 2011| publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| location = Philadelphia| isbn = 978-1-60831-610-6| pages = 19–152| chapter = Oral contraception }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"&gt;{{cite book| first = Ellis R.| last1 = Levin| last2 = Hammes| first2 = Stephen R.| editor1-last = Brunton| editor2-last = Chabner| editor2-first = Bruce A.| editor3-last = Knollmann| editor3-first = Björn C.| title = Goodman &amp; Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics| edition = 12th| year = 2011| publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8| pages = 1163–1194| chapter = Estrogens and progestins }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glasier| first = Anna| authorlink = Anna Glasier| editor1-last = Jameson| editor1-first = J.

Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the secretion of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and greatly decreases the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH secretion prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of an LH surge prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the secretion of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the water content and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

The estrogen and progestogen in COCPs have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;
* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].
* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].
* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.

Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during COCP use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of COCPs.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

==Formulations==
{{Main|Oral contraceptive formulations}}

Oral contraceptives come in a variety of formulations, some containing both [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and [[progestin]]s, and some only containing [[progestogen only pill|progestin]]. Doses of component hormones also vary among products, and some pills are [[oral contraceptive formulations#monophasic|monophasic]] (delivering the same dose of hormones each day) while others are [[oral contraceptive formulations#multiphasic|multiphasic]] (doses vary each day).

COCPs have been somewhat inconsistently grouped into "generations" in the medical literature based on when they were introduced.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011a"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.

Several different classification systems for the progestins exist, but the one most commonly used system recapitulates the history of the pill in the United States by categorizing the progestins into the so-called "generations of progestins." The first three generations of progestins are derived from 19-nortestosterone. The fourth generation is drospirenone. Newer progestins are hybrids.&lt;br/&gt;First-generation progestins. First-generation progestins include noretynodrel, norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, and etynodiol diacetate… These compounds have the lowest potency and relatively short half-lives. The short half-life did not matter in the early, high-dose pills but as doses of progestin were decreased in the more modern pills, problems with unscheduled spotting and bleeding became more common.&lt;br/&gt;Second-generation progestins. To solve the problem of unscheduled bleeding and spotting, the second generation progestins (norgestrol and levonorgestrel) were designed to be significantly more potent and to have longer half-lives than norethisterone-related progestins... The second-generation progestins have been associated with more androgen-related side-effects such as adverse effect on lipids, oily skin, acne, and facial hair growth.&lt;br/&gt;Third-generation progestins. Third-generation progestins (desogestrel, norgestimate and elsewhere, gestodene) were introduced to maintain the potent progestational activity of second-generation progestins, but to reduce androgeneic side effects. Reduction in androgen impacts allows a fuller expression of the pill's estrogen impacts. This has some clinical benefits… On the other hand, concern arose that the increased expression of estrogen might increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This concern introduced a pill scare in Europe until international studies were completed and correctly interpreted.&lt;br/&gt;Fourth-generation progestins. Drospirenone is an anologue of spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic used to treat hypertension. Drospirenone possesses anti-mineralocorticoid and anti-androgenic properties. These properties have led to new contraceptive applications, such as treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and acne… In the wake of concerns around possible increased VTE risk with less androgenic third-generation formulations, those issues were anticipated with drospirenone. They were clearly answered by large international studies.&lt;br/&gt;Next-generation progestins. More recently, newer progestins have been developed with properties that are shared with different generations of progestins. They have more profound, diverse, and discrete effects on the endometrium than prior progestins. This class would include dienogest (United States) and nomegestrol (Europe).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011a"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|page=&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f5XJtYkiJ0YC&amp;pg=PT73 40]&lt;/span&gt;|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, [[Russell Marker]], a professor of [[organic chemistry]] at [[Pennsylvania State University]], developed a method of synthesizing [[progesterone]] from plant steroid [[sapogenin]]s, initially using sarsapogenin from [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]], which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the [[saponin]] from inedible Mexican yams (''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea composita]]'') found in the rain forests of [[Veracruz]] near [[Orizaba]]. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety [[diosgenin]]. Unable to interest his research sponsor [[Parke-Davis]] in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded [[Syntex]] with two partners in [[Mexico City]]. When he left Syntex a year later the [[Mexican barbasco trade|trade of the barbasco yam]] had started and the period of the heyday of the [[Marker degradation#Mexican steroid industry|Mexican steroid industry]] had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.&lt;!--

{{Introduction of first-generation oral contraceptives}}

===Progesterone to prevent ovulation===
In early 1951, reproductive [[physiologist]] [[Gregory Pincus]], a leader in hormone research and co-founder of the [[Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology]] (WFEB) in [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts]], first met American birth control movement founder [[Margaret Sanger]] at a [[Manhattan]] dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, medical director and vice president of [[Planned Parenthood]] (PPFA), who helped Pincus obtain a small grant from PPFA to begin hormonal contraceptive research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-birth-of-the-pill-jonathan-eig-20141016-story.html#page=1|title=Jonathan Eig on 'The Birth of the Pill'|first=Kevin|last=Nance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Birth-of-the-Pill/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-birth-of-the-pill-and-the-reinvention-of-sex-by-jonathan-eig/2014/10/17/914acb3c-48c0-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html|title=Book review: ‘The Birth of the Pill,’ and the reinvention of sex, by Jonathan Eig|first=Kate|last=Manning|date=17 October 2014|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research started on April 25, 1951 with reproductive physiologist [[Min Chueh Chang]] repeating and extending the 1937 experiments of Makepeace ''et al.'' that showed injections of progesterone suppressed ovulation in rabbits. In October 1951, [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]] refused Pincus' request to fund his hormonal contraceptive research, but retained him as a consultant and continued to provide chemical compounds to evaluate.&lt;!--

In March 1952, Sanger wrote a brief note mentioning Pincus' research to her longtime friend and supporter, [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Katharine Dexter McCormick]], who visited the WFEB and its co-founder and old friend Hudson Hoagland in June 1952 to learn about contraceptive research there. Frustrated when research stalled from PPFA's lack of interest and meager funding, McCormick arranged a meeting at the WFEB on June 6, 1953 with Sanger and Hoagland, where she first met Pincus who committed to dramatically expand and accelerate research with McCormick providing fifty times PPFA's previous funding.&lt;!--

Pincus and McCormick enlisted [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]] clinical professor of [[obstetrics and gynaecology|gynecology]] [[John Rock (American scientist)|John Rock]], chief of gynecology at the [[Free Hospital for Women]] and an expert in the treatment of [[infertility]], to lead clinical research with women. At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar approaches to achieve opposite goals. In 1952, Rock induced a three-month [[anovulatory]] "pseudo-pregnancy" state in eighty of his infertility patients with continuous gradually increasing oral doses of estrogen ([[diethylstilbestrol]] 5–30&amp;nbsp;mg/day) and progesterone (50–300&amp;nbsp;mg/day) and within the following four months 15% became pregnant.&lt;!--

In 1953, at Pincus' suggestion, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory "pseudo-pregnancy" state in twenty-seven of his infertility patients with an oral 300&amp;nbsp;mg/day progesterone-only regimen for 20 days from [[menstrual cycle|cycle]] days 5–24 followed by pill-free days to produce [[menstrual cycle|withdrawal bleeding]]. This produced the same 15% pregnancy rate during the following four months without the [[amenorrhea]] of the previous continuous estrogen and progesterone regimen. But 20% of the women experienced [[breakthrough bleeding]] and in the first cycle ovulation was suppressed in only 85% of the women, indicating that even higher and more expensive oral doses of progesterone would be needed to initially consistently suppress ovulation.&lt;!--

===Progestins to prevent ovulation===
Pincus asked his contacts at pharmaceutical companies to send him chemical compounds with progestogenic activity. Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's [[norethisterone]] and Searle's [[noretynodrel]] and [[norethandrolone]].&lt;!--

Chemists [[Carl Djerassi]], [[Luis E. Miramontes|Luis Miramontes]], and [[George Rosenkranz]] at Syntex in Mexico City had synthesized the first orally highly active progestin norethisterone in 1951. [[Frank B. Colton]] at Searle in [[Skokie, Illinois]] had synthesized the orally highly active progestins noretynodrel (an isomer of norethisterone) in 1952 and norethandrolone in 1953.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="maisel"/&gt;

In December 1954, Rock began the first studies of the ovulation-suppressing potential of 5–50&amp;nbsp;mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. Norethisterone or noretynodrel 5&amp;nbsp;mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10&amp;nbsp;mg and higher doses of norethisterone or noretynodrel suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding and led to a 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's noretynodrel for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethisterone very slight androgenicity in animal tests.&lt;!--

===Combined oral contraceptive===
Noretynodrel (and norethisterone) were subsequently discovered to be contaminated with a small percentage of the estrogen [[mestranol]] (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the noretynodrel in Rock's 1954–5 study containing 4–7% mestranol. When further purifying noretynodrel to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956.

[[File:Patient Package Insert for Oral Contraceptives (FDA 079) (8249451687).jpg|thumb|right|oral contraceptives, 1970s]]
On June 10, 1957, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Enovid 10&amp;nbsp;mg (9.85&amp;nbsp;mg noretynodrel and 150&amp;nbsp;µg mestranol) for menstrual disorders, based on data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg doses to be highly effective. On July 23, 1959, [[G.D. Searle &amp; Company|Searle]] filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an approved indication for 10, 5, and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10&amp;nbsp;mg for contraceptive use, and did so on June 23, 1960. At that point, Enovid 10&amp;nbsp;mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.&lt;!--

Although FDA-approved for contraceptive use, Searle never marketed Enovid 10&amp;nbsp;mg as a contraceptive. Eight months later, on February 15, 1961, the FDA approved Enovid 5&amp;nbsp;mg for contraceptive use. In July 1961, Searle finally began marketing Enovid 5&amp;nbsp;mg (5&amp;nbsp;mg noretynodrel and 75&amp;nbsp;µg mestranol) to physicians as a contraceptive.&lt;!--

Although the FDA approved the first oral contraceptive in 1960, contraceptives were not available to married women in all states until ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' in 1965 and were not available to unmarried women in all states until ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' in 1972.&lt;!--

====Britain====
Before the mid-1960s, the United Kingdom did not require pre-marketing approval of drugs. The British [[Family Planning Association]] (FPA) through its clinics was then the primary provider of family planning services in Britain and provided only contraceptives that were on its Approved List of Contraceptives (established in 1934). In 1957, Searle began marketing Enavid (Enovid 10&amp;nbsp;mg in the U.S.) for menstrual disorders. Also in 1957, the FPA established a Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control (CIFC) to test and monitor oral contraceptives which began animal testing of oral contraceptives and in 1960 and 1961 began three large clinical trials in [[Birmingham]], [[Slough]], and [[London]].&lt;!--

In March 1960, the Birmingham FPA began trials of noretynodrel 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg + mestranol 50&amp;nbsp;µg, but a high pregnancy rate initially occurred when the pills accidentally contained only 36&amp;nbsp;µg of mestranol—the trials were continued with noretynodrel 5&amp;nbsp;mg + mestranol 75&amp;nbsp;µg (Conovid in Britain, Enovid 5&amp;nbsp;mg in the U.S.).&lt;!--

====France====
On December 28, 1967, the [[Neuwirth Law]] legalized contraception in France, including the pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dourlen Rollier AV | title = Contraception: yes, but | journal = Fertilité, Orthogénie | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 185–8 | date = October 1972 | pmid = 12306278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pill is the most popular form of contraception in France, especially among young women. It accounts for 60% of the birth control used in France. The abortion rate has remained stable since the introduction of the pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aids Generation: the pill takes priority?|publisher=Science Actualities|year=2000|accessdate=2006-09-07|url=http://www.cite-sciences.fr/francais/ala_cite/science_actualites/sitesactu/question_actu.php?langue=an&amp;id_article=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
In Japan, lobbying from the [[Japan Medical Association]] prevented the pill from being approved for general use for nearly 40 years. The higher dose "second generation" pill was approved for use in cases of gynecological problems, but not for birth control. Two main objections raised by the association were safety concerns over long-term use of the pill, and concerns that pill use would lead to decreased use of condoms and thereby potentially increase [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) rates.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Djerassi on birth control in Japan – abortion 'yes,' pill 'no' |publisher=Stanford University News Service |date=1996-02-14 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/96/960214japanabort.html |accessdate=2006-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106173620/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/96/960214japanabort.html |archive-date=2007-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the Ministry of Health and Welfare approved [[Viagra]]'s use in Japan after only six months of the application's submission, while still claiming that the pill required more data before approval, women's groups cried foul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/science/japan-s-tale-of-two-pills-viagra-and-birth-control.html|title=Japan's Tale of Two Pills: Viagra and Birth Control|date=27 April 1999|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pill was subsequently approved for use in June 1999. However, the pill has not become popular in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/03/news/mn-43662|title=Japan OKs Birth Control Pill After Decades of Delay|first=SONNI|last=EFRON|date=3 June 1999|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to estimates, only 1.3 percent of 28 million Japanese females of childbearing age use the pill, compared with 15.6 percent in the United States. The pill prescription guidelines the government has endorsed require pill users to visit a doctor every three months for pelvic examinations and undergo tests for sexually transmitted diseases and uterine cancer. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, an annual or bi-annual clinic visit is standard for pill users. However, beginning as far back as 2007, many Japanese [[OBGYN]]s have required only a yearly visit for pill users, with multiple checks a year recommended only for those who are older or at increased risk of side effects.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80% of birth control use in Japan, and this may explain Japan's comparatively low rates of AIDS.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
The pill was approved by the FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine placed the pill on its cover in April, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101670407,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Pill |publisher=Time.com |date=April 7, 1967 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first place, it was more effective than most previous reversible methods of birth control, giving women unprecedented control over their fertility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/1514/3518/7100/Pill_History_FactSheet.pdf The Birth Control Pill: A History]&lt;/ref&gt; Its use was separate from intercourse, requiring no special preparations at the time of sexual activity that might interfere with spontaneity or sensation, and the choice to take the pill was a private one. This combination of factors served to make the pill immensely popular within a few years of its introduction.&lt;ref name="asbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkins"/&gt;
Claudia Goldin, among others, argue that this new contraceptive technology was a key player in forming women's modern economic role, in that it prolonged the age at which women first married allowing them to invest in education and other forms of human capital as well as generally become more career-oriented. Soon after the birth control pill was legalized, there was a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Goldin, Claudia |author2=Lawrence Katz |year=2002 |title=The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women's Career and Marriage Decisions |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=730–770 |doi=10.1086/340778|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2624453/Goldin_PowerPill.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an economic point of view, the birth control pill reduced the cost of staying in school. The ability to control fertility without sacrificing sexual relationships allowed women to make long term educational and career plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equalityarchive.com/history/the-pill/|title=The Pill {{!}} Equality Archive|date=2017-03-01|work=Equality Archive|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the pill was so effective, and soon so widespread, it also heightened the debate about the moral and health consequences of [[pre-marital sex]] and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]''. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=George Weigel | title=The Courage to Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Renewal of the Church | year=2002 | publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/regional/muenchen/kirche-pillenverbot-bleibt-streitfrage-zwischen-den-konfessionen_id_4426875.html|title=Pillenverbot bleibt Streitfrage zwischen den Konfessionen|first=FOCUS|last=Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Senate]] began hearings on the pill in 1970 and there were different viewpoints heard from medical professionals. Dr. Michael Newton, President of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The evidence is not yet clear that these still do in fact cause cancer or related to it. The FDA Advisory Committee made comments about this, that if there wasn't enough evidence to indicate whether or not these pills were related to the development of cancer, and I think that's still thin; you have to be cautious about them, but I don't think there is clear evidence, either one way or the other, that they do or don't cause cancer."&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title |title=1970 Year in Review |work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another physician, Dr. Roy Hertz of the [[Population Council]], said that anyone who takes this should know of "our knowledge and ignorance in these matters" and that all women should be made aware of this so she can decide to take the pill or not.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt;

The [[Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] at the time, [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], announced the federal government had accepted a compromise warning statement which would accompany all sales of birth control pills.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt;

==Result on popular culture==
The introduction of the birth control pill in 1960 allowed more women to find employment opportunities and further their education. As a result of more women getting jobs and an education, their husbands had to start taking over household tasks like cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winnick|first=Charles|date=1968|title=The Beige Epoch: Depolarization of Sex Roles in America|jstor=1037799|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=376|pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to stop the change that was occurring in terms of gender norms in an American household, many films, television shows, and other popular culture items portrayed what an ideal American family should be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17528">'''Communicology''' is the scholarly and academic study of how we create and use messages to affect our social environment. Communicology is an academic discipline that distinguishes itself from the broader field of [[Communication studies|human communication]] with its exclusive use of [[scientific method]]s to study communicative phenomena. The goals of these scientific methods are to create and extend theory-based knowledge about the processes and outcomes of communication. Practitioners in the communicology discipline employ empirical and deductive research methods, such as cross-sectional and longitudinal [[Survey methodology|surveys]], [[experiment]]s, [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], and [[Content analysis|content analyses]], to test theoretically-derived hypotheses. [[Correlation and dependence|Correlational]] and [[Causality|causal]] relationships between [[communication]] variables are tested in these studies.

Researchers of communicology explore specific functions of communication. Such functions might include [[interpersonal communication]], message processing, and [[persuasion]]. Researcher might also situate their studies in different contexts, such as [[intercultural communication]], [[health communication]], intergroup communication, [[Computer-mediated communication|technology-mediated communication]], and [[Communication in small groups|small group communication]]. Findings from communicology link research to several different perspectives from the [[social science]]s, [[natural science]]s, and [[medicine]].

==Etymology and definitions==
The word communicology has its roots in [[Latin]] from ''[[wikt:communico|commūnicō]]'', meaning to share or impart, and [[wikt:-logia|-logia]], meaning the “study of.” The academic study of human communication focuses on the use of messages to impart, inform, and participate in dialogue. [[Charles Cooley|Charles Horton Cooley]] described the system of communication as “a tool, a progressive invention, whose improvements react upon mankind and alter the life of every individual and institution.”&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, C. H. (1909). ''Social organization: A study of the larger mind''. New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective form of commūnicō, ''communis'', is translated as “to make common.” An important pursuit in the academic study of human communication is to understand how meaning is created through the messages shared between interaction partners. Although various attempts have been made to label the scientific study of communication, including “[[communication sciences]]” and “communication studies,” such terms have been used to reference broad and all-encompassing approaches to studying messages. The label communicology narrows the scope of studying human communication by focusing solely on scientific approaches to message construction, production, and exchange.

==History==
The study of human communication originated in ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] with notable philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Cicero]], and [[Plato]]. Students of this early study of communication pursued knowledge on [[public rhetoric]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and [[persuasion]]. Interest in the modern study of [[human communication]] intensified with burgeoning technology and it soon grew into a legitimate field following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

The modern study of communication in the U.S. can be traced to four influential forefathers: [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Harold Lasswell]], and [[Carl Hovland]].&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. L. (1997). ''The beginnings of communication study in America: A memoir''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld, who was trained as a mathematician, was influenced by socialism. His training in mathematics made him gravitate toward the methodology of communication rather than its content. [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld]], however, did engage in some theorizing about the effects of propaganda on its viewers. His [[Two-step flow of communication|two-step flow of communication model]] is still used today to describe how information diffuses into public opinion. [[Harold Lasswell]] was interested in power dynamics that existed in politics. [[Harold Lasswell|Lasswell]] used various approaches to understanding the media effects of [[propaganda]] messages, including his initial studies using [[Critical theory|critical]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] designs and his later [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] studies. He was influenced largely by [[pragmatism]] and [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian thought]]. [[Harold Lasswell|Lasswell's]] best known contribution to the communication field is his [[Lasswell's model of communication|model of communication]]. [[Kurt Lewin]] began as an [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. Although some of his work after he moved to the U.S. focused on applied or action research, [[Kurt Lewin|Lewin's]] largest contributions to scientific understanding were based on his theoretically-derived research. His approach to studying psychology was largely guided by the [[natural science]]s, particularly [[physics]], and [[medicine]]. [[Carl Hovland]] was the director of experimental studies for propaganda research during [[World War II]]. [[Carl Hovland|Hovland]] was interested in the [[persuasion]] of [[propaganda]], including ideas involving [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[credibility]], and [[fear appeal]]s. [[Carl Hovland|Hovland's]] approach to studying persuasion was influenced by Freudian [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytics theory]] and [[Clark L. Hull|Clark Hull's]] [[behaviorism]] and [[Classical conditioning|stimulus-response theory]]. During his post as the Director of the Institute of Human Relations at [[Yale University]], Hovland addressed a large number of social problems in his research using [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] approaches.

Following [[World War II]], the study of [[propaganda]] and, more broadly, human interactions did not rest. The forefathers understood the importance of studying message creation and exchange. They developed communication centers and institutes at their own home institutions. The modern study of human communication in the decades that followed grew in the kinds of topics researchers studied and the different methodological approaches from which these topics were studied. Scholars began to address message-related topics of interest to them in subfields such as [[health communication]], [[mass communication]], [[interpersonal communication]], [[intercultural communication]], [[Persuasion|persuasion and social influence]], [[political communication]], and communication technology. These scholars approached theorizing about and researching human communication using various [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] approaches, including [[rhetoric]]al, [[Semiotics|semiotic]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], [[Cyberneticist|cybernetic]], sociopsychological, [[Sociocultural system|sociocultural]], and [[Critical theory|critical]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “communication” used to describe the collection of these vastly different traditions is now so broad and encompassing that it means everything and, at the same time, nothing.

By the end of the 20th century, the scholarly and academic domains of any communication department might include ''performance components'' (e.g., performance of literature; [[storytelling]]), ''[[humanities]] components'' (e.g., [[Rhetorical criticism|rhetorical analyses]]; [[Critical thinking|critical analyses]]); ''[[social science]] components'' (e.g., [[Experiment|scientific experimentation]]), and ''[[Medicine|medical]]/[[Biology|biological]] components'' (e.g., [[Speech-language pathology|speech pathology]], [[audiology]]). Communication departments are also commonly the home of ''professional training'' in media-related topics, such as [[journalism]], [[Mass media|media production]], [[Web design]], and [[telecommunication]]s. Some universities have attempted to house multiple independent departments that focus exclusively on targeted aspects of communication under larger “colleges of communication.”

The large breadth of the communication field meant that rhetoricians and critical cultural scholars were housed in the same departments as [[Quantitative research|quantitative social scientists]] and even [[neuroscientist]]s. Although these disparate learners of communication are ostensibly situated to tackle similar message-related research problems, the methodological approaches they use to resolve these problems vastly differ. The subset of communication researchers who practice theory development and theory building using ''[[Science|scientific]]'' research methods, such as quantitative [[Survey methodology|survey designs]], [[experiment]]s, quantitative [[content analysis]], and [[meta-analysis]], fall under the label communicologists. Programs such as the [http://comm.msu.edu/ College of Communication] at [[Michigan State University]], [http://comm.ucsb.edu/ Department of Communication] at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and [http://comm.arizona.edu/ Department of Communication] at [[University of Arizona]] have, for several decades, directed their research production toward studying human communication from a communicological approach. More recently, programs like the [http://manoa.hawaii.edu/communicology/ Department of Communicology] at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa]] have been created to underscore the exclusively scientific paradigmatic approach shared by all researchers in the department.

==Primary Functions of Human Communication in Communicology==
Human communication in the study of communicology is examined through a functional approach, a general perspective used to describe what humans do with communication. Communicology begins with the primary assumption that the overarching goal of communication is to create [[understanding]]. No matter what reason we have for communicating with another interactant, we simply cannot achieve that purpose without initiating a state of mutual understanding with him or her. In essence, the primary function of all human communication is to get others to hold the same [[mental representation]] that we have in our minds.

Secondary reasons for communicating with others also exist, which generally involve goals of influence. For example, we might attempt to get a person to like us more in the pursuit of a friendship or a romantic relationship. Interactants might attempt to use communication to define and negotiate the nature of their relationship with each other, enacting what is known as relational influence. This [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] function of communication is present in every communicative situation, whether between two people, two corporations, or even two nation states. [[Social influence]] goals can also include using communication to instill specific beliefs in another person, influencing his or her [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] toward some idea or object. The function of social influence is to [[Persuasion|persuade]] a person or induce [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] using requests or communicating desires.

==Major Schools of Thought==
Communicological approaches have been aimed at developing theory-based knowledge using scientific methods. Communicologists often subscribe to [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] views of theory construction and theory refinement. Two views guide the study of human communication from a communicological standpoint: the view of communicology as a [[social science]] and as a [[natural science]].

The view of communicology as a social science is guided by an understanding that social systems and cultures can introduce variability in communication patterns within and across groups of individuals. The [[Social science|social scientific]] approach is generally concerned with the way humans relate to each other by forming [[belief]]s, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[stereotype]]s about them. For decades, a leading question in the study of human communication from a social scientific approach has been how context of the interactants involved in message exchange plays a role in how messages are interpreted. For instance, whereas the question of why people smile might lie in the province of medical or natural scientific approaches to studying communicology, answering questions about the variability between two cultural groups in smiling behaviors following exposure to a stimulus lies within the grasp of the social sciences. In understanding why people engage in specific behaviors, the social scientific approach to communicology references the [[mental process]]es underlying mental activity that give rise to the [[behavior]]. [[Perception]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[reason]]ing, [[Thought|thinking]], [[memory]], and [[emotion]]s, all things that can be directly influenced by one's environment, are taken into consideration when explaining, predicting, and controlling (i.e., the functions of theory-based knowledge) human behaviors.

The view of communicology as a [[natural science]] is guided by an understanding that humans’ communicative behaviors can be best explained as a function of our biologically-engineered responses, which are, to some extent, predetermined by our [[evolution]]ary origins. The basis for this view is that human communication that is employed for cooperation and collaboration served as an important historical adaptive advantage over several millennia. Largely guided by the work of [[Charles Darwin]], the natural science view of communicology attempts to locate communicative behaviors that are common to and unite humans, and attribute these linguistic commonalities to an evolutionary problem for which it solved. The natural science approach also references recent developments in [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] and [[cognitive science]]s to explain human behaviors. Scholars of communicology address topics such as linguistic diversity in relation to parasite stress, the [[neurochemistry]] underlying certain media addictions, and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] and automatic behaviors related to the development of [[habit]]s. The [[physiology]] and neurostructures of the human body are of interest to those who study communicology from this [[natural science]] perspective.

==Alternative Meanings of Communicology==
The term ‘communicology’ has been adopted worldwide by the International Communicology Institute (Communicology.org) to refer to a human science (qualitative) approach to human communication research.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Lanigan (1992). The Human Science of Communicology. Duquesne University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Communicology has been used to describe a discipline under the broader field of communication that uses logic-based semiotic and phenomenological methods to study [[Consciousness|human consciousness]] and behavioral embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of studying human consciousness and embodiment can be traced to [[Edmund Husserl]], the Father of Phenomenology, and later inspired by the works of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]. Cognate subfields recognized under this label include art communicology, clinical communicology, media communicology, and philosophy communicology. Understanding of human communication processes is developed using qualitative methodologies in this discipline of study.

The International Academy of Communicology publishes “[http://en.communicology.us/ Communicology: International Scientific Journal],” a periodical dedicated to research reports on “the theory and practice of public relations, media and communications, the basic theory of communication, sociology of mass communications, image making skills, as well as problems of formation of non-material values (image, publicity, brand, reputation, etc.).” Most uses of the term communicology  do not correspond to how the "social science" (quantitative methods) term has been adopted and used at the University of Hawaii.

A Swedish so-called "Institute of Communicology" promotes [[pseudo-scientific]] claims, such as that all human activity can be described by a set of variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24686">'''Compulsory heterosexuality''' is the idea that [[heterosexuality]] is assumed and enforced by a [[heteronormative]] society. This refers to the idea that heterosexuality can be adopted by people regardless of their personal sexual preferences. Heterosexuality is viewed as the natural inclination or obligation by both sexes. Consequently, anyone who differs from the normalcy of heterosexuality is deemed deviant or abhorrent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|title=Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|year=1980|publisher=Onlywomen Press Ltd|isbn=0-906500-07-9|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrienne Rich]] popularized the term ''compulsory heterosexuality'' in her 1980 essay titled "[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]". Rich's first concept of compulsory heterosexuality only included women, however, later revisions of the idea have included how compulsory heterosexuality affects men. Common examples include the assumption that children will grow up to marry a person of the opposite sex, children must steer away from having friends of the opposite sex, sexual education books that exclusively discuss heterosexuality, the concept of "coming out", religious and secular organizations that assume all members are heterosexual, and believing that if one can pretend to be heterosexual that is better than being non-heterosexual. Compulsory heterosexuality is seen as ignorant, a contributor to homophobia by marginalizing non-heterosexuals, treating heterosexuality as the superior default, and decreasing awareness of the large number of people within the population who are not heterosexual.

==Concept and terminology==
Adrienne Rich, who popularized the term ''compulsory heterosexuality'', argues that heterosexuality is a [[institution|political institution]] which needs to be re-examined for women to escape dis-empowerment. She argues that much of [[feminist literature]] still functions under a compulsory heterosexual paradigm, which is a problem facing the homosexual community. The scholarly articles that emerge from feminist authors fail to recognize the institutions, such as [[marriage]], that are regarded as normal are, in fact, [[socializations]] which we have internalized and reproduced in society. Rich goes on to argue that regardless of a woman's sexual orientation, any woman can choose to be a lesbian. People who question their sexuality are accused of being compulsory heterosexual. Also, Rich views lesbian identification as being on a continuum. She believes that all women can be lesbians by becoming "woman-identified women", meaning that women should be focused on the needs and emotions of other women. Rich argues because women have both maternal as well as sexual desires, they, unlike men are more diverse in their abilities to care for others in diverse rather than purely sexual ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due in part to this argument, Rich’s work has been largely discredited. However, the work of others has attempted to revive the basic argument that Rich puts forth.

Other authors have argued that ''compulsory heterosexuality'' has multiple important uses. [[Stevi Jackson]] stated, "Indeed, Rich's concept of 'compulsory heterosexuality' could be seen as a forerunner of '[[heteronormativity]]' and I would like to preserve an often neglected legacy of the former concept: that institutionalized, normative heterosexuality regulates those kept within its boundaries as well as marginalizing and sanctioning those outside them. The term 'heteronormativity' has not always captured this double-sided social regulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = nterchanges: Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: The complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity|last = Jackson|first = Stevi|date = 2006|journal = Feminist Theory|doi = 10.1177/1464700106061462|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 7|pages = 105–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals are exposed to compulsory heterosexuality from birth and therefore those that are in the sexual minority must explore their understanding of themselves in contrast with society. People are often assumed to be heterosexual until proven otherwise. In Sandra Lipsitz study she sets out to prove that, contrast to what was once believed, sexual minorities psychologically have a greater "global identity development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bem |first1=Sandra Lipsitz |title=Dismantling gender polarization and compulsory heterosexuality: Should we turn the volume down or up? |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=January 1995 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=329–334 |doi=10.1080/00224499509551806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the polarization of the sexes comes the hierarchy. It is argued the dissolving of the barriers would remove [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Konik |first1=Julie |last2=Stewart |first2=Abigail |title=Sexual Identity Development in the Context of Compulsory Heterosexuality |journal=Journal of Personality |date=August 2004 |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=815–844 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3506.2004.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrienne Rich argues that compulsory heterosexuality is reinforced by social institutions. Rich argues that same-sex marriage reinforces compulsory heterosexuality. William Havilland argues that marriage is a socially recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws, and that same-sex marriage has been claimed to be a negative addition to this. It is proposed that a negative connotation is put on same-sex marriage because it works against the idea of what it means to be heteronormative.  In "The New Homonormativity: The Sexual Politics of Neoliberalism", Lisa Duggan:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"Homonormativity—it is a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions—such as marriage, and its call for monogamy and reproduction—but upholds and sustains them while promising the possibility of a demobilized gay constituency and a privatized, depoliticized gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption (179)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Homonormativity: The Sexual Politics of Neoliberalism|last = Duggan|first = Lisa|publisher = Duke University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = United States of America|pages = 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[:fr:Louis-Georges Tin|Louis-Georges Tin]], in "''[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-363688406/the-invention-of-heterosexual-culture The Invention of Heterosexual Culture]''",  heterosexuality and the creation of male to female relationships is considered to be important, and Tin proposes that importance and emphasis has been put on reproduction because of this. He argues that this need for the reproduction "eclipsed"  "homosocial male bonds", which he claims commonly existed during the Middle Ages. Tin argues that negative connotations were associated with male and female relationships prior to this, and that this was because sexual relations were considered to interfere with spiritual obligations, and it was believed that same-sex relationships would not become sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://search.proquest.com/pqrl/docview/1511624946/2F640AB357A4428PQ/1?accountid=7418|title = The Invention of Heterosexual Culture by Louis-Georges Tin|date = 2012|accessdate = December 9, 2015|website = ProQuest|publisher = MIT Press|last = Roy|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tolman, Spencer, Rosen-Reynoso, and Porche, "Rich posited that heterosexuality is political in nature, rather than natural, functioning to serve the needs and desires of men within patriarchy, and therefore requiring various forms of male coercion of women for its production."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sowing the Seeds of Violence in Heterosexual Relationships: Early Adolescents Narrate Compulsory Heterosexuality|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-4560.t01-1-00010/abstract|journal = Journal of Social Issues|date = 2003-04-01|issn = 1540-4560|pages = 159–178|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1540-4560.t01-1-00010|language = en|first = Deborah L.|last = Tolman|first2 = Renée|last2 = Spencer|first3 = Myra|last3 = Rosen-Reynoso|first4 = Michelle V.|last4 = Porche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manifestations of male power ===
Rich claims male dominance and its presence in social institutions are major factors in enforcing female heterosexuality. To describe this phenomenon,  she uses a list of "eight characteristics of male power in archaic and contemporary societies" that is found in [[Kathleen Gough]]'s essay "The Origin of the Family,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in which Gough proposes the following characteristics:
#to deny women [our own] sexuality
#to force it [male sexuality] upon them
#to command or exploit their labor to control their produce
#to control or rob them of their children
#to confine them physically and prevent their movement
#to use them as objects in male transactions
#to cramp their creativeness
#to withhold from them large areas of the society's knowledge and cultural attainments"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Origin of the Family|last = Gough|first = Kathleen|publisher = New Hogtown Press|year = 1973|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rich concludes that all of these characteristics contribute to a culture that convinces women that heterosexual relationships and marriage are inevitable, whether by physical force or "control of consciousness," and especially in combination with lesbian erasure.

=== Lesbian erasure ===
Rich argues that compulsory heterosexuality, as a means of assuring male right of physical, economic, and emotional access, keeps the convention of female disempowerment intact through heterosexual relationships and doesn't allow for the growth of sexualities regarded as [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]], such as [[lesbian]]. Ultimately, Rich suggests a "lesbian continuum" that encourages female relationships, regardless of sexual desire, and views heterosexuality as an institution imposed on women. Rich views the acknowledgment of sexual choice as a necessary condition for female empowerment and an understanding of women's continuous resistance to men throughout history.

Additionally, Rich criticizes feminist scholarship for its exclusion of lesbian as a genuine, natural option for women. She writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The assumption&amp;nbsp;... that women are "innately sexually oriented" toward men, or that the lesbian choice is simply an acting-out of bitterness toward men,&amp;nbsp;... [is] widely current in literature and in the social sciences. I am concerned here with two other matters as well: first, how and why women's choice of women as passionate comrades, life partners, co-workers, lovers, tribe, has been crushed, invalidated, forced into hiding and disguise; and second, the virtual or total neglect of lesbian existence in a wide range of writings, including feminist scholarship. Obviously there is a connection here."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;She explores the content of ''For Her Own Good: 150 Years of the Experts' Advice to Women'' by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]], ''Toward a New Psychology of Women'' by [[Jean Baker Miller]], and ''Minotaur: Sexual Arrangements and the Human Malaise'' by [[Nancy Chodorow]], which, according to Rich, are presented as feminist texts and assume "that the social relations of the sexes are disordered and extremely problematic". Rich argues that these feminist texts do not examine the issue of compulsory heterosexuality or acknowledge that a woman might not choose heterosexuality if she were socialized in a more equal society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kathleen Debold, in her book [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qJQAxWPuCIoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=kathleen+debold+compulsory+heterosexuality&amp;ots=1QuAb9Ggit&amp;sig=uHtSRWksyzLd7kx9C0VbWIwZJK0 ''Dilemmas of desire: Teenage girls talk about sexuality''], argues that lesbian erasure can be a health care issue . She proposes heterosexism is active as a [[tacit assumption]] when "forms assess health risks by asking 'Are you sexually active?' followed by questions about what birth control methods the patient uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women: Images and Realities, A Multicultural Anthology, Fifth Edition|last = Suzanne|first = Kelly|publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-07-351231-0|location = New York|pages = 345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Medical Association states that, "unrecognized homosexuality by the physician or the patient's reluctance to report his or her sexual orientation can lead to failure to screen, diagnose, or treat important medical problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ama-assn.org/ssl3/ecomm/PolicyFinderForm.pl?site=www.ama-assn.org&amp;uri=/resources/html/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-160.991.HTM|title = H-160.991 Health Care Needs of the Homosexual Population|date = 2015|accessdate = December 8, 2015|website = |publisher = American Medical Association|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary theory ===
A major drive for compulsory heterosexuality is that of evolution. It ties a [[sexual orientation]]'s worth with reproduction. Evolutionarily speaking in order to further the species offspring must be created and therefore genes are past on.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sanderson, Stephen K. ''The Evolution of Human Sociality: A Darwinian Conflict Perspective''&lt;/ref&gt; This basic understanding of biology is then taken steps further implicating heterosexuality as the "natural" form and therefore making [[homosexuality]] specifically as well as any minority sexuality "abnormal".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCaughey |first1=Martha |title=Perverting Evolutionary Narratives of Heterosexual Masculinity: Or, Getting Rid of the Heterosexual Bug |journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies |date=1996 |volume=3 |issue=2–3 |pages=261–287 |doi=10.1215/10642684-3-2-3-261}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Seidman puts it, science is “a powerful practical-moral force”.

Though, evolutionary arguments have implications in minority sexualities they also directly impact the stereotypes of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships and especially concepts of masculinity. Arguments for men being the hunter are then applied to today's understanding of the male gender being superior.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The flip side of this understanding is the influence of this on the female gender. Them being depicted as the weaker sex and their main function being childbearing. These understandings however do not include ideas of morality, which is what is being applied to them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
Much of religion invokes a binary model for sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, Gary David, and Susan E. Henking. ''Que(e)rying Religion: A Critical Anthology''. New York: Continuum, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, tracing back to the bible which includes Adam and Eve as the beginning of humanity. As well as specific texts including this one from Leviticus, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."&lt;ref&gt;''King James Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; Religious institutions throughout history have had strict moral guidelines when it came to marriage and what is deemed expectable in the eyes of God. This directly translates to compulsory [[heterosexuality]] in society though influence of leaders of the church as well as devout followers of this belief.&lt;ref name="Birden 638–663"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birden|first=S.|last2=Gaither|first2=L. L.|last3=Laird|first3=S.|title=The Struggle Over the Text: Compulsory Heterosexuality and Educational Policy|journal=Educational Policy|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=638–663|doi=10.1177/0895904800014005007|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuals have a difficult time finding acceptance particularly in the Bible Belt.&lt;ref name="Birden 638–663" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There's little doubt that discrimination against homosexuals is the last "acceptable" form of discrimination. While most folks have outgrown overt racist and sexist attacks, for many people it's still okay to take shots at homosexuals. They are called names, blamed for society's problems, and often humiliated because of their sexual preference."&lt;ref name="Birden 638–663"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;While a binary model for sexuality might be enforced, "Many of the Puritans in colonial New England believed that ''all'' human beings were filled with homosexual as well as heterosexual desire and that the good Christian should direct that desire into procreative sex within marriage."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Endsjø, Dag Ølstein. Sex and Religion : Teachings and Taboos in the History of World Faiths. London, GB: Reaktion Books, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 7 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology carries over in modern-day conservative Christianity, and is enforced through the idea that the more welcoming people are to the idea of homosexuality, the more people will give into their homosexual lusts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Sexism in the labor force ===
Rich argues for compulsory heterosexuality in the workplace,  to which end she references [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination''. MacKinnon argues that women occupy low-paying jobs and their sexual marketability is a factor in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Catharine A.|title=Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination|year=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn|isbn=0-300-02299-9|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon states that "her job depends on her pretending to be not merely heterosexual, but a heterosexual ''woman'' in terms of dressing and playing the feminine, deferential role required of 'real' women".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rich argues that the treatment of women in the workplace is a significant influence in society's compulsory heterosexuality. Rich argues that women feel pressure to be heterosexual in the workplace, and that this pressure is also present in society as a whole. As a species will become extinct if no reproduction occurs, and human women must be inseminated to produce offspring, heterosexual relationships are necessary for the survival of the human race, barring artificial insemination.  According to Rich, women accept the male sex drive and regard themselves as sexual prey, and this influences compulsory heterosexuality. According to Rich, Barry argues for a 'sexual domination perspective', claims that men subject women to what she terms as "sexual abuse" and "terrorism", and that the 'sexual domination perspective' causes people to consider this "sexual abuse" and "terrorism" to be natural and inevitable and thus ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=Kathleen L.|title=Female Sexual Slavery|year=1979|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-1069-7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rich, women believe men have a natural need to have sex, and this results in them viewing "abuse" as inevitable. Barry argues that this rationale is romanticized through popular media. Rich claims that this is reinforced through compulsory heterosexuality.

== In males ==
While the concept of compulsory heterosexuality initially only included women, later revisions of the idea have included discussion on how Compulsory Heterosexuality necessarily requires both men and women to reinforce the construct; furthermore, that compulsory heterosexuality impacts males as well. Tolman, Spencer, Rosen-Reynoso, and Porche (2003) found that even heterosexual males reported being negatively impacted by compulsory heterosexuality through being groomed to aggressively pursue women and through the interactions that society allows them to have with other males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In another article, entitled ''"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deborah_Tolman/publication/6917542_In_a_different_position_conceptualizing_female_adolescent_sexuality_development_within_compulsory_heterosexuality/links/553981ca0cf2239f4e7d9391.pdf In a Different Position: Conceptualizing Female Adolescent Sexuality Development Within Compulsory Heterosexuality]",'' Tolman uses the term ''hegemonic masculinity'' to describe the set of norms and behaviors that dominate the social development of males.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolman|first=Deborah L.|date=2006-06-01|title=In a different position: Conceptualizing female adolescent sexuality development within compulsory heterosexuality|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|language=en|volume=2006|issue=112|pages=71–89|doi=10.1002/cd.163|issn=1534-8687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, hegemonic masculinity mirrors Rich's construct of compulsory heterosexuality by pointing out the social intuitions that demand specific behaviors from males; she says, "these norms demand that men deny most emotions, save for anger; be hard at all times and in all ways; engage in objectification of women and sex itself; and participate in the continuum of violence against women".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Compulsory heterosexuality also negatively affects gay men by teaching them from a young age that straightness is "normal" and therefore anything that deviates from that is abnormal. Debbie Epstein discusses in her book, ''[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30008242 Silenced Sexualities in Schools and Universities]'', how [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] standards as well as compulsory heterosexuality lead to young males not only feeling forced to appear heterosexual, but can lead to violence against these males if they deviate from expectations against them.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Debbie, Sarah OFlynn, and David Telford. ''Silenced sexualities in schools and universities''. Trentham Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Hellen Lenskyj has further suggested in her article "''Combating homophobia in sport and physical education''" that heterosexuality is enforced in males through imitation and violence against those who deviate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenskyj |first1=Helen |title=Combating Homophobia in Sport and Physical Education |journal=Sociology of Sport Journal |date=March 1991 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=61–69 |doi=10.1123/ssj.8.1.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these norms, males are taught from a young age that if they do not comply to heterosexual norms and standards they place themselves at risk for social exclusion and physical violence against them.

== Intersectionality with other minority identities ==
To understand the complexity of compulsory heterosexuality, several scholars have pointed out the importance of the impact of this construct on the differential effects on all populations, including minorities. In "[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v015/15.3richardson.pdf No More Secrets, No More Lies: African American History and Compulsory Heterosexuality]", Mattie Udora Richardson discusses the additional complexities faced by Black women in terms of forced compulsory heterosexuality. Udora Richardon points out that, "Any divergences from the social norms of marriage, domesticity, and the nuclear family have brought serious accusations of savagery, pathology, and deviance upon Black people."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = No More Secrets, No More Lies: African American History and Compulsory Heterosexuality|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v015/15.3richardson.html|journal = Journal of Women's History|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 1527-2036|pages = 63–76|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1353/jowh.2003.0080|first = Mattie Udora|last = Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She argues that as a group that is already stigmatized in multiple ways, Black women face additional pressures from both the Black and White communities towards heteronormativity.  Divergences from heterosexuality place Black women in particular risk of physical harm or social exile.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Dioxin affair''' was a political crisis that struck in Belgium during the spring of 1999.
Contamination of feedstock with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCB) was detected in animal food products, mainly eggs and chickens.
Although health inspectors reported the problem in January, measurements were taken only from May 1999 when the media revealed the case. The then [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (VLD) opposition leader [[Guy Verhofstadt]] claimed that the government was trying to cover up the so-called "nota Destickere", which proved that several [[secretary of state|secretaries of state]] were informed much earlier that the food contained [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s and [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]].

== Political scandal ==

The Dioxin Affair started with some complaints from chicken farmers who noticed increased death among newborn chickens. Laboratory analysis confirmed the presence of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin-like toxins]] well above normal limits in the eggs, tissues and feed of the affected birds. It was later confirmed that the dioxin-like toxicity was a result of the presence of PCBs, many of which form part of the group of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]] which have toxic properties, in the bird's feed.  

{{Interlanguage link multi|Karel Pinxten|nl}}, Minister of Agriculture, and {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Colla|nl}}, Minister of Health, immediately resigned their positions and a commission was installed to investigate the probable sources of contamination and the errors that had been made by the government. Later investigations revealed that the source of the contamination came from an oil-and-fat-recycling company, Verkest, from [[Deinze]]. The fats were reprocessed into animal feed that also contained [[transformer oil]] ([[coolant]] fluid), a known source of PCBs.

Public concern about the quality of animal food in general became a hot issue in the media. This forced the commission to ban certain recycling streams (like frying oil) from entering the [[food chain]] in order to prevent future contamination. Later studies indicated that there was never a serious danger to human health because the contaminated material was largely diluted during the production of the animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11896663 |year=2002 |last1=Bernard |first1=Alfred |last2=Broeckaert |first2=Fabrice |last3=De Poorter |first3=Geert |last4=De Cock |first4=A |last5=Hermans |first5=Cédric |last6=Saegerman |first6=Claude |last7=Houins |first7=Gilbert |title=The Belgian PCB/Dioxin Incident: Analysis of the Food Chain Contamination and Health Risk Evaluation |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1006/enrs.2001.4274 |journal=Environmental Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven million chickens and fifty thousand pigs were slaughtered and discarded.

Many farms were closed down for months and animal food products were banned from the market. During the investigation, questions were raised as to whether the costs for destroying the food and feedstock were necessary, as it seemed obvious that the contaminated food had already passed through the food market during the period from January to May. To protect the farmers, the Belgian government promised to compensate them for their losses.  The crisis also damaged the export of Belgian animal products. Many Belgians went shopping for meat and dairy products in foreign countries. The total costs of the food crisis are estimated at 25 billion francs, or 625 million Euros.

== Political implications ==
The dioxin crisis strongly influenced the [[Belgian federal election, 1999|federal elections of 1999]] (as well as the [[Belgian regional elections, 1999|regional elections of 1999]]). The governing party, [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian People's Party]] (CVP), suffered a historic loss and forced the end of [[Jean-Luc Dehaene|premier Jean-Luc Dehaene]]'s eight-year reign. This meant a victory for the VLD and [[Guy Verhofstadt]], who would become [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] until 2007. Green parties [[Ecolo]] and [[Green!|Agalev]] were also able to profit from the public concern around environment and food quality.

== Health implications ==
[[File:Dioxines diminution lait mamans all.jpg|thumb|Dioxins in [[mother's milk]], in Germany]]

In 2001, a public report announced that high dioxin levels were detected in Belgians' blood plasma compared to other European populations. A direct link to the dioxin crisis seemed obvious. Later comparison with blood samples that were taken before the crisis disproved this hypothesis. High levels could also be attributed to the dense populations and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.05.101 |title=PCDD/F levels in plasma of a belgian population before and after the 1999 belgian PCB/DIOXIN incident |year=2007 |last1=Debacker |first1=Noëmi |last2=Sasse |first2=André |last3=Van Wouwe |first3=Nathalie |last4=Goeyens |first4=Leo |last5=Sartor |first5=Francis |last6=Van Oyen |first6=Herman |journal=Chemosphere |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=S217–23 |pmid=17208274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eskimo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|k|ɪ|m|oʊ}}) is an English term for the [[indigenous peoples]] who have traditionally inhabited the northern circumpolar region from eastern [[Siberia]] (Russia) to across [[Alaska]] (of the United States), [[Canada]], and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="Stern2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pamela R. Stern |title=Historical Dictionary of the Inuit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |date= 2013 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7912-6 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main peoples known as "Eskimo" are: (1) the Alaskan [[Iñupiat]] peoples, [[Greenlandic Inuit]], and the mass-grouping [[Inuit]] peoples of Canada, and (2) the [[Yupik]] of eastern Siberia and Alaska. The Yupik comprise speakers of four distinct [[Yupik languages]]: one used in the [[Russian Far East]] and the others among people of Western Alaska, [[Southcentral Alaska]] and along the [[Gulf of Alaska]] coast. A third northern group, the [[Aleut]], is closely related to these two. They share a relatively recent common ancestor, and a language group ([[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]).

The word "Eskimo" derives from phrases that [[Algonquin people|Algonquin tribes]] used for their northern neighbors. The Inuit and Yupik peoples generally do not use it to refer to themselves, and the governments in Canada and Greenland have ceased using it in official documents.&lt;ref name="Waite2013" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Escimaux building a snow-hut.jpg|thumb|Inuit building an [[igloo]], by [[George Francis Lyon]], 1824]]
Several earlier indigenous peoples existed in the region. The earliest positively identified [[Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures ([[Early Paleo-Eskimo]]) date to 5,000 years ago. They appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the [[Arctic small tool tradition]] in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier. Similar artifacts have been found in Siberia that date to perhaps 18,000 years ago.

The Yupik languages and cultures in Alaska evolved in place, beginning with the original [[pre-Dorset]] indigenous culture developed in Alaska. Approximately 4000 years ago, the Unangan culture of the [[Aleut]] became distinct. It is not generally considered an Eskimo culture.

Approximately 1,500–2,000 years ago, apparently in northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across northern Alaska, through Canada and into Greenland. The distinct culture of the [[Thule people]] developed in northwestern Alaska and very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo people, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.

==Nomenclature==

===Origin===
{{Further|Native American name controversy}}

Two principal competing etymologies have been proposed for the name "Eskimo", both derived from the [[Innu language|Innu-aimun]] (Montagnais) language, an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of the Atlantic Ocean coast. The most commonly accepted today appears to be the proposal of [[Ives Goddard]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], who derives the term from the Montagnais word meaning "snowshoe-netter"&lt;ref name="aueo"/&gt; or "to net snowshoes."&lt;ref name=anlc /&gt; The word ''assime·w'' means "she laces a snowshoe" in Montagnais. Montagnais speakers refer to the neighbouring [[Mi'kmaq]] people using words that sound like ''eskimo''.&lt;ref name="goddard"&gt;Goddard, Ives (1984). "Synonymy," In ''Arctic'', ed. David Damas. Vol. 5 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant, pp. 5–7. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution.

New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Jose Mailhot, a Quebec anthropologist who speaks Montagnais, published a paper suggesting that Eskimo meant "people who speak a different language".&lt;ref name="mailhot1"&gt;Mailhot, J. (1978). "L'étymologie de «Esquimau» revue et corrigée," ''Etudes Inuit/Inuit Studies'' 2-2:59–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="creeml"/&gt; French traders who encountered the Montagnais in the eastern areas, adopted their word for the more western peoples and spelled it as ''Esquimau'' in a transliteration.

The {{citation needed span|date=July 2018|text=first printed use of the word|reason=The ref does not show this is the first printed use of the word, just that it was a printed use.

He is highly unlikely to have encountered French traders or their allies in his travels to have picked up a word for the present-day Inuit from them, as the fall of Quebec and the end of French activity in North America was just 6 years prior to his arrival.  On the contrary, trade at Fort Prince of Wales was conducted with the [[Cree]] and [[Chipewyan people|the Chipewyans]], and conducted at the shores of Hudson Bay at that time.  Trade, by ship, with the Esquimaux was one of Hearne's first assignments.  It would be on Hearne's watch that inland exploration would begin.  It was in the company of [[Matonabbee]] on his third attempt to find the sources of the copper in use by indigenous peoples that Hearne encountered the Inuit as described in [[Bloody Falls Massacre|Massacre at Bloody Falls]].  That the word 'esquimaux' as applying to the Inuit would have come from French sources, and from such southerly peoples as the Algonquians seems highly unlikely, but Hearne's use of the term and his manner of spelling it suggest that the term was already in use prior to his arrival in 1766.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In Canada and Greenland, the term ''Eskimo'' has largely been supplanted by the term ''Inuit''.&lt;ref name=anlc /&gt;&lt;ref name="stern1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ostg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ahdinuit"&gt;Usage note, [https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Inuit Inuit], ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Inuit'' can be accurately applied to all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia. In Alaska the term ''Eskimo'' is commonly used, because it includes both Yupik and Iñupiat. ''Inuit'' is not accepted as a collective term and it is not used specifically for Iñupiat (although they are related to the Canadian Inuit peoples).&lt;ref name=anlc/&gt;

In 1977, the [[Inuit Circumpolar Council|Inuit Circumpolar Conference]] (ICC) meeting in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]], officially adopted Inuit as a designation for all circumpolar native peoples, regardless of their local view on an appropriate term. As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with ''Inuit'' (''Inuk'' in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is ''Inuinnaq'',&lt;ref name=translate&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohokak|first=G.|author2=M. Kadlun |author3=B. Harnum |title=Inuinnaqtun-English Dictionary|publisher=Kitikmeot Heritage Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the eastern Canadian Arctic ''Inuit''. The language is often called ''[[Inuktitut]]'', though other local designations are also used. Despite the ICC's 1977 decision to adopt the term ''Inuit'', this was never accepted by the Yupik peoples, who likened it to calling all [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Indians ''[[Navajo]]'' simply because the Navajo felt that that's what all tribes should be called.

The [[Greenlandic Inuit|Inuit of Greenland]] refer to themselves as "Greenlanders" and speak the [[Greenlandic language]].&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal "Inuktitut, Greenlandic."] ''Ethnologue.'' Retrieved 6 Aug 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the linguistic, ethnic, and cultural differences between Yupik and Inuit peoples, it seems unlikely that any umbrella term will be acceptable. There has been some movement to use ''Inuit'', and the [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]], representing a circumpolar population of 150,000 Inuit and Yupik people of Greenland, Northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, in its charter defines ''Inuit'' for use within that ICC document as including "the Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, [[Inuvialuit]] (Canada), [[Kalaallit]] (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia)."&lt;ref name="ICCcharter"&gt;Inuit Circumpolar Council. (2006).

In 2010, the ICC passed a resolution in which they implored scientists to use "Inuit" and "Paleo-Inuit" instead of "Eskimo" or "Paleo-Eskimo".&lt;ref name="ICC2010-01"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Inuit Circumpolar Council|title=On the use of the term Inuit in scientific and other circles|type=Resolution 2010-01|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/uploads/3/0/5/4/30542564/iccexcouncilresolutiononterminuit.pdf|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; American linguist [[Lenore Grenoble]] has explicitly deferred to this resolution and used "Inuit–Yupik" instead of "Eskimo" with regards to the language branch.&lt;ref name="Grenoble, 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grenoble|first1=Lenore A.|editor1-last=Day|editor1-first=Delyn|editor2-last=Rewi|editor2-first=Poia|editor3-last=Higgins|editor3-first=Rawinia|title=The Journeys of Besieged Languages|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=978-1-4438-9943-7|page=284|chapter=Kalaallisut: The Language of Greenland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 commentary in the journal ''[[Arctic (journal)|Arctic]]'', Canadian archaeologist Max Friesen argued fellow Arctic archaeologists should follow the ICC and use "Paleo-Inuit" instead of "Paleo-Eskimo".&lt;ref name="Friesen, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friesen|first1=T.

But, in Alaska, the Inuit people refer to themselves as ''Iñupiat,'' plural, and ''Iñupiaq'', singular (their [[Inupiaq language|North Alaskan Inupiatun language]] is also called ''Iñupiaq''). They do not commonly use the term Inuit. In Alaska, ''Eskimo'' is in common usage.&lt;ref name=anlc /&gt;

Alaskans also use the term [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]], which is inclusive of all Eskimo, Aleut and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people of Alaska. It does not apply to Inuit or Yupik people originating outside the state. The term ''Alaska Native'' has important legal usage in Alaska and the rest of the United States as a result of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] of 1971.

The term "Eskimo" is also used in linguistic or ethnographic works to denote the larger branch of Eskimo–Aleut languages, the smaller branch being Aleut.

The [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] family of languages includes two cognate branches: the [[Aleut language|Aleut]] (Unangan) branch and the Eskimo branch.

The number of [[Grammatical case|cases]] varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to those of the Eskimo subfamily. Eskimo–Aleut languages possess voiceless plosives at the [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]] and [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] positions in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops but retained the [[Nasal consonant|nasal]]. In the Eskimo subfamily a voiceless [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] is also present.

The Eskimo sub-family consists of the [[Inuit languages|Inuit language]] and Yupik language sub-groups.&lt;ref name="FortecueM"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Comparative Eskimo Dictionary with Aleut Cognates | author = Michael Fortescue|author2=Steven Jacobson |author3=Lawance Kaplan | publisher = [[Alaska Native Language Center]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sirenik Eskimo language|Sirenikski language]], which is virtually extinct, is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Eskimo language family. Other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.&lt;ref name="FortecueM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplanB"&gt;Kaplan, Lawrence. (2001-12-10).

Inuit languages comprise a [[dialect continuum]], or dialect chain, that stretches from [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]] and [[Norton Sound]] in Alaska, across northern Alaska and Canada, and east to Greenland. Changes from western (Iñupiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., ''kumlu'', meaning "thumb", changes to ''kuvlu'', changes to ''kublu'',&lt;ref name=livingdict/&gt; changes to ''kulluk'',&lt;ref name=livingdict/&gt; changes to ''kulluq''&lt;ref name=livingdict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?language=en&amp;searchString=thumb&amp;languageSet=all |title=thumb|work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to understand one another, but speakers from dialects distant from each other on the dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another.&lt;ref name="kaplanB"/&gt; [[Seward Peninsula]] dialects in western Alaska, where much of the [[Iñupiat]] culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages. [[Tunumiit dialect|Eastern Greenlandic]], at the opposite end of the Inuit range, has had significant word replacement due to a unique form of ritual name avoidance.&lt;ref name="FortecueM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplanB"/&gt;

The four [[Yupik languages]], by contrast, including [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]] (Sugpiaq), [[Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]], [[Naukan Yupik language|Naukan]] (Naukanski), and [[Central Siberian Yupik language|Siberian Yupik]], are distinct languages with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences. They demonstrate limited mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="FortecueM"/&gt; Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup'ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages – Siberian Yupik and Naukan Yupik – are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, which is the southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically. Differences of vocabulary between Inuit and any one of the Yupik languages are greater than between any two Yupik languages.&lt;ref name="kaplanB"/&gt; Even the dialectal differences within Alutiiq and Central Alaskan Yup'ik sometimes are relatively great for locations that are relatively close geographically.&lt;ref name="kaplanB"/&gt;

The Sirenikski language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Eskimo language family, but other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.&lt;ref name="kaplanB"/&gt;

The Inuit inhabit the [[Arctic]] and northern [[Bering Sea]] coasts of Alaska in the United States, and Arctic coasts of the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[Quebec]], and [[Labrador]] in Canada, and Greenland (associated with Denmark). Until fairly recent times, there has been a remarkable homogeneity in the culture throughout this area, which traditionally relied on fish, [[marine mammal]]s, and land animals for food, heat, light, clothing, and tools. They maintain a unique [[Inuit culture]].

{{Main| Yupik}}
The Yupik are indigenous or aboriginal peoples who live along the coast of western Alaska, especially on the [[Yukon River|Yukon]]-[[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]] delta and along the Kuskokwim River ([[Yup'ik|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]]); in southern Alaska (the [[Alutiiq]]); and along the eastern coast of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] in the Russian Far East and [[St. Lawrence Island]] in western Alaska (the [[Siberian Yupik]]). The Yupik economy has traditionally been strongly dominated by the harvest of [[marine mammal]]s, especially [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and [[whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Yupik". (2008). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved January 13, 2008, from: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/655025/Yupik Encyclopædia Britannica Online] Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alutiiq===
{{Main|Alutiiq}}
The Alutiiq, also called ''Pacific Yupik'' or ''Sugpiaq'', are a southern, coastal branch of Yupik. They are not to be confused with the Aleut, who live further to the southwest, including along the [[Aleutian Islands]]. They traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources such as [[salmon]], [[halibut]], and whales, as well as rich land resources such as berries and land mammals. Alutiiq people today live in coastal fishing communities, where they work in all aspects of the modern economy. They also maintain the cultural value of a subsistence lifestyle.

The Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the Yupik in the [[Bethel, Alaska]] area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on [[Kodiak Island]], and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern [[Kenai Peninsula]] and in [[Prince William Sound]]. Residents of [[Nanwalek, Alaska|Nanwalek]], located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near [[Seldovia, Alaska|Seldovia]], speak what they call Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the hundreds, Alutiiq communities are working to revitalize their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alutiiqmuseum.org/learn/the-alutiiq-sugpiaq-people/language/906-language-loss-revitalization|title=Language Loss &amp; Revitalization|website=alutiiqmuseum.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Alaskan Yup'ik===
{{Main|Yup'ik}}
''Yup'ik'', with an apostrophe, denotes the speakers of the Central Alaskan [[Yup'ik language]], who live in western Alaska and southwestern Alaska from southern [[Norton Sound]] to the north side of [[Bristol Bay]], on the [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], and on [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]]. The use of the apostrophe in the name ''Yup'ik'' is a written convention to denote the long pronunciation of the ''p'' sound; but it is spoken the same in other [[Yupik languages]]. Of all the [[Alaska Native languages]], Central Alaskan Yup'ik has the most speakers, with about 10,000 of a total Yup'ik population of 21,000 still speaking the language. The five dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik include General Central Yup'ik, and the Egegik, Norton Sound, Hooper Bay-Chevak, and Nunivak dialects. In the latter two dialects, both the language and the people are called ''Cup'ik''.&lt;ref name="centralyup'ik"&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Alaska Native Language Center]].

{{Main|Siberian Yupik}}
Siberian Yupik reside along the Bering Sea coast of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in Siberia in the Russian Far East&lt;ref name="kaplanB"/&gt; and in the villages of [[Gambell, Alaska|Gambell]] and [[Savoonga, Alaska|Savoonga]] on St. Lawrence Island in Alaska.&lt;ref name="siberianyupik"&gt;Alaska Native Language Center.

Retrieved on August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Siberian Yupik spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula and on St. Lawrence Island is nearly identical. About 1,050 of a total Alaska population of 1,100 Siberian Yupik people in Alaska speak the language. It is the first language of the home for most St. Lawrence Island children. In Siberia, about 300 of a total of 900 Siberian Yupik people still learn and study the language, though it is no longer learned as a first language by children.&lt;ref name="siberianyupik"/&gt;

===Naukan===

{{Main|Sirenik Eskimos}}
Some speakers of Siberian Yupik languages used to speak an Eskimo variant in the past, before they underwent a [[language shift]]. These former speakers of [[Sirenik Eskimo language]] inhabited the settlements of [[Sireniki]], &lt;!--This is the correct spelling as per the source. Please don't use AWB to change it. Thanks.--&gt;Imtuk, and some small villages stretching to the west from Sireniki along south-eastern coasts of Chukchi Peninsula.&lt;ref name=VES&gt;[http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/bevakhtin.pdf Vakhtin 1998]: 162&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in neighborhoods with Siberian Yupik and [[Chukchi people]]s.

As early as in 1895, &lt;!--This is the correct spelling as per the source. Please don't use AWB to change it. Thanks.--&gt;Imtuk was a settlement with a mixed population of Sirenik Eskimos and Ungazigmit&lt;ref&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 7&lt;/ref&gt; (the latter belonging to Siberian Yupik). Sirenik Eskimo culture has been influenced by that of Chukchi, and the language shows [[Chukchi language]] influences.&lt;ref name=linfranc&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000861/086162e.pdf Menovshchikov 1990]: 70&lt;/ref&gt; Folktale [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] also show the influence of Chuckchi culture.&lt;ref name=rein-rape&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The above peculiarities of this (already [[Extinct language|extinct]]) Eskimo language amounted to mutual unintelligibility even with its nearest language relatives:&lt;ref&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; in the past, Sirenik Eskimos had to use the unrelated Chukchi language as a [[lingua franca]] for communicating with Siberian Yupik.&lt;ref name=linfranc/&gt;

Many words are formed from entirely different [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s from in Siberian Yupik,&lt;ref name=diff-root&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 42&lt;/ref&gt; but even the grammar has several peculiarities distinct not only among Eskimo languages, but even compared to Aleut. For example, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] is not known in Sirenik Eskimo, while most [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]] have dual,&lt;ref name=only2&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 38&lt;/ref&gt; including its neighboring Siberian Yupikax relatives.&lt;ref name=verb2&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the origin of this diversity. The peculiarities of this language may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Eskimo groups,&lt;ref&gt;Меновщиков 1962: 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Меновщиков 1964: 9&lt;/ref&gt; and being in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries. The influence of the Chukchi language is clear.&lt;ref name=linfranc/&gt;

Because of all these factors, the classification of Sireniki Eskimo language is not settled yet:&lt;ref name=VE3&gt;[http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/bevakhtin.pdf Vakhtin 1998]: 161&lt;/ref&gt; Sireniki language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of Eskimo (at least, its possibility is mentioned).&lt;ref name="VE3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vakh-Sir&gt;Linguist List's description about [http://linguistlist.org/people/personal/get-personal-page2.cfm?PersonID=5548&amp;RequestTimeout=500 Nikolai Vakhtin]'s book: [http://linguistlist.org/pubs/books/get-book.cfm?BookID=938 ''The Old Sirinek Language: Texts, Lexicon, Grammatical Notes''].

'''''Future Shock''''' is a 1970 book by the [[futurist|futurists]] [[Alvin Toffler|Alvin and Heidi Toffler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alvin Toffler: still shocking after all these years - Interview|journal=New Scientist|date=19 March 1994|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14119173-500-alvin-toffler-still-shocking-after-all-these-years/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the authors define the term "''future shock''" as a certain psychological state of individuals and entire societies. Their shortest definition for the term is a personal [[perception]] of "too much change in too short a period of time". The book, which became an international bestseller, grew out of an article "The Future as a Way of Life" in [[Horizon (U.S. magazine)|''Horizon'' magazine]], Summer 1965 issue.&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin, "The Future as a Way of Life", Horizon magazine, Summer 1965, Vol VII, Num 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://notearama.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/horizon-magazine-hardcover-issues-1959.html "Horizon Magazine hardcover issues 1959 – 1977 table of contents"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhart, Mary, [http://www.yoyow.com/marye/tofflers94.html "Alvin And Heidi Toffler: Surfing The Third Wave: On Life And Work In The Information Age"], MicroTimes #118, January 3, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/toffler.php "Alvin Toffler: still shocking after all these years: New Scientist meets the controversial futurologist"], [[New Scientist]], 19 March 1994, pp. 22–25. "What led you to write Future Shock? – While covering Congress, it occurred to us that big technological and social changes were occurring in the United States, but that the political system seemed totally blind to their existence. Between 1955 and 1960, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was introduced, television became universalized, commercial jet travel came into being and a whole raft of other technological events occurred. Having spent several years watching the political process, we came away feeling that 99 per cent of what politicians do is keep systems running that were laid in place by previous generations of politicians. Our ideas came together in 1965 in an article called 'The future as a way of life', which argued that change was going to accelerate and that the speed of change could induce disorientation in lots of people. We coined the phrase 'future shock' as an analogy to the concept of culture shock. With future shock you stay in one place but your own culture changes so rapidly that it has the same disorienting effect as going to another culture"&lt;/ref&gt; The book has sold over 6 million copies and has been widely translated.

A [[Future Shock (film)|documentary film]] based on the book was released in 1972 with [[Orson Welles]] as on-screen narrator.

==Term==
The Tofflers argued that society is undergoing an enormous structural change, a revolution from an [[industrial society]] to a "[[super-industrial society]]". This change overwhelms people. He believed the accelerated rate of technological and social change left people disconnected and suffering from "shattering stress and disorientation"—future shocked. The Tofflers stated that the majority of social problems are symptoms of future shock. In their discussion of the components of such shock, they popularized the term "''[[information overload]]''."

This analysis of the phenomenon of information overload is continued in later publications, especially ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' and ''[[Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth and Violence at the Edge of the 21st Century|Powershift]]''.

In the introduction to an essay entitled "Future Shock" in his book, ''Conscientious Objections'', [[Neil Postman]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Sometime about the middle of 1963, my colleague Charles Weingartner and I delivered in tandem an address to the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]. In that address we used the phrase "future shock" as a way of describing the social paralysis induced by rapid technological change. To my knowledge, Weingartner and I were the first people ever to use it in a public forum. Of course, neither Weingartner nor I had the brains to write a book called ''Future Shock'', and all due credit goes to [[Alvin Toffler]] for having recognized a good phrase when one came along" (p.&amp;nbsp;162).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of society and production==
[[Alvin Toffler|Alvin and Heidi]] distinguished three stages in development of society and production: agrarian, industrial and post-industrial.

All these waves develops own "super-ideology” with which explain the reality. This ideology affects all the spheres which make up a civilization phase: technology, social patterns, information patterns and "power" patterns.

The first stage began in the period of the [[Neolithic]] Era when people invented [[agriculture]], thereby passing from [[Barbarian|barbarity]] to a [[civilization]]. A large number of people acted as [[prosumers]] (eating their grown food, hunting animals, building their own houses, making clothes,....). People traded by exchanging their own goods for commodities of others. The second stage began in England with the Industrial Revolution during which people invented the [[machine tool]] and the [[steam engine]]. People worked in factories to make money they could spend on goods they needed (it means they produced for exchange, not for use). Countries also created new social systems. The third stage began in the second half of the 20th century in the West when people invented automatic production, robotics and the [[computer]]. The [[services sector]] attained great value. 

The Tofflers proposed one criterion for distinguishing between [[industrial society]] and [[post-industrial society]]: the share of the [[population]]  occupied in agriculture versus the share of city labor occupied in the services sector.  In a post-industrial society, the share of the people occupied in agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share of city laborers occupied in the services sector exceeds 50%. Thus, the share of the people occupied with brainwork greatly exceeds the share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society.

[[Third Wave Democracy|The third wave]] led to the [[Information Era]] (now). Homes are the dominant institutions. Most people carry on their own production and consumption in their homes or electronic cottages, they produce more of their own products and services and markets become less important for them. People consider each other to be equally free as vendors of prosumer-generated commodities.

==Fear of the future==
[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|[[Midtown Manhattan]] in New York City, the largest central business district in the United States]]
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's main thought consists of the fact that modern man feels shock from rapid changes. For example, Toffler's daughter went to shop in [[New York City]] and she couldn't find a shop in its previous location. Thus New York has become a city without a [[history]]. The urban population doubles every 11 years. The overall production of goods and services doubles each 50 years in developed countries. Society experiences an increasing number of changes with an increasing rapidity, while people are losing the familiarity that old institutions ([[religion]], [[family]], [[national identity]], [[profession]]) once provided. The so-called "[[brain drain]]" – the [[emigration]] of European scientists to the United States – is both an indicator of the changes in society and also one of their causes.

==Features of post-industrial society==
[[File:100 Yen lighter.JPG|thumb|A generic, disposable lighter.]]
*Many goods have become [[disposable]] as the cost of manual repair or cleaning has become greater than the cost of making new goods due to [[mass production]]. Examples of disposable goods include [[ballpoint pen]]s, [[lighter]]s, [[plastic bottle]]s, and [[paper towels]].
*The design of goods becomes outdated quickly. (And so, for example, a second generation of computers appears before the end of the [[service life|expected period of usability]] of the first generation). It is possible to rent almost everything (from a ladder to a wedding dress), thus eliminating the need for ownership.
*Whole branches of [[industry]] die off and new branches of industry arise. This affects unskilled workers who are compelled to change their residence to find new jobs. The constant change in the [[Market (economics)|market]] also poses a problem for advertisers who must deal with moving targets.
*People of post-industrial society change their profession and their workplace often. People have to change professions because professions quickly become outdated.  People of post-industrial society thus have many [[career]]s in a lifetime. The knowledge of an [[engineer]] becomes outdated in ten years. People look more and more for temporary jobs.
*To follow transient jobs, people have become [[nomad]]s. For example, immigrants from [[Algeria]], [[Turkey]] and other countries go to Europe to find work. Transient people are forced to change residence, phone number, [[school]], friends, car license, and contact with [[family]] often. As a result, relationships tend to be superficial with a large number of people, instead of being intimate or close relationships that are more stable. Evidence for this is tourist travel and holiday romances.
*The [[driver's license]], received at age 16, has become the [[teenager]]'s admission to the world of adults, because it symbolizes the ability to move independently.
*Death of Permanence. The post industrial society will be marked by a transient culture where everything ranging from goods to human relationships will be temporary.

[[Curtis Mayfield]]'s song "[[Future Shock (Curtis Mayfield song)|Future Shock]]" on the album "[[Back to the World (Curtis Mayfield album)|Back to the World]]" took its name from this book, and was in turn covered by [[Herbie Hancock]] as the title track for his 1983 recording ''[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]''. That album was considered groundbreaking for fusing [[jazz]] and [[funk]] with [[electronic music]]. [[Stanley Clarke]] performed a song with the same title on his 1984 album [[Time Exposure (Stanley Clarke album)|Time Exposure]]. The rock band, BANG released "Future Shock" on their self titled Capitol Records release in 1972

In the 1974 movie ''[[The Parallax View]]'' the character Joe relates a story to Lee about a wife having an affair with her psychiatrist and then a bulldozer knocking down his house by calling it ''future shock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subzin.com/quotes/M6928efb3/The+Parallax+View/That%27s+future+shock%2C+Lee |title=Movie Quotes. The Parallax View |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=subzin.com |publisher= |access-date=August 30, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works taking their title from the book include: the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Future Stock]]"; [[Bailter Space|The Gordons]] 1981 EP on [[Flying Nun Records]]; a segment on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' starring [[Samantha Bee]]; Kevin Goldstein's recurring column on the ''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' website; a ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' pre-constructed deck; and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[Starrcade (1989)|1989 Starrcade]] event.

Since 1977, UK Comic [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] has run a series of short stories called [[Future Shocks]] based on this concept, some of which were written by [[Alan Moore]]. The abbreviated derogatory term ''Futsies'' was applied to citizens in 2000 AD stories (mainly in the [[Judge Dredd]] universe) who had been driven insane by Future Shock.

Works deriving themes and elements from Future Shock include the science fiction novels ''[[The Forever War]]'' (1974) by [[Joe Haldeman]], ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' (1975) by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], the [[role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'' (2002) by [[Steve Jackson Games]], and the [[indie RPG]] ''[[Shock: Social Science Fiction]]'' (2006) by designer [[Joshua A.C. Newman]]. [[Experimental music|Experimental]] music group [[Death Grips]] use the lyric "Culture shock, future shock, fuck yourself, choke yourself" in their song "[[Exmilitary|Culture Shock]]".

The line ''You knocked a '''future shock''' crowbar upside my head'' occurs in the track "The Outsiders" on the alternative rock band [[R.E.M.]]'s 2004 album ''[[Around the Sun]]''.

In 2011, a song titled "Future Shock" by Darwin, Obie, and Mr-E appeared on the album ''Nu Nrg 100'', the final installment of the world-renowned label Nu Energy, while Brooklyn-based band [[TV on the Radio]] included a song titled "No Future Shock" on their album ''[[Nine Types of Light]]''. The same year, the [[Unsound Festival|Unsound Music Festival]] in [[Krakow, Poland]] took the concept of 'future shock' as its theme.

[[William Brittelle]], the Brooklyn-based composer of pop-influenced electro-acoustic art music, has an album called "Future Shock".

The sense of future shock is an integral aspect of [[cyberpunk]].

Futureshock were also an electronic music duo recording for Junior Boys Own and Parlophone / EMI. The members were Phil Dockerty and Alex Tepper.

The Future Shock Book was lying on the deceased Wendell Armbruster Sr.'s desk in the 1972 movie [[Avanti!]] starring [[Jack Lemmon]].

[[File:Legal statuses of German in the world.svg|thumb|Namibia is a German-language territory far outside of Central Europe]]

[[Namibia]] is a multilingual country wherein [[German language|German]] is recognised as a [[national language]] (a form of minority language). While [[English language|English]] is the sole official language of the country since 1990, in many areas of the country German enjoys official status at a community level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az.com.na/fileadmin/pdf/2007/deutsch_in_namibia_2007_07_18.pdf|title=Deutsch in Namibia|publisher=Beilage der Allgemeinen Zeitung|date=18 July 2007|accessdate=23 June 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624233949/http://www.az.com.na/fileadmin/pdf/2007/deutsch_in_namibia_2007_07_18.pdf|archivedate=24 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German is especially widely used in central and southern Namibia and was until 1990 one of three official languages in what was then [[South West Africa]], alongside [[Afrikaans]] and English. German is the main or mother tongue of about 30,000 Namibians, a number composed roughly equally of [[German Namibians]] as well as older black speakers of [[Namibian Black German]] and Namibians who as children grew up in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany). The German Namibian newspaper ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' on its website refers to 22,000 native speakers and of several hundred thousand who know German as a second (third etc.) language. German benefits from its similarity to Afrikaans and has a prominent position in the tourism and business sectors. Many Namibian natural features, place and street names have German names. However, Germanic linguist Ulrich Ammon sees the future of German in Namibia as threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Fischer: [http://www.az.com.na/lokales/erhalt-von-deutsch-and-fraglich-and.113442.php ''Erhalt von Deutsch "fraglich".''] In: ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)|Allgemeine Zeitung]].'' 13. September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:WindhukSchild.jpg|thumb|200px|Sign in Windhoek with directions to the German colonial-era monuments [[Christ Church, Windhoek|Christ Church]], [[Alte Feste]] and [[Reiterdenkmal, Windhoek|Reiterdenkmal]]]]
[[File:AllgemeineZeitungNamibia.png|thumb|200px|The ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' is the only German-language daily newspaper in Africa and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in Namibia]]

During the period as a German colony from 1884 to 1915 German was the only official language in [[German Southwest Africa]], as Namibia was then known. [[Boers]], i.e. South African whites who spoke Dutch (South African Dutch would later develop into Afrikaans) already lived in the country alongside [[Orlam]] tribes and mixed-race [[Rehoboth, Namibia|Reheboth]] [[Basters]].

South Africa took over administration of the country in 1915. However, German language privileges and education remained in place. In 1916 the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)|Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' newspaper was founded under its original name of ''Der Kriegsbote''. After the end of the First World War the South African attitude to the German Namibians changed, and between 1919 and 1920 about half of the Germans were transferred out of the country. In 1920 Dutch (later to be superseded by Afrikaans) and English replaced German as the official languages of the country.

The German-speaking population wished German to be reinstated as an official language and in 1932 the Treaty of Cape Town encouraged South Africa to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klausdierks.com/Geschichte/86.htm "Nach den Bestimmungen des Vertrages von Kapstadt wird die südafrikanische Regierung aufgefordert, deutsch als dritte Amtssprache einzuführen."]&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped that this would throw a spanner in the works against South Africa annexing South West Africa into the Union of South Africa. South Africa did not officially recognise German; however, de facto German was added to Afrikaans and English as a working language of the government. Only in 1984 would German officially be added as an official language.

After independence in 1990, English became the sole official language of Namibia, and German thus lost its official status, but German today continues to be used in a wide range of spheres of Namibian life.

=== Situation today ===

==== Degree of use ====
German is more widely used than may be assumed by its lack of official status. About 31,000 Namibians speak German as a mother tongue, and several tens of thousands of Namibians, either white native speakers of English or Afrikaans or well-to-do black Namibians, speak German as a second language. German is taught in many schools, and is the medium for a daily newspaper, the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)|Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', as well as daily programming on the [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Although German (and for that matter English) is not common as a mother tongue among the black population, a number of public servants especially in the tourism sector speak German to various degrees.

However, there are many spheres in which the German language is not or barely present at all — spheres with a small number of white people, especially in the north part of the country, but also in many neighbourhoods of Windhoek.

====Culture====
German is used as a medium of communication in a wide range of cultural spheres:
* Churches, most notably the German-speaking [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (GELK)]]
* Schools (e.g. in the [[Deutsche Höhere Privatschule Windhoek]])
* Literature (German-Namibian authors include [[Giselher W. Hoffmann]])
* Radio and television (German-language programming of the [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]])
* Music (e.g. artist [[EES (rapper)|EES]])
* Online media (as standard German or Namdeutsch [Namibian German] in social media, forums or online newspapers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gm.winter-verlag.de/list/articles/author/Radke,%20Henning|title='Lekker dieses namtal zu lesen. Ich hou davon.' Namdeutscher Sprachgebrauch in namibischer Onlinekommunikation|last=Radke|first=Henning|date=2017|website=gm.winter-verlag.de|series=In: Germanistische Mitteilungen|pages=109-132|language=de|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====

In addition to 32 schools in which about 14,000 pupils learn German as a foreign language, there are about a dozen German-medium schools, including the [[Deutsche Höhere Privatschule Windhoek]] (DHPS), German schools in [[Omaruru, Namibia|Omaruru]] and [[Otjiwarongo]] as well as five government schools. There are several additional elementary schools, German-medium high schools and a German-medium ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in Windhoek.
The [[University of Namibia]] offers German-medium programs in [[German studies]] and [[business administration]].

==== Signs ====
[[Image:NamibiaMehrsprachigkeit.jpg|thumb|Examples of multilingual signs in Namibia]]
Signs for shops, restaurants and services are often in English and German, reflecting not only a high proportion of German-Namibian ownership but also the high number of German-speaking tourists that visit the country. However, a customer entering such as shop may well be greeted in Afrikaans; relatively fewer signs are in Afrikaans but the language retains a leading position as a spoken lingua franca in Windhoek and throughout the central and southern parts of the country.

German is also found on signs for tourists, especially those to monuments and historic buildings from the German colonial period. Other signs that include German date back before 1990, when English, Afrikaans and German shared status as official languages of the country.

====Street names====
In [[Windhoek]], [[Swakopmund]], [[Keetmanshoop]], [[Grootfontein]] and [[Lüderitz]] many or most street names are German in origin, even though after 1990 many streets were renamed to honor black Namibian people. (See for example [[List of former Swakopmund street names]]). Streets named before 1990 often end in "Str.", the standard abbreviation in German for ''Straße'', and in Afrikaans for ''straat''; streets renamed since 1990 often end in "St.", implying the English abbreviation for "Street".&lt;ref name="AZ_2001"&gt;[http://www.az.com.na/politik/strae-umgetauft.2062.php ''Straße umgetauft.''] In: ''Allgemeine Zeitung.'' 19. Dezember 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AZ_2003"&gt;[http://www.az.com.na/lokales/umbenennung-sorgt-fr-irrwege.5350.php ''Umbenennung sorgt für Irrwege.''] In: ''Allgemeine Zeitung.'' 19. Juni 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Place names ====
[[Image:StrassenschildMaltahoeheMariental.jpg|thumb|German place names are especially prevalent in the south of the country]]
[[Image:NamibiaDetailFinal.jpg|thumb|Namibia contains many Afrikaans and German place names, except for in the northern part of the country]]
Unlike other parts of the world with large German immigration and large numbers of German place names, Namibia never experienced a wave of place-name changes. Especially in the south, in the regions of [[Hardap Region|Hardap]] and [[Karas Region, Namibia|Karas]], about 80% of all place names are either German, Afrikaans, or a mix of German or Afrikaans with English. Examples include "Keetmanshoop" (after German industrialist ''Johann Keetman'' and the Afrikaans word for "hope", ''hoop''.

The German language as spoken in Namibia is characterised by simplification and the adoption of many words from [[Afrikaans]], English, and [[Ovambo language|Ovambo]] and other [[Bantu languages]]. This variant of German is called variously ''Südwesterdeutsch'' (German ''südwest'', southwest, referring to the country's former name, [[South West Africa]]); while younger people also call it ''Namsläng'' (i.e. Namibian slang) or ''Namlish''.

'''Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston Barnett''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (''née'' '''Rowland'''; 4 May 1851 – 10 June 1936) was a notable English [[social reformer]], educationist, and author. She and her husband, [[Samuel Augustus Barnett]], founded the first "University Settlement" at [[Toynbee Hall]] (in the [[East End of London]]) in 1884. They also worked to establish the model [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] in the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Born in [[Clapham]], London, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland lost her mother (Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges)&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simkin|first1=John|title=Henrietta Barnett|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Henrietta_Barnett.htm|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an early age. Her father, Alexander William Rowland, a wealthy businessman associated with the [[Macassar oil|Macassar Oil Company]],&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt; raised her and seven siblings at their London home and a country house in [[Kent]], where she developed a lifelong appreciation of country pursuits. One of her sisters was the philanthropist [[Alice Hart]].&lt;ref name="hgs.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgs.org.uk/reference/hbbiography/ckreview.html |title=Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel a review by Chris Kellerman |website=Hgs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infed1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/henrietta-barnett-social-reform-and-community-building |title=Henrietta Barnett, social reform and community building |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, Henrietta was sent to a boarding school in Devon run by the Haddon sisters, who, influenced by [[James Hinton]],&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt; were committed to social altruism. When her father died in 1869, Henrietta moved with two sisters to Bayswater, where she met and helped social activist and housing reformer [[Octavia Hill]].&lt;ref name="infed1" /&gt; Hill introduced Henrietta to the writings of [[John Ruskin]], as well as many influential people similarly interested in improving the condition of London's poor.

==Marriage and activism==
Through Hill, Henrietta met [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Samuel Barnett, then the curate of [[St Mary's, Bryanston Square]]. They married in 1873. The newlyweds soon moved to the impoverished [[Whitechapel]] parish of St Jude's, intent on improving social conditions. Henrietta continued her parish visiting activities, with a focus on women and children, including the more than 2,000 prostitutes then active in Whitechapel alone.&lt;ref name="hgs.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgs.org.uk/reference/hbbiography/ckreview.html |title=Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel a review by Chris Kellerman |website=Hgs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, Henrietta became a woman guardian for the parish, and the following year was named a school manager for the [[Poor law union|Poor Law district]] schools in [[Forest Gate]]. Another social initiative which the Barnetts helped set up was the [[Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants]] (1876), with [[Jane Senior]]; the organisation aimed to prevent girls from becoming prostitutes, criminals or alcoholics, and provided domestic servants.&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt;  The Barnetts' experiment in sending slum children for country holidays grew into the Children's Fresh Air Mission (Off to the Country), established in 1877,&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infed.org/mobi/henrietta-barnett-social-reform-and-community-building Children's Country Holiday Fund], Retrieved 14 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the Children's Country Holidays Fund in 1884.&lt;ref name="CCHF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.cchf-allaboutkids.org.uk/ourhistory.htm|website=CCHF - All About Kids|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henrietta Barnett promoted Homes for Workhouse Girls starting in 1880, and founded the London Pupil Teachers Association in 1891. She also served as vice-president of the National Association for the Welfare of the Feeble-Minded (1895) and [[National Council of Women of Great Britain|National Union of Women Workers]] (1895–96).
[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|Toynbee Hall 1902]]
In 1884, the Barnetts established (and began living at) [[Toynbee Hall]], a pioneering university [[settlement house|settlement]] named after the recently deceased distinguished historian [[Arnold Toynbee]],&lt;ref&gt;
Seth Koven, ‘Barnett , Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston (1851–1936)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2013 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30610, accessed 14 Jan 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; who had advocated education of the working classes and reduction of the division between social classes. In 1897 annual loan exhibitions of fine art began at the nearby [[Whitechapel Gallery]] through the Barnetts' efforts. In 1903 [[Richard Tawney]] began working with them, the Children's Country Holiday Fund, and the [[Workers' Educational Association]]. [[William Beveridge]] and [[Clement Attlee]] also worked with the Barnetts as they started their own careers. A visit to Toynbee Hall inspired [[Jane Addams]] to found Hull House in Chicago.

[[File:1 South Square, Hampstead Garden Suburb 2.JPG|thumb|left|1 South Square, Hampstead Garden Suburb, former home of Henrietta Barnett]]
In 1889 the activist couple acquired a weekend home at Spaniard's End in the [[Hampstead]] area of north-west London. The Barnetts became inspired by [[Ebenezer Howard]] and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by [[Letchworth]] garden city), as well as protecting part of nearby [[Hampstead Heath]] from development by [[Eton College]]. In 1904, they established trusts which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to [[Golders Green]]. This became the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], a model garden city developed through their efforts and those of architects [[Raymond Unwin]] and Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] and which ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgstrust.org/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232730/http://hgstrust.org/history/index.html |archivedate=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, an adult education institute opened in the middle of the new Hampstead Garden Suburb, with cultural programmes and discussion groups. Soon a school for girls was established and named the [[Henrietta Barnett School]].&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

Although the suburb was never completely developed according to Lutyens's plan (and soon became a middle class enclave rather than a mixture of classes), it did include Grade I listed [[St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb|St Jude's Church]], as well as a clubhouse and a tea house (for non-alcoholic social focus), a Quaker meeting house, children's homes, a nursery school, and housing for old people. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The Barnetts never had children of their own. They adopted Dorothy Woods, and Henrietta also served as legal guardian for her brain-damaged elder sister, Fanny. After Samuel died in 1913, Henrietta founded Barnett House at Oxford (1914) in his memory. She helped it become the university's centre for social work and social policy education.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Writing==
Barnett wrote several books, alone and with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=BARNETT, Mrs. (Henrietta Octavia)|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Christian Socialist]] beliefs are set out in ''Practicable Socialism'' (1889) and ''Toward Social Reform'' (1909).

Her early books concerned domestic issues: ''The Making of the Home'' (1885), ''How to Mind the Baby,'' (1887) and, written with her husband and [[Ernest Abraham Hart]] (her brother-in-law), ''The Making of the Body'' (1894). With Kathleen Mallam, Henrietta Barnett also edited a collection of essays entitled ''Destitute, Neglected, and Delinquent Children'' (Pan-Anglican papers, 1908). After her husband's death, Henrietta Barnett finished their ''Illustrated British Ballads Old and New'' (1915), wrote his multi-volume biography, ''Canon Barnett: his life, work and friends'' (1918) as well as published collections of essays, most notably ''Matters that Matter'' (1930). {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Honours==
For her work as a social reformer, Barnett was named a [[CBE|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1917, and elevated to [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in 1924. In 1920, she was named honorary president of the 480 member American Federation of Settlements.

==Death and legacy==
For the final dozen years of her life, Henrietta Barnett took up painting and often lived at 45 Wish Road, Hove (today marked by a [[blue plaque]]).

She died at Hampstead in 1936 (aged 85) and is buried (with Samuel) in the churchyard of [[St Helen's Church, Hangleton]], East Sussex.&lt;ref name="Dale227"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dale|first=Antony|title=Brighton Churches|year=1989|location=London EC4|isbn=0-415-00863-8|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barnetts are jointly remembered on 17 June on the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|liturgical calendar]] of the [[Church of England]].

'''Holt Coffey''' (August 2, 1891 – January 1964)&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]][http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi]&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[sheriff]] of [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte County]], [[Missouri]] from 1933 until 1937 and again from 1941 until 1945. Coffey, along with newly elected Platte City Prosecutor David Clevenger, was responsible for cleaning up much of the small-time crime around Platte County, a suburb of freewheeling [[Kansas City Massacre|Kansas City, Missouri]].

On July 18, 1933, during Coffey's first term as sheriff, [[Bonnie and Clyde]] and three other gang members checked into the [[Red Crown Tourist Court]] south of Platte City. The conspicuous behavior of the gang caught Coffey's and others' interest, and on July 20, a ferocious firefight between the Barrows and thirteen officers injured both Coffey and his sixteen-year-old son Clarence. While Clarence suffered a wound in his arm that at one time was considered life-threatening, the elder Coffey sought no treatment for his minor wounds. The Barrows escaped and were cornered and engaged again by another posse five days later in Iowa.

An expert marksman, Coffey was also a one-time [[minor-league baseball]] player. The Coffey family maintained a close relationship with [[Blanche Barrow]], sister-in-law of Clyde, with Blanche claiming the Coffeys were more kind than her own family.

Coffey went on to own and operate the Red Crown Tavern from 1945 to 1950. He became a [[county commissioner]] in 1956. He died at age 72 in 1964.

'''James Robert Cummins''' or Cummings, aka: "Windy Jim" (January 31, 1847 &amp;ndash; July 9, 1929) was an American criminal.

Cummins lived near [[Kearney, Missouri]] and rode with [[Quantrill's Raiders]] during the Civil War, most often assigned to follow "Bloody" Bill Anderson. A known horse thief, he joined up with the [[James-Younger gang|James-Younger Gang]] after the war and was involved in the train robberies at Winston and Blue Cut, Missouri. After the breakup of the James Gang, he became a farmer in Arkansas and actually tried to turn himself in several times, but no one believed he was really Jim Cummins.&lt;ref name=OutlawSummary&gt;{{cite web|title=James and Youngers|url=http://www.civilwarstlouis.com/history/jamesgangoutlaws.htm|work=Civil War St. Louis|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 63 he married Florence Sherwood &lt;ref name=OutlawSummary /&gt; and lived to an old age.

In 1903 he published a memoir of his time with the James-Younger gang, "Jim Cummins' Book Written by Himself, The Life Story of the James and Younger Gang and Their Comrades, Including the Operations of Quantrell's Guerrillas, By One Who Rode With Them: A True But Terrible Tale of Outlawry."  &lt;ref name=LibraryItem&gt;{{cite web|title=Missouri Valley Special Collections : Item Viewer|url=http://www.kchistory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/outlaws&amp;CISOPTR=39&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15|publisher=Missouri Valley Special Collections, Kansas City Public Library, Kansas City, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in the [[Old soldiers' home|Old Soldiers Home]] at Higginsville Missouri on July 9, 1929.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Who Fought With Jesse James Loses His Greatest Struggle|url=http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/585331|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=Wilmington Morning Star|date=July 11, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khuen have appeared in research under several different English spellings including Khuen, Kuan, Kuanhua, Kween, Khween, and Khouen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Language==
The Khuen speak a language also called Khuen, which is a [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic language]].&lt;ref name="Ethnologue report for Laos"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=LA Ethnologue report for Laos]&lt;/ref&gt; The Khmuic languages are Austro-Asiatic.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue report for Laos"/&gt; There is some debate as to whether the Khmuic languages are of the Mon-Khmer branch, but the majority opinion is that they are not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Geographic Distribution==
*Population in Laos:  8000 in [[Luang Namtha Province]]&lt;ref name="Ethnologue report for Laos"/&gt;
*Population in China:  1500, centered on [[Jinghong]] in Southern China{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
*Population in United States:  Unknown

==Customs==
As a fellow member of the larger Khmuic ethnic group, many aspects of Khuen culture are similar to the [[Khmu people|Khmu]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Family names are usually the names of sacred animals or plants. It is taboo for a Khuen person to touch the animal or plant that bears his or her family name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Religion==
In addition to [[Theravada Buddhism]], they also worship a hierarchy of demons and ghosts.  Ancestor worship is also practiced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

'''Khwarshi''' (also spelled ''Xvarshi, Khvarshi'') is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] spoken in the [[Tsumadinsky District|Tsumadinsky-]], [[Kizilyurtovsky District|Kizilyurtovsky-]] and [[Khasavyurtovsky District|Khasavyurtovsky districts]] of [[Dagestan]] by the [[Khwarshi people]]. The exact number of speakers is not known, but the linguist [[Zaira Khalilova]], who has carried out fieldwork in the period from 2005 to 2009, gives the figure 8,500.&lt;ref name="khalilova_3"&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources give much lower figures, such as [[Ethnologue]] with the figure 1,870&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=khv |title=Ethnologue entry for Khwarshi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latest [[Russian Census (2002)|population census of Russia]] with the figure 1,872.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-4.xls Всероссийская перепись населения 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609203844/http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-4.xls |date=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The low figures are because many Khwarshi have registered themselves as being [[Avar language|Avar]] speakers,&lt;ref name="khalilova_3" /&gt; which is also considered their [[literary language]].

There are six [[dialect]]s of the Khwarshi language based on their geographical distribution. The dialects are: [[Upper Inkhokwari Khwarshi|Upper-]] and [[Lower Inkhokwari Khwarshi]], [[Kwantlada Khwarshi]], [[Santlada Khwarshi]], [[Khwayni Khwarshi]] and [[Khwarshi Proper]], originating in their respective villages in the [[Tsumadinsky District|Tsumadinsky district]]. Due to [[emigration]], see the [[Khwarshi people]] and their history, [[Kwantlada Khwarshi]]-, [[Upper Inkhokwari Khwarshi|Upper-]] and [[Lower Inkhokwari Khwarshi]]-speaking communities also exist in [[Oktyabrskoe]], [[Santlada Khwarshi]]-speaking communities exist in [[Pervomayskoe]] and [[Khwarshi Proper]]-speaking communities exist in [[Mutsalaul]].

== Phonology ==
The [[phoneme|phoneme inventory]] of Khwarshi is large, with about 87 distinct [[phoneme]]s. Notable phonological processes include [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[vowel harmony]], and [[nasalization]] occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 25-30&lt;/ref&gt; The [[syllable|syllabic]] structure of Khwarshi is also quite simple, with (C)V(C) being the most common structure, of which V(C) is only permitted word-initially.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
Khwarshi has a total number of 21 [[vowel]] [[phoneme]]s, including [[vowel length]] and [[nasal vowel|nasalization]].&lt;ref name="khalilova_14"&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

All the vowels above also have a long counterpart, which are always in stressed syllables. All vowels can occur in closed syllables (i.e. (C)VC), and all except {{IPA|/ɨ/}} occur in open syllables (i.e. (C)V). {{IPA|/ɨ/}} does not occur in the [[Khwarshi Proper]] and [[Inkhokwari dialect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

*All the nasal vowels above except /ĩ/ have a long counterpart.
*Note also, that there is no nasalized version of /ɨ/.
*The [[Khwarshi Proper]] dialect does not have nasalized vowels and replaces these with their non-nasalized counterparts.

=== Consonants ===
Khwarshi has 66 [[consonant]]s:&lt;ref name="khalilova_14" /&gt;

It is not clear whether {{IPA|/tʷ/}} is present in Khwarshi or not, as [[Zaira Khalilova]] does not include it in her chart of consonants, but nevertheless provides a minimal pair indicating there is a distinction between {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/tʷ/}}: {{IPA|/eta/}} ''"touch"'' and {{IPA|/etʷa/}} ''"fly"''.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is shown in parentheses in the chart above.

All the consonants can be found in native [[vocabulary]], but some of them are however more rare than others, and some are mostly found in [[loanword]]s, such as {{IPA|/ʕ/}} which almost only occur in loanwords of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin. Another example is {{IPA|/x/}}, found only in loanwords of [[Avar language|Avar]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonant and all the [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] consonants are not found in [[Khwarshi Proper]], but can be found in all the other dialects. Consider for instance the [[Khwarshi Proper]] word {{IPA|/χililːu/}} ''"drunk"'', which in the other dialects is {{IPA|/χˤilʲilʲːu/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 16, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gemination ====
[[Gemination]] is quite a common [[phonology|phonological process]] in Khwarshi, caused by [[grammar|grammatical processes]]. Gemination only occurs intervocally and not all consonants geminate. Which consonants that geminate is different according to which processes they are a part of, and it depends on the dialect as well.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a list of some of the processes causing gemination:

* When [[suffix]]ing the [[past participle]]-ending {{IPA|/-u/}} to a [[verb|verbal stem]] ending in a consonant, the final consonant is geminated, e.g. {{IPA|/lat͡sʼ-a/}} ''"to eat"'' &gt; {{IPA|/lat͡sʼ-ːu/}} ''"eaten"''.
* When [[suffix]]ing the [[present tense]]-ending, which generally is {{IPA|/-ʃe/}}, the final consonant is geminated, e.g. {{IPA|/lat͡sʼ-a/}} ''"to eat"'' &gt; {{IPA|/lat͡s-ːe/}} ''"eat''-&lt;span title="Present tense"&gt;{{smallcaps|pres}}&lt;/span&gt;". Notice that [[ejective consonant|ejectivization]] is lost with the present tense-ending, while it is kept with the past participle-ending.
* When [[suffix]]ing the [[verbal noun]]-ending {{IPA|/-nu/}} to a [[verb|verbal stem]], the verbal noun-ending is geminated - not the final consonant, e.g. {{IPA|/tʼa-ja/}} ''"to drop"'' &gt; {{IPA|/tʼa-nːu/}} ''"something which has been dropped"''.
* When [[infix]]ing the potential marker {{IPA|/-l-/}} to a [[verb|verbal stem]], the potential marker is geminated, e.g. {{IPA|/tʼa-ja/}} ''"to drop"'' &gt; {{IPA|/tʼa-lː-a/}} ''"to potentially drop"''.
* When [[stress (linguistics)|emphasis]] is needed, the consonants of some words may be geminated, e.g. {{IPA|/ʕezeʕan/}} ''"much"'' &gt; {{IPA|/ʕezːeʕan/}} ''"much indeed"''. It is highly idiomatic though, and does not apply to all words.

In [[loanword]]s, geminated consonants are normally non-geminated, when adopted into the Khwarshi language. For example, the [[Avar language|Avar]] word {{IPA|/kːʼara/}} ''"mosquito"'' is found as {{IPA|/kʼara/}} in Khwarshi. The same goes for words of [[Tindi language|Tindi]] origin such as {{IPA|/kːʼanu/}} ''"small"'', which is found as {{IPA|/kʼanu/}} in Khwarshi. Another interesting aspect of loanwords of Tindi origin in the Khwarshi language is that the consonants are [[ejective consonant|ejectivized]] when they enter the Khwarshi language, e.g. [[Tindi language|Tindi]] {{IPA|/t͡sːikʷːa/}} ''"small intestine"'' &gt; Khwarshi {{IPA|/t͡sʼikʷʼa/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
Khwarshi [[noun]]s inflect for [[grammatical case|case]], of which there are 51, and [[grammatical number|number]], singular or plural, and belong to one of five [[grammatical gender|genders]], or rather [[noun class]]es. That a noun belongs to a specific class cannot be seen on the noun itself, but only through [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]].

==== Noun classes ====
There are five noun classes in the singular, but only a distinction between ''human'' and ''non-human'' in the plural, the ''male human'' and ''female human'' having merged into ''human'', and the remaining classes into ''non-human''.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun classes are visible through agreement in [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[postposition]]s and [[demonstrative|demonstrative pronouns]], and also [[verb]]s if the verb begins with a [[vowel]]. There are, however, some exceptions, like with [[irregular verb]]s in other languages. Below are some examples of such agreement in postpositions, demonstrative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, respectively. Notice however, that a verb is present in all of the examples but the first, while the third example has a special focus on verbs.

As the noun class of a noun cannot be seen on the noun itself, it should not be represented in a [[literal translation]]. In the examples above, however, the noun class of certain nouns is shown, albeit in [[superscript]] to indicate that it is not represented in the original Khwarshi sentence. The only nouns that have their noun classes indicated here are those with which the other words agree with.

==== Cases ====
There are 8 grammatical cases in Khwarshi, and 43 locative cases. The grammatical cases are: [[absolutive case|absolutive]], [[ergative case|ergative]], two [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[durative case|durative]], [[vocative case|vocative]] and [[causal case|causal]]. The remaining cases, the locative cases, are a bit more complex, as they each consist of both a part that has something to do with orientation and a part that has something to do with direction. So while the [[ergative case]] has a single [[suffix]] /-(j)i/, the [[superversative case]] consists of two suffixes, the [[superessive case|superessive]] /-t͡ɬʼo/ plus the [[versative case|versative]] /-ʁul/, becoming /-t͡ɬʼoʁul/.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 66-67, 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are the case endings of the grammatical cases.

=== Verbs ===
Khwarshi [[verb]]s normally consist of a stem, an [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] [[prefix]] indicating [[noun class]] and number of the relevant nouns, and a [[suffix]] showing [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], or the like. Only about one fourth of the Khwarshi verbs show agreement, all of them beginning with a [[vowel]]. There is a small number of verbs beginning with a vowel that do not show agreement. Verbs beginning with a [[consonant]] do not show agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt;

The verbs are very regular in Khwarshi, the only [[irregular verb]] being the [[auxiliary verb]] /goli/ ''"to be"'', which takes neither a prefix nor a suffix and has only several [[non-finite verb|non-finite forms]]. In the [[past tense|past-]] and [[future tense]], however, the verb /-et͡ʃ-/ ''"to be situated"'' is used instead of /goli/, which may take both a prefix and a suffix.&lt;ref&gt;Khalilova (2009), pp. 182-183&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luxembourgers''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|s|əm|b|ɜːr|ɡ|ər|z}} {{respell|LUK|səm|bur|gərz}}) are a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Luxembourg]] who share the [[culture of Luxembourg]], speak [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] and are of [[Luxembourg]]ish descent. 

Luxembourgers were, much like [[Austrians]], historically considered to be a regional subgroup of [[ethnic Germans]] and viewed themselves as such until the collapse of the [[German Confederation]]. Luxembourg became independent, while remaining in personal union with the [[Netherlands]], after the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] in 1839. The personal union proved short-lived as it was bilaterally and amicably dissolved in 1890.&lt;ref name="Cole 2011, p. 246"&gt;Cole (2011), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minahan|2000|p=769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minahan|2000|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole 2011, p. 246"&gt;Cole (2011), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Legally, all citizens of the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] are considered to be ''Luxembourgers'' per Luxembourgish law, although a distinct Germanic [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] identification is vocally espoused and promoted. The corresponding adjective is "'''Luxembourgish'''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/111499 Luxemburgisch, Luxembourgish]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=ProKro |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''; [https://archive.is/20150404124346/http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/111497 Luxembourgeois] at ''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000500.htm | publisher= Publications Office of the [[European Union]]| work= Interinstitutional Style Guide| title=List of countries, territories and currencies| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120205104436/http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000500.htm |archivedate= 2012-02-05 | date= 2012-01-24| access-date= October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Most ethnic Luxembourgers live in the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], a small country in Europe between [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Belgium]], and are of [[Celts|Celtic]]/[[Gallo-Roman]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ([[Franks|Frankish]]) origin.  Most speak [[Luxembourgish]], as their native language, in addition to [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. Despite the rather small number of Luxembourgers, there is a relatively large [[diaspora]], in [[Europe]] and elsewhere. Particularly, there are populations in the surrounding countries of [[Belgium]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]. For the most part, this is due to historic reasons, especially the three [[Partitions of Luxembourg]], which led to former territories of Luxembourg being incorporated into each of the three surrounding countries.

There are also significant populations in the [[Americas]], with the largest contingent being in the [[United States]].  However, many people of Luxembourgish descent live in [[Canada]] and [[Brazil]], to which large waves of Luxembourgers emigrated in the nineteenth century, as did [[Germans]] at the same time.&lt;ref name="L’émigration luxembourgeoise vers l’Argentine" /&gt;  Others migrated to [[Hungary]] along with Germans during the first phase of [[Ostsiedlung|German eastward settlement]] in the 12th century. [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and [[Banat Swabians]] are the descendants of these settlers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2199">[[File:Royal Mantle of João VI.jpg|thumb|right|The Mantle of João VI.]]
The '''Mantle of João VI''', also known as the '''Mantle of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Manto de João VI; Manto do Reino Unido de Portugal, do Brasil, e dos Algarves), is the royal robe, a part of the [[Portuguese Crown Jewels]], that was fashioned for the acclamation of King [[João VI]], alongside the [[Crown of João VI]] and the [[Sceptre of the Armillary]].

== History ==
The Mantle of João VI was created for the acclamation of João VI as King. It was fashioned in Portugal, even though João VI [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|was in Brazil]], for Portugal was encaged in the [[Peninsular War]]. The robe was only used only by João VI.

== Details ==
The mantle was made in Portugal for João VI's acclamation.  It is fashioned out of velvet, silk, ermine, wire rod, sequins, and various precious jewels. The design of the robe bears several symbols of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], for which João VI was monarch of during João VI's [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|stay in Brazil]].
*[[Armillary Sphere]] - Originally a symbol of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], it also became a symbol of [[Colonial Brazil]]. After the creation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], it became the [[pluricontinental]] symbol of Portugal and Brazil and appeared on [[Flag of Portugal#1667–1830|its flag]].
*Castle - Said to symbolize the castles of the seven Moorish Kings that [[Afonso I of Portugal]] conquered, the castles are found on the [[Coat of arms of Portugal]].
*Shield with Five Escutcheons - Originally symbolizing Portugal's right to issue currency as an independent nation, the symbol was commonly used as a simplified version of the Portuguese coat of arms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Mecklenburgisch''' (''Mecklenborgsch'' or ''Mäkelborgsch'') is a [[Low German]] ([[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]]) dialect group used predominantly in the [[Mecklenburg]] area of today’s North German state of [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]].

There is no sharp dividing line between its western dialects and adjacent [[Northern Low Saxon]] dialects on the one hand and between its eastern dialects and dialects of [[Western Pomerania]] on the other hand. Thus, although the [[Mecklenburg]] group is traditionally considered an [[East Low German]] group, it is in fact a link between eastern and western dialects. Its [[West Slavic languages|Western Slavic]] [[substratum|substrata]] do not seem to be as strong as those of dialects spoken farther east. A striking eastern characteristic is the use of the [[diminutive]] suffix ''-ing'' (e.g. ''Poot'' ‘paw’ &gt; ''Pöting'' ‘little paw’, ''Änning'' ‘Annie’, ''lies’'' ‘quietly’, ‘softly’, ‘slowly’ &gt; ''liesing'' ‘very quietly’, ‘very softly’, ‘very carefully’, ‘nice and easy’). This suffix is most likely derived from [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] varieties once spoken in the area (cf. diminutive ''-inka'' in other Slavic languages).

'''The nature–culture divide''' refers to a theoretical foundation of contemporary [[anthropology]]. Early{{clarify|date=March 2015}} anthropologists sought theoretical insight from the perceived tensions between [[nature]] and [[culture]]. Later, the argument became framed by the question of whether the two entities function separately from one another, or if they were in a continuous [[wikt:biotic|biotic]] relationship with each other.

In eastern society nature and culture are conceptualized as [[dichotomous]] (separate and distinct domains of reference). Some consider culture to be "man's secret adaptive weapon"&lt;ref name=GS&gt;Greenwood, David J and William A. Stini (1977) ''Nature, Culture, and Human History'', New York: Harper and Row, 393–408&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|393}} in the sense that it is the core means of survival. 
It has been observed that the terms "nature" and "culture" that can not necessarily be translated into non-western languages,&lt;ref&gt;Strathern 1980&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Native American [[John Mohawk]]{{year needed|date=March 2015}} describing "nature"{{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--the Latin word? so he was trying to define the western term?--&gt; as "anything that supports life".&lt;ref name=MKN&gt;Nelson, Melissa K., 2008, ''Original Instructions: Indigenous Teachings for a Sustainable Future'', Rochester: [[Collective Heritage Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that small scale-societies can have a more symbiotic relationship with nature{{by whom|date=November 2015}}. But less symbiotic relations with nature are limiting small-scale communities' access to water and food resources.&lt;ref name=MKN/&gt; It was also argued that the contemporary Man-Nature divide manifests itself in different aspects of alienation and conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel (2014). "Sustainability and Contemporary Man-Nature Divide: Aspects of Conflict, Alienation, and Beyond", [[Consilience: The Journal of Sustainable Development]] 13(1), 125-146.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Greenwood and Stini argue that agriculture is only monetarily cost-efficient because it takes much more to produce than one can get out of eating their own crops,&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;{{rp|397}} e.g. "high culture cannot come at low energy costs".&lt;ref&gt;Braun and Castree 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s [[Sherry Ortner]] showed the parallel between the divide and [[gender role]]s with women as nature and men as culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherry Ortner]] (1972) [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3177638?sid=21105641078311&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2 Is Female to Male as Nature is to Culture?], [[Feminist Studies]] 1(2): 5-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[nature]]-[[culture]] divide is deeply intertwined with the social versus biological debate, since it both are implications of each other. As viewed in earlier forms of [[Anthropology]], it is believed that [[genetic determinism]] de-emphasizes the importance of culture, making it obsolete. However, more modern views show that culture is valued more than nature because everyday aspects of culture have a wider impact on how the humans see the world, rather than just our genetic makeup. Older anthropological theories have separated the two, such as [[Franz Boas]], who claimed that social organization and behavior is purely the transmission of social norms and not necessarily the passing of hereditable traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Tony|date=2015-01-26|title=Cultural Studies and the Culture Concept|journal=Cultural Studies|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=546–568|doi=10.1080/09502386.2014.1000605|issn=0950-2386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using such a contrasting approach, more modern anthropologists see [[Neo-Darwinism]] as an outline for culture, therefore nature is essentially guiding how culture develops. When looking at adaptations. anthropologists such as Daniel Nettle believe that behavior associated with cultural groups is a development of genetic difference between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nettle|first=Daniel|date=2009|title=Beyond nature versus culture: cultural variation as an evolved characteristic|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/curl.pdf|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=15|pages=223–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, he states that animals choose their mates based on their environment, which is shaped by directly by culture. More importantly, the adaptations seen in nature are a result of evoked nature, which is defined as cultural characteristics which shape the environment and that then queue changes in phenotypes for future generations. To put simply, cultures that promote more effective resource allocation and chance for survival are more likely to be successful and produce more developed societies and cultures that feed off of each other.

On the other hand, transmitted culture can be used to bridge the gap between the two even more, for it uses a trial and error based approach that shows how humans are constantly learning, and that they use [[Social learning theory|social learning]] to influence individual choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mortenson|first=Erik|date=2011|title=Bridging the Nature/Culture Divide|url=https://topia.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/topia/article/download/40278/36426|journal=Topia|volume=33|pages=254–257|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen best about how the more superficial aspects of culture still are intertwined with nature and generic variation. For example, there are [[beauty standards]] intertwined into culture because they are associated with better [[survival rate]]s, yet they also serve personal interests which allows for individual breeding pairs to understand how they fit into society. Additionally, cultural lags dissolve because it is not sustainable for reproduction, and cultural norms that benefit biology continue to persevere. By learning from each other, nature becomes more intertwined with culture since they reinforce each other.

Since nature and culture are now viewed as more intertwined than ever before, which makes the divide between the two seems obsolete. Similarly, the social scientists have been reluctant to use biological explanations as explantations for cultural divisions because it is difficult to construct what what ‘biological’ explanations entail. According to social scientists like [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], anthropologists and especially sociologists have tended to characterize biological explanations in only a physiological and cognitive sense within individuals, not in a group setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowring|first=Finn|date=2015-05-07|title=The individual and society in Durkheim|journal=European Journal of Social Theory|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=21–38|doi=10.1177/1368431015585042|issn=1368-4310|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/72258/1/Bowring_Durkheim%20paper_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is a heavier focus on the social determinism as seen in human behavior instead. Furthermore, even as divide between nature and culture has been narrowed there is a reluctance to define biological determinism on a large scale.

'''Nevado de Acay''' is a {{convert|5950|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain in [[Argentina]]. It is a [[Intrusive rock|volcanic intrusion]] that formed during the [[Miocene]] and was later exposed. The intrusion is formed by [[monzonite]] and is associated with a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] system that also connects to neighbouring volcanoes.

While not presently [[Glacier|glaciated]], it contains a seasonal [[snowpack]] and is the source of several streams and rivers, including the [[Salado River (Argentina)|Rio Salado]]. A number of archeological sites have been found on Nevado de Acay and mining activity occurred there until recent times.

Nevado de Acay is {{convert|5716|m}},&lt;ref name="MartiniStrelin2013" /&gt; {{convert|5886|m}}{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1129}} or {{convert|5950|m}} high.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=17}}{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1129}} It lies in the [[La Poma Department]] of [[Argentina]]'s [[Salta Province]]. It is part of the Cuesta del Acay mountains and their highest summit.{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=8}} The Calchaqui valley extends south from Nevado de Acay.{{sfn|Paoli|2003|p=10}}

It is formed by [[monzonite]] that was generated 12.6 ± 0.3 million years ago,&lt;ref name="InselGrove2012" /&gt; along the Calchaqui fault.{{sfn|del Papa|Petrinovic|2017|p=197}} It originally formed as an [[intrusion]] that was exposed about 12.61 ± 0.25 million years ago.{{sfn|del Papa|Petrinovic|2017|p=199}} Another date is 26 million years ago,{{sfn|Coira|Kay|Viramonte|1993|p=686}} which would make it contemporaneous with the disintegration of the [[Farallon Plate]] and the following increase in [[subduction]] and volcanic activity.{{sfn|Coira|Kay|Viramonte|1993|p=710}} Yet another older date is 18.9 million years ago.&lt;ref name="PetrinovicRiller2005" /&gt;

Emplaced within the [[Precambrian]]-[[Cambrian]] Puncoviscana [[formation (geology)|formation]], the Nevado de Acay monzonite contains [[biotite]], [[diorite]], [[hornblende]], [[magnetite]], [[monzodiorite]], [[pyroxene]], [[titanite]] and [[tonalite]]. [[Skarn]] and mineral deposits formed within the monzonite as well.{{sfn|Coira|Kay|Viramonte|1993|p=686}}

Located close to the [[Negra Muerta volcanic complex]], it is a volcanic system associated with the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro [[fault (geology)|fault]] system.

[[Cirque]]s indicate the presence of former glaciers.&lt;ref name="Martonne1934" /&gt; The present-day [[snowline]] lies at an altitude of {{convert|5800|m}};{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1128}} [[rock glacier]]s fed by avalanches exist on Nevado de Acay in [[Pleistocene]] glacier valleys.{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1139}} Nevado de Acay is covered in snow only during the winter months, although summer storms can also deposit snow on it; during the dry season the mountain is bare.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=17}}

Nevado de Acay is the site of an [[Inca civilization|Inka]] mountain sanctuary.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=19}} A summit sanctuary was discovered in 2000; later two additional sites were discovered on the subsidiary summits Blanca and Navaja.{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=377}} Some historical references to the mountain indicate that it was the connection between the Inka province Chicoana and the [[Altiplano|Puna]], although the [[Abra del Acay]] is not the only place to which these historical records may refer. The present day [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|National Route 40]] passes close to the mountain.&lt;ref name="Mignone2014" /&gt;

The mountaintop was not the sole site of human activity at Nevado de Acay; traces of mining and pastoral activity among others has been found lower on its slopes as well. At least 53 structures have been identified at elevations between {{convert|4500|-|5000|m}}.&lt;ref name="Mignone2014" /&gt; Historical records exist of a site named "San Bernardo de Acay" south of Nevado de Acay.{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=376}} The archeological structures of Nevado de Acay are still only incompletely understood.{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=385}}

Some of these mines reported in 1907 are known as "Flor de Desierto", "Protectora", "Resurreccion" and "Saturno" - the last owner of these mines obtained them in 1924. Mining activity including [[gold]] and [[silver]] is reported to have occurred in the area during the time of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] rule and ended only during the 1656 rebellion of [[Pedro Bohórquez]]; the Spanish efforts on these mines may have been the reason why the rebellion occurred in the region. Later an [[iron]] mine was active on the northern slope but it is now abandoned.&lt;ref name="Mignone2014" /&gt; [[Obsidian]] outcrops have been observed in the area.&lt;ref name="YacobaccioEscola2004" /&gt;

'''Ogun Festival''' is an annual festival observed by the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Ondo State]], [[Nigeria]] in honour of [[Ogun]], a warrior and powerful spirit of metal work believed by the Yoruba to be the first god to arrive on earth.

==History==

According to [[History of the Yoruba people|Yoruba mythology]], Ogun was a King and the father of [[Oranyan|Oranmiyan]], and the first person to arrive on earth; he used a cutlass and a dog to clear the road for the arrival of other deities. He is also said to have given the finishing touches to the first set of humans created by [[Obatala]], the Yoruba god of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adeoye | first = C.

His festival is usually held around August or September in Ondo State and parts of Ekiti state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ogun Festival » Facts.ng|url=https://www.facts.ng/culture/festivals/the-ogun-festival/|website=Facts.ng|accessdate=12 January 2018|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web|title=Ogun Festival|url=https://zodml.org/discover-nigeria/heritage-and-culture/ogun-festival#.Wlig8KinHIV|website=ZODML|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HERITAGE: At Ogunnire Festival, Ire-Ekiti Remembers Ogun, God of Iron|url=http://westernpostnigeria.com/heritage-at-ogunnire-festival-ire-ekiti-remembers-ogun-god-of-iron/|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Western Post News|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[General] - IRE-EKITI: Town where Ogun, Yoruba god of iron, 'disappeared'|url=http://www.villagesquare.ng/xenforo/index.php?threads/ire-ekiti-town-where-ogun-yoruba-god-of-iron-disappeared.85260/|website=NVS XenForo|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==

Preparation for the festival begin seventeen days in advance. The chief priest announces the sighting of the new moon (which must be sighted before beginning the festival) by blowing the ''upe'' (local trumpet) for seven days. Nine days after the sighting of the new moon, the  king sends an emissary to officially announce the ceremony. Preparations for the festival include the repairing of bridges and clearing of footpaths. The festival continues with a vigil called Ilagun, Asoro or aisun ogun which takes place three days before the Ogun day. The blacksmiths of the [[Ife|city of Ife]] donate new cutlasses, hoes and bell gongs, and the shrine is beautified with palm fronds, cowries and other items. Libation is then poured, a ritual dance is conducted around the shrine, and prayers are offered. Dogs are prepared for sacrifice.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Origin Of Ogun – God Of Iron - Ekimogun Descendant United Kingdom &amp; Northern Ireland|url=http://www.ekimogundescendant.org/origin-of-ogun-god-of-iron/|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Ekimogun Descendant United Kingdom &amp; Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fieldhouse | first = Paul | title = Food, feasts, and faith : an encyclopedia of food culture in world religions | publisher = ABC-CLIO, an Imprint of ABC-CLIO, LLC | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2017 | isbn = 9781610694124 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ogun Festival|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ogun+Festival|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivity==
The festival reaches a frenzy during the last three days. The dog which is the main centre of the festival is slaughtered on the first of these days. Two people moving in opposite directions pull the dog towards themselves hence forcing it to a slow and painful death. Sometimes the High priest kills the dog by striking it with a machete before it actually dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brutal Dog Sacrifices Occur At Nigeria's Ogun Festival|url=http://www.bodahub.com/dogs-slaughter-ogun-festival/|website=Bodahub|accessdate=12 January 2018|date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blood of the dog is then mixed with salt, kolanuts, palm wine and palm oil, and poured over the working tools of the worshipers which are gathered in a bowl; this is believed to protect them from trouble and bring about abundant profits. Ogun is the patron of those who make use of metals in their everyday work, such as blacksmith, drivers, mechanics and surgeons. The festival can also be held anywhere as the high priest sometimes celebrates the festival at [[Abuja]] without not following the usual seventeen-day order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Michael|title=Nigeria: Live Dog Sacrifices To Ogun, The God Of Iron - Fight Dog Meat|url=https://fightdogmeat.com/2016/06/05/nigeria-live-dog-sacrifices-to-ogun-the-god-of-iron/|website=fightdogmeat.com|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sotunde|first1=Afolabi|title=Ogun: Sacrifice to the iron god|url=https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/ogun-sacrifice-to-the-iron-god|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=The Wider Image|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11837">'''Prostitution in Uruguay''' was legislated in 2002 through the sex work law (17.515).&lt;ref name=law-17515 /&gt; Before that, prostitution was unlegislated but it was not illegal, since the constitution allows any activity that is not forbidden by law.&lt;ref name=constitutionart10 /&gt; Prostitution is currently not a subject of debate.

[[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 8,195 prostitutes in [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Uruguay's Law no. 17.515 of 2002 - ''Trabajo Sexual Se Dictan Norma'' (Sexual Work Standards Are Dictated) - explicitly states sex work is legal and provides regulations that must be adhered to. It also obliges the government to advise sex workers of their rights and duties, support them against exploitation and provide sexual health information.&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work Law - Countries {{!}} Sexuality, Poverty and Law|url=http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries|website=spl.ids.ac.uk|accessdate=26 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law set up a confidential National Registry of Sex Workers. Sex works must enrol on the National Registry, this demands an initial and periodical health checks focus in the prevention, detection and treatments of [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. The register gives the worker a license which is necessary to work in brothels. Article 31 of the law provides penalties for selling sex without a health card, and their names are placed on the register.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Local authorities may, in consultation with sex workers, set up local sex work areas. These must not be near educational establishments and be sensitive to local opinions. The local authority may also set working hours and dictate dress code and behaviour.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Brothels and commercial sex bars are permitted provided they have the agreement of local police and are licensed. Sex may not be sold in massage establishments.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

The law established a "National Honorary Commission for the Protection of Sex Work", and two sex workers sit on the commission.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

In 1995, the [[Banco de Previsión Social]] (state-owned Uruguayan social security institute) recognised sex work by women.&lt;ref name=presidencenews /&gt;&lt;ref name=LR21 /&gt; In 2009 a law was passed that recognised men and transwomen in sex work.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

The prostitution of a minor (person under the legal age of consent) is prohibited and the authorities have the obligation of protect them from sexual exploitation and prostitution.&lt;ref name=OPCRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNA15 /&gt; 

Despite this, many [[Street prostitution|sex workers work on the streets]] or independently and not always have health checks.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Practicing ==
Prostitution must be performed in [[brothel]]s (in Uruguay they have many euphemistic names like “whiskerias” or “casas de masajes”).&lt;ref name=law-17515 /&gt; Usually brothels use a red light as distinctive, or have discrete announcements with the name of the establishment and a suggestive phrase to attract clients.

In order to open, a brothel must have the authorization of the municipal government and the state police and follow certain rules dictated by the Ministry of Public Health. Police and municipal government are in charge of determining in which areas brothels may exist considering the characteristics of the place. However brothels may not function near schools or high schools.&lt;ref name=law-17515 /&gt;

Minors are not allowed to enter brothels, in addition to performing any kind of activity inside.&lt;ref name=law-17515 /&gt;

As any commercial establishment brothels pay taxes and have social security obligations.

== Organizations ==
The aforementioned sex labour law created the ''Comisión Nacional Honoraria de Protección al Trabajo Sexual'' (National Honorary Commission for Protection of Sexual Work) within the Ministry of Public Health, whose aim is to advise Executive Branch on this matter, watch over the fulfillment of the law, provide counseling to sex workers and promote [[sexual education]] courses and campaigns on the matter.&lt;ref name=law-17515 /&gt;

There was a [[trade union]] named ''Asociación de Meretrices Profesionales del Uruguay'', created in 1986, which comprised about 1200 women sex workers affiliates and whose purpose was the cooperation between sex workers, the defense of their rights, carrying out workshops and promote the prevention of STDs and [[HIV]]. Even received support from the [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref name=unfpa /&gt; However it was dissolved in early 2015 under accusations of corruption of its president and vicepresident, including misappropriation of donated lands intended for HIV-infected women and donated goods for beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=subrayado /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Uruguay}}
Uruguay is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Uruguayan women and girls—and to a more limited extent transgender adults and male adolescents—are subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Uruguayan women and LGBTI individuals are forced into prostitution in [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]]; however, the number of identified Uruguayan victims exploited abroad has decreased in recent years. Women from the Dominican Republic, and to a lesser extent from South American countries, are subjected to sex trafficking in Uruguay. Uruguayan officials have identified citizens of other countries, including [[China]] and the Dominican Republic, transiting Uruguay en route to other destinations, particularly Argentina, as potential victims of sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uruguay 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271310.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=26 April 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Uruguay as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Pökoot''' (also known as ''Pokot'', ''Päkot'', ''Pökot'', and in older literature as ''Suk'') is a language spoken in western [[Kenya]] and eastern [[Uganda]] by the [[Pokot people]]. Pökoot is classified to the northern branch of the [[Kalenjin languages]] found in Kenya, Uganda, and [[Tanzania]]. The Pökoot are usually called "Kimukon" by the other Kalenjin peoples. A 1994 figure of SIL puts the total number of speakers at 264,000, while the only little more recent Schladt (1997:40) gives the more conservative estimate of 150,000 people, presumably based on the figures found in Rottland (1982:26) who puts the number at slightly more than 115,000.

The Pökoot area is bordered to the north by the [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] language [[Karimojong language|Karimojong]]. [[Turkana language|Turkana]], another Eastern Nilotic language, is found to the northeast. To the east, the [[Maa languages]] [[Samburu language|Samburu]] and [[Camus language|Camus]] (on [[Lake Baringo]]) are spoken, and to the south, the other Kalenjin languages [[Tugen language|Tugen]] and [[Markweta language|Markweta]] are found, which show considerable influence from Pökoot.&lt;ref&gt;Rottland, Franz (1982) ''Die Südnilotischen Sprachen: Beschreibung, Vergleichung und Rekonstruktion'' (Kölner Beiträge zur Afrikanistik vol. 7).

'''''Race Against the Machine''''' is a non-fiction book from 2011 by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Andrew McAfee]] about the interaction of digital technology, employment and organization.   The full title of the book is: ''Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy''.

==Contents==
The main thesis of this book is that we are in the midst of a technological revolution that is radically redefining what work is, how value is created, and how the economy distributes that value. The authors stumbled upon these ideas after analyzing the unique economic recovery that followed the Great Recession of 2008. When the recession ended, many measures of economic health (such as GDP, corporate profits, and investment in equipment and software) rebounded quickly; however, one measure, unemployment, lagged behind. This observation led the authors to conclude that a drastic shift in the means of production was taking place. The authors believe that technology is causing this shift, simultaneously boosting the productivity of firms while also eliminating the need for many forms of human labor. As the authors came to this conclusion, they looked around to see if anyone else had begun to analyze this trend. When they found that technology was largely being left out of the mainstream discussion of unemployment, they decided that they would write this book to help get the ball rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Against The Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy|last=Brynjolfsson|first=Erik|last2=McAfee|first2=Andrew|publisher=Digital Frontier Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Lexington, Massachusetts|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One supporting point in the book is that the pace of automation has picked up in recent years due to a combination of increasingly clever technologies such as [[robotics]], [[numerically controlled]] machines, computerized [[inventory management software]], [[speech recognition]], speaker recognition, language translation, [[self-driving vehicles]], [[pattern recognition]] and online commerce. The authors write that businesses are increasingly substituting machines for people, and that rate at which digital technologies are advancing is exponentially higher than that of the organizations, institutions, and individuals within our economy. Additionally, the corporate use of equipment and software is increasing faster than the rate than employment.&lt;ref name=NYTimesReview&gt;Steve Lohr, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/technology/economists-see-more-jobs-for-machines-not-people.html More Jobs Predicted for Machines, Not People],'' book review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2011.10.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechCrunch&gt;[[Andrew Keen]], ''[https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/keen-on-how-the-internet-is-making-us-both-richer-and-more-unequal-tctv/  Keen On How The Internet Is Making Us Both Richer and More Unequal (TCTV)],'' interview with [[Andrew McAfee]] and [[Erik Brynjolfsson]], [[TechCrunch]], 2011.11.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider&gt;JILL KRASNY, ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-professors-the-99-should-shake-their-fists-at-the-tech-boom-2011-11  MIT Professors: The 99% Should Shake Their Fists At The Tech Boom]'', [[Business Insider]], 2011.11.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheMarker&gt;Ascher Schechter, ''[http://www.themarker.com/markerweek/1.2154726  After the Working Class, Technology is Eliminating the Middle Class]'', [[TheMarker]], 2013.01.11.

Brynjolfsson and McAfee write that advanced digital technologies are making people more innovative, productive and richer, both in the short- and long-term, but potentially at the cost of increasing wealth inequality in society. In the authors' view, one of the main [[Egalitarianism|in-egalitarian]] consequences of digital technological developments is its potentially negative impact on some types of employment, such as routine information processing work. The authors appear to advocate for a collaborative partnership between computers and humans as the road to future job creation. "In medicine, law, finance, retailing, manufacturing and even scientific discovery," they write, "the key to winning the race is not to compete ''against'' machines but to compete ''with'' machines."&lt;ref name=NYTimesReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=TechCrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheMarker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;

==Recommendations==
Given the advancement of technology, the authors have several recommendations for policymakers in the United States to increase economic prosperity, including:&lt;ref&gt;http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/ma2012_brynjolfsson_mcafee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investing more in education, starting with increasing teacher salaries
* More accountability for teachers on performance metrics, possibly including the elimination of tenure
* Focus education on useful outcomes and less on signaling prestige, time, or effort, by separating instruction from certification and testing
* More instructional hours per year for K-12 students
* Expand immigration of entrepreneurs and skilled workers, including both permanent residents and H1-B
* Teach entrepreneurship skills in higher education (outside of business schools)
* Speed the creation of startups with franchise opportunities, online guides, and clearinghouses
* Reduce regulatory barriers to new business creation
* Invest more in communication and transportation infrastructure improvements
* Invest more in government funding for basic research
* Maintain labor market fluidity and the ability to hire and fire
* Reduce payroll taxes (to make it more attractive to hire a person rather than a machine) and increase taxes on congestion and pollution
* De-couple health insurance from employment
* Keep crowdsourcing businesses like [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] lightly regulated to allow experimentation
* Eliminate tax breaks for home mortgages and reallocate the proceeds to education and research
* Reduce government subsidies for the financial services industry, to free talent for other industries
* Reform the patent system, and speed up patent adjudication
* Reduce the length of copyright terms and expand [[fair use]]

==Criticism==
Like [[Jeremy Rifkin]]'s book ''[[The End of Work]]'', ''The Race against the Machine'' has been criticized for lacking credible evidence in making predictions about future job loss.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2), 13-14]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggest the invention and distribution of computers during the 1990s increased employment, rather than decreased it.&lt;ref&gt;J Bessen, ‘How Computer Automation Affects Occupations: Technology, jobs, and skills’ (2016) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690435 Boston University, Law &amp; Economics WP No. 15-49]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Singoalla''''' is a 1949 Swedish-French film directed by [[Christian-Jaque]], starring [[Viveca Lindfors]] and [[Alf Kjellin]]. It is a visually stunning film with a haunting score, based on the romantic novel ''[[The Wind Is My Lover]]'' by [[Viktor Rydberg]]. The story is based on a medieval legend of the love between a gypsy and a nobleman. It was produced in three language versions: Swedish, French, and English. The Swedish and French versions were entitled '''''Singoalla'''''. The English version had three titles: '''''Gypsy Fury''''' (USA), '''''The Wind is My Lover''''' (UK), and '''''The Mask and the Sword''''' (UK). The Swedish and English versions starred Alf Kjellin as the nobleman, but the French version starred Michel Auclair. All three versions were edited separately – even scoring is slightly different. The Swedish and French run over 100 minutes, the English only 63 minutes.

'''Strip poker''' is a [[party game]] and a variation of the traditional [[poker]] where players remove clothing when they lose a round. Any form of poker can be adapted to a strip form; however, it is usually played with simple variants with few betting rounds, like [[five-card draw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://poker.about.com/od/strippoker/a/strippoker.htm About.com: How to Play Strip Poker] by Toby Bochan&lt;/ref&gt; Strip poker can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups in social situations and intended to generate an atmosphere of fun, and to lighten the social atmosphere by the removal of clothing. Sometimes the game is played to heighten the [[Foreplay|sexual atmosphere]], though the game itself is regarded as non-sexual. Like other adult or [[Adolescence|adolescent]] party games, activities besides removing clothing and playing cards might be involved. ("[[Truth or Dare?]]" type options are often included.) Strip poker has also been adapted for a person to play alone, either by use of video games or online; and several television shows have been based on the game.

==Strategy==
In some rule sets, players who fold before the flop are not required to remove clothing. As such, a player who is uncomfortable removing clothing (or, more commonly, a player who does not want to remove all their clothing first) can simply fold very often or every time before the flop, essentially playing a "tight" [[Texas hold 'em pre-flop basic strategy|pre-flop strategy]]. Using this strategy, a player could stay clothed for the entire game simply by folding their hands.

Strip poker requires a different overall strategy from poker played with betting chips since the maximum loss on a hand of strip poker is (typically) one item of clothing. In a betting environment, a player who stays in the pot with a weak hand is liable to lose many chips in a single hand. In strip poker, the risk of staying in a hand is significantly limited, so players can play hands with lower probabilities than they would in a [[cash game]]. For example, in a cash game, because it occurs only 8% of the time, an [[Draw (poker)#Inside straight draw|inside straight draw]] might be a poor hand to play, hence the saying "Never draw to an inside straight." In strip poker, when the potential loss is only one item of clothing whether you fold or call, an 8% chance to win the hand is better than the alternative.

==History==
While it has been suggested that strip poker originated in [[New Orleans]] in the United States around the same time as original poker in the 19th century, played in brothels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.777.com/articles/strip-poker-history-and-rules 777.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514110750/http://www.777.com/articles/strip-poker-history-and-rules |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vstrippoker.com/faq.html Strip Poker FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; the term is only attested since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=strip Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Strip poker most likely began as a prank among boys, and as late as the 1930s, the current mixed-gender version was called "mixed strip poker" in England to differentiate it from the all-male variety.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 1 of [[A Coffin for Dimitrios]] by [[Eric Ambler]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Film===
Strip poker games are presented in a number of films, including:
* ''Welcome to the Cabin''
* ''Kicking the Dog''
* ''[[American Pie 2]]''
* ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]''

''Strip Poker Invitational'' productions were filmed in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Both productions aired on [[Pay-Per-View]] in 2005.

Strip poker on [[music video]]:
* Music video of "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)#Music video|Poker Face]]" by [[Lady Gaga]] - 2009

===Computer games===
In 1982, an American computer game company, [[Artworx]], produced a ''Strip Poker'' game for the [[Apple II]] computer. It has been ported to many other computers since then, and is still available today. Many others followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/strip-poker-games MobyGames]&lt;/ref&gt; Strip poker is featured as an Easter Egg in the [[Windows 8]] card suite Card Hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/736160-card-hero/cheats Gamefaqs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strip variants of other games==
As with all forms of poker, strip poker also has variations. Recently, strip poker has been available online. One can visit one of these sites, choose a male or female opponent, and play strip poker. In this game strip poker online or a strip poker web cam game is conducted using virtual chips. The first player pays only for the time spent in the private poker room. Usually this game is played between two players, the girl from the site and the strip poker site visitor. Both players can communicate with each other through web cams. Game rules can be varied; usually the players discuss them before the game begins.

"Video Strip Games" is becoming a popular addition to online game websites with the introduction of higher speed internet connections.  This includes video:  strip poker, blackjack, pool, darts, hangman, etc.  The list goes on.  This was not really a viable solution to stream the games in the past because of high bandwidth costs and slow performance.  Even mobile devices can play video strip games with almost no issues.

Many other games besides poker have "strip" variants.  In particular, many "strip [[mahjong]]" video games have been published, especially by Japanese software companies.  In 2013, the concept of Strip Sports Betting was launched in the United States by creating live internet broadcasts using models and pornstars who bet on football games and take their clothes off as they lose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepresswire.com/?p=1993 The Presswire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripsportsbetting.com Strip Sports Betting]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13596">The first treatise on '''Telugu grammar''' ({{lang-te|వ్యాకరణం}} ''vyākaranam''), the "Andhra Shabda Chintamani" was written in [[Sanskrit]] by [[Nannayya]], who was considered as the first poet and translator of Telugu in the 11th century A.D. After Nannayya, [[Atharvana]] and [[Ahobala]] composed [[sūtra|sutras]], [[vartikas]] and [[bhashyam]].

In the 19th century, Chinnaya Suri wrote a simplified work on Telugu grammar called ''[[Bāla Vyākaranam]]'', borrowing concepts and ideas from Nannayya's Andhra Shabda Chintamani, and wrote his literary work in Telugu.&lt;ref name="Padmapriya ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Comparative Study Of Andhrasabdachintamani And Balavyakaranam |last= Gopavaram |first= Padmapriya |authorlink= |author2=Subrahmanyam, Korada  |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Hyderabad |location=Hyderabad|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nannayya]], language without '[[Niyama]]' or the language which doesn't adhere to Vyākaranam is called [[apabhramsa|Grāmya]] or [[apabhramsa|Apabhraṃśa]] and hence it is unfit for literary usage. All the literary texts in Telugu follows Vyākaranam.&lt;ref name="Padmapriya ch1" /&gt;

==Inflection==
Telugu is more [[inflected language|inflected]] than the other literary Dravidian languages. Telugu nouns are inflected for number (singular, plural), gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, vocative, instrumental, and locative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| year=1857 | title = A grammar of the Telugu language | author1=Charles Philip Brown | edition=2 | publisher=Christian Knowledge Society's Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender (''liṃgam'')===
Telugu has three [[Grammatical gender|genders]]:
* masculine (purusha liṃgam), 	
* feminine (strī liṃgam),
* neuter (napuṃsaka liṃgam).

In Telugu the suffix (–Du) is almost always indicative of masculine gender. 
For example: 
* ta-mmu-Du (younger brother), 
* mu-khyu-Du (important man),
* Ramu-Du (Ramu),
* nA-ya-ku-Du (leader).

However, there are more masculine nouns that do not end in (-Du). 
For example: 
* a-nnaya (elder brother), 
* mA-maya (uncle).

Some masculine nouns ending in (Du) can be converted to feminine nouns by deleting the (–Du)  suffix and adding a suffix (-I).
{| class="IPA wikitable" style=text-align:center
|-
!Masculine  
!Feminine
|-
| na-ta-ku-Du (dancer)|| na-ta-ki (dancer)
|-
| vA-cha-ku-Du (narrator)|| vA-cha-ki (narrator)
|-
| pre-mi-ku-Du (lover) || pre-ya-si (lover)
|-
|}
Some masculine names ending in (Du) can be converted to Feminine names by deleting the (Du) and adding the suffix (rAlu).  
{| class="IPA wikitable" style=text-align:center
|-
!Masculine  
!Feminine
|-
| na-rta-ku-Du (dancer)|| na-rta-ku-rA-lu (dancer)
|-
| pri-yu-Du (lover) || pri-yu-rA-lu (lover)
|-
| bha-ktu-Du (male devote) || bha-ktu-rA-lu (female devotee)
|-
|}

In Telugu the suffix (–Mu) or (-Am) or (-u) is almost always indicative of the neuter gender. For example: 
* Chitra Pata-mu or Chitra Pat-am (Photo Frame),
* Chitra-mu or Chitr-am (Picture/Photo)
* Akash-am or Akasha-mu (sky),
* Neer-u (Water),
* Parikar-am or Parikara-mu (Tool).

However, Telugu sometimes uses the same forms for singular feminine and neuter genders&amp;nbsp;– the third person pronoun (అది {{IPA|/ad̪ɪ/}}) is used to refer to animals and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| year=1857 | title = A grammar of the Telugu language | author1=Charles Philip Brown | edition=2 | publisher=Christian Knowledge Society's Press | page=39 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnAIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=feminine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number (''vachanam'')===

Any thing in singular form is singular (''ekavachanam'').
Any things more than one in number are called plural (''bahuvachanam'').

In Telugu the plural is also used to address elders with respect. Some nouns are [[Plurale tantum|always plural]] and some are always singular. For example, water (''neellu'') is always plural.

God (''bhagavantudu''), sun (''suryudu''), earth (''bhoomi''), and moon (''chandrudu'') are always singular form. 
However, ''Devullu'' is a plural form of ''bhagavantudu'', used when referring to multiple deities.

===Case (విభక్తి ''vibhakti'')===
Telugu has eight cases.

* Interrogative pronoun.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| year=1905| title = A progressive Grammar of Telugu Language with copious examples and exercises | publisher=Christian Knowledge Society's Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word order==
The primary word order of Telugu is SOV ([[subject–object–verb]])

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Sentence
| colspan="3" style="text-align:left" | రాముడు బడికి వెళ్తాడు.
|-
! Words
| రాముడు || బడికి || వెళ్తాడు.
|-
! [[Transliteration]]
| Rāmuḍu || baḍiki || veḷtāḍu
|-
! [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|Gloss]]
| Ram || to school || goes.
|-
! Parts
| Subject
| Object
| Verb
|-
! Translation
| colspan="3" style="text-align:left" | Ram goes to school.
|}
This sentence can also be interpreted as 'Ram will go to school' depending on the context. But it does not affect the SOV order.
&lt;ref name="Padmapriya ch1" /&gt;

==Punctuation==
Telugu uses single and double vertical bars to indicate a comma and a full stop. However modern Telugu uses punctuation marks  which  are  borrowed  from English.&lt;ref name="University of Hyderabad"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Short Outline of Telugu Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sandhi or joining==
[[Sandhi]] is the fusion of sounds across word boundaries and the alteration of sounds due to neighboring sounds or due to the grammatical function of adjacent words.

Telugu uses [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes to join words together, forming complex words. These processes are traditionally referred to as [[sandhi]].
Example, ''Shankara'' + ''Abharanam'' gives the word ''shankarabharanamu''.

There are many types of sandhi in Telugu. Some of them are mentioned below: 
* Savarna Deergha Sandhi.
* Guna Sandhi.
* Vruddhi Sandhi.
* Yanadesha Sandhi.
* Trika Sandhi.
* Akara Sandhi.
* Ukara sandhi.
* Ikara Sandhi.
* Dugagama Sandhi.
* Saraladesha Sandhi
* Gasadadavadesha Sandhi.
* Rugagama Sandhi.
* Yadagama Sandhi.
* Prathametara Vibhakti Sxandhi.
* Uchadadi sandhi.
* Yanadesha sandhi

==Samasam or nominal compounds==
Samasam or samasa occurs with various structures, but morphologically speaking they are essentially the same: each noun (or adjective) is in its (weak) stem form, with only the final element receiving case inflection.

Some of the Telugu samasams are:
* [[Tatpuruṣa]] Samasam.
** ''Prathama tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Dvitiya tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Trutiya tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Chaturthi tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Panchami tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Shashti tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Saptami tatpurusha samasam''
** ''Nai tatpurusha samasam''

** ''Viśeshana uttarapada karmadharaya samasam''
** ''Viśeshana ubhayapada karmadharaya samasam''
** ''Upamana purvapada karmadharaya samasam''
** ''Upamana uttarapada karmadharaya samasam''
** ''Avadharana purvapada karmadharaya samasam''
** ''Sambhavana purvapada karmadharaya samasam''
* [[Dvigu]] Samasam.
* [[Dvandva]] Samasam.
* [[Bahuvrīhi]] Samasam.
* [[Amredita]] Samasam.
* awyaee bhava samasam

== Alankaram or ornamentation ==

Telugu Alankaram is a figure of speech which means ornaments or embellishments which are used to enhance the beauty of the poems. There are two types of Alankarams, 'Shabdalankaram' which primarily focuses on Sound and 'Arthalamkaram' which focuses on meaning. These two alankarams are further broken down in to different categories.&lt;ref name="Padmapriya ch2"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Comparative Study Of Andhrasabdachintamani And Balavyakaranam |last= Gopavaram |first= Padmapriya |authorlink= |author2=Subrahmanyam, Korada  |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Hyderabad |location=Hyderabad}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
shabdalankaras are 6 types where as there are nearly 30 to 40 types in ardhalankaras.
* ''Shabdalankaram''
** ''Vruttyanuprasa''
** ''Chekanuprasa''
** ''Latanuprasa''
** ''antyanuprasa''
** ''Yamakam''
** ''Mukta pada grastam''
* ''Arthalamkaram''
** ''Upamanaalankaram''
** ''Utprekshaalankaram''
** ''Rupakaalankaram''
** ''Shleshalankaram''
** ''Arthantaranyaasam''
** ''Atishayokti''
** ''Atishayokti Alamkaram'' {This was invented by a Telugu teacher (Sreedhar Raju Alluri) from MUNICH on 12th Feb 2017}
** ''Drushtantam''
** ''Swabhavokti''
** ''vyajastu''
** ''virodhi''
** ''vishamamu''
** ''parikaramu''
** ''branti madala''
** ''kramalam

==Chandassu or Telugu prosody ==

Utpalamala, Champakamala, Mattebha vikreeditham, Sardoola Vikreeditham, Kanda, Aata veladi, Theta geethi, Sragdhara, Bhujangaprayata, etc. are some metrics used in Telugu poetry.

==Prakruti and Vikruti==

'''Thermohaline circulation''' ('''THC''') is a part of the large-scale [[Ocean current|ocean circulation]] that is driven by global [[density gradient]]s created by surface heat and freshwater [[flux]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmstorf|first=S|title=The concept of the thermohaline circulation|journal=Nature|volume=421|page=699|year=2003|url=http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Nature/nature_concept_03.pdf|pmid=12610602|issue=6924|doi=10.1038/421699a|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..699R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lappo|first=SS|title=On reason of the northward heat advection across the Equator in the South Pacific and Atlantic ocean|journal=Study of Ocean and Atmosphere Interaction Processes|year=1984|pages=125–9|publisher=Moscow Department of Gidrometeoizdat (in Mandarin)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''thermohaline'' derives from ''[[wikt:thermo-|thermo-]]'' referring to [[temperature]] and ''{{nowrap|-haline}}'' referring to [[salinity|salt content]], factors which together determine the [[Water (molecule)#Density of saltwater and ice|density of sea water]]. [[Wind]]-driven surface currents (such as the [[Gulf Stream]]) travel [[Polar regions of Earth|polewards]] from the equatorial [[Atlantic Ocean]], cooling en route, and eventually sinking at high [[latitude]]s (forming [[North Atlantic Deep Water]]). This dense water then flows into the [[ocean basin]]s. While the bulk of it [[upwelling|upwells]] in the [[Southern Ocean]], the oldest waters (with a transit time of around 1000 years)&lt;ref&gt;The global ocean conveyor belt is a constantly moving system of deep-ocean circulation driven by temperature and salinity; [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/conveyor.html What is the global ocean conveyor belt?]&lt;/ref&gt; upwell in the North Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/JPO2699.1|last=Primeau|first=F|title=Characterizing transport between the surface mixed layer and the ocean interior with a forward and adjoint global ocean transport model|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=35|issue=4|pages=545–64|year=2005|bibcode=2005JPO....35..545P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins, reducing differences between them and making the Earth's oceans a global system. On their journey, the water masses transport both energy (in the form of heat) and mass of substances (solids, dissolved substances and gases) around the globe. As such, the state of the circulation has a large impact on the [[climate]] of the Earth.

The thermohaline circulation is sometimes called the ocean conveyor belt, the great ocean conveyor, or the global conveyor belt. On occasion, it is used to refer to the [[Zonal and meridional|meridional]] overturning circulation (often abbreviated as MOC). The term ''MOC'' is more accurate and well defined, as it is difficult to separate the part of the circulation which is driven by temperature and [[salinity]] alone as opposed to other factors such as the wind and [[tidal force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wunsch|first=C|year=2002|title=What is the thermohaline circulation?|journal=Science|volume=298|issue=5596|pages=1179–81|doi=10.1126/science.1079329|pmid=12424356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, temperature and salinity gradients can also lead to circulation effects that are not included in the MOC itself.

==Overview==
[[File:Conveyor belt.svg|thumb|left|275px|The global conveyor belt on a continuous-ocean map]]

The movement of surface currents pushed by the wind is fairly intuitive. For example, the wind easily produces ripples on the surface of a pond. Thus the deep ocean&amp;mdash;devoid of wind&amp;mdash;was assumed to be perfectly static by early oceanographers. However, modern instrumentation shows that current velocities in deep water masses can be significant (although much less than surface speeds). In general, ocean water velocities range from fractions of centimeters per second (in the depth of the oceans) to sometimes more than 1&amp;nbsp;m/s in surface currents like the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[Kuroshio Current|Kuroshio]].

In the deep ocean, the predominant driving force is differences in [[density]], caused by salinity and temperature variations (increasing salinity and lowering the temperature of a fluid both increase its density). There is often confusion over the components of the circulation that are wind and density driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wyrtki|first=K|title=The thermohaline circulation in relation to the general circulation in the oceans|journal=Deep-Sea Research|volume=8|issue=1|pages=39–64|year=1961 |doi=10.1016/0146-6313(61)90014-4|bibcode=1961DSR.....8...39W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, G., 2005, [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=159 Gulf Stream slowdown?], [[RealClimate]]&lt;/ref&gt; Note that ocean currents due to [[tides]] are also significant in many places; most prominent in relatively shallow coastal areas, tidal currents can also be significant in the deep ocean. There they are currently thought to facilitate mixing processes, especially diapycnal mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean Dynamics|last=Eden|first=Carsten|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-3-642-23449-1|location=|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of ocean water is not globally homogeneous, but varies significantly and discretely. Sharply defined boundaries exist between [[water mass]]es which form at the surface, and subsequently maintain their own identity within the ocean. But these sharp boundaries are not to be imagined spatially but rather in a [[Temperature vs. specific entropy diagram|T-S-diagram]]{{clarify|date=October 2017}} where water masses are distinguished. They position themselves above or below each other according to their [[density]], which depends on both temperature and salinity.

Warm seawater expands and is thus less dense than cooler seawater. Saltier water is denser than fresher water because the dissolved salts fill interstices between water molecules, resulting in more mass per unit volume. Lighter [[water mass]]es float over denser ones (just as a piece of wood or ice will float on water, see [[buoyancy]]). This is known as "stable stratification" as opposed to unstable stratification (see Brunt-Väisälä frequency){{clarify|date=October 2017}} where denser waters are located over less dense waters (see [[convection]] or deep convection needed for water mass formation). When dense water masses are first formed, they are not stably stratified, so they seek to locate themselves in the correct vertical position according to their density. This motion is called convection, it orders the stratification by gravitation. Driven by the density gradients this sets up the main driving force behind deep ocean currents like the deep western boundary current (DWBC).

The thermohaline circulation is mainly driven by the formation of deep water masses in the [[North Atlantic]] and the [[Southern Ocean]] caused by differences in temperature and salinity of the water.

The great quantities of dense water sinking at high latitudes must be offset by equal quantities of water rising elsewhere. Note that cold water in polar zones sink relatively rapidly over a small area, while warm water in temperate and tropical zones rise more gradually across a much larger area. It then slowly returns poleward near the surface to repeat the cycle. The continual diffuse upwelling of deep water maintains the existence of the permanent thermocline found everywhere at low and mid-latitudes. This model was described by Henry Stommel and Arnold B. Arons in 1960 and is known as the Stommel-Arons box model for the MOC.&lt;ref&gt;Stommel, H., &amp; Arons, A. B. (1960). On the abyssal circulation of the world ocean. – I. Stationary planetary flow patterns on a sphere. Deep Sea Research (1953), 6, 140-154.&lt;/ref&gt; This slow upward movement is approximated to be about 1 centimeter (0.5 inch) per day over most of the ocean. If this rise were to stop, downward movement of heat would cause the [[thermocline]] to descend and would reduce its steepness.

===Formation of deep water masses===
The dense water masses that sink into the deep basins are formed in quite specific areas of the [[North Atlantic]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. In the North Atlantic, seawater at the surface of the ocean is intensely cooled by the wind and low ambient air temperatures. Wind moving over the water also produces a great deal of evaporation, leading to a decrease in temperature, called [[evaporative cooling]] related to latent heat. Evaporation removes only water molecules, resulting in an increase in the salinity of the seawater left behind, and thus an increase in the density of the water mass along with the decrease in temperature. In the [[Norwegian Sea]] evaporative cooling is predominant, and the sinking water mass, the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW), fills the basin and spills southwards through crevasses in the [[submarine sill]]s that connect [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Great Britain]] which are known as the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge. It then flows very slowly into the deep [[abyssal plain]]s of the Atlantic, always in a southerly direction. Flow from the [[Arctic Ocean]] Basin into the Pacific, however, is blocked by the narrow shallows of the [[Bering Strait]].

[[File:Sea water freezing temperature and density maximum.png|thumb|293x293px|Diagram showing relation between temperature and salinity for sea water density maximum and sea water freezing temperature.]]

In the [[Southern Ocean]], strong [[katabatic wind]]s blowing from the Antarctic continent onto the ice shelves will blow the newly formed [[sea ice]] away, opening [[polynyas]] along the coast. The ocean, no longer protected by sea ice, suffers a brutal and strong cooling (see [[polynya]]). Meanwhile, sea ice starts reforming, so the surface waters also get saltier, hence very dense. In fact, the formation of sea ice contributes to an increase in surface seawater salinity; saltier [[brine]] is left behind as the sea ice forms around it (pure water preferentially being frozen). Increasing salinity lowers the freezing point of seawater, so cold liquid brine is formed in inclusions within a honeycomb of ice. The brine progressively melts the ice just beneath it, eventually dripping out of the ice matrix and sinking. This process is known as [[brine rejection]].

The resulting [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (AABW) sinks and flows north and east, but is so dense it actually underflows the NADW. AABW formed in the [[Weddell Sea]] will mainly fill the Atlantic and Indian Basins, whereas the AABW formed in the [[Ross Sea]] will flow towards the Pacific Ocean.

The dense water masses formed by these processes flow downhill at the bottom of the ocean, like a stream within the surrounding less dense fluid, and fill up the basins of the polar seas. Just as river valleys direct streams and rivers on the continents, the bottom topography constrains the deep and bottom water masses.

Note that, unlike fresh water, [[seawater]] does not have a density maximum at 4&amp;nbsp;°C but gets denser as it cools all the way to its freezing point of approximately −1.8&amp;nbsp;°C. This freezing point is however a function of salinity and pressure and thus −1.8&amp;nbsp;°C is not a general freezing temperature for sea water (see diagram to the right).

=== Movement of deep water masses===
Formation and movement of the deep water masses at the North Atlantic Ocean, creates sinking water masses that fill the basin and flows very slowly into the deep abyssal plains of the Atlantic. This high-latitude cooling and the low-latitude heating drives the movement of the deep water in a polar southward flow. The deep water flows through the [[Antarctic Ocean]] Basin around [[South Africa]] where it is split into two routes: one into the [[Indian Ocean]] and one past [[Australia]] into the Pacific.

At the Indian Ocean, some of the cold and salty water from the Atlantic—drawn by the flow of warmer and fresher upper ocean water from the tropical Pacific—causes a vertical exchange of dense, sinking water with lighter water above. It is known as '''overturning'''. In the Pacific Ocean, the rest of the cold and salty water from the Atlantic undergoes haline forcing, and becomes warmer and fresher more quickly.

The out-flowing undersea of cold and salty water makes the sea level of the Atlantic slightly lower than the Pacific and salinity or halinity of water at the Atlantic higher than the Pacific. This generates a large but slow flow of warmer and fresher upper ocean water from the tropical Pacific to the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] to replace the cold and salty [[Antarctic Bottom Water]]. This is also known as 'haline forcing' (net high latitude freshwater gain and low latitude evaporation). This warmer, fresher water from the Pacific flows up through the [[South Atlantic]] to [[Greenland]], where it cools off and undergoes [[evaporative cooling]] and sinks to the ocean floor, providing a continuous thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme / GRID-Arendal, 2006, [http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/32.htm]. ''Potential Impact of Climate Change''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, a recent and popular name for the thermohaline circulation, emphasizing the vertical nature and pole-to-pole character of this kind of ocean circulation, is the '''meridional overturning circulation'''.

===Quantitative estimation===

Direct estimates of the strength of the thermohaline circulation have been made at 26.5°N in the North Atlantic since 2004 by the UK-US RAPID programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/overview.php|title=RAPID: monitoring the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation at 26.5N since 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining direct estimates of ocean transport using current meters and subsea cable measurements with estimates of the [[geostrophic current]] from temperature and salinity measurements, the RAPID programme provides continuous, full-depth, basinwide estimates of the thermohaline circulation or, more accurately, the meridional overturning circulation.

The deep water masses that participate in the MOC have chemical, temperature and isotopic ratio signatures and can be traced, their flow rate calculated, and their age determined.
These include [[Isotope geochemistry|&lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa / &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th]] ratios.

==Gulf Stream==
{{Main|Gulf Stream}}
[[File:Franklingulfstream.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s map of the [[Gulf Stream]]]]
The [[Gulf Stream]], together with its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], is a powerful, warm, and swift [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[ocean current]] that originates at the tip of [[Florida]], and follows the eastern coastlines of the [[United States]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of [[Boundary current|western intensification]] causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (2009).

==Upwelling==
{{Main|Upwelling}}
All these dense water masses sinking into the ocean basins displace the older deep water masses that were made less dense by ocean mixing. To maintain a balance, water must be rising elsewhere. However, because this thermohaline upwelling is so widespread and diffuse, its speeds are very slow even compared to the movement of the bottom water masses. It is therefore difficult to measure where upwelling occurs using current speeds, given all the other wind-driven processes going on in the surface ocean. Deep waters have their own chemical signature, formed from the breakdown of particulate matter falling into them over the course of their long journey at depth. A number of scientists have tried to use these tracers to infer where the upwelling occurs.

[[Wallace S. Broecker|Wallace Broecker]], using box models, has asserted that the bulk of deep upwelling occurs in the North Pacific, using as evidence the high values of silicon found in these waters. Other investigators have not found such clear evidence. Computer models of ocean circulation increasingly place most of the deep upwelling in the Southern Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=John|author2=Speer, Kevin |title=Closure of the meridional overturning circulation through Southern Ocean upwelling|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=26 February 2012|volume=5|issue=3|pages=171–180|doi=10.1038/ngeo1391|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..171M }}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the strong winds in the open latitudes between South America and Antarctica. While this picture is consistent with the global observational synthesis of William Schmitz at Woods Hole and with low observed values of diffusion, not all observational syntheses agree. Recent papers by [[Lynne Talley]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and Bernadette Sloyan and Stephen Rintoul in Australia suggest that a significant amount of dense deep water must be transformed to light water somewhere north of the Southern Ocean.

==Effects on global climate==
The thermohaline circulation plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in regulating the amount of sea ice in these regions, although poleward heat transport outside the tropics is considerably larger in the atmosphere than in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trenberth|first1=K|last2=Caron|first2=J|year=2001|title=Estimates of Meridional Atmosphere and Ocean Heat Transports|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=14|issue=16|pages=3433–43|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2001)014&lt;3433:EOMAAO&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode=2001JCli...14.3433T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on the Earth's [[radiation budget]]. Insofar as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters are exposed to the surface, it may also play an important role in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While it is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that [[Western Europe]] is so temperate, it has been suggested that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin, and because of the effect of [[atmospheric waves]] bringing warm air north from the [[subtropics]].&lt;ref&gt;Seager, R., 2006, [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2006/4/the-source-of-europes-mild-climate/1 The Source of Europe's Mild Climate], ''American Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the underlying assumptions of this particular analysis have likewise been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Rhines and Hakkinen, 2003, [http://www.realclimate.org/Rhines_hakkinen_2003.pdf Is the Oceanic Heat Transport in the North Atlantic Irrelevant to the Climate in Europe?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716003623/http://www.realclimate.org/Rhines_hakkinen_2003.pdf |date=16 July 2007 }} ''ASOF Newsletter''&lt;/ref&gt;

Large influxes of low-density meltwater from [[Lake Agassiz]] and deglaciation in [[North America]] are thought to have led to a shifting of deep water formation and subsidence in the extreme North Atlantic and caused the climate period in Europe known as the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name="Broecker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broecker|first=WS|title=Was the Younger Dryas Triggered by a Flood?|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5777|pages=1146–8|doi=10.1126/science.1123253|pmid=16728622|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shutdown of thermohaline circulation ===
{{Main|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}}
{{See also|Deglaciation|Cold blob (North Atlantic)}}
In 2005, British researchers noticed that the net flow of the northern [[Gulf Stream]] had decreased by about 30% since 1957. Coincidentally, scientists at Woods Hole had been measuring the freshening of the North Atlantic as [[Global warming|Earth becomes warmer]]. Their findings suggested that precipitation increases in the high northern latitudes, and [[polar ice]] melts as a consequence. By flooding the northern seas with lots of extra fresh water, global warming could, in theory, divert the Gulf Stream waters that usually flow northward, past the British Isles and [[Norway]], and cause them to instead circulate toward the [[Equator]]. If this were to happen, Europe's climate would be seriously impacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Tom|title=Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science|publisher=Cengage Learning|edition=7th|date=2009|pages=582|isbn=9780495391937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 2013, an unexpected significant weakening of the THC led to [[2013 Atlantic hurricane season|one of the quietest Atlantic hurricane seasons observed since 1994]]. The main cause of the inactivity was caused by a continuation of the spring pattern across the Atlantic basin.

The '''Turkbank scandal''' was a [[political scandal]] in 1998 surrounding the relationship between the [[Government of Turkey|Turkish government]], the private sector, and [[organized crime]] that led to the resignation of the prime minister [[Mesut Yılmaz]] and [[55th government of Turkey|his cabinet]] in early 1999. It took place during the privatization process of [[Türk Ticaret Bankası]] (TTB), aka Türkbank.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;

==Background==
Established as a regional bank by private investors under the name ''[[Adapazarı]] [[İslam]] Ticaret Bankası'' in 1913, Türkbank became the first private bank of Turkey. Following the Turkish financial crisis, which blew up in January 1994, and the [[devaluation]] of the [[Turkish lira|Turkish currency]] at hundred percent,&lt;ref name="ed"/&gt; the bank weakened, which operated 274 branches and employed 4,532 staff nationwide at that time. The bank was taken under control by the Treasury in May of the same year. The bank's 84.52% stake was taken over by the [[Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey]] ({{lang-tr|Tasarruf Mevduatı Sigorta Fonu}}, TMSF) for sale in a public tender.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;

The TMSF [[Request for tender|requested for tender]] on May 4, 1998. On May 18, Police of Istanbul applied to the [[Judicial system of Turkey#State Security Courts|State Security Court]] ({{lang-tr|Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi}}) to obtain a permission to eavesdrop businessman [[Korkmaz Yiğit]]'s mobile phone for the length of one month due to reasonable grounds on his existing ties with and money transfer to organized crime.&lt;ref name="t1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aym"/&gt;

On August 4, Yiğit's construction company with his Bank Ekspres placed the highest bid of US$600 million for the majority stake, followed by US$595 million of [[Zorlu Holding]] controlling [[Denizbank]].&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt; Right after the accomplishment of the tender process, the police notified the TMSF in writing about the relationship between Yiğit and the mob boss [[Alaattin Çakıcı]], and Çakıcı's thraetening other bidders of the tender.&lt;ref name="t1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ycg1"/&gt;
 
Korkmaz Yiğit (born 1943) was a self-made businessman, who owned two banks, two newspapers and three television channels at that time, all acquired not a long time ago.&lt;ref name="a2"/&gt; Alaattin Çakıcı (born 1953), a former member of the ultra-nationalist organization [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] and one of the leading mobs of the Turkish underworld, was a fugitive since 1992, sought for several crimes. Çakıcı had connection with businessman [[Erol Evcil]], who had tried to purchase Türkbank in 1995.&lt;ref name="t1"/&gt;

On August 17, 1998, Çakıcı was apprehended in France upon request by the Turkish Police, and extradited to Turkey. [[Fikri Sağlar]], a deputy of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) in the opposition and a former [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Minister of Culture]], received a recording tape by mail on August 29, which contained a conversation between Yiğit and Çakıcı about the Türkbank tender. On October 8, Sağlar submitted the recording tape to his friend [[Tuncay Özkan]], the news director of [[Kanal D]], for broadcasting on the TV. As Kanal D did nothing in the meantime, Sağlar disclosed the private conversation at a press conference on October 13. Thereupon, the TMSF annulled the tender for Türkbank sale on October 15, 1998.&lt;ref name="hbr3"/&gt;

==Downfall of Yılmaz cabinet and trial==
Yiğit was taken to the Organized Crime Department of Istanbul Police, where he presented a testimony of five pages on November 12, in which he confessed all his connections and unlawful doings related to the tender process. The scandal spread over to the politics when some information from Yiğit's testimony leaked to the public. It became apparent that Prime minister Mesut Yılmaz and Minister of State responsible for Economy [[Güneş Taner]] were involved in the scandal.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt; Yiğit claimed that "Yılmaz and Taner encouraged him to buy Türkbank, and offered him loans from other state banks to ensure that his bid was the highest".&lt;ref name="mt1"/&gt; He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, losing all his assets during this time.&lt;ref name="a2"/&gt;
 
Right after the political scandal emerged, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] formed a parliamentary investigation committee. Yılmaz was invited to testify before the committee. The coalition cabinet led by Yılmaz was brought to fall by [[motion of no confidence]] on January 11, 1999.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt;

After hearing several politicians and journalists, the parliamentary committee prepared an investigative report, which blamed Yılmaz for conspiring to [[bid rigging|rig bids on tender]]. However, the report became obsolate due to the upcoming [[Turkish general election, 1999|1999 general election]] to be held on April 18.&lt;ref name="hbr3"/&gt; After the [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002 general election]] on November 3, the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) and CHP both pushed the suspended corruption cases, including the Türkbank scandal. On December 9, 2002, a parliamentary committee was formed, which heard further witnesses involved in the tender process, and investigated the allegations against Yılmaz and Taner once again. Accomplished on June 25, 2004, the thousands-page report concluded Yılmaz and Taner of bid rigging, and proposed their trial at the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] ({{lang-tr|Yüce Divan}}), which is the supreme court for trials of high-ranking politicians in Turkey.

The parliament assembly accepted the report by 429 votes in favour of the total 447 present in the 550-seat parliament (276 votes would have been sufficient) on July 13, 2004. Yılmaz asked for his trial before the independent Constitutional Court. On July 23, the Constitutional Court rejected the submission on the grounds that the case has to be separated for both defendants.&lt;ref name="set1"/&gt; The parliament decided on October 27 to send the two politicians separately to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt; Mesut Yılmaz became so the first prime minister ever to stand trial in the Constitutional Court of Turkey.&lt;ref name="mt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="set1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

The highest court ruled on June 23, 2006 that on some of the allegations relating to their term of office and responsibilities, Mesut Yılmaz (June 30, 1997 – January 11, 1999) and Güneş Taner (June 30, 1997 – November 25, 1998) are guilty of bid rigging as per Turkish Penal Code's Article 765 Section 205. However, the sentences were reprieved in accordance with applicable laws.&lt;ref name="aym"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hv1"/&gt;

{{other|Washerwoman (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:ElHuasoYLaLavandera.jpg|thumb|200px|''The [[Huaso]] and the Washerwoman'' by [[Mauricio Rugendas]] (1835).]]
[[File:Bal des blanchisseuses au lavoir Popincourt 1872.jpg|thumb|The annual dance of the washerwomen in one district of Paris, 1872]]
[[File:0 Bruxelles - Petit Sablon - Blanchisseur.JPG|thumb|right|The launderer by [[Jef Lambeaux]].]]
A '''washerwoman''' or '''laundress''' is a woman who takes in [[laundry]]. Both terms are now old-fashioned.

==Description==
As evidenced by the character of [[Nausicaa]] in the [[Odyssey]], in the social conventions depicted by [[Homer]] and evidently taken for granted in Greek society of the time, there was nothing unusual or demeaning in a princess and her handmaidens personally washing laundry. However, in later times this was mostly considered as the work of women of low social status. The [[Magdalene asylum]]s chose laundering as a suitable occupation for the "[[fallen women]]" they accommodated. In between these two extremes, the various sub-divisions of laundry workers in C19th France (''blanchisseuse'', ''lavandière'', ''laveuse'', ''buandière'', ''repasseuse'', etc.) were respected for their trade. A festival in their honour was held at the end of winter (''Mi-Careme'', halfway through [[Lent]], i.e. three weeks after [[Mardi Gras]] or [[Shrove Tuesday]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monjaret|first1=Anne|title=La Fete de la Sainte-Catherine a Paris dans les Annees Folles|journal=Ethnologia Europaea: Journal of European Ethnology|date=1995|volume=25|issue=1|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival has now been revived as [[:fr:Mi-Carême au Carnaval de Paris|Mi-Carême au Carnaval de Paris]].

While having a significant social function in various human cultures over thousands of years, the spread of [[washing machines]] and [[self-service laundry|self-service laundries]] has rendered washerwomen unnecessary in much of the contemporary world.

==Popular culture==
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}
There are copious examples of washerwomen or laundresses in art (see [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Washerwomen_in_art WikiCommons]) and some examples in literature as well:

* the disguise adopted by Toad, one of the protagonists of ''[[Wind in the Willows]]'', in order to escape from prison.

* In ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', an unnamed laundress worked for [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. When the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] showed him his future where he is dead, the laundress assists the [[charwoman]] Mrs. Dilber and the unnamed [[Funeral director|undertaker]] into stealing some of Scrooge's belongings and selling them to a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Old Joe.

* In ''[[The Penultimate Peril]]'' story of the [[Lemony Snicket]] book series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', Count Olaf's minion Kevin poses as a washerwoman who works in the laundry room at the Hotel Denouement.

==See also==
* [[Dhobi]], the washermen of India
* [[Baths and wash houses in Britain]]
* [[Blanchisseuse]], a village named after its washerwomen
* [[Les Lavandières]], a group of three old women in Celtic folklore

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in Paraguay''' live in a culture that has been undergoing rapid change in recent decades. Women's rights were expanded through constitutional and legal changes during the 1990s. Cultural attitudes towards many areas of women's lives are also changing. Yet [[Paraguay]]an women still face many challenges in trying to attain social equality.

The legal and government institutions that currently exist in Paraguay were developed in part through the efforts of feminist organizations in the country that held significant awareness-raising campaigns during the 1990s to formalize the guarantees of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Institutions and Gender Index|url=http://genderindex.org/country/paraguay|publisher=genderindex.org|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 Constitution of Paraguay upholds the principle of equality for all individuals and prohibits discrimination.  However, socio-cultural practices still support discrimination against women in some areas.

==Education==
Illiteracy rates for women in Paraguay are higher than those of men, although this is a much more pronounced difference for older generations. The gender gap in education has decreased in recent years.  Among youth aged 15 to 24 years, the literacy rate is 99% for both males and females. Young people of both sexes begin dropping out of the education system at significant rates following primary levels, however, and are unlikely to pursue education beyond the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At a glance: Paraguay statistics|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/paraguay_statistics.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, of the population 15 and over, 92.9% of women and 94.8% of men were literate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
[[File:Chipa pirú Paraguay.jpg|thumb|A woman shopkeeper in Paraguay.]]
Women's salaries in relation to men's are the second-lowest in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Legatum Prosperity Index|url=http://2008.prosperity.com/country.aspx?id=PA|publisher=Legatum|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the fact that women make up 74% of Paraguay's labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraguay Makes Step Forward For Women’s|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/paraguay-makes-step-forward-for-women’s-and-indigenous-rights-analysis-07072011/|publisher=www.eurasiareview.com|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination against women in the workplace, as well as sexual harassment on the job, are common in Paraguay. The Labor Code prohibits, but does not criminalize, discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex. Complaints are generally settled privately. The Secretariat of Women's Affairs occasionally operates programs supporting women's access to employment, social security, housing, land ownership and business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraguay|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41770.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==

Early marriage is common in Paraguay. A 2004 United Nations report estimated that 17 percent of girls between 15 and 19 years of age were married, divorced or widowed. The legal age for marriage in Paraguay is 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Institutions and Gender Index|url=http://genderindex.org/country/paraguay|publisher=genderindex.org|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce==
[[Divorce]] was legalized in Paraguay in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay was one of the last countries to legalize divorce, both in the world and in Latin America: divorce was also legalized in 1991 in Colombia;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19390164&lt;/ref&gt; across Latin America it was only Chile that had not legalized it by that time, subsequently doing so in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The legalization of divorce in Paraguay had been strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church, a powerful force in Paraguayan society since European colonization.  Divorce rates in Paraguay remain well below worldwide averages, and are the lowest in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Legatum Prosperity Index|url=http://2008.prosperity.com/country.aspx?id=PA|publisher=Legatum|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maternity==
[[File:Paraguay 1064.JPG|thumb|An indigenous woman and child. Fertility rates are higher in rural areas and among indigenous women.]]
Fertility rates in Paraguay were historically high relative to other countries in the Latin American region. This has changed since the 1990s, and fertility has recently declined significantly. In 2004 the fertility rate was estimated at 2.9. Research has found that births before marriage are common in Paraguay, although like the fertility rate overall, this phenomenon is decreasing. One study established that birth rates before a first marriage were 23, 24, and 21 percent, based on 2004, 1998, and 1995–96 data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kanako Ishida |author2=Paul Stupp |author3=Mercedes Melian  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Fertility decline in Paraguay|url=http://paraguay.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fertility-decline-in-paraguay.pdf|publisher=USAID|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maternal mortality]] rate in Paraguay is 99 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality and birth control==
{{Further|Abortion in Paraguay}}

As the cultural influence of the Roman Catholic Church declines in Paraguay, attitudes towards women's sexuality and the use of birth control are changing. The use of modern contraceptive methods, such as birth control pills, condoms and IUDs, increased from a rate of 43% in 1996 to more than 60% by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kanako Ishida |author2=Paul Stupp |author3=Mercedes Melian  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Fertility decline in Paraguay|url=http://paraguay.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fertility-decline-in-paraguay.pdf|publisher=USAID|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery]] was decriminalized in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultimahora.com/nuevo-codigo-elimino-delitos-machistas-y-discriminatorios-n212137.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HIV/AIDS]] rate is 0.3% for adults (aged 15–49), as of 2012 estimates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion remains illegal in Paraguay, with exceptional cases where it can be demonstrated that the life of the mother is in danger.

==Financial matters==
Agriculture is a significant component of Paraguay's economy and an important source of income, with approximately 45% of Paraguay's workforce being employed in agriculture. Access to land ownership has been problematic for women in Paraguay, however. There are no legal restrictions on female land ownership, yet women are half as likely as men to be approved for loans to buy land.  The 2002 Agrarian Act includes provisions intended to strengthen women's rights in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Institutions and Gender Index|url=http://genderindex.org/country/paraguay|publisher=genderindex.org|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Gloria Rubin Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Gloria Rubìn, Paraguay's Minister of the Women's Secretariat, supports reforms that improve women's rights.]]

Women in Paraguay have no legal restrictions on holding political office. Women have served in the government as members of the Congress (as National Deputies and as Senators), as governors, as heads of ministries, and there has been one female Supreme Court judge. They are underrepresented in comparison to male members of the government, however, and even relative to the rates of female representation in the governments of other countries of Latin America. Indeed, Paraguay has one of the lowest percentage of women in parliament in Latin America, significantly lower than neighboring Argentina and Bolivia, although higher than Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women==
{{Further|Domestic violence in Paraguay}}

===Domestic violence===
Domestic abuse is common in Paraguay. The legal response of Paraguay to domestic violence has been very weak, even by Latin American standards. Although Paraguay enacted in 2000 ''Law No. 1,600 Against Domestic Violence'' (Ley No 1.600 contra la Violencia Doméstica), this law - while having a broad definition of domestic violence (including physical, psychological and sexual abuse "lesiones, maltratos físicos, psíquicos o sexuales" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/paraguay.dv.00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) - is civil in nature, and as such does not provide for any sanctions against the perpetrators. While the Criminal Code provides for a crime of domestic violence, this crime has a very narrow definition, as  physical violence that is carried out habitually, and is punishable only by a fine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/42df61652.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurasiareview.com/07072011-paraguay-makes-step-forward-for-women%E2%80%99s-and-indigenous-rights-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there have been increasing calls, from both inside and outside of the country, for the enactment of a comprehensive law against [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.decidamos.org.py/www/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1705:10-razones-por-las-que-paraguay-necesita-una-ley-integral-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/136-secretaria-de-genero/609&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.lainformacion.com/politica/derechos-humanos/paraguay-requiere-ley-contra-violencia-de-genero-dice-representante-de-onu_StZtbOZvhADLnLJA5rcFN6/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/a-paraguay-le-urge-una-ley-contra-violencia-de-genero&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paraguay.com/nacionales/reclaman-ley-integral-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-99037&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.com.py/especiales/fin-de-semana/un-salto-legal-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-1303660.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human trafficking===

Human trafficking for the purposes of forcing young women into prostitution is an entrenched problem. In recent years, human trafficking networks organized by Taiwanese and Chinese nationals have been broken up by Paraguayan law enforcement, with Paraguayan women being trafficked to Brazil, Argentina, or Spain to work in brothels. There are no precise estimates of the number of women who are victims of human trafficking, but anecdotal estimates are that several hundred Paraguayan women are smuggled out of the country annually. Underage girls are also trafficked within Paraguay and to neighbouring countries to be forced to work as domestic servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraguay|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41770.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights history in Paraguay==
The movement to expand women's rights in [[Paraguay]] grew significantly in the 1920s, in large part through the work of [[María Felicidad González]], who represented her country at a feminist conference in [[Baltimore]], in 1922. One year earlier, on April 26, 1921, she opened the  ''Centro Femenino del Paraguay'' (CFP) (Women's Centre of Paraguay). Influenced by women's rights movements in North America and Europe, Paraguayan women also began to mobilize and claim their rights. During this period, feminism was associated with the [[Revolutionary Febrerista Party]].

=== Paraguayan Women's Union ===
In 1936, during the [[Revolution of February 17, 1936]], the ''Unión Femenina del Paraguay'' (UFP) (Paraguayan Women's Union) was created. It was founded on April 26, 15 years after the founding of the Women's Centre of Paraguay, at a meeting that took place at the Colegio Nacional de la Capital, in [[Asunción]]. The first president of the Union was [[Maria F. de Casati]].

The Union, in addition to its feminist cause, was openly [[socialist]] and part of the wider changes resulting from the [[Revolution of February 17, 1936]]. In fact, [[María F. de Casati]] stated: {{blockquote|Our feminist movement was born on February 17, with the Revolution that was a clarion call to the popular soul, which opened to everyone the hope for social improvement".&lt;ref&gt;Juan Speratti: Feminismo, Editorial Litocolor, Asunción, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the participants in the Union were [[Elena Freis de Barthe]], [[Lorenza C. de Gaona]], and [[Luisa vda. de Felip]]. The Union published a periodical called Por la Mujer (For Women), which was the first feminist periodical in [[Paraguay]]. Among other causes, it promoted [[women's suffrage]] and equality of the sexes.

The Union held meetings in the capitol and throughout Paraguay to raise awareness among women about their rights. Ties were strengthened with other feminist groups in the Americas, including: ''Asociación Argentina Pro-Sufragio Femenino'', the ''Confederación Femenina de la Paz Americana'', ''Liga Femenina Pro-Union Americana'', the ''Asociación Argentina Pro Paz'', and the ''Asociación Cristiana Femenina''.

In 1937, with the fall of the government that came into power following the [[Revolution of February 17, 1936]], the Union was forced to disband, leaving the women's rights movement without an organization.

=== Women's Democratic Union ===
After passing several years between 1940 and 1945 without a women's rights organization, the ''Unión Democrática de Mujeres'' (UDM) (Women's Democratic Union) was founded on December 19, 1946. It grew out of the ''Agrupación de Mujeres Febrerista Residentes en Montevideo'' (AMFRM) (Association of Febrerista Women Living in Montevideo), which was connected to the ''Concentración Revolucionaria Febrerista'', a Febrerista exile group based out of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. The founders of this group included [[Carmen Soler]], [[Esther Ballestrino]], Lilia Freis, and several others. This group was forced to disband following the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Paraguayan Civil War]] in 1947.

=== Febrerista Women's Emancipation Movement ===
The ''Movimiento Femenino Febrerista de Emancipación'' (MFFE) (Febrerista Women's Emancipation Movement) was founded in 1949, and it was the successor organization to the ''Agrupación de Mujeres Febreristas Residentes en Montevideo''. It published a periodical, ''Correspondencia''. The MFFE remained associated with the ''Concentración Revolucionaria Febrerista'' group. In 1951, the [[Febrerista Revolutionary Party]] was founded, and the MFFE was integrated with it.

Women's suffrage was gained in Paraguay in 1961, primarily because the [[Dictator|strongarm]] president, [[Alfredo Stroessner]], lacking the approval of his male constituents, sought to bolster his support through women voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Przeworski|first1=Adam|last2=Shin|first2=Kong Joo|last3=Xi|first3=Tianyang|title=A Simple Partisan Calculus of Women’s Suffrage|url=http://www.fflch.usp.br/centrodametropole/upload/aaa/495-wsuffrage_092613.pdf|website=Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas|publisher=Universidade de São Paulo|accessdate=9 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142541/http://www.fflch.usp.br/centrodametropole/upload/aaa/495-wsuffrage_092613.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2017|location=São Paulo, Brazil|page=22|language=English|date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current feminist organizations ===
In recent years, almost all major political parties in Paraguay have included groups focussed on women's rights issues. Many members of these groups were part of the ''Mujeres por la Alianza'' (Women for the Alliance) movement that supported the candidacy of [[Fernando Lugo]], on April 20, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fernandolugo.blogspot.com/2008/07/mujeres-por-la-alianza-ratifican-apoyo.html Mujeres por la Alianza]&lt;/ref&gt;
