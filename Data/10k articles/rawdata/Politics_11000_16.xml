The '''1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference''' was the eleventh [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|Meeting]] of the [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It was held in the [[United Kingdom]] in March 1961, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]].

While Commonwealth conferences were normally held biennially, this conference was held after an interval of only a year as the May 1960 conference due to disagreement over [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] and whether the country should be removed from the Commonwealth due to its policy of racial segregation with [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya's]] Prime Minister demanding South Africa's expulsion. 

South African Prime Minister [[H.F. Verwoerd]], attended the conference to give formal notice that his country was to become a republic in May 1961 after having approved the constitutional change in an [[South African republic referendum, 1960|October 1960 referendum]]. South Africa's application was opposed by the leaders of African states under black majority rule, as well as Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Malaya's [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], and the other non-white Commonwealth countries as well as Canadian prime minister [[John Diefenbaker]] due to South Africa's policy of [[apartheid]]. Canada was the only member of the old [[white Commonwealth]] to oppose South Africa's application. The "Keep South Africa In" group included Britain's [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]'s [[Roy Welensky]], Australia's [[Robert Menzies]] and [[Keith Holyoake]] of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news |last=Roth |first=Edwin |title=The Commonwealth Convenes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GStgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aW8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5027,865912&amp;dq=commonwealth+conference&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The StarPhoenix|Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]] |date=6 March 1961 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian prime minister [[John Diefenbaker]] proposed that South Africa only be re-admitted if it joined other states in condemning apartheid in principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/john-diefenbaker-staring-down-south-africa John Diefenbaker: Staring down South Africa], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC Archives]], March 17, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Once it became clear that South Africa's membership would be rejected, Verwoerd withdrew his country's application and left the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/south-africa-withdraws-commonwealth |title=South Africa withdraws from the Commonwealth |work=South African History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns were also expressed about Britain's prospective membership in the [[Common Market]] and the possible impact on trade relations between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; The Commonwealth also expressed its support for worldwide disarmament "subject to effective inspection and control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Commonwealth at the Summit: Communiqués of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, 1944–1986|year=1987|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |location=London |page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vciLoneE8GYC&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=commonwealth%20conference%201946%20prime%20ministers&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=commonwealth%20conference%201946%20prime%20ministers&amp;f=false |isbn=0-85092-317-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Cyprus]]' application to join the Commonwealth, following its independence the previous year, was approved over the opposition of the United Kingdom which objected as Cyprus had not applied for membership prior to independence as had been customary. Cyprus' President, Archbishop [[Makarios III]], joined the conference once the decision on his country's membership was made. The membership application of [[Sierra Leone]] was also accepted and became effective upon its independence on 27 April. 

This was the first Commonwealth conference in which one of the heads of government was a woman, [[Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike]], who was also the first female prime minister in the world.

The '''1970s energy crisis''' was a period when the major industrial countries of the world, particularly the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, faced substantial [[petroleum]] shortages, real and perceived, as well as elevated prices. The two worst crises of this period were the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]], when the [[Yom Kippur War]] and the [[Iranian Revolution]] triggered interruptions in Middle Eastern oil exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil Squeeze |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |journal=Time |date=1979-02-05 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307085655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C946222%2C00.html |archivedate=7 March 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis began to unfold as petroleum production in the United States and some other parts of the world peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite conference

The major industrial centers of the world were forced to contend with escalating issues related to petroleum supply. Western countries relied on the resources of potentially unfriendly countries in the Middle East and other parts of the world.

The crisis led to stagnant economic growth in many countries as oil prices surged. Although there were genuine concerns with supply, part of the run-up in prices resulted from the perception of a crisis. The combination of stagnant growth and price inflation during this era led to the coinage of the term ''[[stagflation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Macroeconomics: Canadian Edition Updated | page=270 |author1=Mankiw, N. Gregory |author2=Scarth William M. | publisher=Worth Publishers | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7167-5928-7 | year=2003 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yi2gZl4hWgC| accessdate= 13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, both the recessions of the 1970s and adjustments in local economies to become more efficient in petroleum usage, controlled demand sufficiently for petroleum prices worldwide to return to more sustainable levels.

The period was not uniformly negative for all economies. Petroleum-rich countries in the Middle East benefited from increased prices and the slowing production in other areas of the world. Some other countries, such as Norway, Mexico, and Venezuela, benefited as well. In the United States, [[Texas]] and [[Alaska]], as well as some other oil-producing areas, experienced major economic booms due to soaring oil prices even as most of the rest of the nation struggled with the stagnant economy. Many of these economic gains, however, came to a halt as prices stabilized and dropped in the 1980s.

=== Production peaks around 1970 ===
{{Further|Peak oil}}
During the 1960s, petroleum production in some of the world's top producers began to peak. [[Germany]] reached its production peak in 1966, [[Venezuela]] and the United States in 1970, and [[Iran]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Petroleum Overview, 1949–2008 | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0501.xls | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | accessdate=2 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091003045505/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0501.xls| archivedate= 3 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abc.net.au/4corners/special_eds/20060710/ | title=ABC TV's Four Corners | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Company | accessdate=2 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091014133913/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/special_eds/20060710/| archivedate= 14 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]]'s conventional oil production peaked around this same time (though non-conventional production later helped revive Canadian production to some degree).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energiekrise.de/e/documents/2003/International-Summer-School-Salzburg-2002.pdf |title=Future world oil supply |page=11 |publisher=L-B-Systemtechnik |date=January 2003 |author1=Zittel, Werner |author2=Schindler, Jörg |accessdate=2 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718235517/http://www.energiekrise.de/e/documents/2003/International-Summer-School-Salzburg-2002.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide production per capita peaked soon afterward.&lt;ref name="RCDuncan2001"/&gt;

Although production in other parts of the world was increasing, the peaks in these regions began to put substantial upward pressure on world oil prices. Equally as important, control of the oil supply became an increasingly important problem as countries like West Germany and the U.S. became increasingly dependent on foreign suppliers for this key resource.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== 1973 oil crisis ===
{{Main|1973 oil crisis}}
The 1973 oil crisis is a direct consequence of the US production peak in late 1960 and the beginning of 1971 (and shortages, especially for heating oil, started from there). The "embargo" as described below is the "practical name" given to the crisis. For the main Arab producers, the "embargo" allowed them to show to "the [[Arab street]]" that they were doing something for the Palestinians. In real market terms (number of barrels) the embargo was almost a non-event, and only from a few countries, towards a few countries.&lt;ref&gt;Maugeri, Leonardo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JWmx5uKA6gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Age of Oil: The Mythology, History, and Future of the World's Most Controversial Resource]''. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that the "Embargo" was never effective from Saudi Arabia towards the US, as reported by [[James E. Akins|James Akins]] in interview at 24:10 in the documentary "la face cachée du pétrole part 2".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xj4eum_la-face-cachee-du-petrole-arte-2-2_news?search_algo=2 |title=The hidden face of oil}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James E. Akins|James Akins]], who audited US capacity for Nixon after US peak, was US ambassador in Saudi Arabia at that time.
[[Lawrence Rocks (chemist)|Lawrence Rocks]] and Richard Runyon captured the unfolding of these events at the time in The Energy Crisis book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Smith |first= William D. |date= 17 April 1973|title= Energy Crisis: Shortages Amid Plenty |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/17/archives/energy-crisis-shortages-amid-plenty-energy-crisis-paradox-of.html |newspaper= The New York Times|location= New York |access-date= 5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |last= Welles|first= Chris |date= 25 February 1973|title= The Energy Crisis |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/25/archives/the-energy-crisis-the-struggle-to-monopolize-the-worlds-energy.html|newspaper= The New York Times|location= New York|access-date= 5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In October 1973, the members of [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]] or the OAPEC (consisting of the [[Arab]] members of [[OPEC]]) proclaimed an oil [[embargo]] "in response to the U.S. decision to re-supply the Israeli military" during the [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur war]]; it lasted until March 1974.&lt;ref name=USstate2ndCrisis&gt;[https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/oil-embargo Oil Embargo, 1973–1974, at [[US State Department]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  OAPEC declared it would limit or stop [[oil]] shipments to the [[United States]] and other countries if they supported [[Israel]] in the conflict. With the US actions seen as initiating the oil embargo, the long-term possibility of embargo-related high oil prices, disrupted supply and recession, created a strong rift within [[NATO]]; both European countries and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from the US Middle East policy. Arab oil producers had also linked the end of the embargo with successful US efforts to create peace in the Middle East, which complicated the situation. To address these developments, the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] Administration began parallel negotiations with both Arab oil producers to end the embargo, and with [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and Israel to arrange an Israeli pull back from the Sinai and the Golan Heights after the fighting stopped. By January 18, 1974, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was sufficient to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974. By May, Israel agreed to withdraw from the [[Golan Heights]].&lt;ref name=USstate2ndCrisis /&gt;

Independently, the OPEC members agreed to use their leverage over the world price-setting mechanism for [[Petroleum|oil]] to stabilize their real incomes by raising world oil prices. This action followed several years of steep income declines after the recent failure of negotiations with the major Western oil companies earlier in the month.

For the most part, industrialized economies relied on crude oil,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and OPEC was their major supplier.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Because of the dramatic inflation experienced during this period, a popular economic theory has been that these price increases were to blame, as being suppressive of economic activity. However, the causality stated by this theory is often questioned.&lt;ref name=Barsky&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barsky |first=Robert B. |first2=Lutz |last2=Kilian |title=Oil and the Macroeconomy since the 1970s |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=2004 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=115–134 |doi=10.1257/0895330042632708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The targeted countries responded with a wide variety of new, and mostly permanent, initiatives to contain their further dependency. The 1973 "oil price shock", along with the [[1973–1974 stock market crash]], have been regarded as the first event since the [[Great Depression]] to have a persistent economic effect.&lt;ref name=Perron1988&gt;{{Citation|author1=Perron, P. |author2=University, Princeton |author3=Program, Econometric Research |year=1988 |title=The Great Crash, the Oil Price Shock and the Unit Root Hypothesis |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~erp/ERParchives/archivepdfs/M338.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Econometric Research Program, Princeton University |location=Princeton, NJ |accessdate=15 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015154333/http://www.princeton.edu/~erp/ERParchives/archivepdfs/M338.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crisis emerged in the [[United States]] in 1979 during the wake of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Amid massive protests, the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], fled his country in early 1979, allowing the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] to gain control. The protests shattered the Iranian oil sector. While the new regime resumed oil exports, it was inconsistent and at a lower volume, forcing prices to go up. [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[OPEC]] nations, under the presidency of [[Dr. Mana Alotaiba]] increased production to offset the decline, and the overall loss in production was about 4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil Squeeze |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |work=Time |date=1979-02-05 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201015034/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C946222%2C00.html |archivedate=1 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a widespread panic resulted, driving the price far higher than would be expected under normal circumstances.

In 1980, following the [[Iran–Iraq War#September 1980: Iraqi invasion|Iraqi invasion of Iran]], oil production in Iran nearly stopped, and Iraq's oil production was severely cut as well.

After 1980, oil prices began a decline as other countries began to fill the production shortfalls from Iran and Iraq.

=== 1980s oil glut ===
{{Main|1980s oil glut}}

The [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] had caused petroleum prices to peak in 1980 at over [[United States dollar|US$]]35 per barrel (US${{inflation|US|35|1980}} in today's dollars). Following these events slowing industrial economies and stabilization of supply and demand caused prices to begin falling in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Oil Prices Pass Record Set in ’80s, but Then Recede | date=2008-03-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/worldbusiness/03cnd-oil.html?hp | publisher = New York Times | first=Jad | last=Mouawad | accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries (due to the 1973 and 1979 energy crises) and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This sentiment was echoed in November 1981, when the CEO of [[Exxon Corp]] also characterized the glut as a temporary surplus, and that the word "glut" was an example of "our American penchant for exaggerated language." He wrote that the main cause of the glut was declining consumption. In the United States, Europe and Japan, oil consumption had fallen 13% from 1979 to 1981, due to "in part, in reaction to the very large increases in oil prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporters," continuing a trend begun during the 1973 price increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After 1980, reduced demand and overproduction produced a glut on the world market, causing a six-year-long decline in oil prices culminating with a 46 percent price drop in 1986.

===Recession===
{{Main|1973–75 recession}}
[[File:1973-75 recession.jpg|right|In the parlance of [[recession shapes]], the Recession of 1973–75 in the United States could be considered a [[U-shaped recession]], because of its prolonged period of weak growth and contraction.&lt;ref name=TBM&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/oexplainer/2009/01/12/recession-was-brought-you-letters-u-v-and-l | title = This Recession Was Brought to You by the Letters U, V and L | author = Martha C.

The decade of the 1970s was a period of limited economic growth due in part to the energy crises of that decade. Although the mid decade was the worst period for the United States the economy was generally weak until the 1980s. The period marked the end of the general [[post-World War II economic boom]]. It differed from many previous recessions as being a [[stagflation]], where high [[unemployment]] coincided with high [[inflation]].

Other causes that contributed to the recession included the [[Vietnam War]], which turned out costly for the [[United States of America]] and the fall of the [[Bretton Woods system]]. The emergence of [[newly industrialized countries]] rose competition in the metal industry, triggering a [[steel crisis]], where industrial core areas in North America and Europe were forced to re-structure. The [[1973–1974 stock market crash]] made the recession evident.

According to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the recession in the United States lasted from November 1973 to March 1975.&lt;ref name=NBER&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-01 |url=http://www.nber.org/cycles.html/ |title=NBER Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=NBER |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QOwh5ffT?url=http://www.nber.org/cycles.html/ |archivedate=2007-07-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the economy was expanding from 1975 to the [[Early 1980s recession|first recession of the early 1980s]], which began in January 1980, inflation remained extremely high for the rest of the decade.

During this recession, the [[Gross Domestic Product]] of the United States fell 3.2 percent. Although the recession ended in March 1975, the unemployment rate did not peak for several months. In May 1975, the rate reached its height for the cycle of 9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/cps/ Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. Retrieved on September 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  (Only two cycles have higher peaks than this, the current cycle, where the unemployment rate is currently 9.7% {{when|date=November 2014}} in the United States and the [[early 1980s recession]] where unemployment peaked at 10.8% in November and December 1982.)

The recession also lasted from 1973–75 in the [[United Kingdom]]. The GDP declined by 3.9%&lt;ref name="ir09feb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/inflationreport/ir09feb.pdf |title=Bank of England February 2009 Quarterly inflation report |access-date=2009-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115151118/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/inflationreport/ir09feb.pdf |archive-date=2009-11-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ONS09Feb"&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/ Office for National Statistics, IHYQ series, Gross Domestic Product: Quarter on Quarter growth: CVM SA, Seasonally adjusted, Constant 2003 prices, Updated on 23/ 1/2009, retrieved on 17 February 2009]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ElLMS7nx?url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/ |date=30 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 3.37%&lt;ref&gt;ONS GDP ABMI series&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the source. It took 14 quarters for the UK's GDP to recover to that at the start of recession.&lt;ref name="ir09feb"/&gt;

===Strategic petroleum reserves===
{{Main|Global strategic petroleum reserves}}
As a result of the 1973 crisis many nations created strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs), crude oil inventories (or stockpiles) held by the governments of particular countries or private industry, for the purpose of providing economic and national security during an energy crisis. According to the United States [[Energy Information Administration]], approximately {{convert|4.1|Goilbbl|m3}} of oil are held in strategic reserves, of which 1.4 billion is government-controlled. The remainder is held by private industry. At the moment the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is one of the largest strategic reserves, with much of the remainder held by the other 26 members of the International Energy Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fact Sheet on IEA Oil Stocks and Emergency Response Potential |publisher= International Energy Agency|date=2004-01-01 |url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2004/factsheetcover.pdf| accessdate= 7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, other non-IEA countries have begun creating their own strategic petroleum reserves, with China being the largest of these new reserves. Since current consumption levels are neighboring {{convert|0.1|Goilbbl|m3}}/day, in the case of a dramatic worldwide drop in oil field output as suggested by some peak oil analysts {{who|date=November 2014}}, the strategic petroleum reserves are unlikely to last for more than a few months.

===Middle East===
{{Further|Arab–Israeli conflict}}

Since [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel's declaration of independence]] in 1948 this state has found itself in nearly continual conflict with the [[Arab world]] and some other predominantly [[Muslim]] countries. The animosity between the Arabs and the Israelis became a global issue during the 1970s. The [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, with the supplying of Israel by its Western allies while some Arab states received [[USSR|Soviet]] supplies, made this one of the most internationally threatening confrontations of the period.

The large oil discoveries in the [[Middle East]] and southwestern Asia, and the peaking of production in some of the more industrialized areas of the world gave some Muslim countries unique leverage in the world, beginning in the 1960s. The 1973 and 1979 crises, in particular, were demonstrations of the new power that these countries had found. The United States and other countries were forced to become more involved in the conflicts between these states and Israel leading to peace initiatives such as the [[Camp David Accords]].

===OPEC===
{{Further|OPEC}}

One of the first challenges OPEC faced in the 1970s was the United States' [[Nixon Shock|unilaterally pulling out]] of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods Accord]] and taking the U.S. off the established [[Gold Exchange Standard]] in 1971. With that standard, only the value of the U.S. dollar was pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar. The change resulted in instability in world currencies and [[Depreciation (currency)|depreciation]] of the value of the [[U.S. dollar]], as well as other currencies, and decreasing real revenues for OPEC whose producers still priced oil in dollars.

OPEC was slow to adjust to the situation but finally made the decision to price oil against gold.&lt;ref name=IndepBlackGold&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hammes, David |author2=Wills, Douglas. | title=Black Gold: The End of Bretton Woods and the Oil-Price Shocks of the 1970s | work=The Independent Review | volume=v.

=== "Oil Patch" ===
The major oil-producing regions of the U.S.—Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming, and Alaska—benefited greatly from the price inflation of the 1970s as did the U.S. oil industry in general. Oil prices generally increased throughout the decade; between 1978 and 1980 the price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] crude oil increased 250 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/fyi/2005/021005fyi.html | title=U.S. Home Prices: Does Bust Always Follow Boom? | date=8 April 2005 | publisher=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation | author1=Angell, Cynthia | author2=Williams, Norman | accessdate=8 November 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430055452/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/fyi/2005/021005fyi.html | archive-date=2010-04-30 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although all states felt the effects of the stock market crash and related national economic problems, the economic benefits of increased oil revenue in the Oil Patch states generally offset much of this.

The '''American Hellenic Institute''' ('''AHI''') is a [[Greek American]] organization created in 1974 to strengthen [[Greece-United States relations|US-Greece]] and [[Cyprus-United States relations|US-Cyprus relations]], as well as relations within [[Greek American|Hellenic-American]] community.  The group has a [[lobbying]] focus, which distinguishes it from the other organizations associated with AHI.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.ahiworld.com/history.html "American Hellenic Institute"] American Hellenic Institute. 2006. Retrieved 19 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The American Hellenic Institute was created on August 1, 1974, by Eugene Rossides in response to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish occupation of Cyprus]].  The Institute argued that Turkey had violated the [[Foreign Assistance Act|US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961]] and Foreign Military Sales Act, in that Turkish forces were purportedly using American weapons.  They called upon [[Henry Kissinger]], who would be a perennial obstacle to the AHI's goals, to condemn Turkey and to deny it further sales and aid until all Turkish troops were withdrawn from the soil of Cyprus.  This petition was denied, but under continued pressure from AHI, Congress decided on an arms embargo toward Turkey.  In December 1974, an AHI-sponsored $25 million Congressional aid package to Cyprus was approved.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==Major issues of concern==
[[Image:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|Current political map of Cyprus]]
The issues outlined in the AHI policy letters sent to presidential candidates [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and [[John McCain|McCain]] were typical of policy points that AHI advocates.  First and foremost was the question of American policy on Cyprus.  The removal of all Turkish troops and the peaceful unification of the island feature prominently as goals in most Greek-American lobbying.  In the event of continued Turkish military presence on Cyprus, AHI advised the application of [[economic sanctions]] and an [[arms embargo]] against Turkey because of restriction of human rights and lack of cooperation with American aims.

[[Image:Bartolomew I.jpg|thumb|left|The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Bartholomew I]]]]The letter also called for reinforcement of maritime borders and airspace in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], which Turkey has purportedly repeatedly violated.  AHI also urges the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to negotiate in good faith with Greece to resolve the [[Macedonia naming dispute|name issue]] and find a mutually-acceptable solution to the name to be used by the Republic of Macedonia for all purposes. AHI maintains that the Republic of Macedonia should immediately cease their propaganda against Greece, propaganda which violates the U.N.-brokered Interim Accord between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, as stated in Article 7 paragraph 1 of the Accord which was signed in New York, September 13, 1995. Since antiquity the name Macedonia has referred to a geographical region and not to a nationality. Geographic Macedonia is within the borders of at least three countries. Only a small portion of geographic Macedonia lies within the Republic of Macedonia, whose population is one-third Albanian and two-thirds Slavic in origin, yet the government of the Republic of Macedonia continues to make territorial claims on parts of Greece (the largest part of geographic Macedonia lies within Greece in the Greek province of Macedonia).&lt;ref&gt;http://ahiworld.org/pdfs/Policy_Statements/2013_policy_statements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the policy letters strongly suggested the inclusion of Greece in the [[Visa Waiver Program|American visa waiver program]] and the application of American pressure to ensure protection of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] and [[Greek Orthodox]] theological centers in Turkey.&lt;ref name="Candidate Letters" /&gt;

==Changes in level of influence==
AHI reached its peak of power in the late 1970s, due to the urgency of the situation on Cyprus at the time, in accordance with the theory of [[Functionalism in international relations|functionalism]].  Additional factors in AHI's high levels of influence at the time include the demise of the divisive [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greek junta]], a "new wave" of Greek immigration to the US, and the placement of many [[List of Greek Americans|Greek-Americans in high levels]] in American politics and business.&lt;ref&gt;Kaloudis, George. "THE INFLUENCE OF THE GREEK DIASPORA ON GREECE AND THE UNITED STATES." International Journal on World Peace 25.3 p. 29-59. Sep. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization did, however, face considerable opposition from the executive branch of government, notably as represented in the person of [[Henry Kissinger]].  By the 1980s and after, AHI had declined somewhat in influence, although, as mentioned earlier, they continued to be active in the political arena.  Their relative decline can be attributed to a variety of factors, among them the fact that the Greek-American community had more issues by then to collectively tackle than that of the Cyprus conflict.&lt;ref name="Power Myth" /&gt;

The '''Christian Coalition of America''' ('''CCA'''), a [[501(c)(4)]] organization, is the successor to the original Christian Coalition created in 1989 by religious broadcaster and former presidential candidate [[Pat Robertson|Marion Gordon "Pat" Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel D. Vaughan, "The Rise and Fall of the Christian Coalition," Eugene, OR:  Wipf &amp; Stock, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[United States|US]] [[Christian]]  [[advocacy group]] includes members of various [[Christian denomination]]s, including [[Baptist]]s (50%), [[mainline Protestant]]s (25%), [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (16%), [[Pentecostal]]s (10% to 15%), among communicants of other Churches.&lt;ref name="SmidtPenning1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smidt|first1=Corwin E.|last2=Penning|first2=James M.|title=Sojourners in the Wilderness: The Christian Right in Comparative Perspective|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|language=English |isbn=9780847686452|page=49|quote=Thus far, this ecumenical appeal appears to be working.

More recently, the Christian Coalition has reported that Catholics comprise 16 percent of its total membership.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Neil J.|title=We Gather Together: The Religious Right and the Problem of Interfaith Politics|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780199908868|page=247|quote=In 1995, an internal survey of the Christian Coalition found that 16 percent of its 1.7 million members were Catholics.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Formation===
In 1988, following a well-funded but failed bid for the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidency]], Pat Robertson, a religious broadcaster and political commentator, used the remainder of his campaign resources to jump-start the formation of a voter-mobilization effort dubbed the Christian Coalition. ''Americans for Robertson'' accumulated a mailing list of several million conservative Christians interested in politics. This mailing provided the basis of the new organization.

The coalition had four original directors: Robertson; his son Gordon Robertson; Dick Weinhold, head of the [[Texas]] organization; and, [[Billy McCormack (Louisiana pastor)|Billy McCormack]], pastor of the University Worship Center in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]]. McCormack had headed the Louisiana division of ''Americans for Robertson'' in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.justicetalking.org/ShowPage.aspx?ShowID=469|title= Pulpits and Politics: The Role of Religion in Elections, September 27, 2004|publisher= justicetalking.org|accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the vice president of the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://demo.openlogicsys.com/cc/blog/we%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2ve_come_long_way_baby_race_relations |title= We've Come a Long Way, Baby, in Race Relations, March 16, 2008 |publisher= demo.openlogicsys.com |accessdate= June 6, 2012 }}{{dead link|date= November 2016 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its founding, the Christian Coalition applied to become a tax-exempt [[501(c)(3)|charitable organization]] with the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref name= reorganize&gt;{{cite news |title =  Christian Coalition, Denied Tax-Exempt Status, Will Reorganize |last1 = Edsall |first1 = Thomas B. |last2 = Rosin |first2 = Hanna |work = The Washington Post |date = June 11, 1999 |page = A4 |url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/408482611/14027E920E03F17F223/1?accountid=46320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-nine state chapters formed as independent corporations within their states, including the Christian Coalition of Texas. A handful, including the Christian Coalition of Texas, successfully obtained tax-exempt status as [[501(c)(4)|social-welfare organizations]]. After ten years, the Internal Revenue Service declined the Christian Coalition's application for charitable status because it engaged in political activities.&lt;ref name= reorganize/&gt; In response, the Christian Coalition of Texas was renamed the Christian Coalition of America, and the organization relocated in order to work nationwide.&lt;ref name= reorganize/&gt;

===Voter guides===
In 1990, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], began producing non-partisan voter guides which it distributed to conservative Christian churches. Complaints that the voter guides were partisan led to the denial by the IRS of the Christian Coalition, Inc.'s tax-exempt status in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/june99/christian11.htm |title=IRS Denies Christian Coalition Tax-Exempt Status | work=The Washington Post | date=June 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, the Coalition prevailed in its five-year defense of lawsuit brought by the Federal Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], an Emory University Ph.D. candidate, whom Robertson had met when the younger man was working as a waiter at an inaugural dinner for George H. W. Bush in January 1989, took control of day-to-day operations of the coalition in 1989 as its founding executive director. He remained in the post until August 1997 when he left to enter [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] political consulting, founding his new firm Century Strategies, based near Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Dionne, "The Religious Right Loses Its Most Skilled Tactician," ''(Norfolk) Virginian Pilot,'' 24 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political involvement===
Robertson served as the organization's president from its founding until June 1997, when President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s Cabinet Secretary [[Donald P. Hodel]] was named president of the CCA, and former U. S. Representative [[Randy Tate]] (R-WA) was named executive director.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Baker and Laurie Goodstein, "Christian Coalition Rearranges Top Posts," Washington Post, June 12, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon announcement of Hodel becoming president of the CCA, Robertson expressed a desire to serve the grassroots activists that made up the Coalition:  "...I am here. Not only because I felt God's call on me but that I knew of God's call on you."{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--needs cite because it was obviously missing a word and I had to guess what the word was. I guessed 'on' --&gt;

[[Grover Norquist]], Washington insider, president of [[Americans for Tax Reform]], and an old Reed ally, said of the appointments: "What you've got is Reagan and [[Newt Gingrich|Gingrich]]. Hodel is a Reagan Republican and Tate is a Gingrich Republican."&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Goodstein.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1997 the CCA was ranked by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine as the 7th most powerful political organization in America.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, "Washington's Power 25," ''FORTUNE,'' 8 December 1997, pp. 144-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a disagreement with Robertson, Hodel left in January 1999&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Z. Hallow, "Christian Coalition President Resigns," ''Washington Times,'' 10 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tate soon followed. Robertson took over the presidency. Later in 2001 he turned it and the chairmanship over to Roberta Combs, the group's Executive Vice President and former State Chairman of South Carolina, when he officially left the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, pp. 151 - 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, the Coalition moved from Chesapeake, Virginia, to a large office on Capitol Hill in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Combs is the current president and CEO of the Christian Coalition of America. She is a founding state director and has been the only woman on the board of directors in the history of the Christian Coalition of America. Since moving to the capital, Combs installed members of her family as high-ranking officials in the group, including her daughter Michele Ammons and son-in-law Tracy Ammons. Michele and Tracy Ammons later divorced. Combs fired her former son-in-law Tracy Ammons after her daughter received a judgement against him for alimony and child support. Combs had filed an affidavit on her behalf on Coalition letterhead.&lt;ref name=Divorce&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/02/20041202-111826-4444r/ |title=Christian Coalition fights bitter lawsuit after divorce |date=December 2, 2004 |newspaper=The Washington Times |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shrinks&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040901063_2.html |title=Christian Coalition Shrinks as Debt Grows |first1=Alan |last1=Cooperman |first2=Thomas B. |last2=Edsall |date=April 10, 2006 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, Combs down-sized the staff and moved the organization's offices from Washington, D.C., to a suburb of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The Coalition reduced its lobbyists in Washington from a dozen to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley |first=Michael |url=http://swampland.time.com/2011/03/08/social-issues-the-economy-and-weird-and-kinky-lifestyles-at-a-gop-2012-forum-in-iowa/ |title=Religion, the Economy and “Weird and Kinky” Lifestyles at a GOP 2012 Forum in Iowa &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Swampland.time.com |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian Coalition was later sued for $1,890 by Reese &amp; Sons Enterprises of Maryland, the moving company it used for transporting its goods to South Carolina, because of failure to pay the wrapping and packing fee. The Coalition lost in court in Richmond, Virginia, and finally paid the movers.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/oct/13/20051013-121940-9083r/?page=all |title=Christian Coalition falls on lean days |publisher=Washingtontimes.com |date=2005-10-13 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooperman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jan/19/20060119-105804-6857r/ |title=Christian Coalition sued for unpaid bill |publisher=Washingtontimes.com |date=2006-01-19 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reported debts have been $69,729 owed to its longtime law firm, Huff, Poole &amp; Mahoney PC of Virginia Beach, and Global Direct, a fundraising firm in Oklahoma, sued for $87,000 in expenses.&lt;ref name=Shrinks/&gt;
From the time Robertson left the group in 2001 until 2006, the Coalition's influence greatly declined. Revenue declined from a high of $26.5 million in 1996 to $1.3 million in 2004. The organization's 2004 income tax return showed the Christian Coalition to be technically bankrupt, with debts exceeding assets by more than $2 million.&lt;ref name="Cooperman"/&gt;

In 2005, the Coalition finally concluded a settlement agreement with the [[Internal Revenue Service]], ending its long-running battle with that agency regarding its [[tax exempt status]].&lt;ref name="washpost06"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooperman |first=Alan |author2=Thomas B. Edsall |title=Christian Coalition Shrinks as Debt Grows |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2006-04-10 |url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040901063.html |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the IRS has recognized the Coalition as a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization, the first time in the agency's history that it has granted a letter of exemption to a group that stated in its application that it would distribute voter guides directly in churches. The consent decree enforces limitations on the terminology that may be used in the Coalition's voter guides.&lt;ref name="washpost06"/&gt;

In late 2005, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that the Christian Coalition was unable to pay its office postage bill to [[Pitney Bowes]]. In addition, it had not paid new lawyers in Virginia Beach; the law firm sued the Coalition.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=7488 |title=FrontPage Magazine - War Blog |publisher=Archive.frontpagemag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, the Christian Coalition of Iowa renamed itself the Iowa Christian Alliance. In splitting from the national group, the Iowa Christian Alliance cited "the current problems facing the Christian Coalition of America". In August 2006, the Christian Coalition of Alabama split from the national group. It later renamed itself Christian Action Alabama.&lt;ref name="Cooperman"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040901063.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Alan | last1=Cooperman | first2=Thomas B. | last2=Edsall | title=Christian Coalition Shrinks as Debt Grows | date=April 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2007/11/a-rebuke-of-robertson-from-iowas-powerful-christian-alliance/50934/ |title=A Rebuke Of Robertson From Iowa's Powerful Christian Alliance — The Atlantic |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, the president-elect of the Christian Coalition of America resigned his post, citing a difference in philosophy over which issues the organization should embrace. Reverend [[Joel Hunter]], currently the senior pastor of the Northland Church in [[Longwood, Florida]], was to assume the presidency in January. But Hunter said the Coalition's leaders resisted his calls to expand their issue base, saying it would not expand the agenda beyond opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. Hunter also said he wanted to focus on rebuilding the Coalition's once powerful grassroots, an appeal he says board members rejected. "After initial willingness to consider these changes, the board of the CCA decided, 'that is fine, but that is not who we are,'" Hunter said. Combs continues as the Coalition's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/us/28pastor.html?ref=joelchunter | work=The New York Times | first=Neela | last=Banerjee | title=Pastor Chosen to Lead Christian Coalition Steps Down in Dispute Over Agenda | date=November 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13064">[[File:Hopelibrary.JPG|thumb|The HOPE Columbine Memorial Library at [[Columbine High School]], where most of the [[Columbine High School massacre|massacre]] took place on April 20, 1999. 13 civilians, among them 12 students and a teacher, were killed and 23 others injured by two [[perpetrator]]s named [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] who also attended the school.]]

'''Civilian casualties''' occurs in a general sense, when [[civilian]]s are killed or injured by non-civilians, mostly [[law enforcement officer]]s, [[military personnel]], or [[crime|criminals]] such as [[terrorism|terrorists]] and [[bank robbery|bank robbers]]. Under the [[law of war]], it is referred to civilians who perished or suffered wounds as a result of [[war]]time acts. In both cases, they can be associated with the outcome of any form of action regardless of whether civilians were targeted directly or not.

==Overview==
[[File:Casualties of a mass panic - Chungking, China.jpg|thumb|left|Casualties of a mass panic during a June 1941 Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; More than 5,000 civilians died during the first two days of air raids in 1939.]]
In times of armed conflict, despite numerous advancements in technology, the [[European Union]]’s [[European Security Strategy]], adopted by the [[European Council]] in Brussels in December 2003, stated that since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} However, [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) reports that civilian fatalities have climbed from 5 per cent at the turn of the century to more than 90 per cent in the wars of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns in conflict: Civilians are now the target|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/patterns.htm|website=www.unicef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generating reliable assessments of casualties of war is a notoriously complex process. Civilian casualties present particular difficulties. One problem is that the attribution of the label ‘civilian’ is contested in some cases. On the surface, the definition of a civilian, at least in the context of international armed conflicts, is relatively simple: a civilian is any person who is not a member of the armed forces and is not a combatant in situation of armed conflict. To make effective use of such statistics as there are about civilian casualties of war, it is necessary to be explicit about the criteria for inclusion. All too often, there is a lack of clarity about which of the following categories of civilian casualties are included in any given set of figures.&lt;ref name="JU"&gt;[https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/user/1044/Survival_Jun-Jul_2010_-_AR_on_lives___statistics_-_non-printable.pdf Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of War Victims Civilians?]&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. Those killed as a direct effect of war;
:2. Those injured as a direct effect of war;
:3. Those dying, whether during or after a war, from indirect effects of war such as disease, malnutrition and lawlessness, and who would not have been expected to die at such rates from such causes in the absence of the war;
:4. Victims of one-sided violence, such as when states slaughter their own citizens in connection with a war; 
:5. Victims of [[Wartime sexual violence|rape and other forms of sexual violence in connection with a war]];
:6. Those uprooted in a war – that is, [[refugees]] and [[Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs);
:7 Those who, even after a war is over, die prematurely from injuries sustained in war.

The inclusion of people in each of these categories may be defensible, but needs to be explicit. Each category presents its own methodological problems. In the case of people dying from indirect effects (category 3), much careful work is needed to distinguish between ‘expected’ and ‘excess’ levels. of mortality. In the case of victims of sexual crimes (category 5) there could be an argument for including not only direct crimes by combatants, but also 'indirect’ crimes due to general social collapse. In the case of those uprooted in war (category 6), the implication that refugees and IDPs always count as war victims is too simple. Some may be fleeing one-sided violence from a repressive state apparatus, natural calamity, or general social breakdown. Moreover, in certain episodes, such as the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War of 2001]], military campaigns have enabled large numbers of refugees to return home. Indeed, in the 1971 and 1999 wars, refugee return was a stated reason for launching hostilities. Yet this key observation finds remarkably little reflection in the literature about the casualties of contemporary war. A focus on the numbers of those uprooted in war is especially problematic as those who are trapped in conflict zones may in fact be worse off than those uprooted, but seldom feature in statistics. Figures for war deaths and for war-related migration should be presented separately, not amalgamated.&lt;ref name="JU" /&gt;

==International law==

Following the Second World War, a series of treaties governing the laws of war were adopted starting in 1949. These [[Geneva Conventions]] would come into force, in no small part, because of a general reaction against the practices of the Second World War. Although the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] attempted to erect some legal defenses for civilians in time of [[war]], the bulk of the Fourth Convention devoted to explicating civilian rights in [[occupied territories]], and no explicit attention is paid to the problems of [[bombardment]] and the hazardous effects in the [[combat|combat-zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=213 |title=Moral Principles and Nuclear Weapons |author=Douglas P. Lackey |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |date=January 1, 1984 |isbn=978-0-8476-7116-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Protocol I]] was adopted as an amendment to the Geneva Conventions, prohibiting the deliberate or indiscriminate attack of civilians and civilian objects in the war-zone and the attacking force must take precautions and steps to spare the lives of civilians and civilian objects as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 | title = Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977 | publisher = The American National Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ratified by 173 countries, the only countries that are currently not signatories to Protocol I are the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_treatySelected=D9E6B6264D7723C3C12563CD002D6CE4&amp;xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;redirect=0 | title = Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977 | publisher = International Committee of the Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rome Statute]] defines that "intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population" to be illegal, but only came into effect on July 1, 2002 and has not been [[ratified]] by every country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/romefra.htm Rome Statute]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
Many modern nations' views on the [[ethics]] of civilian casualties align with the [[Just War|Just War theory]], which advocates a system of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. An [[Casus belli|act of war]] is deemed proportional in Just War theory if the overall destruction expected from the use of force is outweighed by the projected good to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/international/justwar.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This view is a war-adapted version of [[utilitarianism]], the moral system which advocates that the morally correct action is the one that does the most good.

However, [[moral philosophers]] often contest this approach to war. Such theorists advocate [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]], which holds there are various ethical rules that are, as the name implies, absolute. One such rule is that [[non-combatants]] cannot be attacked because they are, by definition, not partaking in combat; to attack non-combatants anyway, regardless of the expected outcome, is to deny them [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Thus, by the absolutist view, only enemy [[combatants]] can be attacked. The philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] advocates this abolutist rule in his essay &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/spring06/papers/nagle_war.html|title=Nagel - War and Massacre|work=ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;''War and Massacre''.

Finally, the approach of [[pacifism]] is the belief that war of any kind is morally unjust. Pacifists sometimes extend [[humanitarian]] concern not just to enemy civilians but also to enemy combatants, especially [[conscripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanifesto.info/manifesto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220190620/http://www.themanifesto.info/manifesto.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-20|title=Manifesto against Conscription and the Military System|work=themanifesto.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refugees===
The [[laws of war]] have changed over the course of history, and international protocols like the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] explicitly provide legal protections to civilians in [[military occupation|territories occupied]] by a [[belligerent]] party during and after an international armed conflict. The 1951 [[Refugee Convention]] and the 1967 [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]] has also given protection to people who have a well founded fear of persecution.

Some researchers{{weasel words inline|date=September 2015|reason=UNDUE? ratio needed or attribution if the numbers are very small}} have included [[refugees]] and [[internally displaced persons]] in their definition of "civilian casualty".&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, C. and K.-A. Nordquist (1991). "Casualties of conflict: report for the world campaign for the protection of victims of war." Uppsala, Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbett2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Garbett|title=The Concept of the Civilian: Legal Recognition, Adjudication and the Trials of International Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cr8cBgAAQBAJ|date=9 January 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-00624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian casualty ratio==
{{main|Civilian casualty ratio}}
The civilian casualty ratio in an [[armed conflict]] is the ratio of civilian casualties to combatant casualties or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by a particular belligerent or to casualties in the conflict as a whole.

The ratio of ten civilian casualties for every combatant is a frequently-cited, but disputed figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiss.org/en/publications/survival/sections/2010-e7df/survival--global-politics-and-strategy-june-july-2010-af5f/52-3-10-roberts-5d9c Roberts, A. (2010). "Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of war victims civilians?" ''Survival'' 52(3): 115-136.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collateral damage==
{{main|Collateral damage}}
Collateral damage is defined in terms of armed conflict as unavoidable or accidental killing or injury of [[non-combatants]] or unavoidable or accidental destruction of non-combatant property caused by attacks on [[legitimate military target]]s.

A '''constitutionally limited government''' is a system of government that is bound to certain principles of action by a state [[constitution]].  This system of government is dialectically opposed to [[pragmatism]], on the basis that no state action can be made that conflicts with its constitution, regardless of the action's possible consequences.

An example of a constitutionally limited government is the United States, which is a constitutionally limited republic.&lt;ref name="Lee2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Lee|title=The Freedom Agenda: Why a Balanced Budget Amendment Is Necessary to Restore Constitutional Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4kwmC7yCEIC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=17 August 2013|date=18 July 2011|publisher=Regnery Publishing|isbn=978-1-59698-294-9|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inherent in any constitutionally limited government, is an accepted code of values, used to define its constitutional view of [[justice]], making it a ''value social system''.

'''Criticism of capitalism''' ranges from expressing disagreement with the principles of [[capitalism]] in its entirety to expressing disagreement with particular outcomes of capitalism.

Criticism of capitalism comes from various political and philosophical approaches, including [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Religion|religious]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] viewpoints. Some believe that capitalism can only be overcome through revolution, and some believe that structural change can come slowly through [[Reformism|political reforms]]. Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [[social market]] movement).

Prominent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [[Wage slavery|exploitative]], that it is [[Sustainability|unsustainable]], that it creates [[economic inequality]], that it is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of [[human rights]] and that it incentivizes [[Imperialism|imperialist]] expansion and [[Military–industrial complex|war]].

{{quote box|quote="Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone".|source=— [[John Maynard Keynes]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics'', by Eric D. Beinhocker, Harvard Business Press, 2006, {{ISBN|157851777X}}, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%|align=right}}

===Democracy and freedoms===
{{further|Free market#Criticisms}}
Economist [[Branko Horvat]] stated that "[I]t is now well known that capitalist development leads to the concentration of capital, employment and power. It is somewhat less known that it leads to the almost complete destruction of economic freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Horvat, Branko, The Political Economy of Socialism (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc.) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that capitalism leads to a significant loss of political, democratic and economic power for the [[the 99%|vast majority]] of the global human population. The reason for this is they believe capitalism creates very large concentrations of money and property in the hands of a relatively small minority of the global human population (the [[elite]] or the "[[The Power Elite|power elite]]"), leading, they say, to very large and increasing, wealth and income inequalities between the elite and the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Bakan, Joel (writer) [http://www.thecorporation.com/ The Corporation (2003)] (Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; "Corporate capitalism" and "[[inverted totalitarianism]]" are terms used by the aforementioned activists and critics of capitalism to describe a capitalist marketplace—and society—characterized by the dominance of [[hierarchical]], [[bureaucratic]], [[Big business|large corporations]], which are legally required to pursue profit without concern for social welfare. Corporate capitalism has been criticized for the amount of power and influence corporations and large business interest groups have over government policy, including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns. Many social scientists have criticized [[corporation]]s for failing to act in the interests of the people; they claim the existence of large corporations seems to circumvent the principles of democracy, which assumes equal power relations between all individuals in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abeles|first=Marc|title=Globalization, Power, and Survival: an Anthropological Perspective|pages=484–86|journal=[[Anthropological Quarterly]]|volume=79|issue=3|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[political left]], activists against corporate power and influence work towards a decreased [[income gap]] and improved [[Equity (economics)|economical equity]].

The rise of giant [[multinational corporation]]s has been a topic of concern among the aforementioned scholars, intellectuals and activists, who see the large corporation as leading to deep, structural erosion of such basic [[human rights]] and [[civil rights]] as [[Wealth inequality|equitable wealth and income distribution]], equitable democratic political and socio-economic [[The Power Elite|power representation]] and many other human rights and needs. They have pointed out that in their view large corporations create false needs in consumers and—they contend—have had a long history of interference in and distortion of the policies of [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[nation states]] through high-priced legal [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] and other [[Jack Abramoff|almost always legal]], powerful forms of [[Robert G. Kaiser|influence peddling]]. In their view, evidence supporting this belief includes invasive advertising (such as [[billboards]], television ads, [[adware]], [[Spam (electronic)|spam]], [[telemarketing]], child-targeted advertising and [[guerrilla marketing]]), massive open or secret corporate political campaign [[Campaign finance|contributions]] in so-called "democratic" elections, [[corporatocracy]], the [[Lobbying in the United States|revolving door]] between government and corporations, [[regulatory capture]], "[[too big to fail]]" (also known as "[[Griftopia|too big to jail]]"), massive taxpayer-provided corporate [[bailout]]s, [[Corporate welfare|socialism/communism for the very rich]] and brutal, vicious, [[Social Darwinism|Darwinian capitalism]] for everyone else, and—they claim—seemingly endless global news stories about [[corporate corruption]] ([[Martha Stewart]] and [[Enron]], among many{{Citation needed|reason=which?|date=April 2018}} other examples). Anti-corporate-activists express the view that large corporations [[Robert G. Kaiser|answer only]] to large shareholders, giving [[human rights]] issues, [[social justice]] issues, environmental issues and other issues of high significance to the [[the 99%|bottom 99%]] of the global human population virtually no consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abeles|first=Marc|date=2006|title=Globalization, Power, and Survival: an Anthropological Perspective|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=79|issue=3|pages=484–86|doi=10.1353/anq.2006.0030|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00125880/file/M_Abeles_2006_AQ.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/|title=The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy|publisher=Inclusivedemocracy.org|accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; American political philosopher [[Jodi Dean]] says that contemporary economic and financial calamities have dispelled the notion that capitalism is a viable economic system, adding that "the fantasy that democracy exerts a force for economic justice has dissolved as the US government funnels trillions of dollars to banks and European central banks rig national governments and cut social programs to keep themselves afloat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dean|first=Jodi|date=2012 |title=The Communist Horizon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7-dxAtB0usC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Verso]]|page=21 |isbn=978-1844679546|author-link=Jodi Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Schweickart]] wrote that in capitalist societies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Ordinary people are deemed competent enough to select their political leaders-but not their bosses. Contemporary capitalism celebrates democracy, yet denies us our democratic rights at precisely the point where they might be utilized most immediately and concretely: at the place where we spend most of the active and alert hours of our adult lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Weiss |coauthors= |title=A Comparison of Economic Democracy and Participatory Economics |date=2005-05-04 |publisher= |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/6345 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090729004839/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/6345 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-29 |work=[[ZMag]] |pages= |accessdate=2008-06-26 |language= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]], one of the founders of the United States, said "I hope we shall crush [...] in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country".&lt;ref name="virginia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/quotations/jeff5.htm|title=Home – Thomas Jefferson |publisher= UVa Research Portal at UVa Library|website=etext.virginia.edu|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 29, 1938 message to [[United States Congress|Congress]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] warned that the growth of private power could lead to [[fascism]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself.

===Exploitation of workers===
{{see also|Wage slavery}}
[[File:UsuryDurer.jpg|thumb|200px|"Of usury", from [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]; [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]])]]
Critics of capitalism view the system as inherently [[exploitation of labour|exploitative]]. In an economic sense, exploitation is often related to the [[Wage slavery|expropriation]] of labor for [[profit (economics)|profit]] and based on [[Karl Marx]]'s version of the [[labor theory of value]]. The labor theory of value was supported by classical economists like [[David Ricardo]] and [[Adam Smith]] who believed that "the value of a commodity depends on the relative quantity of labor which is necessary for its production".&lt;ref name="principlesvalue"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ricardo | first = David | title = Chapter 1: On Value – On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/ricardo/tax/ch01.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx identified the commodity as the basic unit of capitalist organization. Marx described a "common denominator" between commodities, in particular that commodities are the product of labor and are related to each other by an [[exchange value]] (i.e. [[price]]).&lt;ref name="commodities"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = Chapter 1: Commodities – Capital, Volume 1 | publisher = Penguin Classics | year = 1992 | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S1 | isbn = 978-0140445688}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using the labor theory of value, [[Marxism|Marxists]] see a connection between labor and exchange value, in that commodities are exchanged depending on the [[socially necessary labor time]] needed to produce them.&lt;ref name="valueprice"&gt;{{cite web | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = Value, Price, and Profit | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the productive forces of industrial organization, laborers are seen as creating more exchange value during the course of the working day than the cost of their survival (food, shelter, clothing and so on).&lt;ref name="wagelabour"&gt;{{cite web | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = Wage Labour and Capital | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch06.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists argue that capitalists are thus able to pay for this cost of survival while expropriating the excess labor (i.e. [[surplus value]]).&lt;ref name=valueprice/&gt;

Marxists further argue that due to [[economic inequality]], the purchase of labor cannot occur under "free" conditions. Since capitalists control the [[means of production]] (e.g. factories, businesses, machinery and so on) and workers control only their labor, the worker is naturally coerced into allowing their labor to be exploited.&lt;ref name="competition"&gt;{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = Competition – The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ch05.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that exploitation occurs even if the exploited consents, since the definition of exploitation is independent of consent. In essence, workers must allow their labor to be exploited or face starvation. Since some degree of unemployment is typical in modern economies, Marxists argue that wages are naturally driven down in free market systems. Hence, even if a worker contests their wages, capitalists are able to find someone from the [[reserve army of labor]] who is more desperate.&lt;ref name="histmaterial"&gt;{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = Historical Materialism – Socialism: Utopian and Scientific | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unions are the "traditional method" for workers to have more [[inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] in the marketplace.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The act (or threat) of [[strike action|striking]] has historically been an organized action to withhold labor from capitalists, without fear of individual retaliation.&lt;ref name="tradesoc"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kautsky | first = Karl | title = Trade Unions and Socialism | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1901/04/unions.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of capitalism, while acknowledging the necessity of trade unionism, believe that trade unions simply reform an already exploitative system, leaving the system of exploitation intact.&lt;ref name="subterranean"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Sharon | title = Subterranean Fire: A History of Working Class Radicalism in the United States | publisher = [[Haymarket Books]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1931859233 | page = 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reformrevolution"&gt;{{cite web | last = Luxembourg| first = Rosa | title = Chapter VII: Co-operatives, Unions, Democracy – Reform or Revolution | url = http://marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch07.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysander Spooner]] argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them. Indeed, large fortunes could rarely be made at all by one individual, except by his sponging capital and labour from others".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, James J. ''Men Against the State'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labor history (discipline)|Labor historian]] [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] has argued that [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]]—by [[Slavery|slaves]], [[indentured servant]]s, [[penal labor|prisoners]] and other coerced persons—is compatible with capitalist relations.&lt;ref&gt;That unfree labor is acceptable to capital was argued during the 1980s by Tom Brass. See ''Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labor'' (Cass, 1999). {{cite journal |author=Marcel van der Linden |date=Fall 2003 |title=Labour History as the History of Multitudes |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html |journal=Labour/Le Travail |volume=52 |pages=235–44 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217185826/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html |archivedate=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics such as [[Howard Gardner]] have proposed the adoption of upper limits in individual wealth as "a solution that would make the world a better place".&lt;ref name="alternet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/economy/62507/|title=When the Rich Make Too Much: Is it Time for a Maximum Wage?|publisher=alternet.org|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperialism and political oppression===
Critics of capitalism (e.g. [[John Bellamy Foster]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]]) argue that the system is responsible for not only economic exploitation, but also [[imperialism|imperialist]], [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[counter-revolutionary]] wars and repression of workers and trade unionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/100601mcchesney-foster.php |title=Capitalism, the Absurd System: A View from the United States |publisher=[[Monthly Review]] |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the start of the 20th century, [[Vladimir Lenin]] claimed that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm | title=Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism | author=Vladimir Lenin | accessdate=June 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marxists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm|title=Lenin: Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|publisher=marxists.org|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that capitalism needs imperialism in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin’s Selected Works, Progress Publishers, 1963, Moscow, Volume 1, pp. 667–766&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lenin, the export of financial capital superseded the export of commodities; banking and industrial capital merged to form large financial cartels and trusts in which production and distribution are highly centralized; and [[monopoly capitalism|monopoly capitalists]] influenced state policy to carve up the world into spheres of interest. These trends led states to defend their capitalist interests abroad through military power.

The [[military–industrial complex]], mentioned in [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s presidential farewell address, appears to play a significant role in the American capitalist system. It may be one of the driving forces of American militarism and intervention abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/10/25/doctrine-armed-exceptionalism|title=The Doctrine of Armed Exceptionalism|newspaper=Common Dreams|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inefficiency, irrationality and unpredictability===
Some opponents criticize capitalism's [[inefficiency]]. They note a shift from pre-industrial [[reuse]] and thriftiness before capitalism to a consumer-based economy that pushes "ready-made" materials.&lt;ref name="isrwaste"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Heather | title=The Conquest of Garbage |url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/garbage.shtml |website=isreview.org |publisher=International Socialist Review (1997) |accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that a [[sanitation]] industry arose under capitalism that deemed trash valueless—a significant break from the past when much "waste" was used and reused almost indefinitely.&lt;ref name=isrwaste/&gt; In the process, critics say, capitalism has created a profit driven system based on selling as many products as possible.&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hawken | first = Paul | title = Natural Capitalism | url = https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1997/03/hawken.html | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics relate the "ready-made" trend to a growing garbage problem in which 4.5&amp;nbsp;pounds of trash are generated per person each day (compared to 2.7&amp;nbsp;pounds in 1960).&lt;ref name="epawaste"&gt;{{cite web | last = U.S. EPA | title = Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Pie Chart | url = http://www.epa.gov/msw/facts-text.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] groups with an emphasis on [[Conservation movement|conservation]] include [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialists]] and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologists]].

[[Planned obsolescence]] has been criticized as a wasteful practice under capitalism. By designing products to wear out faster than need be, new consumption is generated.&lt;ref name=isrwaste/&gt; This would benefit corporations by increasing sales while at the same time generating excessive waste. A well-known example is the charge that Apple designed its [[iPod]] to fail after 18&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="ipod"&gt;{{cite news | last = Inman | first = Phillip | title = When your iPod isn't all that it's cracked up to be | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/sep/30/news.consumernews | publisher = The Guardian | accessdate = 2008-03-13 | location=London | date=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics view planned obsolescence as wasteful and an inefficient use of resources.&lt;ref name="obsolescence"&gt;{{cite web | last = McMinn | first = David | title = Planned Obsolescence: The Ultimate Economic Inefficiency | url = http://www.davidmcminn.com/ngc/pages/obsol.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors such as [[Naomi Klein]] have criticized brand-based marketing for putting more emphasis on the company's name-brand than on manufacturing products.&lt;ref name="kleininter"&gt;{{cite web | last = PBS Frontline | title = Interview with Naomi Klein | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, most notably [[Marxian economists]], argue that the system of perpetual capital accumulation leads to irrational outcomes and a mis-allocation of resources as industries and jobs are created for the sake of making money as opposed to satisfying actual demands and needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shutt|first= Harry |title= Beyond the Profits System: Possibilities for a post-capitalist era |publisher= Zed Books|date=March 2010|isbn= 978-1848134171|page =|quote=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BlEpAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Market failure====
[[Market failure]] is a term used by economists to describe the condition where the allocation of goods and services by a market is not [[Efficiency (economics)|efficient]]. [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economist]]&lt;ref name="pkarchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pkarchive.org/personal/EnronFAQ.html|title=The Unofficial Paul Krugman Web Page|publisher=pkarchive.org|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]] views this scenario in which individuals' pursuit of self-interest leads to bad results for society as a whole.&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;Krugman, Paul, Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Maynard Keynes]] preferred [[economic intervention]] by government to free markets.&lt;ref name="keynes"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Keynes | first = John Maynard | title = The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0230004764| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yVhBPgAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the lack of [[perfect information]] and [[perfect competition]] in a free market is grounds for government intervention. Others perceive certain unique problems with a free market including: [[Monopoly|monopolies]], [[monopsony|monopsonies]], [[insider trading]] and [[price gouging]].&lt;ref name="part6"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rea | first = K.J. | title = Monopoly, Imperfect Competition, and Oligopoly | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~reak/eco100/100_6.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inequality===
{{main|Economic inequality}}
[[File:Day 9 Occupy Wall Street September 25 2011 Shankbone 25.JPG|thumb|A man at the protest event [[Occupy Wall Street]]]]
Critics argue that capitalism is associated with the unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; a tendency toward market monopoly or [[oligopoly]] (and government by [[oligarchy]]); imperialism, counter-revolutionary wars and various forms of economic and cultural exploitation; [[Political repression|repression]] of workers and [[trade union]]ists and phenomena such as [[social alienation]], economic inequality, unemployment and economic instability. Critics have argued that there is an inherent tendency toward oligopolistic structures when ''[[laissez-faire]]'' is combined with capitalist [[private property]]. Capitalism is regarded by many socialists to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions and thus should be controlled through [[competition law|public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brander, James A. Government policy toward business. 4th ed. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley &amp; Sons Canada, Ltd., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Vladimir Lenin]] argued that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm |title=Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism |author=Vladimir Lenin |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Che Guevara]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The laws of capitalism, which are blind and are invisible to ordinary people, act upon the individual without he or she being aware of it. One sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon ahead. That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists who purport to draw a lesson from the example of [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]]—whether or not it is true—about the possibilities of individual success. The amount of poverty and suffering required for a [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]] to emerge, and the amount of depravity entailed in the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude, are left out of the picture, and it is not always possible for the popular forces to expose this clearly.... It is a contest among wolves. One can win only at the cost of the failure of others.&lt;ref name="Socialism and Man in Cuba"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm "Socialism and Man in Cuba"] A letter to [[Carlos Quijano]], editor of ''[[Marcha (newspaper)|Marcha]]'', a weekly newspaper published in Montevideo, Uruguay; published as "From Algiers, for Marcha: The Cuban Revolution Today" by on March 12, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A modern critic of capitalism is [[Ravi Batra]], who focuses on inequality as a source of immiserization but also of system failure. Batra popularised the concept "share of wealth held by richest 1%" as an indicator of inequality and an important determinant of depressions in his best-selling books in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/06/books/best-sellers-from-1987-s-book-crop.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Best Sellers From 1987's Book Crop |accessdate=13 October 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/358815 |title=Regular economic cycles : money, inflation, regulation and depressions, Venus Books, 1985 |author=Ravi Batra|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the shares of earnings and wealth of the households in the top 1 percent of the corresponding distributions are 21 percent (in 2006) and 37 percent (in 2009), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_589.pdf |title=Working Paper No. 589 |publisher=Levyinstitute.org |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, such as Ravi Batra, argue that the capitalist system has inherent biases favoring those who already possess greater resources. The inequality may be propagated through inheritance and economic policy. Rich people are in a position to give their children a better education and inherited wealth and that this can create or increase large differences in wealth between people who do not differ in ability or effort. One study shows that in the United States 43.35% of the people in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine "400 richest individuals" list were already rich enough at birth to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faireconomy.org/press/archive/Pre_1999/forbes_400_study.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828223407/http://www.faireconomy.org/press/archive/Pre_1999/forbes_400_study.html |date=August 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated that in the United States wealth, race and schooling are important to the inheritance of economic status, but that IQ is not a major contributor and the genetic transmission of IQ is even less important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/intergen.pdf |title=The Inheritance of Inequality |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batra has argued that the tax and benefit legislation in the United States since the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan presidency]] has contributed greatly to the inequalities and economic problems and should be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474|title="The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism", ''Foreign Affairs'', October 11, 2011 |author=Ravi Batra|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market instability===
[[File:Abandoned fast-food restaurant, North Park, San Diego, CA.JPG|thumb|200px|Business might "fail", or not sell enough to pay bills.]]
Critics of capitalism, particularly Marxists, identify market instability as a permanent feature of capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="onfreetrade"&gt;{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = On the Question of Free Trade | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1888/free-trade/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isrcrisis"&gt;{{cite web | last = Easterling | first = Earl | title = Marx's Theory of Economic Crisis | url = http://www.isreview.org/issues/32/crisis_theory.shtml | publisher = [[International Socialist Review (1997)|International Socialist Review]] | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the unplanned and explosive growth of capitalism does not occur in a smooth manner, but is interrupted by periods of overproduction in which stagnation or decline occur (i.e. [[recessions]]).&lt;ref name="communistmanifesto"&gt;{{cite web | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = The Communist Manifesto | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of Marxists, several contradictions in the capitalist [[mode of production]] are present, particularly the internal contradiction between anarchy in the sphere of capital (i.e. [[free market]]) and socialised production in the sphere of labor (i.e. [[industrialism]]).&lt;ref name="anti-duhring"&gt;{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = Part III: Socialism (Theoretical) – Anti-Duhring | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx and Engels highlighted what they saw as a uniquely capitalist juxtaposition of overabundance and poverty: "Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism. And why? Because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce".&lt;ref name=communistmanifesto/&gt;

===Property===
[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] argue that the [[free market]] is not necessarily free, but weighted towards those who already own private property.&lt;ref name=histmaterial/&gt;&lt;ref name="propertytheft"&gt;{{cite web | last = Proudhon | first = Pierre-Joseph | title = What Is Property? An Inquiry Into the Principle of Right and Government | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They view capitalist regulations, including the enforcement of [[private property]] on land and exclusive rights to natural resources, as unjustly [[Enclosure|enclosing]] upon what should be owned by all, forcing those without [[private property]] to sell their labor to capitalists and landlords in a market favorable to the latter, thus forcing workers to accept low wages in order to survive.&lt;ref name="meaningmarx"&gt;{{Cite book | last = D'Amato | first = Paul | title = The Meaning of Marxism | publisher = [[Haymarket Books]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1931859295 | page = 60| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3unyAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his criticism of capitalism, Proudhon believed that the emphasis on private property is the problem. He argued that [[property is theft]], arguing that private property leads to despotism: "Now, property necessarily engenders despotism—the government of caprice, the reign of libidinous pleasure. That is so clearly the essence of property that, to be convinced of it, one need but remember what it is, and observe what happens around him. Property is the right to use and abuse".&lt;ref name=propertytheft/&gt; Many left-wing anarchists, such as [[anarchist communist]]s, believe in replacing capitalist private property with a system where people can lay claim to things based on personal use and claim that "[private] property is the domination of an individual, or a coalition of individuals, over things; it is not the claim of any person or persons to the use of things" and "this is, usufruct, a very different matter. Property means the monopoly of wealth, the right to prevent others using it, whether the owner needs it or not".&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchist Essays'', pp. 22–23, 40. Freedom Press, London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualists]] and some anarchists support markets and private property, but not in their present form.&lt;ref name="mutualiststudy"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carson | first = Kevin | title = Studies in Mutualist Political Economy | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1419658693}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that particular aspects of modern capitalism violate the ability of individuals to trade in the absence of coercion. Mutualists support markets and private property in the product of labor, but only when these markets guarantee that workers [[worker cooperative|will realize for themselves]] the value of their labor.&lt;ref name=propertytheft/&gt;

In recent times, most economies have extended private property rights to include such things as [[patents]] and [[copyrights]]. Critics see this as coercive against those with few prior resources. They argue that such regulations discourage the sharing of ideas and encourage nonproductive [[rent seeking]] behavior, both of which enact a [[deadweight loss]] on the economy, erecting a prohibitive barrier to entry into the market.&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite web |title = An Economic Analysis of Property Law|url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html|accessdate = 2008-03-10|first = William M.|last = Landes|first2 = Richard A.|last2 = Posner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all pro-capitalists support the concept of copyrights, but those who do argue that compensation to the creator is necessary as an incentive.&lt;ref name=copyright/&gt;

===Sustainability===
{{see also|Steady-state economy #Capitalism without growth}}
One of the main modern criticisms to the [[sustainability]] of capitalism is related to the so-called commodity chains, or production/consumption chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.it-environment.org/publications/QITS%20report.pdf |title=de beste bron van informatie over it-environment.

Examples include high tech commodities produced in countries with low average wages by multinational firms and then being sold in distant high income countries; materials and resources being extracted in some countries, turned into finished products in some others and sold as commodities in further ones; and countries exchanging with each other the same kind of commodities for the sake of consumers' choice (e.g. Europe both exporting and importing cars to and from the United States). According to critics, such processes, all of which produce pollution and waste of resources, are an integral part of the functioning of capitalism (i.e. its "[[metabolism]]").&lt;ref name="unu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80841e/80841E00.htm#Contents|title=Industrial metabolism: Restructuring for sustainable development|publisher=unu.edu|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics note that the statistical methods used in calculating [[ecological footprint]] have been criticized and some find the whole concept of counting how much land is used to be flawed, arguing that there is nothing intrinsically negative about using more land to improve living standards (rejection of the [[Intrinsicism|intrinsic]] value of nature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh and Harmen Verbruggen |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/redir.pl?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinbergen.nl%2Fdiscussionpapers%2F98105.pdf;h=repec:dgr:uvatin:19980105 |title=EconPapers: Spatial Sustainability, Trade and Indicators |publisher=Econpapers.repec.org |date=1998-09-28 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html|title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W.

Many environmentalists{{who|date=October 2010}} have long argued that the real dangers are due to the world's current social institutions that claim to promote environmentally irresponsible consumption and production. Under what they call the "grow or die" imperative of capitalism, they say there is little reason to expect hazardous consumption and production practices to change in a timely manner.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} They also claim that markets and states invariably drag their feet on substantive environmental reform and are notoriously slow to adopt viable sustainable technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20031118113538865 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225001752/http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20031118113538865 |date=December 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monthlyreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/1200jbf.htm|title=Capitalism's Environmental Crisis – Is Technology the Answer? |publisher=monthlyreview.org|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], referring to the externalization of costs as the "dirty secret" of capitalism, claims that there are built-in limits to ecological reform and that the costs of doing business in the world capitalist economy are ratcheting upward because of deruralization and democratization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fbc.binghamton.edu/iwecol.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128132537/http://fbc.binghamton.edu/iwecol.htm |date=January 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of Finnish scientists hired by the UN Secretary-General to aid the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report assert that capitalism as we know it is moribund, primarily because it focuses on short term profits and fails to look after the long term needs of people and the environment which is being subjected to unsustainable exploitation. Their report goes on to link many seemingly disparate contemporary crises to this system, including environmental factors such as [[global warming]] and accelerated [[Holocene extinction|species extinctions]] and also societal factors such as rising [[economic inequality]], [[unemployment]], sluggish economic growth, rising debt levels, and impuissant governments unable to deal with these problems. The scientists say a new economic model, one which focuses on sustainability and efficiency and not profit and growth, will be needed as decades of robust economic growth driven by abundant resources and cheap energy is rapidly coming to a close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ahmed|first=Nafeez|date=August 27, 2018 |title=Scientists Warn the UN of Capitalism's Imminent Demise|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43pek3/scientists-warn-the-un-of-capitalisms-imminent-demise|work=Vice |location= |access-date=August 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Paddison |first=Laura |date=August 31, 2018 |title=We Cannot Fight Climate Change With Capitalism, Says Report|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-capitalism-economy_us_5b87bf0ce4b0cf7b00326edc|work=The Huffington Post |location= |access-date=September 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to contemporary critics{{Quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[Industrial Revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [[8-hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]] and [[shanty towns]].&lt;ref name="conditionsworking"&gt;{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].

By the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as "[[socialism of the 21st century]]".

==Criticisms of capitalism==

===Anarchist criticisms of capitalism===
[[File:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|[[Emma Goldman]] denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: "This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 "B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, this is why "[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other "resources"—that is to say its inseparability from its bearer—labour, unlike other "property," is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 "B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?" by An Anarchist FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the influential [[German people|German]] [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], [[private property]] is a "spook" which "lives by the grace of law" and "becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law". In other words, private property exists purely "through the protection of the State, through the State's grace". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that "[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour", rather it is "interest-bearing possession [...] labouring capital, therefore [...] labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the—subject labourers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin |url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |title=G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner? in An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=Infoshop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |archivedate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] sees "capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [[State capitalism]] or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State".&lt;ref&gt;"el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el
capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente...Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within anarchism there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url= http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher= [[Spunk Library]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarian socialists]] believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with [[direct democracy]], voluntary federation and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. 'Encyclopedia of Social Theory' Routledge (2006) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines while later [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American anarchist Emma Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes", she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. ''Anarchism and Other Essays''. 3rd ed. 1917. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1969., p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. ''Anarchism and Other Essays''. 3rd ed. 1917. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1969. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or "wage slavery". He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 2 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. 'A History of European Socialism' Yale University Press (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of "private property" and "[[Personal property|personal possession]]". Whereas "private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. 'Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth' The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s "big four" monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents) that have emerged under capitalism, neo-[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] economist [[Kevin Carson]] argues that the [[Sovereign state|state]] has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions, whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. The theoretical sections of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]'' are presented as an attempt to integrate [[marginalist]] critiques into the [[labor theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin A. Carson, ''[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Studies in Mutualist Political Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html |date=2010-12-21 }}'' chs. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Carson has also been highly critical of [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c4ss.org/content/521|title=Intellectual Property – A Libertarian Critique|publisher=c4ss.org|accessdate=May 23, 2009|last=Carson|first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized manufacturing and the informal and household economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c4ss.org/content/78|title=Industrial Policy: New Wine in Old Bottles|publisher=c4ss.org|accessdate=May 26, 2009|last=Carson|first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson holds that "[c]apitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [[Middle Ages]], was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [[Feudalism|feudal]] conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable".&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Carson coined the [[pejorative]] term "vulgar libertarianism", a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of [[corporate capitalism]] and [[economic inequality]]. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase "vulgar political economy", which Karl Marx described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Theories of Surplus Value, III,'' p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalism has been criticized for establishing power in the hands of a minority capitalist class that exists through the exploitation of a working class majority; for prioritizing profit over social good, natural resources and the environment; and for being an engine of inequality and economic instabilities.

===Socialist criticisms===
{{main|Socialism}}
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|The 1911 |[[Industrial Workers of the World]]'s "[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]" cartoon is an example of socialist critique of capitalism and of [[social stratification]].]]
Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement), thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |date=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Magdoff and Michael D.

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, therefore a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that making money, or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand (the production of [[use-value]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''Let's produce for use, not profit''. Retrieved August 7, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: {{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |archivedate=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental criterion for economic activity in capitalism is the accumulation of capital for reinvestment in production. This spurs the development of new, non-productive industries that do not produce use-value and only exist to keep the accumulation process afloat. An example of a non-productive industry is the [[Financialization|financial industry]], which contributes to the formation of economic bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rdwolff.com/content/economic-crisis-socialist-perspective |title=Economic Crisis from a Socialist Perspective |author= Professor Richard D.

Socialists view [[private property]] relations as limiting the potential of [[productive forces]] in the economy. According to socialists, private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Fredrich. ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''. Retrieved October 30, 2010, from Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm, "The bourgeoisie demonstrated to be a superfluous class. All its social functions are now performed by salaried employees."&lt;/ref&gt; With no need for [[capital accumulation]] and a class of owners, private property of the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] of individuals based on public or [[common ownership]] of these socialized assets.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. Chapter 1: Capitalism, The General Pattern of Capitalist Development (pp. 15–20)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"&gt;Marx and Engels Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p. 40. Capitalist property relations put a "fetter" on the productive forces.&lt;/ref&gt; Private ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to uncoordinated economic decisions that result in business fluctuations, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of [[overproduction]].&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. p. 197"&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (p. 197)&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive disparities in income distribution lead to social instability and require costly corrective measures in the form of redistributive taxation. This incurs heavy administrative costs while weakening the incentive to work, inviting dishonesty and increasing the likelihood of tax evasion (the corrective measures) while reducing the overall efficiency of the market economy.&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197–198"&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (pp. 197–98)&lt;/ref&gt; These corrective policies limit the market's incentive system by providing things such as [[minimum wage]]s, [[unemployment benefit|unemployment insurance]], taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labor, resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production. In essence, social welfare policies cripple capitalism's incentive system and are thus unsustainable in the long-run.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists, 1998. pp. 60–61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', 1998. pp. 60–61"&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists argue that the establishment of a [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] is the only way to overcome these deficiencies. Socialists and specifically [[Marxian Socialism|Marxian socialists]], argue that the inherent conflict of interests between the working class and capital prevent optimal use of available human resources and leads to contradictory interest groups (labor and business) striving to influence the state to intervene in the economy at the expense of overall economic efficiency.

Early socialists ([[utopian socialist]]s and [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]]) criticized capitalism for concentrating [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wealth]] within a small segment of society&lt;ref&gt;in Encyclopædia Britannica (2009). Retrieved October 14, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism, "Main" summary: "Socialists complain that capitalism necessarily leads to unfair and exploitative concentrations of wealth and power in the hands of the relative few who emerge victorious from free-market competition—people who then use their wealth and power to reinforce their dominance in society."&lt;/ref&gt; who do not utilize available [[technology]] and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.&lt;ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"/&gt;

====Marxian criticisms====
{{main|Marxism}}
[[Karl Marx]] saw capitalism as a historical stage, once progressive but which would eventually stagnate due to internal contradictions and would eventually be followed by socialism. Marx claimed that capitalism was nothing more than a necessary stepping stone for the progression of man, which would then face a political revolution before embracing the [[Communism|classless society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Immanuel|first=Wallerstein|title=The Rise and Future Demise of the World Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=September 1974|volume=16|issue=4|pages=387–415|url=http://bev.berkeley.edu/ipe/readings/Wallerstein.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists define [[capital (economics)|capital]] as "a social, economic relation" between people (rather than between people and things). In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers ("[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the workerforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.

Marxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, "the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems".&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments stateideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed "[[capitalist roader]]s", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these "capitalist roaders" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

{{Main article|Anarchism}}
Critics of [[anarchism]] include allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism, and vandalism towards feats of civilization.

==Allegation of utopianism==
[[Anarchism]] is evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book ''European Socialism'' argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force." He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity".&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;Landauer, Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists often counter this assertion by arguing that it is merely a misconception. Mainstream anarchism does not expect such an outcome and instead offers other, decentralized mechanisms for crime prevention and adjudication.&lt;ref name=lib2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lib1 /&gt; ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following:  "Anarchy is not a utopia [...] anarchists make no claims about human perfection [...] disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies [...] some sort of "court" system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens [...]".&lt;ref name="Anarchist FAQ, perfect people"&gt;[http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secA2.html#seca216 Anarchist FAQ, does anarchism require "perfect people" to work?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anarchist FAQ, what about crime"&gt;[http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secI5.html#seci58 Anarchist FAQ, what about crime?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] economist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of [[fascists]] and fascist sympathizers by Spanish anarchists in the [[Spanish Civil War]] was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the anarchists "ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians," alongside the [[Communist state|communists]] and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) to join the Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s book on the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the government of Spain six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan.

==Anarchism and civilization==
In his essay ''On authority'', [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that radical [[decentralization]] promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilization, citing an example of [[railway]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm Friedrich Engels, ''On Authority'' (1872)] on the Marxists' Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?}}
In the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, B., 2014. Using political ideas, Sixth edition. ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc, Hoboken, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3088">The '''David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009''' (H.R. 254) or '''David's Law''', was a bill first introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on January 7, 2009, by Rep. [[Sheila Jackson-Lee]] of [[Texas]]. It was designed to enhance Federal enforcement of laws regarding [[hate crime]]s, and to specifically make [[sexual orientation]], like race and gender, a [[protected class]]. The bill stated that existing Federal law was inadequate to address violence motivated by race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim. It called for the revision of Section 246* of title 18 of the United States Code as well as the addition of a subsection outlining the punishment for anyone found guilty of a hate crime. Statistics show that minority groups are the main victims of hate crimes. Crimes against gay men and lesbians are said, by researches in Los Angeles County, to be the most severe form of hate crimes.

== Legal Hate Crime History ==
State legislators began to introduce hate crime laws starting in the 1970s to address racism, prejudice, and discrimination that escalated into more violent crimes.  The first state law against hate crimes, titled California Section 190.2 was passed in 1978 in California. This statute's sole purpose was the enhance the penalty of crimes that were motivated by prejudice due to race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, and etc. In California, there was an increase in crimes committed against Asians based on their race, religion, and ethnicity based on a survey conducted by a spokesperson of the National LGBTQ Task Force(NGLTF). Research studies conducted by George Comstock in 1991, proved that there was a rise in hate crimes as of 1985 at the same time that policies against hate crimes were being created. In 1990, President George Bush signed the Hate Crime Statistics Act which allowed analysis of hate crimes that occur across the country. However, hate crimes are often not reported which makes it virtually impossible to gather statistics and compare these statistics with other statistics. Hate crimes and bias crimes started to receive the attention of policymakers, community activists, and social scientists after there was a rise of hate crimes across the country committed in 1985. Hate crime convictions do not occur frequently because when crimes investigations occur, motives are tough to figure out in the eyes of the law.

It is not clear how effective hate crime legislation has been because although all states record hate crime data, state legislators have different definitions of hate crimes so it is hard to compare the statistics.

The '''Department of National Defense''' ('''DND'''; [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Kagawaran ng Tanggulang Pambansa'', ''KTP'') is the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive department]] of the [[Philippine government]] responsible for guarding against external and internal threats to peace and security in the country. The Department of National Defense exercises executive supervision over the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP), the [[Office of Civil Defense (Philippines)|Office of Civil Defense]] (OCD), the [[Philippine Veterans Affairs Office]] (PVAO), the [[National Defense College of the Philippines]] (NDCP), and the [[Government Arsenal (Philippines)|Government Arsenal]] (GA). It is also responsible for disaster preparation and management in the country.

It is headed by the Secretary of National Defense, who is a member of the [[President of the Philippines|President's]] cabinet. The current Secretary of National Defense of the Philippines is [[Delfin Lorenzana]] as of 30 June 2016.

==History==
The Department of National Defense or DND was formally organised on 1 November 1939, pursuant to Executive Order № 230 of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] to implement [[Republic Act|Commonwealth Act]] № 1 or the [http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/comacts/ca_1_1935.html National Defense Act of 1935] passed by the National Assembly on 31 December 1935, and Commonwealth Act № 340 creating the department.

Throughout its existence, the Department's functions are to enforce the law and to curb criminality and to guarantee the external and internal security of the country. As such, the DND deals also with criminal elements because the Philippine Constabulary or PC, then a major branch of the Armed Forces that has responsibility in enforcing the law and maintaining peace and order was under its supervision, aside from other AFP major services ([[Army]], [[Navy]], [[Air Force]]) which are busy dealing with fighting insurgents like the Communists and Muslim secessionists.

During Martial Law, the DND became the most powerful department in the executive department under the leadership of then Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], who was
then named martial law overseer by then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], the military
commander-in-chief. But, during also Martial Law, Marcos, who assumed dictatorial
powers issued a decree creating the National Intelligence and Security Authority
or NISA, to be the country's national intelligence agency with broad powers over
intelligence and national security. In effect, NISA also served as the secret
police force of Marcos, and now became the most powerful agency, and the DND's status dwindled. The NISA was headed by General [[Fabian Ver]], Marcos' most trusted man, who was also at that time, the commander of the then Presidential
Security Command and later, was named to be the concurrent chief of staff of
the Armed Forces, thus becoming the most powerful military officer.

At the end of Marcos regime on 1986, the DND continues to exercise the powers
to deal with criminality and internal plus external defense of the country until
1991 when then President [[Corazon Aquino]] signed a law passing the functions to
enforce all criminal laws from DND to The Department of Interior and Local Government or DILG. Both departments, however, shared the responsibility of guaranteeing internal secure

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17892">'''Disequilibrium macroeconomics''' is a tradition of research centered on the role of [[Disequilibrium (economics)|disequilibrium]] in [[economics]]. This approach is also known as  '''non-Walrasian theory''', '''equilibrium with rationing''', the '''non-market clearing approach''', and '''non-tâtonnement theory'''.{{sfn|Backhouse|Boianovsky|2012|p=8}} Early work in the area was done by [[Don Patinkin]], [[Robert W. Clower]], and [[Axel Leijonhufvud]]. Their work was formalized into [[general disequilibrium models]], which were very influential in the 1970s. American economists had mostly abandoned these models by the late 1970s, but French economists continued work in the tradition and developed [[fixprice models]].

== Macroeconomic disequilibria ==
In the [[neoclassical synthesis]], equilibrium models were the rule. In these models, rigid wages modeled unemployment at equilibria. These models were challenged by [[Don Patinkin]] and later disequilibrium theorists. Patinkin argued that unemployment resulted from [[Disequilibrium (economics)|disequilibrium]].{{sfn|Beaud|Dostaler|1997|p=122}} Patinkin, [[Robert W. Clower]], and [[Axel Leijonhufvud]] focused on the role of disequilibrium.{{sfn|Beaud|Dostaler|1997|pp=121–123}} Clower and Leijonhufvud argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|2010|p=288}}

[[Robert Barro]] and [[Herschel Grossman]] formulated [[general disequilibrium]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barro | first1=Robert J.| first2= Herschel I. | last2= Grossman | year=1971 |title=A General Disequilibrium Model of Income and Employment| journal=American Economic Review | issue=1 | volume=61| pages=82–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced "false prices" resulting in disequilibrium.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=383}} Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States{{sfn|Hoover|2003|p=419}}{{sfn|Mankiw|1990}}{{sfn|Snowdon|Vane|2005|p=72}} and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market-clearing hypotheses.{{sfn|Barro|1979}} However, leading American economists continued work with disequilibrium models, for example [[Franklin M. Fisher]] at MIT, [[Richard E. Quandt]] at Princeton University, and [[John Roberts (economist)|John Roberts]] at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Fisher. ''Disequilibrium Foundations of Equilibrium Economics.'' New York: Cambridge University Press. Econometric Society Monographs. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Quandt wrote several books on disequilibrium economics:

According to Malinvaud the economy is usually in a state of either Keynesian unemployment, with excess supply of goods and labor, or classical unemployment, with excess supply of labor and excess demand for goods.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|2010|p=294}}]]
While disequilibrium economics had only a supporting role in the US, it had major role in European economics, and indeed a leading role in French-speaking Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Quandt|Rosen|1988|p=5}} wrote
{{quote|The debate between protagonists of the equilibrium paradigm and the disequilibrium paradigm has a strong ideological flavor. Proponents of one view frequently think that the alternative view is worthless or downright silly. A few years ago, one of us gave several seminars on the question of how one would test the null hypothesis that [potential data &lt;!-- Fisherian confusion, diagnosed by Peirce: a data set --&gt; is generated] from an equilibrium as opposed to a disequilibrium specification. On some occasions (mostly in the U.S.), five minutes into the seminar it would be interrupted with the remark, 'What you are trying to do is silly, because everybody knows that prices always clear markets and therefore there is nothing to test.' At other times (mostly in Europe) the interruption took the form, 'What you are trying to do is silly, because everybody knows that prices never clear markets and therefore there is nothing to test.'}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Jean-Pascal Bénassy (1975) and Yves Younès (1975) studied macroeconomic models with fixed prices. Disequilibrium economics received greater research as mass unemployment returned to Western Europe in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques H. Drèze. 1987.

''[[Macroeconomic Dynamics]]'', 9, 2005, 429–461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The rise of European unemployment prompted several books by [[Edmond Malinvaud]]:

* "Profitability and Unemployment", 1980.
* "Théorie macroéconomique", 2 volumes, 1981-2.
* "Mass Unemployment", 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Disequilibrium economics also influenced European policy discussions, particularly in France and Belgium.&lt;ref name="Omar Licandro 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drèze, Jacques H. 1994"&gt;*Drèze, Jacques H.; [[Edmond Malinvaud|Malinvaud, Edmond]]. 1994.

Jackman) Oxford University Press, 2nd ed., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; European economists such as [[Edmond Malinvaud]] and [[Jacques Drèze]] expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead of simply assuming it.{{sfn|Beaud|Dostaler|1997|p=123}}

Malinvaud used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|2010|p=293}} He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|p=293}} Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|p=293}} In Malinvaud's framework, prices are fixed and only quantities adjust.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|p=294}} Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. He pays less attention to the case of repressed inflation and considers underconsumption/unemployment a theoretical curiosity.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|p=295}} Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case is almost impossible to achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|2010|p=295}} Malinvaud's work provided different policy prescriptions depending on the state of the economy.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|p=295}} Given Keynesian unemployment, fiscal policy could shift both the labor and goods curves upwards leading to higher wages and prices. With this shift, the Walrasian equilibrium would be closer to the actual economic equilibrium. On the other hand, fiscal policy with an economy in the classical unemployment would only make matters worse. A policy leading to higher prices and lower wages would be recommended instead.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|p=296}}

"Disequilibrium [[econometrics|macroeconometrics]]" was developed by Drèze's, Henri Sneessens (1981) and Jean-Paul Lambert (1988).&lt;ref&gt;

== Disequilibrium extensions of Arrow–Debreu general equilibrium theory ==
In Belgium, [[Jacques Drèze]] defined equilibria with price rigidities and quantity constraints and studied their properties, extending the [[Arrow–Debreu model]] of [[general equilibrium theory]] in [[mathematical economics]]. Introduced in his 1975 paper, a "Drèze equilibrium" occurs when supply (demand) is constrained only when prices are downward (upward) rigid, whereas a preselected commodity (e.g. money) is never rationed. Existence is proved for arbitrary bounds on prices. A joint paper with Pierre Dehez established the existence of Drèze equilibria with no rationing of the demand side. Stanford's [[Donald John Roberts|John Roberts]] studied supply-constrained equilibria at competitive prices;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = J. | authorlink = Donald John Roberts | year = 1987 | title = An equilibrium model with involuntary unemployment at flexible, competitive prices and wages | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 856–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar results were obtained by Jean-Jacques Herings at Tilburg (1987, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;
* Herings, J. J. (1996), ''Static and Dynamic Aspects of General Disequilibrium Theory'', Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts and Hering proved the existence of a continuum of Drèze equilibria. Then Drèze (113) proved existence of equilibria with arbitrarily severe rationing of supply. Next, in a joint paper with Herings and others (132), the generic existence of a continuum of Pareto-ranked supply-constrained equilibria was established for a standard economy with some fixed prices. The multiplicity of equilibria thus formalises a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, comparable to a [[Phillips curve]]. Drèze viewed his approach to macroeconomics as examining the macroeconomic consequences of Arrow–Debreu general equilibrium theory with rationing, an approach complementing the often-announced program of providing [[microfoundations of macroeconomics|microfoundations for macroeconomics]].&lt;ref name="Omar Licandro 2005"/&gt;

==Specific economic sectors==

===Credit markets===
{{Main|Credit rationing}}

Disequilibrium credit rationing can occur for one of two reasons. In the presence of [[usury]] laws, if the equilibrium interest rate on loans is above the legally allowable rate, the market cannot clear and at the maximum allowable rate the quantity of credit demanded will exceed the quantity of credit supplied.

A more subtle source of credit rationing is that higher interest rates can increase the risk of default by the borrower, making the potential lender reluctant to lend at otherwise attractively high interest rates.

===Labour markets===
{{Main|Shortage#Labour shortage|l1=Labour shortage}}
{{Main|Unemployment}}

Labour markets are prone to particular sources of price rigidity because the item being transacted is people, and laws or social constraints designed to protect those people may hinder market adjustments. Such constraints include restrictions on who or how many people can be laid off and when (which can affect both the number of layoffs and the number of people hired by firms that are concerned by the restrictions), restrictions on the lowering of wages when a firm experiences a decline in the demand for its product, and long-term labor contracts that pre-specify wages.

===Spillovers between markets===
{{Main|Effective demand}}

Disequilibrium in one market can affect demand or supply in other markets. Specifically, if an [[economic agent]] is constrained in one market, his supply or demand in another market may be changed from its unconstrained form, termed the ''notional demand'', into a modified form known as ''effective demand''. If this occurs systematically for a large number of market participants, market outcomes in the latter market for prices and quantities transacted (themselves either equilibrium or disequilibrium outcomes) will be affected.

Examples include:

*If the supply of [[mortgage]] credit to potential homebuyers is [[rationing|rationed]], this will decrease the demand for newly built houses.
*If labourers cannot supply all the labor they wish to, they will have constrained income and their demand in the goods market will be lower.
*If employers cannot hire all the labor they wish to, they cannot produce as much output as they wish to, and supply in the market for their good will be diminished.

[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|240px|The Gerry-Mander (1812)]]
'''Elkanah Tisdale''' (1768-1835) was an American engraver, [[miniature painter]] and [[cartoonist]]. He was known for the famous cartoon "The Gerry-Mander", published in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' on 26 March 1812, which led to the coining of the term [[gerrymandering]].{{efn|Under Republican Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]] in 1812 the Massachusetts Republicans arranged for the state electoral districts to be redrawn to make it harder for the Federalist majority to win the state senatorial elections. There was a public outcry, and Gerry was voted out of office, although later he was elected Vice-President to [[James Madison]]. The cartoon shows one of the two new Essex County districts decorated to resemble a [[salamander]], with the name a pun combining the governor's name with that of the mythical beast.{{sfn|The Gerry-mander}}}}

==Biography==
Elkanah Tisdale was born in 1768{{efn|Some sources give his date of birth as 1768.{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=70}} Others gave a date of around 1771.{{sfn|Convention at Philadelphia}}{{sfn|The Gerry-mander}}}} in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]].
His father ran a wagon shop in Lebanon before moving to New York City in 1794, and Elkanah probably worked for him as a carriage painter.{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=70}}    
Tisdale was based in New York from 1794 to 1798, where he described himself as "Engraver and miniature painter".{{sfn|The Gerry-mander}}
After 1798 he called himself a miniature painter. Some sources say that he met [[Benjamin Trott]] in 1798, and the two friends left New York and stayed in Albany for a few months to avoid an epidemic of yellow fever. From that time he alternated between Connecticut and New York City.{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=70}}

In 1798 he founded the Hartford Engraving Company in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Convention at Philadelphia}}
He joined the Graphic Co. in Hartford, an association of engravers, though he designed vignettes but did not engrave them.{{sfn|The Gerry-mander}} 
He probably met and taught the future miniaturist [[Anson Dickinson]] in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=100}}
From 1813 to 1818 he worked in Boston. In 1818 he exhibited two miniatures at the New York [[American Academy of the Fine Arts]]. 
He moved to Hartford in 1818.{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=70}}
In 1920 he was designing and engraving plates for Samuel F. Goodrich in Hartford.{{sfn|The Gerry-mander}}
He returned to Lebanon around 1823.{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=70}}
His engraving of the Convention at Philadelphia appeared in an 1823 edition of A History of the United States.{{sfn|Convention at Philadelphia}} 
He died in 1835 in [[Norwich, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Barratt|Zabar|2010|p=70}}

==Work==
Some of Tisdale's earliest works were his full-page illustrations in [[John Trumbull (poet)|John Trumbull]]'s ''McFingal'', which was published in New York in 1795.
According to David McNeely Stauffer in his ''American Engravers on Copper and Steel'', "Tisdale worked in both line and stipple; but his plates possess little merit ... Tisdale was a better designer than engraver, and he claimed to be a painter in his early life, though his best work was in the line of miniature portrait painting."{{sfn|The Gerry-mander}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33351">The '''federal electoral districts''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''distritos electorales federales'') of [[Mexico]] are the 300 [[electoral district|constituencies or electoral districts]] into which [[Mexico]] is divided for the purpose of [[Elections in Mexico|federal elections]]. Each district returns one [[Deputy (legislator)|federal deputy]] (''diputado''), who sits in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Cámara de Diputados''), the lower house of the [[Congress of the Union|Federal Congress]]. An additional 200 deputies are elected by [[proportional representation]] from the five [[electoral regions of Mexico|electoral regions]].

Electoral districts are identified by [[Roman numeral]]s and by federal entity ([[States of Mexico|state]] or the [[Mexico City|Federal District]]).  The number of electoral districts was set at 300 in 1979, when the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies was increased from 196. The demarcation of the districts depends on the results of the previous electoral census, and adjustments to the 1979 districts were made in 1996 and 2005.

Irrespective of population, no state may be represented by fewer than two electoral districts. This is the case with [[Baja California Sur]] (population: 512,000), [[Campeche]] (population: 755,000) and [[Colima]] (population: 568,000), which, as a result, return more [[Senate (Mexico)|senators]] than deputies to Congress. The states with the most electoral districts are the [[state of México]] (population: 14 million), with 40, and [[Veracruz]] (population: 7.1 million), with 21. The [[Federal District (Mexico)|Federal District]], with a population of 8.8 million, has 27.

On 11 February 2005, the Federal Electoral Institute (now the [[National Electoral Institute]]) established the districts to be used in the [[Mexican presidential election, 2006|2006 general election]] and the [[Mexican congressional election, 2009|2009 mid-term election]], in accordance with the following criteria: 
*Each district to belong to only one federal entity.
*Balanced distribution of population between districts.
*Presence of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous populations]].
*Geographical continuity.
*Journey times.

Under this scheme, the current electoral districts are the following:

The numbers indicate the number of districts in each federal entity for federal elections between 2006 and 2015.

The '''Federation of American Scientists''' ('''FAS''') is a [[501(c)(3) organization]] with the stated intent of using science and scientific analysis to attempt to make the world more secure. FAS was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop the first atomic bombs.

With 100 sponsors,&lt;ref name = "autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://fas.org/about-fas/advisory-sponsor-boards/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | title = Advisory &amp; Sponsor Boards | date = 2013-03-08 |accessdate = 2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAS claims that it promotes a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology [[security policy]] problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fas.org/about/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | title = About FAS | date = 2013-03-08 | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAS projects are organized in three main programs: nuclear security, government secrecy, and [[biosecurity]].

==History==
[[File:Federation of American Scientists (logo).gif|thumb|FAS logo]]
FAS was founded as the Federation of Atomic Scientists on November 30, 1945, by a group of [[scientists]] and [[engineers]] within the Associations of Manhattan Project Scientists, [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] Scientists, and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] Scientists. Its early mission was to support the [[McMahon Act]] of 1946, educate the public, [[News media|press]], politicians, and policy-makers, and promote international transparency and [[nuclear disarmament]]. On January 6, 1946, FAS changed its name to the Federation of American Scientists, but its purpose remained the same—to agitate for the international control of [[Nuclear reaction|atomic energy]] and its devotion to peaceful uses, public promotion of science and the freedom and integrity of scientists and scientific research. For this purpose, permanent headquarters were set up in [[Washington, D.C.]], and contacts were established with the several branches of government, the [[United Nations]], professional and private organizations, and influential persons.{{Citation needed | date = September 2014}}

By 1948, the Federation had grown to twenty local associations, with 2,500 members, and had been instrumental in the passage of the [[McMahon Act]] and the [[National Science Foundation]], and had influenced the American position in the [[United Nations]] with regard to international control of atomic energy and disarmament.{{Citation needed | date = September 2014}}

In addition to influencing government policy, it undertook a program of public education on the nature and control of atomic energy through lectures, films, exhibits, and the distribution of literature, coordinating its own activities with that of member organizations through the issue of [[memorandum]], policy statements, information sheets, and newsletters.

===Mission===
The mission of FAS is to promote a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology security policy problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting transparency through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy.

==Nuclear Security Program==
Continuing the FAS tradition of international control of atomic energy and devotion to its peaceful uses, the Nuclear Security Program  pursues projects that create a more secure world. SSP includes program work that focuses on reducing the risks of further nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.

===Nuclear Information Project===
The Nuclear Information Project provides the [[general public]] and policy-makers with information and analysis on the status, number, and operation of [[nuclear weapons]], the policies that guide their potential use and nuclear arms control. The project reports on developments in the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] that are relevant to [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]]. The project puts technical information into a nonproliferation context and looks at case studies by conducting independent calculations and analyses.

==Government Secrecy==
The Government Secrecy Project works to promote public access to [[government]] information and to illuminate the apparatus of government secrecy, including [[national security classification]] and [[declassification]] policies. The project also publishes previously undisclosed or hard-to-find government documents of public policy interest, as well as resources on intelligence policy.

The project publication is Secrecy News,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/ | title = Secrecy News |publisher=Fas | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reports on new developments in government secrecy and provides public access to documentary resources on secrecy, intelligence, and national security policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://fas.org/issues/government-secrecy/ | publisher =Federation of American Scientists | title = About the Government Secrecy Project | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government Secrecy Project is directed by [[Steven Aftergood]], who is also editor and author of Secrecy News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://fas.org/expert/steven-aftergood/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | type = biography | title = Steven Aftergood | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy Programs and Projects ==

===Arms Sales Monitoring Project===
The Arms Sales Monitoring Project (ASMP) worked to increase transparency, accountability and restraint in the legal [[arms industry|arms trade]]; eradicate the illicit arms trade; and served as a repository of data on U.S. arms transfers and arms export controls.  Project work focused on the arms trade, U.S. arms export policies, and the illicit trade in [[small arms]] and light weapons through the publication of reports and articles, media outreach, and public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://fas.org/programs/ssp/asmp/ | publisher =Federation of American Scientists | title = The Arms Sales Monitoring Project | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arms Sales Monitoring Project was discontinued in 2014.

===Biosecurity Program===
The '''Biosecurity Program''' concentrates on researching and advocating policies that balance science and security without compromising [[national security]] or scientific progress. This includes preventing the misuse of research and promoting the public understanding of the real threats from [[biological]] and [[chemical weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://fas.org/programs/bio/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | title = Biological and Chemical Weapons | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virtual Biosecurity Center provides the public with a resource to find the latest updates on [[biosecurity]] policy, [[bioterrorism]] information, and [[biodefense]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.virtualbiosecuritycenter.org/ | publisher = FAS | title = Biosecurity |accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Analysis Network===
The Military Analysis Network offered information on U.S. and Foreign Weapon Systems, [[Munitions]], and [[space weapon|Weapons in Space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | title = Military Analysis Network | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Network provided resources and databases in several categories including:
*A guide to United States Munitions and Weapons Systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | title = United States Munitions and Weapon Systems | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a legacy project and information is no longer updated by FAS staff.

===Learning Technologies Program===
The '''Learning Technologies Program (LTP)''' focused on ways to use innovative technologies to improve how people teach and learn. The LTP created [[prototype]] games and learning tools and assembled collaborative projects consisting of [[NGOs]], design professionals, and community leaders to undertake innovative education initiatives at both the national and local level.

The Project worked to help create learning tools to bring about major gains in learning and training. The major project of the Program is [[Immune Attack]], a fully 3-D game in which high school students discover the inner workings of the body's circulatory and immune systems, as they pilot a tiny drone through the bloodstream to fight microscopic invaders.

Immune Attack was jointly developed by the Federation of American Scientists, the [[the University of Southern California|University of Southern California]], [[Brown University]], and Escape Hatch Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/immuneattack/ |title=Immune Attack |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immune Attack is a supplemental teaching tool, designed to be used in addition to middle school and high school biology textbooks. It introduces [[molecular biology]] and [[cellular biology]] in detail that is usually reserved for college students. However, it uses the familiar and motivational video game format to introduce the strange and new world of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/immuneattack/blog |title=Immune Attack blog |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Learning Technologies Program was discontinued in 2013.

===Earth Systems Program===
The''' Earth Systems Program (ESP)''' examined the increased stresses on the environment, including issues relating to energy, food, agriculture, water, and other [[natural resources]], and to analyze how they interact with respect to [[international security]]. ESP was created out of the idea that technology should allow people worldwide to improve their [[living standards]] and amenities through secure and [[environmentally friendly]] ways.  The program worked improve dialogue and trust between [[environmental scientist]]s, policy makers, and the public, as well as to develop science partnerships to solve critical environment and energy problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://fas.org/programs/energy/ | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | title = Earth Systems Program Overview | accessdate = 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building Technologies Project===
The FAS Building Technologies Project was initiated in 2001 to focus the efforts of scientists and engineers who specialize in building materials on a range of issues such as [[structural engineering]], [[indoor air quality]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and [[architectural design]] to create homes that are safe, affordable, and attractive to builders and owners in the United States and abroad.

The Building Technologies Program worked to advance innovation in [[building design]] and construction that can improve quality, affordability, energy efficiency and hazard protection while lowering construction and [[operating costs]]. Technical advances, including new composite materials and [[prefabricated]] components, help to meet these goals in ways that are beneficial for builders and owners.  The Building Technologies Project combined the talents of renowned architects and engineers along with the nation’s leading energy experts to embark upon housing issues in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fas.org/programs/energy/btech/ | publisher =Federation of American Scientists | title = Building Technologies Project | accessdate= 2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7080">The '''Flickskolekommittén 1866''' (Girl School Committee of 1866), was a Swedish governmental [[committee]] issued by the Swedish Parliament, the [[Riksdag]], in 1866 to examine organization of female education in Sweden and produce suggestions of reforms and recommendations on how the policy regarding education for women should be organized. This was the first governmental committee of its kind, and was to have a large impact upon the educational system in Sweden as well as the gender roles and policy regarding women's rights in general of its country.

==Background and context==
Since the introduction of a public compulsory school system for children of both sexes in 1842, education for females had been a constant question of debate for politicians as well as in intellectual circles: while the new school system allowed every male the opportunity to go from compulsory education to secondary education and finally university, the public school system were closed for females after 5th grade. Except for private teachers, only two educational institutions were open to females after puberty: the free pauper schools, which taught poor girls professions, and the [[girls' school]]s for students from the middle and upper classes. These existing girls schools were normally more or less equivalents to [[finishing school]]s, with the goal to make the student a "lady", and they were forcefully criticized for their shallow and "useless" education. In 1842, only five girls' schools offered a more serious academic education: [[Wallinska skolan]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Askersunds flickskola]] in [[Askersund]], och [[Fruntimmersföreningens flickskola]], [[Kjellbergska flickskolan]] and [[Societetsskolan]].

Since the introduction of a public compulsory school in 1842, progressive politicians had debated for the organisation of governmental secondary education of females: this would ensure a far better quality than when the secondary education were only provided by private schools, who were subjected to the views of their students conservative parents. The conservative view was that females should be educated in the home for the home; that education and knowledge could destroy the feminine qualities that differed women from men and cause women distaste for the role of wife and mother; and that the idea of equality could not interfere with the order stated by God. In parallel, the [[Population growth]] had created a large number of women who could not marry and were forced to support themselves and with few means to do so.

The reformists, who had initially motivated themselves with the idea of [[Difference feminism]], therefore started with the more efficient argument that although the first natural choice for a woman was always that of a wife and mother, not all women would be married, and those who could find no one to marry should be given the opportunity to support themselves without having to resort to the charity of relatives, criminality or prostitution. This argument was successful and caused a row of reforms in women's rights: equal inheritance rights in 1845; equal rights within trade and commerce in 1846, 1861 and 1864; the profession of teacher in the public school system in 1853; legal majority for unmarried women in 1858-63; access to the professions of [[Feldsher]], organist and dentist in 1861 and the professions of telegraph- and postal offices in 1863. These reforms were in themselves arguments for the reformists, who stated that as females now had been given more rights from the state, it was also the task of the state to give them education to handle these rights. In 1856, the novel ''[[Hertha (novel)|Hertha]]'' by [[Fredrika Bremer]] caused a debate of women's educational rights which led to the foundation of the [[female seminary]] [[Högre lärarinneseminariet]] in 1861. This pressed the matter of governmental secondary education for girls, and after a heated debate in 1865-66, the committee was issued to solve the policy of female education.

==Recommendations and results==
According to the committee, the girl schools task was a double one: to give women an education suitable for her to be a wife and mother and the complement of a man, which was a woman's first task; but also to give women an education which would make it possible for females to support themselves professionally as independent women within the educated professions which were newly opened to women, in the case they should not succeed to be marry.

The organization of girl schools recommended was in fact quite progressive, and was for the larger part equivalent to the organisation of the secondary education of males, the [[Gymnasium (school)]]: this would place the female students on the same level as the male ones who were qualified to enter university. Gymnastics, an innovative subject, were also a recommendation for health reasons. The committee recommended that girl schools should offer a six years term education, followed by voluntary two years; and that those students having completed eight years should be given some sort of exam equivalent to those given male students. The exceptions were mathematics and natural science, which were given a larger and more abstract part for males than those recommended for females: another difference were that while the German language were at the time the most important foreign language for male students, French retained that position for females. The committee also recommended that women be allowed to attend university: this would once and for all answer the questions about the scientific ability of females. The professions recommended for an educated woman were that of a medical doctor, apothecary, positions within the telegraph, postal-, custom and tax offices as well as the lower levels of the teaching professions: some of these professions had recently been opened to women.

In 1870, women were allowed to study medicine and the profession of doctor were opened to them; in 1873, women were allowed to attend university; and though no secondary education schools for girls were provided by the government, those private girl schools who met with the qualifications received governmental support from 1874.

The [[John Birch Society]] has been a prominent advocate for health freedom since at least the 1970s, and the specific term "health freedom movement" has been used in the United States since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Gallegly Is Key Foe of FDA's Vitamin Rules - Simi Valley: The GOP congressman has emerged as leader of effort to minimize new labeling requirements" Los Angeles Times, 2 January 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Doctor's supporters go to bat for him - Followers of alternative medicine organize to defend physicians they see as under attack" The Orange County Register, 7 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamins and supplements have been exempted in the US from regulations requiring evidence of safety and efficacy, largely due to the activism of health freedom advocates. The belief that supplements and vitamins can demonstrably improve health or longevity and that there are no negative consequences from their use, is not widely accepted in the medical community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsvita.htm Counseling for Vitamin Supplementation to Prevent Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease], from the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]].

==Roots and support base==
Health freedom is a libertarian position but not aligned on the left/right political axis. Libertarian [[Ron Paul]] introduced the Health Freedom Protection Act in the U.S. Congress in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=33525 Health Freedom Protection Act Introduced in US Congress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2005/cr111005.htm Free Speech and Dietary Supplements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051117180248/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2005/cr111005.htm |date=17 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent celebrity supporters of the movement include the musician Sir [[Paul McCartney]], who says that people "have a right to buy legitimate health food supplements" and that "this right is now clearly under threat,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/09/13/dp1301.xml "Health food fans plan to copy alliance march", Daily Telegraph] Published 13 September 2002.

==Legislation==

===United States===
The [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]] (DSHEA) defines supplements as foods and thus permits marketing unless the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) proves that it poses significant or unreasonable risk of harm rather than requiring the manufacturer to prove the supplement’s safety or efficacy. The Food and Drug Administration can take action only if the producers make medical claims about their products or if consumers of the products become seriously ill.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7679-2042-2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Hurley |title=Natural causes: death, lies, and politics in America's vitamin and herbal supplement industry |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7679-2042-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2002 nationwide Harris poll showed that, at that time, consumers still had widespread confusion about the differences between supplements and pharmaceuticals. Here, 59% of respondents believed that supplements had to be approved by a government agency before they could be marketed; 68% believed that supplements had to list potential side effects on their labels; and 55% believed that supplement labels could not make claims of safety without scientific evidence. All of these beliefs are incorrect as a result of provisions of the DSHEA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/drugs-supplements/dangerous-supplements-504/overview/index.htm "Dangerous Supplements: Still at Large"], from ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' magazine.

==Conspiracy theories==
Health freedom-orientated writers and campaigners tend to see restrictive legislation on supplements as being designed to [[conspiracy theory|protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; If herbal medicines and supplements are removed from sale, they argue, patients will have no alternative but to use conventional pharmaceutical medicines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-10-doctors-drugmakers_N.htm?csp=34 Medical schools, journals start to fight drug industry influence] USA today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2499259.stm "Euro MPs back herbal crackdown"].

Pharmacist and skeptical writer Scott Gavura notes that the reverse is more often true, and that "governments around the world have consistently given manufacturers the upper hand, prioritizing a company’s desire to sell a product over a consumer’s right to a marketplace with safe, effective products".&lt;ref name="Gavura"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/fixing-the-supplement-market-for-consumers/ |title=Fixing the supplement market for consumers |last=Gavura |first=Scott |website=[[Science Based Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the US [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act]] permitted existing supplements to be marketed without any evidence that they are effective or safe, and for new supplement ingredients required only that a new ingredient "should be safe".&lt;ref name="Skerrett"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fda-needs-stronger-rules-to-ensure-the-safety-of-dietary-supplements-201202024182 |title=FDA needs stronger rules to ensure the safety of dietary supplements |last=Skerrett |first=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a number of serious incidents including adulteration with synthetic drugs.&lt;ref name="Rocha"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rocha | first=Tiago | last2=Amaral | first2=Joana S. | last3=Oliveira | first3=Maria Beatriz P.P. | title=Adulteration of Dietary Supplements by the Illegal Addition of Synthetic Drugs: A Review | journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety | publisher=Wiley | volume=15 | issue=1 | date=19 October 2015 | issn=1541-4337 | doi=10.1111/1541-4337.12173 | pages=43–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Peter A |title=Assessing Supplement Safety — The FDA's Controversial Proposal |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1113325 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |publication-date=2012-02-08 |issue=366 |pages=389-391 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1113325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text specifies that "supplements should contain vitamins/provitamins and minerals whose nutritional value for human beings has been proven by scientific data and whose status as vitamins and minerals is recognised by FAO and WHO." In addition, it states that the "sources of vitamins and minerals may be either natural or synthetic" and that "their selection should be based on considerations such as safety and bioavailability."

The [[United Nations]]' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) have stated that the guidelines are a consumer protection measure "to stop consumers overdosing on vitamin and mineral food supplements." The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has said that the guidelines call "for labelling that contains information on maximum consumption levels of vitamin and mineral food supplements." The WHO has also said that the Guidelines "ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=14974&amp;Cr=codex&amp;Cr1 UN commission adopts safety guidelines for vitamin and food supplements] United Nations News Centre.

==Organizations and campaigners==
===USA and the Americas===

The [[Weston A. Price Foundation]] (WAPF), co-founded in 1999 by Sally Fallon (Morell) and [[nutritionist]] [[Mary G. Enig]] (PhD), is a U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[501(c)(3)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization active in the [[United States raw milk debate]].

The [[National Health Federation]] (NHF) is an international [[non-profit organization]] founded in January 1955, which describes its mission as protecting individuals' rights to use [[dietary supplement]]s and [[Alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] without government restriction. The NHF also opposes interventions such as [[water fluoridation]] and [[vaccine|childhood vaccines]]. The Federation has official observer status at meetings of the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, the highest international body on food standards.  Based in [[California]], the Federation's board members include [[medical doctors]], scientists, therapists and consumer advocates of [[natural health]]; and it is the only health-freedom organization with Codex credentials permitting it to participate actively at Codex Alimentarius meetings.

===Europe===

The [[Alliance for Natural Health]] (ANH) is an advocacy group founded in 2002 by Robert Verkerk and based in the [[United Kingdom]]. The ANH was initially founded to raise funds to finance a legal challenge of the EU Food Supplement Directive. The ANH lobbies against regulation of [[dietary supplement]]s and in favor of [[alternative medicine|alternative medical approaches]] such as [[homeopathy]], and also advocates a healthy diet, exercise, and other lifestyle approaches to health. Verkerk rejects scientific research showing that megadoses of vitamins lack any health benefit.

===Individual campaigners===

The health freedom movement includes proponents such as [[Gary Null]], Dr [[Joseph Mercola]] and convicted fraudster [[Kevin Trudeau]].

A staunch Republican and [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]], he was elected to the Provisional Assembly in 1848, and was elected Vice President later that year and served from 20 January 1849 to 14 January 1852, after which the post, and the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] itself, were abolished. He served in the Imperial Senate from 26 January 1852 until his death on 24 November 1858.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17567">The '''[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]''' of the United States was formed in Colorado Springs in the home of Luke Zell by a group of individuals led by [[David Nolan (Libertarian Party)|David Nolan]] on December 11, 1971, after several months of debate among members of the [[Committee to Form a Libertarian Party]], founded July 17.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Winter, [https://archive.is/20120530095126/http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/cp3/message/9701 "1971–2001: The Libertarian Party's 30th Anniversary Year: Remembering the first three decades of America's 'Party of Principle'"] LP News&lt;/ref&gt; The formation was prompted in part by [[price controls]] and the end of the [[Gold Standard]] implemented by President [[Richard Nixon]]. The Libertarian Party viewed the dominant [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] parties as having diverged from what they viewed as the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] principles of the American [[Founding Fathers]]. This group included [[John Hospers]], [[Ed Crane (political activist)|Edward Crane]], Manuel Klausner, [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Roy Childs]], [[Theodora (Tonie) Nathan]],{{Fact|date=August 2008}} and [[Jim Dean (DFA)|Jim Dean]]{{dubious|date=April 2017}}.

==Early history==
[[File:TonieNathan1993-LPConvention.jpg|thumb|150px|Tonie Nathan at the 1993 [[Libertarian National Convention]] in Salt Lake City]]
A press conference announcing the new party was held on January 31, 1972 at the party's headquarters in [[Westminster, Colorado]]. The first national convention, attracting 89 delegates from 23 states, was held that June in Denver, Colorado. According to Ron Crickenberger, former Political Director of the LP, a search of LP records showed that the LP had elected Miguel Gilson-De Lemos in a partisan local board race in New York even before the adoption of its first platform.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Several others were also elected or appointed that year. Party leaders initially doubted they would even see six people elected or appointed by 2001, so this led to early optimism among some. However, in subsequent years the number of people in office seemed to be about 1% of its donor base: approximately 30 officeholders with 3,000 donors in 1981; 100 in office and 10,000 donors in 1991; and 600 and 60,000 in 2001.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

By the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], the party had grown to over 80 members and had attained [[ballot access]] in two states. Their presidential ticket, [[John Hospers]] and [[Theodora (Tonie) Nathan]], earned between 3,000 and 4,000 votes, but received the first and only [[electoral college]] vote for a Libertarian presidential ticket, from [[Roger MacBride]] of [[Virginia]], who was pledged to [[Richard Nixon]]. His was also the first vote ever cast for a woman in the [[United States Electoral College]]. MacBride became the party's presidential nominee in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 Presidential Election]]. The 1976 election established the Libertarian Party as the #1 alternative political party in the United States, and it remains the most successful alternative political party since the end of the Second World War.

In 1978, [[Dick Randolph]] became the first Libertarian to win State-level office with his election to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Two years later, he won another term and Ken Fanning was also elected as a Libertarian to that chamber.

==Clark, Crane, Koch, and Paul==
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential contest]], the Libertarian Party gained ballot access in all 50 States, [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Guam]], the first time a [[Third party (United States)|third party]] accomplished this since the [[United States Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] in 1916 (when there were only 48 States and the District of Columbia did not get to vote for president). The ticket of [[Ed Clark]] and [[David H. Koch]] spent several million dollars on this [[political campaign]] and earned more than one percent of the [[Direct election|popular vote]] with almost one million votes.

On December 29, 1981, the first widely reported successful election in the continental United States of a Libertarian Party candidate in a partisan race occurred as Richard P. Siano, a [[Boeing 707]] pilot for [[Trans World Airlines]], running against both a Republican and a Democrat, was elected to the office of [[Kingwood Township, New Jersey|Kingwood Township]] Committeeman in western [[Hunterdon County]], [[New Jersey]]. His election resulted from the special election held on December 29, 1981 to break a tie vote in the general election between him and the Democratic candidate. He received 63% of the votes cast in the special election. He served a three-year term of office.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Another Libertarian had, in 1977, been elected to a city council position in New Jersey.

In 1983 (the LP at the time held its nominating convention the year before the election, due to the stringent requirements many States set for allowing an alternative party on their ballots), the party was divided by internal disputes; former party leaders Ed Crane and [[David H. Koch]] left, taking a number of their supporters with them.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} In 1984, the party's presidential nominee, [[David Bergland]], gained access to the ballot in 36 states and earned one-quarter of one percent of the popular vote. In 1987, Doug Anderson became the first Libertarian elected to office in a major city, elected to the Denver Election Commission (later, in 2005, Anderson was elected to the Lakewood, Colorado city council).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakewood.org/index.cfm?&amp;include=/citycouncil/councilcontact.cfm Lakewood City Council] page showing Council members. Retrieved November 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, former [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Congressman [[Ron Paul]] won the Libertarian nomination for president and was on the ballot in 46 states. Paul later successfully ran for [[United States House of Representatives]] from Texas, once again as a Republican, and held that office until 2013. He ran in the Republican primaries in 2008 and sponsored HR 1207 in the House of Representatives, a bill to audit the Federal Reserve.{{fact|date=December 2011}} His running-mate was Andre Marrou, a former member of the Alaska legislature; the ticket was thus one of the few "third-party" tickets in American history to have former office-holders in both slots.

==From Marrou to Browne==
In 1992, [[Andre Marrou]], a Libertarian elected to the [[Alaska]] [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] and Ron Paul's [[running mate]] in 1988, led the [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], with attorney [[Nancy Lord]] as his [[Vice President]]ial (VP) running mate. For the first time since the [[Ed Clark|Clark]] campaign in 1980, the Libertarian Party's presidential ticket made the ballot in all 50 states, DC, and Guam usually as independent candidates without party labelling. In 1994, radio personality [[Howard Stern]] embarked on a political campaign for [[Governor of New York]], formally announcing his candidacy under the Libertarian Party ticket. Although he legally qualified for the office and campaigned for a time after his nomination, many viewed the run for office as nothing more than a [[publicity stunt]]. He subsequently withdrew his candidacy because he did not want to comply with the financial disclosure requirements for candidates.

[[Investment adviser]] [[Harry Browne]] headed the 1996 and 2000 presidential tickets. The VP candidate in 1996 was [[South Carolina]] [[entrepreneur]] [[Jo Jorgensen]]; in 2000, [[Art Olivier]] of [[California]] was Browne's running mate. In 1996 the Party's presidential candidate again made the ballot in all 50 states, often as an independent without Libertarian labelling [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Guam]]. The party's presidential ticket again made the ballot in 49 states, DC and Guam in 2000, mostly without party labelling. Although the LP has had ballot access with party labelling in some states for an election or for a time, the LP has never had ballot access with party labelling in all fifty states.

==Election cycles in the 2000s==
In all of these cases, the party's presidential nominee drew in between one third and one half of one percent of the popular vote. In 2000, the [[Arizona]] Libertarian Party, which had been disaffiliated from the national organization in late 1999, but which controlled the Libertarian ballot line in that state, nominated science fiction author [[L. Neil Smith]] and newspaperman [[Vin Suprynowicz]], rather than Browne and Olivier, as its presidential slate. Smith and Suprynowicz polled 5,775 votes (0.38%) in Arizona.

===2004–2007===
In the 2004 election cycle, the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination race was the closest to date. Three candidates{{spaced ndash}}gun-rights activist and software engineer [[Michael Badnarik]], talk radio host [[Gary Nolan (radio host)|Gary Nolan]], and Hollywood producer [[Aaron Russo]]{{spaced ndash}}came within two percent of each other on the first two ballots at the 2004 [[Libertarian National Convention|national convention]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Badnarik was chosen as the party's presidential nominee on the third ballot after Nolan was eliminated, a comeback many saw as surprising, as Badnarik had not been viewed as a front-runner for the nomination{{spaced ndash}}many delegates were won over during the convention itself, due to Badnarik's perceived strong performance in a formal candidate debate. The Badnarik campaign secured ballot status in 48 states (plus DC and Guam) and earned 397,265 votes. Despite less name recognition and a much smaller campaign checkbook, Badnarik polled nearly as well as independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]]. The Libertarian party also garnered more votes than the Green Party that year. His running mate was Richard Campagna who secured the vice presidential nod at the party's Atlanta convention with a landslide victory.

In the November 2006 mid-term election, the median vote percentage for Libertarians who ran for US House (excluding races with only one major party nominee) was 2.04%; while the median percentage for Greens who ran for that office (again excluding races with only one major party nominee) was 1.41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballot-access.org/2006/11/19/which-minor-party-did-best-in-us-house-races/ Richard Winger article] comparing the electoral strength of minor-party candidates. &lt;/ref&gt; Over 13,400,000 votes were cast for Libertarian Party candidates in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://lp.org/archives/2006ar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States general elections, 2007|2007 general elections]], Libertarian Party candidates won 14 elective offices, including an election for mayor of [[Avis, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lp.org/ Official Website of the Libertarian National Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
Several [[United States presidential election, 2008#Libertarian Party|candidates]] sought to become the party's 2008 presidential nominee. [[Ron Paul]], who had been the party's 1988 nominee and was seeking the 2008 Presidential nomination of the Republican Party, was mentioned as a possible nominee as well, but he officially denied any intent to run under a third-party banner. On December 12, 2007, the Party adopted a resolution requesting Paul to run on the Libertarian ticket if he did not win the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallgovtimes.com/story/07dec10.libertarians.paul/index.html Libertarians want Paul back] Libertarian Party resolution as reported by SmallGovTimes.com. 12-12-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 25, 2008, [[Mike Gravel]] changed from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the Libertarian Party. On May 12, 2008, ten days before the [[2008 Libertarian National Convention]], [[Bob Barr]], a former employee for then CIA Director George W. Bush and later a Republican U.S. Congressman, announced that he would seek the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/05/12/politics/p062145D40.DTL "Barr launches Libertarian White House bid"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[2008 Libertarian National Convention]] there were eight candidates for consideration at the convention: [[Bob Barr]], [[Mike Gravel]], [[Mike Jingozian]], [[Steve Kubby]], [[George Phillies]], [[Wayne Allyn Root]], [[Mary Ruwart]], and [[Christine Smith (Libertarian)|Christine Smith]]. On May 25, after six ballots, the Libertarian Party chose Barr as their official nominee for president, and Root as his running mate.

===2009-2012, Tea Party protests===
[[File:Tea Party Protest, Hartford, Connecticut, 15 April 2009 - 031.jpg|201px|thumb|Many Libertarians credit the [[Tea Party movement]] for increasing their popularity in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|2012]] elections.|left]]
Protests caused by the [[Great Recession]] and the [[Affordable Care Act]] resulted in gains for both the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties in the [[U.S. House elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]].  Calling themselves the [[Tea Party movement]] (based on the original [[Boston Tea Party]]), [[protesters]] desired a return to the government's [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] limits, cuts in [[government spending]] and [[taxes]], a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]], and other economic policy reforms supported by the Libertarian Party.  Though the Republicans successfully absorbed many [[voters]] from these protests as well, they would later lose popularity as the Libertarians continued to benefit into the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|2012 elections]] and held on to much of the support they had lost in the mid-2000s.

===2012 Gary Johnson campaign===
[[File:GaryJohnsonLPConvention2012.jpg|thumb|175px|Gary Johnson during Presidential nomination debate at Libertarian Party convention.]]
{{main|Gary Johnson presidential campaign, 2012}}
After initially running for the Republican nomination, former [[Governor of New Mexico]] [[Gary Johnson]] announced his intention to seek that of the Libertarians. Johnson is known for his opposition to United States involvement in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan]] wars and as a fiscal conservative who supports "slashing government spending". As governor, he cut taxes fourteen times and slashed the 10% annual growth in the New Mexican budget using his gubernatorial veto. He won the nomination over Virginian [[Bill Still]] and Texan [[R. Lee Wrights]]. He came in third in the general election, receiving 1,275,821 popular votes (0.99%), the most votes of any Libertarian Party presidential candidate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== 2016 Gary Johnson campaign ===
At the [[Libertarian Party National Convention]] held in Orlando, Florida on May 26-30, 2016, former [[Governor of New Mexico]] [[Gary Johnson]] became the Libertarian Party candidate for President.  His running mate is former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[William Weld|Bill Weld]].  They were on the ballot in all 50 states including D.C.

{{Politics of Ethiopia}} {{weasel words|date=October 2017}}
According to the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s human rights report for 2004 and similar sources, the '''Ethiopian government's human rights''' "remained poor; although there were improvements, serious problems remained".{{update after|2014|8|25}} The report listed numerous cases where police and security forces are said to have harassed, illegally detained, tortured, and/or killed individuals, who were members of opposition groups or accused of being insurgents. Thousands of suspects remained in detention without charge, and lengthy pretrial detention continued to be a problem. Prison conditions were poor. The government often ignores citizens' privacy rights and laws regarding search warrants. [[Freedom House]] agrees; the site gave  Ethiopia a six out of seven, which means that it is not free. Although fewer journalists have been arrested, detained, or punished in 2004 than in previous years, the government nevertheless continues to restrict [[freedom of the press]]. The government limits [[freedom of assembly]], particularly for members of opposition groups, and security forces have used excessive force to break up demonstrations. Violence and discrimination against women continue to be problems. [[Female genital cutting|Female genital mutilation]] is widespread, although efforts to curb the practice have had some effect. The economic and sexual exploitation of children continues, as does [[human trafficking]]. [[Forced labor]], particularly among children, is a persistent problem. Low-level government interference with [[Trade unions in Ethiopia|labor union]]s continues. Although the government generally respected the [[free exercise of religion]], local authorities at times interfere with religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41603.htm 2004 County Reports on Human Rights Practices: Africa: Ethiopia], [[US State Department]], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, published 28 February 2005 (accessed 8 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to improve Ethiopia's image, they hired US agencies to improve Ethiopia's image for $2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-a-us-agency-cleaned-up-rwandas-genocide-stained-image/article2322005/page2/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=How a U.S. agency cleaned up Rwanda's genocide-stained image | date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to report of [[Amnesty International|amnesty international]] 2016/2017 prolonged protests over political, economic, social and cultural grievances were met with excessive and lethal force by police. The report added that the crackdown on the political opposition saw mass [[arbitrary arrest]]s, [[torture]] and other ill-treatment, unfair trials and violations of the rights to [[freedom of expression]] and association. On October 9th 2016, the [[Government of Ethiopia|government]] announced a [[state of emergency]], which led to further [[human rights violations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/africa/ethiopia/report-ethiopia/ ETHIOPIA 2016/2017]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, more than 20 have died in ethnic based attacks. Protestors outside the capital have been calling for the prime minister to issue a state of emergency to prevent further killings. 
== Anti-Terrorism Proclamation ==
Ethiopia’s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation was introduced in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/009/2011/en/ Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa: Ethiopia] AI 27 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The broad provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation allow the authorities to criminalize the exercise of [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/ethiopia-swedish-journalists-must-be-released-immediately-and-unconditional Ethiopia: Swedish journalists must be released immediately and unconditionally] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307154631/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/ethiopia-swedish-journalists-must-be-released-immediately-and-unconditional |date=7 March 2012 }} Amnesty International 21 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International believes that at least 108 journalists and opposition members were arrested in 2011 primarily because of their legitimate and peaceful criticism of the government. The sheer numbers involved in this wave of arrests represents the most far-reaching crackdown on freedom of expression seen in many years in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=pdf2011&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/011/2011/en/  Dismantling Dissent: Intensified crackdown on free speech in Ethiopia] 16 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 2011 to December 2011 at least 108 opposition party members and six journalists were arrested in Ethiopia for alleged involvement with various proscribed terrorist groups. The detainees had been charged with crimes under the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation and the Criminal Code. Many arrests in 2011 came in the days immediately after individuals publicly criticized the government, were involved in public calls for reform, applied for permission to hold demonstrations, or attempted to conduct investigative journalism in a region of Ethiopia to which the government severely restricts access.&lt;ref name="pdf2011"/&gt;

Amnesty International believes the individuals will not receive a fair trial and will be convicted for exercising their right to freedom of expression. Many of the detainees complained that they experienced torture and were forced to sign confessions or incriminating evidence. Almost all were denied access to lawyers and family at start of detention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/012/2011/en/ Amnesty International report on growing repression in Ethiopia] [[Amnesty International]] 15 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials have become deeply politicized owing to the interest of senior government officials including the Prime Minister who declared in the national parliament that all the defendants are guilty. The Prime Minister has publicly threatened to carry out further arrests. In the first
week of December 135 people were reported to be arrested in [[Oromia]]. Amnesty International calls on the [[United Nations]], [[European Union]], [[African Union]], and governments to: Conduct systematic monitoring of the ongoing terrorism trials and the trials of members of the [[Oromo people]] political opposition arrested during 2011 and make findings public.&lt;ref name="pdf2011"/&gt;

== Political freedom ==
Two journalists and four opposition politicians of the [[Unity for Democracy and Justice]] (UDJ) party, and the Ethiopian National Democratic party, were arrested on 14 September and on 9 September 2011. They were accused of involvement with the [[Ginbot 7]] group, a banned political party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/008/2011/en/ Amnesty action letter Ethiopia] 19 September  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elections ===
According to [[Amnesty International]] citizens were pressed to leave opposition parties in [[Ethiopian general election, 2010|May 2010 elections]]. Voters in [[Addis Ababa]] were reportedly threatened with the withdrawal of state assistance if they did not vote for the [[EPRDF]]. There was political violence: One candidate and several activists were killed. Registration as candidates was reportedly prevented by armed forces. Opposition parties said that their members were harassed, beaten and detained by the EPRDF in the build-up to the elections. Hundreds of people were allegedly arrested arbitrarily in the [[Oromia region]], often on the grounds of supporting the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF), an armed group. Detention without trial, torture and killings of Oromos were reported.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/ethiopia/report-2011 Amnesty International's 2011 Annual Report on Ethiopia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front ([[EPRDF]]) consolidated political control with 99.6 percent victory in the May 2010 parliamentary elections. According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the polls were preceded by months of intimidation of opposition party supporters. According to European election observers the election fell
short of international standards. The government had a five-year strategy to systematically close down space for political dissent and independent criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] [https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/wr2011.pdf World Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414140057/http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/wr2011.pdf |date=14 April 2015 }} page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom of the press ==
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] Article 19 of the [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] states: ''Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.''

According to [[Reporters Without Borders]] Ethiopia was  139 out of 178 in its latest worldwide index in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/report-ethiopia,16.html Ethiopia [[Reporters Without Borders]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204195134/http://en.rsf.org/report-ethiopia%2C16.html |date=4 December 2011 }} January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/ethiopia.html Ethiopia articles Reporters Without Borders]&lt;/ref&gt;

Government censorship, harassment and arrest of bloggers and journalists severely restricts freedom of the press in Ethiopia:
* in December 2009, Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson were convicted for "rendering support to terrorism" and entering the country illegally "to commit an act that is a threat to the well-being of the people of Ethiopia. Status:Pardoned&lt;ref name=hrwdecimates&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia: Terrorism Law Decimates Media|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/03/ethiopia-terrorism-law-decimates-media|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* in 2011, Hellman-Hammett Award winner Woubshet Taye Abebe was arrested. He was charged under the anti-terrorism law. Before his arrest, he was the deputy editor of the ''Awramba Times''. Status: In prison&lt;ref name=hrwdecimates /&gt;
* in 2012, Reeyot Alemu Gobebo, a journalist for Feteh, was convicted on three counts under the terrorism law and initially sentenced to 14 years in prison. This sentence was reduced to 5 years on appeal. Status: In prison.&lt;ref name=hrwdecimates /&gt; 
* in 2012 [[PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award]] recipient [[Eskinder Nega]] was arrested under terrorism charges for his reporting on the [[Arab Spring]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Eskinder Nega, Ethiopia. Status: In Prison|url=http://www.pen.org/defending-writers/eskinder-nega|accessdate=31 July 2014 |publisher=PEN America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 2014 six members of the [[Zone 9 bloggers|Zone 9 blogging collective]] were arrested under terrorism charges related to their reporting and use of online encryption tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Contextual Translation of the Charges of the Zone9 Bloggers|url=http://trialtrackerblog.org/2014/07/19/contextual-translation-of-the-charges-of-the-zone9-bloggers/|accessdate=31 July 2014 |publisher=Trial Tracker |date=19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the above individuals were held at the [[Kaliti Prison]].

== Freedom of association ==

The Charities and Societies Proclamation No. 621/2009 of Ethiopia (Civil Society Law or CSO law) was enacted on January 6, 2009. It claims to ensure "the realization of citizens’ rights to association enshrined in the constitution… as well as …to aid and facilitate the role of [[civil society]] in the overall development of the Ethiopian people", yet many feel this law has been used for the repression of Ethiopian citizens and has been an obstacle to development.{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}{{POV statement |date=August 2014}}

According to a paper by the Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University School of Law, "The CSO law is the product of the Ethiopian government’s deep suspicion of civil society" and has been frequently used to silence any organization that advocates for human rights in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/humanrights/documents/EthiopiaCSOPaper-Nov2009.pdf "Sounding the Horn: Ethiopia's Civil Society Law Threatens Human Rights Defenders"], Yalemzewd Bekele Mulat, Cherice Hopkins, and Liane
Ngin Noble, Sandra Babcock and Nicolas Martinez (eds.), Center for International Human Rights, Northwestern University School of Law, November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This law is more draconian than a similar Russian law and is most similar to a draft of a Zimbabwean NGO bill that was never signed into law. Research indicates that Ethiopia’s CSO law is among the most restrictive in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This law prohibits "foreign" NGO’s from engaging in a very wide range of activities including human rights, women’s rights, children’s rights, disability rights, citizenship rights, conflict resolution or democratic governance.  The definition of "foreign" NGO was broadened to include local NGOs that receive more than ten percent of their funding from foreign sources.  Given that most local NGO’s cannot sustain themselves without some foreign funding, this definition is broad enough to include almost all NGO’s in Ethiopia. However, the government of Ethiopia itself receives 50 to 60 percent of its national budget from foreign governments, which according to its own definition would clearly make it a foreign entity as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/development-aid-ethiopia "Development Aid to Ethiopia: Overlooking Violence, Marginalization, and Political Repression "], Oakland Institute, 17 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years Ethiopian organizations that have found themselves to be targets of harassment using the CSO Law include the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), the Ethiopian Women Lawyers’ Association (EWLA) which provided pro bono service to Ethiopian women who could not afford a lawyer.  Despite the fact that Article 31 of the Ethiopian Constitution provides that "every person has the right to freedom of association for any cause or purpose", the prohibition of NGO’s by the CSO Law has had the effect of severely restricting citizens’ right of association, as members of NGO’s can not associate freely. {{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

== Electronic communications ==
{{main article|Internet in Ethiopia}}

In 2012, Ethiopia passed a law that criminalizes providing Internet voice communication ([[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) and requiring inspection of any imported voice communications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africareview.com/Business---Finance/New-Ethiopian-law-criminalises-Skype/-/979184/1426020/-/u7t2ld/-/index.html|title=New Ethiopian law criminalises Skype, installs Internet filters|publisher=[[Nation Media Group|Africa Review]]|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it prohibits "bypasses the telecom infrastructure established by the telecom service provider", which restricts Internet access to only the [[Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation|ETC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chilot.me/2012/12/13/proclamation-no-7612012-telecom-fraud-offence-proclamation/|title=Proclamation No. 761/2012 Telecom Fraud Offence Proclamation (English translation)|publisher=Ethiopian Legal Brief|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abyssinialaw.com/uploads/761.pdf|title=Proclamation No. 761/2012 Telecom Fraud Offence Proclamation|publisher=Abyssinia Law|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Freedom House]]'s Freedom on the Net 2013 report, Ethiopia ranked 56th out of 60 countries on Internet freedom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom on the Net 2013|url=http://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013_Full%20Report_0.pdf|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|accessdate=24 August 2014|page=25|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 47th out of 53 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom on the Net 2012|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202012%20-%20Full%20Report_0.pdf|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|accessdate=24 August 2014|page=26|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2016 many Ethiopians protested against the Government after they prohibit use of social media, and banning several television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37679165|title=Seven things banned under Ethiopia's state of emergency|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, hundreds of people killed and hundreds more imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ecnmy.org/engage/ethiopia-state-emergency/|title=Ethiopia is in a state of emergency.

According to surveys in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, [[marriage by abduction]] accounts for 69% of the nation's marriages, with around 80% in the largest region, Oromiya, and as high as 92 percent in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/IndepthMain.aspx?InDepthID=28&amp;ReportID=69993 |title=Youth in Crisis: Coming of age in the 21st century |publisher=[[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] |date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205144923/http://www.irinnews.org/IndepthMain.aspx?InDepthID=28&amp;ReportID=69993 |archivedate=5 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/ethiopia/ET_real_abduction.pdf|title=UNICEF supports fight to end marriage by abduction in Ethiopia|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817054036/http://www.unicef.org/ethiopia/ET_real_abduction.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2005 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey, more than 74% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone some form of genital mutilation and cutting with more than 97% in the [[Somali region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/ethiopia_34881.html|title=Battling an ancient tradition: Female genital mutilation in Ethiopia|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of "cursed" children==
Among certain ethnic groups in Southern Ethiopia, babies and young children deemed "cursed" as [[Mingi]] are usually killed by drowning in rivers, pushing them off cliffs, or leaving them in the bush to starve or be eaten by wild animals.&lt;ref name="mingi-ethiopia"&gt;''Is the tide turning against the killing of 'cursed' infants in Ethiopia?'' http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/05/world/africa/mingi-ethiopia/index.html?hpt=hp_c2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Karo people (Ethiopia)|Karo]] officially banned Mingi in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/lale-labuko/|title=Lale Labuko|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forced relocation ==
The [[Ethiopian government]] relocated forcibly ca 70,000 [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous people]] from the [[Gambela Region]] between 2010 and January 2012 to new villages that lack adequate food, farmland, healthcare, and educational facilities. State security forces threatened, assaulted, and arbitrarily arrested villagers who resisted the transfers. From 2008 through January 2011, Ethiopia [[Lease#Land lease|leased]] out at least 3.6 million [[hectare]]s of land, an area the size of the [[Netherlands]]. An additional 2.1 million hectares of land is available through the federal government’s land bank for agricultural investment. In Gambella, 42 percent of the land is marketed for investors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/node/104348 Ethiopia: Forced Relocations Bring Hunger, Hardship] [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gambela Region]] has a population of 307,000, mainly indigenous [[Anuak people|Anuak]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]]. Its richly fertile soil has attracted foreign and domestic investors who have leased large tracts of land at favorable prices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jan/17/ethiopia-relocation-programme-report Thousands 'forcibly relocated' in Ethiopia, says HRW report] Guardian 16.1.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

In 2005, the [[Ethiopian police massacres|Ethiopian Police Massacre]] took place.  In this, it was claimed that the Ethiopian police massacred almost 200 opposition protesters, who were protesting in response to the May 2005 General Elections. During this, live gunfire from government forces was directed at protesters and bystanders.

According to a report released by [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) in June 2008, the Ethiopian army has committed widespread [[execution]]s, [[torture]] and [[rape]] in [[Ogaden]], as part of a [[counterinsurgency]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hrw.org/node/74305 | title = Ethiopia: Army Commits Executions, Torture, and Rape in Ogaden | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] | date = 2008-06-12 | accessdate= 2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] responded with a big press release stating that they performed an investigation during August and September of that year, which "found no trace of serious human rights violation let alone war crimes or crimes against humanity" during their response to the [[Abole oil field raid]], but claimed the investigation found "a mass of evidence of further systematic abuses committed by the ONLF."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.et/Press_Section/Press_Statement_26_November_2008.htm "Human Rights Watch: Flawed Methodology, Unsubstantiated Allegations"], Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (accessed 17 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. State Department]]'s annual report on human rights notes that [[Lisan Yohannes]], a "former ruling party insider", led the investigation, an appointment which "opens questions about the independence of the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/af/119001.htm "2008 Human Rights Reports: Ethiopia"], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department (accessed 8 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2009, the Ethiopian [[Federal Parliamentary Assembly|parliament]] passed the "Charities and Societies Proclamation (NGO law)", which "criminalizes most human rights work in the country" according to HRW, who added that "the law is a direct rebuke to governments that assist Ethiopia and that had expressed concerns about the law's restrictions on freedom of association and expression."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/01/08/ethiopia-new-law-ratchets-repression "Ethiopia: New Law Ratchets up Repression"], Human Rights Watch website (accessed 20 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the State of Emergency declared in 2016, there were reports of thousands of deaths of citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2017/af/276999.htm|title=Ethiopia|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After protests in Oromo, Amhara, and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's region, The Ethiopian Human Rights Council reported that there were 669 deaths on aggregate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to other NGOs and Oromo region officials, there were hundreds of deaths due to militia groups in the eastern side of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== Detention Centers ==
The Detention Centers in Ethiopia have come under scrutiny for the conditions present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The prisons are overcrowded, for example a prison in Asella has a capacity of 400 people, but there are 3000 people there. The prisoners are beaten and killed, like Ayele Beyene in Kilinto who was beaten by guards and then his wounds were ignored which eventually led to his death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once people are placed in the prison system their families have little knowledge of their whereabouts. Detainees can not have visitors some places and there is no database or organization to find the location of prisoners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In a 2017 HRCO report, the conditions of the Finote Selam Prison in Amhara, the Awash Arba Prison, and Kilinto Prison, were revealed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the Finote Selam Prison the reports indicated the detainees were beaten and tortured, and the Amahara and Oromo ethnicities were given worse treatment than other groups. Detainees were also subjected to spend time immersed in latrine pits of human feces. In the Awash Arba Prison, they were overcrowded, unfed, beaten, and forced to do manual labor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the detainees spent time outside walking barefoot and sitting in the sun for consecutive days. In Kilinto, the prisoners were forced to give confessions at the threat of physical punishment, while being mistreated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2018, under the new leadership of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the Ethiopian Government closed Jail Ogaden in the Somali Region of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/09/22/ethiopia-s-somali-region-closes-notorious-jail-ogaden/|title=Ethiopia's Somali region closes notorious 'Jail Ogaden' {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jail Ogaden was operated under the former leader of the Somali Region, Abdi Mohamoud Omar, with many of the imprisoned there without charges against them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/07/04/we-are-dead/torture-and-other-human-rights-abuses-jail-ogaden-somali-regional|title=“We are Like the Dead” {{!}} Torture and other Human Rights Abuses in Jail Ogaden, Somali Regional State, Ethiopia|date=2018-07-04|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Human Rights Watch report indicates that the prisoners were malnourished, beaten, and kept in small confines that promoted rampant disease spread.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The former head of the prison Shamaahiye Sheikh Farah was arrested in September of 2018 for his role in the prison. Shamaahiye's most infamous incident of torture was having a month of hunger, where none of the prisoners were allowed to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unpo.org/article/21125?id=21125|title=UNPO: Ogaden: Former ‘Jail Ogaden’ Prison Commissioner Arrested|website=unpo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10th 2018, The United States Congress passed Resolution 128, a bill aimed at encouraging human rights, rule of law, and democracy&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/10/us-house-resolution-ethiopia-passes|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A congregation of Ethiopian-Americans expressed concern with consistent human right violations of the Ethiopian government. The interest group of Ethiopian-Americans along with lobbyists got 114 representatives and 33 states to co-sponsor the bill&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The bill created provisions for independent examinations into the state of human rights in Ethiopia by the United Nations&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The bill is non-binding.</text>

'''Independentist Students''' ('''EI''', ''Estudantes Independentistas'' in [[Galician language]]) was a [[Galician nationalism|Galician independentist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[students' union|student union]], formed by [[university]] students.&lt;ref name="lavozdegalicia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2000/05/11/26881.shtml?idioma=galego|title=Unha manifestación de douscentos estudantes conclúe con varias desfeitas no centro histórico|author=La Voz de Galicia|publisher=Lavozdegalicia.es|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FER was founded in December 1995.&lt;ref name="estoutrasnotaspoliticas.blogspot.com.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estoutrasnotaspoliticas.blogspot.com.es/2006/12/breve-resenha-do-independentismo.html|title=ESTOUTRAS: Breve resenha do independentismo estudantil|publisher=Estoutrasnotaspoliticas.blogspot.com.es|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 EI gained several representatives in the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] Council and in the Faculty Councils.&lt;ref&gt;EI won the elections in the history and geography faculty, with 11 seats won.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the student union grew significantly, although in 1997 and early 1998, the organization stopped growing. Despite their early success in the student elections, EI always focused in the ''struggle in the street''; [[Street protest|demonstrations]] and [[Student strike|strikes]] were the main means of struggle. Between 1998 and 2000, the organization grew again, gaining presence in all the universities of [[Galiza]] and getting seats in the faculty and university councils. Between 1998 and 2000 EI also made a lot of common acts, [[Street protest|demonstrations]] and [[strike action|strikes]] with the [[Comités Abertos de Faculdade]] and the [[Movemento Estudantil Universitario]].

==U.S. Senate==

=== Elections ===
In 1994, incumbent Senator [[David L. Boren|David Boren]], who had been serving in the Senate since 1979, agreed to become president of the [[University of Oklahoma]] and announced he would resign as soon as a successor was elected. Inhofe was elected Boren's successor in an election cycle that saw the Republican Party take both houses of Congress and the Oklahoma governorship (the latter for only the third time in state history). Inhofe took office on November 16, giving him more seniority than the incoming class of senators. After serving the last two years of Boren's term, he won his first full term in 1996. He was reelected in 2002, 2008 and 2014.

;Armed Services Committee
As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Inhofe was among the panelists questioning witnesses about the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], saying he was "outraged by the outrage" over the revelations of abuse. Although he believed that the individuals responsible for mistreating prisoners should be punished, he said that the prisoners "are not there for traffic violations ... they're murderers, they're [[terrorist]]s, they're [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgents]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/11/inhofe.abuse/index.html|title=GOP senator labels abused prisoners 'terrorists' |publisher=CNN |date=May 4, 2004 |accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/11/politics/main616896.shtml |title=GOP Sen.: 'Outraged' At Outrage |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=May 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Inhofe was one of only nine senators to vote against the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]], which prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment of individuals in [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/42C21D.txt Text of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805042122/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/42C21D.txt |date=August 5, 2009 }} (Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006/Division A/Title X), SEC. 1003.

Before the Republicans regained control of the Senate in the November 2002 elections, Inhofe had compared the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to a [[Gestapo]] bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Myers|first=Jim|title=Critics point to Inhofe's record|newspaper=Tulsa World|location=Tulsa, OK|date=November 30, 2002|accessdate=January 17, 2015 |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&amp;articleid=021130_To_a1_criti&amp;archive=yes|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110505010803/http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&amp;articleid=021130_To_a1_criti&amp;archive=yes |dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mooney 16 April 2004"&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Mooney |title=Earth Last: James Inhofe proves "flat Earth" doesn't refer to Oklahoma|website=The American Prospect|date=April 16, 2004  |url=http://prospect.org/article/earth-last-0|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and EPA Administrator [[Carol Browner]] to [[Tokyo Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;"I think we have got a Tokyo Rose running the EPA." – Inhofe's remarks to the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, as reported in the Tulsa World, November 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, he became Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]], and continued challenging mainstream science in favor of what he called "sound science", in accordance with the [[Frank Luntz#Global warming|Luntz memo]].&lt;ref name="Mooney 16 April 2004" /&gt;

===Global warming a "hoax"===
Since 2003, when he was first elected Chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Inhofe has been the foremost Republican promoting arguments for [[climate change denial]] in the [[global warming controversy]]. He famously said in the Senate that global warming is a [[hoax]], and  has invited contrarians to testify in Committee hearings, and spread his views via the Committee website run by [[Marc Morano]], and through his access to conservative media.{{sfn|Kutney|2014|p=107}}&lt;ref name="OUP Dryzek"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author1=John S.

As Environment and Public Works chairman, Inhofe made a two-hour-long Senate Floor speech on July 28, 2003, in the context of discussions on the [[Climate Stewardship Acts|McCain-Lieberman Bill]].&lt;ref name="revkin August 5, 2003"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/science/politics-reasserts-itself-in-the-debate-over-climate-change-and-its-hazards.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Politics Reasserts Itself in the Debate Over Climate Change and Its Hazards|date=August 5, 2003 |publisher=New York Times|quote="In a two-hour speech on July 28 on the Senate floor, Senator James M.

He supported what he called "sound science" with citations from scientists; contrarians including [[Patrick Michaels]], [[Fred Singer]], [[Richard Lindzen]] and [[Sallie Baliunas]] as well as some mainstream scientists. Two of these, [[Tom Wigley]] and [[Stephen Schneider]], later issued statements that Inhofe had misrepresented their work.&lt;ref name="climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mooney 84–86"&gt;{{citation|author=Chris Mooney|title=The Republican War on Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jr5e7Tz5VNQC&amp;pg=PT83 |year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00386-0|pages=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, the day after his Senate speech, Inhofe chaired an Environment and Public Works hearing with contrarian views represented by Baliunas and [[David Legates]], and praised their "1,000-year climate study", then involved in the [[Soon and Baliunas controversy]], as "a powerful new work of science". Against them, [[Michael E. Mann]] defended mainstream science and specifically his work which they and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] disputed in the [[hockey stick controversy]].&lt;ref name="revkin August 5, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mooney2007"&gt;{{citation|author=Chris Mooney|title=The Republican War on Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jr5e7Tz5VNQC&amp;pg=PT86|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00386-0|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hearing Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] read out an email from [[Hans von Storch]] saying he had resigned as editor-in-chief of the journal which had published the Soon and Baliunas paper, as the peer-review had "failed to detect significant methodological flaws in the paper" and the critique published by Mann and colleagues was valid.&lt;ref name="Mooney2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mona2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monastersky|first=Richard|title=Storm Brews Over Global Warming|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=September 2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=A16|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Storm-Brews-Over-Global/27779/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a continuation of these themes, Inhofe had a 20-page brochure published under the [[Seal of the United States Senate]] reiterating his "hoax" statement, comparing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) to a "Soviet style trial", and in a section headed "The IPCC Plays Hockey" he attacked what he called "Mann's flawed, limited research."{{sfn|Kutney|2014|p=108}}&lt;ref name=". 2003"&gt;{{cite web|website=US Senate, Environment and Public Works|year=2003 |url=http://epw.senate.gov/repwhitepapers/ClimateChange.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427025748/http://epw.senate.gov/repwhitepapers/ClimateChange.pdf |archivedate=April 27, 2005 |title=The Facts and Science of Climate Change |accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brochure restated themes from Inhofe's Senate speech, and in December 2003, he distributed copies of it in [[Milan]] at a meeting discussing the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], where he met "green activists" with posters quoting him as saying that global warming "is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people". He signed a poster for them,&lt;ref name="Mooney 16 April 2004" /&gt; and thanked them for quoting him correctly. In an October 2004 Senate speech he said "Global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. It was true when I said it before, and it remains true today. Perhaps what has made this hoax so effective is that we hear over and over that the science is settled and there is a consensus that, unless we fundamentally change our way of life by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, we will cause catastrophic global warming.

During a [[heat wave]] in July 2006, Inhofe said to the ''[[Tulsa World]]'' newspaper that the environmentalist movement reminded him of "the [[Third Reich]], the [[Big Lie]]", as "You say something over and over and over and over again, and people will believe it, and that's their strategy."&lt;ref name="Nicks 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicks|first=Denver|authorlink=Nicks Denver|title=The Craziest Senator |website=The Daily Beast|date=July 29, 2009|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/07/29/the-craziest-senator.html |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Myers|first=Jim|title=Heat wave has senator sticking to beliefs|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|location=Tulsa, OK|date=July 22, 2006|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=060722_Ne_A1_Heatw72040 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5orMa6h8d?url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=060722_Ne_A1_Heatw72040 |archivedate=April 9, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2006 Senate speech, Inhofe argued that the threat of global warming was exaggerated by "the media, [[Hollywood]] [[Elitism|elites]] and our pop culture". He said that in the 1960s [[mass media|the media]] had switched from warning of global warming to warning of [[global cooling]] and a coming [[ice age]], then in the 1970s had returned to warming to promote "climate change fears".&lt;ref&gt;[http://epw.senate.gov/speechitem.cfm?party=rep&amp;id=263759 Text of speech by James Inhofe in the Senate on September 25, 2006, on global warming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212224/http://epw.senate.gov/speechitem.cfm?party=rep&amp;id=263759 |date=March 28, 2007 }}. Retrieved September 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, he told ''[[Fox News]]'' that mainstream science increasingly attributed climate change to natural causes, and only "those individuals on the far left, such as Hollywood liberals and the United Nations" opposed this.{{sfn|Kutney|2014|p=109}}

In 2006, Inhofe introduced Senate Amendment 4682 with [[Kit Bond]] (R-[[Missouri|MO]]), which would have modified oversight responsibility of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. The [[League of Conservation Voters]], an environmentalist group, said analyses for corps projects "have been manipulated to favor large-scale projects that harm the environment."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_2006_Scorecard_final.pdf LCV Scorecard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101211219/http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_2006_Scorecard_final.pdf |date=November 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[109th Congress]], Inhofe voted to increase [[offshore drilling|offshore oil drilling]], to include provisions for drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] in the House Budget Amendment, and to deny funding for both low-income energy assistance and environmental stewardship, citing heavy costs and unproven programs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In May 2009, he gave support to the idea that black carbon is a significant contributor to global warming.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|title=US climate change denier James Inhofe joins Al Gore in fight against soot|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=May 5, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/05/inhofe-black-carbon-bill|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Inhofe stated, "I don't think that anyone disagrees with the fact that we actually are in a cold period that started about nine years ago.  Now, that's not me talking, those are the scientists that say that." The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] said that what Inhofe stated was wrong, pointing to an [[NOAA]] report indicating that, through July 2010 had been the hottest summer on record since 1880. Inhofe added that "People on the other side of this argument back in January, they said, 'Inhofe, it has nothing to do with today's or this month or next month.

During a House committee hearing in 2011, Inhofe testified, "I have to admit—and, you know, confession is good for the soul ... I, too, once thought that catastrophic global warming was caused by anthropogenic gases—because everyone said it was."&lt;ref name=tnr031611&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/environment-energy/83196/epa-regulations-congress-inhofe-upton|title=Is This What The Climate-Change Debate Has Come To?|first=Bradford|last=Plumer|publisher=[[The New Republic]]|date=February 10, 2011|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under questioning from committee member [[Jay Inslee]], Inhofe dismissed the notion that he was less knowledgeable than climate scientists, saying that he'd already given "five speeches on the science."&lt;ref name=tnr031611/&gt;

===2015: Chair of Environment and Public Works committee===
[[File:Inhofe holding snowball.jpg|thumb|right|Inhofe holding a snowball on the U.S. Senate floor.]]
On January 21, 2015, Inhofe returned to chairing the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, as part of a new Republican majority in the Senate. In response to reports by NOAA and NASA that the year 2014 had been the warmest globally in the [[temperature record]], he said "we had the coldest in the western hemisphere in the same time frame", and attributed changes to a 30-year cycle, not human activities.&lt;ref name="Cama 2101 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cama|first=Timothy|title=Sen.

Inhofe clarified his view that "Climate is changing and climate has always changed and always will. There is archaeological evidence of that, there is biblical evidence of that, there is historical evidence of that", but added that "there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate."&lt;ref name="Tulsa 21012015"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dina Cappiello, The Associated Press|title=Senate says climate change real, but doesn't agree on cause|website=Dayton Daily News|date=January 21, 2015|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/ap/ap/top-news/senate-republicans-climate-change-not-a-hoax/njsm7/ |accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2015, Inhofe brought a snowball on to the Senate floor and tossed it before delivering remarks in which he claimed that environmentalists keep talking about global warming even though it keeps getting cold.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Casteel [http://www.tulsaworld.com/sen-inhofe-throws-snowball-on-u-s-senate-floor/article_af064ad5-1c04-5c9d-8f48-0b7866280464.html "Sen.

=== Hydraulic fracturing ===
On March 19, 2015, Inhofe introduced S.828, "The Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands (FRESH) Act." The bill would transfer regulatory power over hydraulic fracturing from the federal government to state governments. In his announcement of the bill, Inhofe said that hydraulic fracturing has never contaminated ground water in Oklahoma (the state he represents in the Senate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Majority Page :. |url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Majority.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=31c63566-c7a1-79fe-3f39-761a806c1ad2|website=www.epw.senate.gov|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both U.S. senators from 7 states (Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Dakota and Texas) cosponsored the bill with Inhofe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosponsors – S.828 – 114th Congress (2015-2016): Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act {{!}} Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/828/cosponsors|website=www.congress.gov|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Agreement===
Inhofe co-authored and was one of 22 senators to sign a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senator James Inhofe |url=https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/download/?id=E1E34574-5655-42AA-92E8-0D23DC8C33BA&amp;download=1|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to President [[Donald Trump]] urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the [[Paris Agreement]]. According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], Inhofe has received over $529,000 from the oil and gas industry since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/01/republican-senators-paris-climate-deal-energy-donations|accessdate=June 1, 2017 |publisher=The Guardian|date=June 1, 2017|title=The Republicans who urged Trump to pull out of Paris deal are big oil darlings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other political positions==

===Israel===
In a Senate speech on March 4, 2002, Inhofe presented his position on the "seven reasons that [[Israel]] has the right to their land."&lt;ref name=inhofeisrael/&gt;

These are summarized as follows:

#Archeological evidence. Excerpt: "Every time there is a [[Archaeology of Israel|dig in Israel]], it does nothing but support the fact that [[Israeli people|Israelis]] have had a presence there for 3,000 years."
#Historic right. Inhofe's case includes the historic presence of Israel prior to the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Balfour Declaration|promise]] given to the [[Jews]] by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1917 to provide a [[Jewish homeland]].
#Agricultural development. Inhofe argues that Israel has been "able to bring [[Agriculture in Israel|more food]] out of a desert environment than any other country in the world."
#Humanitarian concerns. Inhofe argues that due to the extent of their persecution—he cites [[Antisemitism in Russia|Russia]], and their slaughter, during [[World War II]] [[the Holocaust|by the Nazi]]s—the Jews are entitled to a homeland, and that this is not an unreasonable demand.
#Strategic ally of the United States. "They vote with us in the [[Israel, Palestine, and the United Nations|United Nations]] more than [[United Kingdom–United States relations|England]], more than [[Canada–United States relations|Canada]], more than [[France–United States relations|France]], more than [[Germany–United States relations|Germany]] &amp;mdash; more than any other country in the world."
#Acting as an effective roadblock to terrorism. In this part of his speech, Inhofe refers to [[Arab–Israeli conflict|four wars]] which Israel has fought and won (as of the date of his speech, dated 2002): "The [[1948 War of Independence]], the 1956 [[Sinai campaign]], the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], and the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]." And he states that "In all four cases, Israel was attacked. They were not the aggressor ... In regard to their effectiveness, they are great warriors. They consider a level playing field being outnumbered 2-to-1." He also states at this point that, "One of the reasons I believe the spiritual door was opened for an attack against the United States is that the policy of our government has been to ask the Israelis, and demand it with pressure, not to retaliate in a significant way against the [[Timeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|terrorist strikes]] that have been launched against them."&lt;ref name=inhofeisrael/&gt;
#Biblical references. Inhofe states, "I believe very strongly that we ought to support Israel, and that it has a right to the land, because God said so."

In a Senate speech, Inhofe said that America should base its [[Israel]] policy on the text of the [[Bible]]:&lt;ref name=inhofeisrael/&gt;

{{quote|I believe very strongly that we ought to support Israel; that it has a right to the land. This is the most important reason: Because God said so. As I said a minute ago, look it up in the [[Book of Genesis]]. It is right up there on the desk.

In Genesis 13:14–17, the Bible says:

The Lord said to [[Abraham]], "Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward and westward: for all the land which you see, [[Abrahamic covenant|to you will I give it, and to your seed forever]]. ... Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee." That is God talking.

The Bible says that Abraham removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of [[Mamre]], which is in [[Hebron]], and built there an [[altar]] before the Lord. Hebron is in the [[West Bank]]. It is at this place where God appeared to Abram and said, "I am giving you this land — the West Bank". This is not a political battle at all. It is a contest over whether or not the word of God is true.}}

In March 2002, Inhofe also made a speech before the U.S. Senate that included the explicit suggestion that the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] were a form of divine retribution against the U.S. for failing to defend Israel. He said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the reasons I believe the spiritual door was opened for an attack against the United States of America is that the policy of our Government has been to ask the Israelis, and demand it with pressure, not to retaliate in a significant way against the [[terrorist]] strikes that have been launched against them.&lt;ref name=inhofeisrael&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/speech/peace-in-the-middle-east-speech|title=Peace in the Middle East Speech |publisher=''Jim Inhofe''|date=March 4, 2002|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Syria===
Inhofe has condemned President Barack Obama's inaction on Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/congress-speaks-with-a-loud-muddled-voice-on-syria-1.220706|title=Congress speaks with a loud, muddled voice on Syria|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
Inhofe wrote the [[Inhofe Amendment]] to the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006]], which was debated in Congress in May 2006. The amendment would make [[English language|English]] the [[national language]] of the United States and require that new citizens take an English proficiency test. The amendment was passed on May 18, 2006, with 32 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], one [[independent (politics)|independent]], and one [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] dissenting. The measure had 11 cosponsors, including one Democrat.

In the debate, Inhofe cited a 2005 [[Zogby International|Zogby]] Poll&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zogby.com/soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=12892 Zogby Poll http://www.zogby.com/soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=12892 Zogby Poll] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021055/http://www.zogby.com/soundbites/ReadClips.dbm?ID=12892 |date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing 84% of Americans support making English the official language of governmental operations, including 71% of Hispanics. He also noted that 27 states and 51 nations have made English their official language and that the [[Office of Management and Budget]] estimated that it costs taxpayers $1–2 billion to provide language assistance under President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Executive Order 13166]] that created the entitlement to services provided in any language other than English.

===LGBT rights===
[[File:Inhofefamily-noglbt.png|thumb|right|Inhofe pointing at a large photograph of his family, proclaiming none have been divorced or LGBT]]
Inhofe has generally been seen as overtly hostile by [[LGBT]] advocacy groups, earning a 0% in every one of his terms on [[Human Rights Campaign]]'s position scorecard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/your_community/your_elected_officials.asp?state=OK&amp;x=20&amp;y=11&amp;view=myofficials&amp;zip= HRC profile of James Inhofe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319211702/http://www.hrc.org/your_community/your_elected_officials.asp?state=OK&amp;x=20&amp;y=11&amp;view=myofficials&amp;zip= |date=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inhofe is in favor of a constitutional amendment banning [[same-sex marriage]], against adding [[sexual orientation]] to the definition of [[hate crime]]s, and voted against prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/James_Inhofe.htmJames Inhofe On the Issues]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhofe's office has said he "does not hire openly [[gay]] staffers due to the possibility of a conflict of agenda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001976967_gays11.html Reprinted in Seattle Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918075623/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001976967_gays11.html |date=September 18, 2008 }}, "Senate takes up fight on banning gay marriages" Chicago Tribune – Chicago, Ill.

Inhofe campaigned for his Senate seat in 1994 using the phrase "God, guns, and gays."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7hqCYMRDMWQC&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=inhofe%20god%20guns%20gays&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q=inhofe%20god%20guns%20gays&amp;f=falseThe Freshmen: What Happened to the Republican Revolution?], Linda Killian, 1999. Basic Books. "From there it was on to Hominy, where Inhofe walked up and down Main Street and stopped by the local coffee shop to shake some hands.  He told the morning customers the Senate race could be summed up by the "three Gs – God, gays, and guns." Inhofe asserted Dave McCurdy was a liberal Washington insider out of touch with what Oklahomans care about, who was against [[school prayer|prayer in schools]], for gays in the military and [[gun control]], and who voted with [[Bill Clinton]] more than 80 percent of the time."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Weisberg.

Inhofe describes how the phrase came to be in The Associated Press via [https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-09-18-2881050521_x.htm USA Today], Ron Jenkins, September 18, 2008.  "Inhofe, in a telephone interview from Washington, recalled that 14 years ago he was told by a small group in Hugo that he would carry McCurtain County, a Democratic stronghold in southeastern Oklahoma.  He said he asked the Hugo residents why he would win, "and they said because of the three G's. They're the ones who came up with that and it became almost a chant out there."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, his campaign was noted by the [[Associated Press]] for running an ad with "anti-gay overtones" featuring a wedding cake with two male figures on top, fading into his opponent's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Ron|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-09-18-2881050521_x.htm|title=Oklahoma's Inhofe on attack again in Senate race|publisher=''[[Associated Press]]''|date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GI Bill reform===
Inhofe, an initial sponsor of Senator [[Jim Webb]]'s [[Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008]], subsequently withdrew support for this bill to support S 2938, a competing bill that would have provided benefits beyond those offered in Webb's bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2008/05/military_gibill_showdown_050608w/|title=Senate prepares for GI Bill showdown- Army News, opinions, editorials, news from Iraq, photos, reports – Army Times|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Inhofe voted to enact Webb's legislation in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00162United States Senate Roll Call Votes, 110th Congress, 2nd Session].

===Misconduct while piloting an aircraft in 2010===
Trained by the U.S. Navy, Inhofe is one of the few members of Congress who is licensed as a commercial pilot. In 1994, when he first ran for the U.S. Senate, he used his plane as a daily campaign vehicle to travel throughout Oklahoma and visit almost every town in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7hqCYMRDMWQC&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=inhofe%20god%20guns%20gays&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Freshmen: What Happened to the Republican Revolution?], Linda Killian, 1999. Basic Books. "Inhofe, one of Congress's few certified commercial pilots, has been crisscrossing the state in his 1969 Piper Aztec and managed to visit almost every town in Oklahoma before the end of the campaign."&lt;/ref&gt; He has been influential in Senate and Congressional debates involving aircraft regulation.&lt;ref&gt;The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association [http://www.aopa.org/feature/election08/congress.html says this about Inhofe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020051246/http://www.aopa.org/feature/election08/congress.html |date=October 20, 2008 }}: "An active pilot for more than 50 years, aircraft owner and AOPA member, Sen. Jim Inhofe has been at the forefront of every aviation debate since arriving in Congress in 1986, offering his real-world perspective. He was a major force behind passage of the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994 that is credited with reviving aviation manufacturing in America. During the current battle over user fees, Inhofe spent countless hours working behind the scenes to educate his colleagues in the Senate about the negative impacts of a user fee-funded system. He even took the unusual step of testifying before the Senate's aviation subcommittee to explain his opposition to user fees and the detrimental impact it would have on general aviation. Oklahoma pilots can be proud of Senator Inhofe's accomplishments and dedication to work on issues affecting pilots."&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2010, at the age of 75, Inhofe landed his Cessna on a closed runway at a south Texas airport, scattering construction workers who ran for their lives. In a recorded telephone call, the men's supervisor told the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) that Inhofe "scared the crap out of" the workers, adding that the Cessna "damn near hit" a truck. And the airport manager, also speaking to the FAA in a recorded telephone call, opined: "I've got over 50 years flying, three tours of Vietnam, and I can assure you I have never seen such a reckless disregard for human life in my life. Something needs to be done. This guy is famous for these violations."&lt;ref&gt;The Smoking Gun [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/inhofe-scared-crap-out-airport-workers-192645 Inhofe "Scared The Crap Out Of" Airport Workers] – retrieved April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the incident, Inhofe stated that he "did nothing wrong", and accused the FAA of "agency overreach" and causing a "feeling of desperation" in him. He agreed to take a remedial training program, and the FAA agreed not to pursue legal action against him if he took the program. In July 2011, Inhofe introduced a bill to create a "Pilot's Bill of Rights" which he said would increase fairness in FAA enforcement actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inhofe to introduce 'Pilot's Bill of Rights' |date=July 6, 2011 |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=505&amp;articleid=20110706_16_A11_CUTLIN890205&amp;archive=yes |author=Jim Meyers |work=Tulsa World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1335 S. 1335 (112th): Pilot's Bill of Rights].

===Taxpayer-funded travel===
Inhofe states that he has made over 140 trips to Africa over about 20 years and helped to get [[United States Africa Command]] established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Inhofe |first=Jim |subjectlink=Jim Inhofe |interviewer=[[Hugh Hewitt]] |title=Hugh Hewitt Show|date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhofe has made multiple foreign trips, especially to Africa, on missions that he described as "a [[Jesus]] thing" and that were paid for by the U.S. government.

In the aftermath of the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], Inhofe blamed the "culture of [[sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]]" rather than lax gun control legislation for the shootings.&lt;ref name=twsVox1&gt;Tara Golshan, October 3, 2017, VOX News, [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/3/16412100/republican-sanctuary-cities-las-vegas-shooting-inhofe https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/3/16412100/republican-sanctuary-cities-las-vegas-shooting-inhofe], Retrieved October 3, 2017, "... It's the existence of "sanctuary cities" that creates a lawless culture fostering mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

In 1959, Inhofe married Kay Kirkpatrick, with whom he has four children.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joint Committee on Printing|date= 2014|title=Official Congressional Directory: 113th Congress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOsRkb1EJ_EC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;ots=vtSroZJ87m&amp;dq=inhofe%20married%20kay%20kirkpatrick%201959&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q=inhofe%20married%20kay%20kirkpatrick%201959&amp;f=false |publisher=Government Printing Office |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2013, Inhofe's son, Dr. Perry Inhofe, died in a plane crash in [[Owasso, Oklahoma]], flying alone for the first time since training in a newly acquired plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Kerry|title=NTSB On Scene Of Perry Inhofe Crash |url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/ntsb-scene-perry-inhofe-crash|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhofe was the first recipient of the U.S. Air Force Academy's Character and Leadership Award for his character and leadership in public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhofe Honored with Air Force Leadership Award|url=https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-honored-with-air-force-leadership-award|date=March 5, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kees van der Pijl''' (born 15 June 1947) is a Dutch political scientist who is emeritus professor of international relations at the [[University of Sussex]]. He is known for his critical approach to [[global political economy]] and has published, amongst others, ''Flight MH17, Ukraine and the New Cold War. Prism of Disaster'' (2018), a trilogy on ''Modes of Foreign Relations and Political Economy'' (2007, 2010, 2014); ''Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq'' (2006); ''Transnational Classes and International Relations'' (1998); and ''The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class'' (1984, reprinted 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van der Pijl, Kees Transnational Classes and International Relations |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61872975.html |work=Perspectives on Political Science |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=2009-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Kees van der Pijl studied law at [[Leiden University]] from 1965 to 1967. After military service as a reserve officer in the [[Royal Marechaussee|Royal Dutch Military Police]], and a trip through the Soviet Union to Japan in 1970, he switched to political science, a specialisation taught in Leiden as part of the public law degree. His most influential teachers were {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Daalder|nl}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ben Sijes|nl}}, and the Indologist, J.C. Heesterman, with whom he wrote his final thesis on the politics of regional diversity in India.
He graduated in 1973 and was hired as a junior lecturer by the Department of International Relations at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in that year. In 1983 he received his doctorate at the University of Amsterdam on a thesis titled  ''Imperialism and Class Formation in the North Atlantic Area'', supervised by Gerd Junne. He was involved in the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN)]] and also published short stories and three novels (1989, 1992, 1994, all with De Harmonie). Van der Pijl was co-director of the Research Centre for International Political Economy (Recipe) from 1992 to 1998. With [[Henk Overbeek]], [[Ries Bode]], [[Otto Holman]], [[Bastiaan van Apeldoorn]] and others, this created a tentative Amsterdam School of global political economy.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Political Economy, 19: 3, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of International Relations and Development, 7: 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Van der Pijl moved to the United Kingdom to take up the chair in international relations at the University of Sussex, vacant after the retirement of Professor Michael Nicholson. He was appointed director of the Centre for Global Political Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cgpe|title=Centre for Global Political Economy|author=Centre for Global Political Economy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CGPE) at that university when it was launched in 2001 (until 2006), and was subject chair/head of the Department of Politics and International Relations from 2002 to 2004. In 2006 he was awarded a [[Leverhulme]] Major Research Fellowship. He has taught as a visiting professor at the [[University of Auvergne]] at Clermont-Ferrand (2005, 2006) and at [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"|L’Orientale University in Naples]] (2009, 2010). His work has been nominated for prizes in 2007 and 2008 and he was awarded the [[Deutscher Memorial Prize]] in 2008 for ''Nomads, Empires, States'' (Pluto 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nomads, Empires, States |url=http://www.deutscherprize.org.uk/ |work=[[Isaac Deutscher Memorial Prize]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to the Netherlands he joined the Dutch Anti-Fascist Resistance (AFVN/BvA, issued from the wartime communist underground). He served as its president from 2013 to October 2015 and was involved in launching a Committee of Vigilance Against Resurgent Fascism of which he is the current president.

== Research ==

The work of Kees van der Pijl covers four main areas: a) transnational classes; b) the structure of the global political economy; c) the history of ideas in International Relations and Global Political Economy; d) modes of foreign relations.

===Transnational classes===

The study of transnational class formation was central in the work at the University of Amsterdam. It built on the writings of [[Christian Palloix]], [[Nikos Poulantzas]], [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]] and on the materialist Cold War history in the United States (Joyce and [[Gabriel Kolko]]). Van der Pijl’s contribution was on the transmission of American mass production to Western Europe in the [[Marshall Plan]] and the relegation of the cartelised European steel industry to the role of a supplier for the automobile industry, resulting in a first book in Dutch (1978). Economic statesmen involved in this process weld their different ‘fractional’ perspectives (heavy/light industrial, national/international trade, investment and commercial banking, etc.) into ‘globale beheersconcepties’ (comprehensive concepts of control, a notion coined by Ries Bode). A concept of control projects a presumed general interest totalising all others, under the guidance of the dominant fraction. In his doctoral dissertation of 1983 and the book based on it (''The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class'', Verso 1984, reprinted with a new preface 2012), Van der Pijl applied this to the evolution of transatlantic class formation. In ''Transnational Classes and International Relations'' (Routledge 1998), [[neoliberalism]] is identified as the hegemonic concept of control in the closing decades of the 20th century. This book also analyses the managerial ‘cadre’, an auxiliary class of salaried functionaries with directive-educative roles. The cadre typically come to the fore in major crises (the 1930s, the 1970s, and again today), proposing managerial alternatives to liberalism. If not checked by popular mobilization, their intervention may assume authoritarian forms.

===Structure of the global political economy===

Challenging the state-centric understanding of world politics, which assumes that each state contains a self-enclosed society, van der Pijl distinguishes a ''Lockean heartland'' (after the ideologue of the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England) at the centre of the global political economy. This is composed of the white-majority, English-speaking countries. Its common law tradition favouring social self-regulation and distrust of state encroachment, ideology of possessive individualism, and missionary interpretation of its role in the world (inspired by Puritanism) have fostered the development of capitalist social relations. The Lockean heartland has interacted with rival states seeking to impose themselves on their societies, to balance and withstand the influence of the liberal West and avoid colonisation. These ''contender states'', of which France in the long 18th century, Germany, Japan and Italy from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, and the Soviet Union after World War II, have been the most important ones, develop through [[revolution from above|revolutions from above]] (Gramsci’s ‘[[passive revolution]]’) into alternatives to transnational Western liberalism. This line of analysis,  developed in ''Transnational Classes and International Relations'' and more recently in ''Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq'' (Pluto and Sage-Vistaar 2006, Turkish trans., Imge 2014) leads to the identification of China as the current primary contender.

===History of international thought===

Building on the concepts of the Anglophone Lockean heartland and the contender states, Van der Pijl in ''Vordenker der Weltpolitik'' (Leske+Budrich 1996, revised from an earlier work in Dutch) argued that the liberal West typically produced ‘idealist’ conceptions of world order, against the ‘realist’ power politics perspective of the contenders. After World War I, there was an exodus of such ‘realists’ from the European continent to the United States, incorporating the realist argument into the IR mainstream. At Sussex, Van der Pijl has posted a web-textbook for the MA in Global Political Economy, 'A Survey of Global Political Economy'. In volumes II and III of his ''Modes of foreign relations'' project, Van der Pijl discusses what myth and religion say about foreign relations, and how liberalism prescribes the nation-state form for the world. The third volume, The Discipline of Western Supremacy (2014) presents a historical sociology of the IR discipline in this light.

===Modes of foreign relations===

In the Modes of foreign relations project, sponsored by the [[Leverhulme Trust]] under a major research fellowship 2006-2009, Van der Pijl argues that inter-state relations (as well as the national state form itself) are transient, historical forms of more fundamental foreign relations. Just as Marx developed a critique of equilibrium economics by claiming that this was only one ‘[[mode of production]]’, which had been preceded and would be followed by others, Van der Pijl in this project challenges the ‘IR’ paradigm. Modes of foreign relations include a tribal, an empire/nomad, the sovereign equality, and the [[global governance]] modes; in each, a specific way occupation of space, its protection, and the exchange with others, are made possible by a given level of civilisation.

== Controversy ==

Van der Pijl has claimed that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks 'with help from Zionists in the US government', and that Al-Qaeda is a front for the Israeli [[Mossad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Osbourne |first1=Samuel |title=Sussex University professor who claimed Israelis carried out 9/11 must have emeritus status removed, Jewish group says |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sussex-university-world-trade-centre-911-professor-kees-van-der-pijl-israel-tweet-jewish-a8620416.html |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

== History ==
The Kentucky Department of Education became an official organization when the legislature gave it a definition in 1924.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Board of Education, Kentucky. State. ''Goals of Kentucky Department of Education.'' Frankfort, Ky. : State Board of Education, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters is located in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/464621175|title=Public education in Kentucky|last=N.Y.)|first=General Education Board (New York,|date=1922|publisher=General education board, 1921|oclc=464621175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Kentucky citizens voted for a law that allowed taxation to support schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1938, new laws were passed allowing vocational-technical schools to be formed. In 1956, vocational-technical schools were expanded to help those who were blind. There was a focus on providing training and jobs for the visually impaired. The vocational schools became controlled, like other public schools in the state, by the Department of Education in 1962.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Kentucky Education Reform Act]] (KERA) became a law in 1990.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Steffy, Betty E. ''The Kentucky Education Reform : Lessons for America''. Lancaster, Pa. : Technomic Publ., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It is enforced by the Kentucky Department of Education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; KRS 159.010 is the original Kentucky [[law]] requiring children from age 6 to 16 to attend school.

== Goals==
According to "Goals of the Kentucky Department of Education," a booklet published by the State Board of Education in 1974, the Kentucky Department of Education aims to reach the following goals:

# '''Have a functioning State Department of Education.''' This goal is met by providing policies and training.
# '''To have maintenance and improvement in the Department.''' Required services include looking at statistics, distributing and collecting educational materials, and keeping track of money.
# '''Have programs, methods, and practices to provide education for everyone in the state.''' Form Equal Education Opportunity programs and give information to the public.
# '''Hold activities across the state that improve education.'''
# '''Distribute resources.''' This includes materials and funding. 
# '''Have operating schools and school programs that the Board of Education will manage.''' This includes [[Vocational school|vocational]], technical, and rehabilitation programs. Provide schooling for the Deaf and Blind.

== Kentucky Board of Education ==
The [[Kentucky Board of Education]] was established by a 1838 law. It was made of ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' members, meaning the board's power to perform its tasks was limited. The members of the board had other responsibilities within the state. The Board’s powers, at the time, included creating laws, establishing a course of study and choosing books for the courses, and controlling funds and property. The Board of Education is responsible for granting certificates for high school graduates, teacher training.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Kentucky Board of Education consists of 11 members. The [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] appoints the members and they are confirmed by both the state [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Kentucky Senate|Senate]] of the state of Kentucky. They are chosen regardless of [[political party]]. Each member of the board must be at least 30 years old, have an [[associate's degree|associates degree]] or higher, and have lived in Kentucky for at least 3 years. Each member serves for 4 years. Their main purpose is to make and adopt regulations and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2018 Kentucky School Laws Annotated|last=Drury|first=Tina|publisher=Kentucky Department of Education|year=2018|isbn=|location=education.ky.gov/districts/legal/Documents/KY%20School%20Laws%202018%20Edition.pdf.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state Board of Education has power over all of the schools in the state. The county board of education has power over each of the schools located within its county. The county’s board deals with issues that are of interest to the county.

There have been conflicts between the Board and the Department. In November 2015 the [[Knox County Board of Education]] was investigated by the Kentucky Department of Education. The Board in Knox County had violated Kentucky laws such as including personal matters into the district rules, disturbing district operation, or providing resources to independent schools for free. The Kentucky Department of Education is able to intervene and control the Boards in the state because it has more power than the Boards.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kristina. “Kentucky Law, Board Policy Violations by Knox Board of Education Uncovered in State Report.” ''Times-Tribune, The (Corbin, KY)'', 28 Nov. 2015. ''EBSCOhost'', ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=2W62251922283&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==

=== Superintendent ===
The 1838 law established a Board of Education in Kentucky also called for a [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] that would serve for 2 years. The governor would elect the superintendent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

A law was passed in 1850 allowing the superintendent to serve for 4 years and be elected by the people. Superintendents may not be re-elected due to a law passed in 1891.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The superintendent approves the building of new schools, monitors spending, and ensures school governments follow laws passed by the Board of Education. In 1893 the power of selecting books was given to the superintendent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Superintendents are required to work full-time in an office in Frankfort.

[[John C. Breckinridge|John Cabell Breckinridge]], the 6th for Kentucky, was the superintendent in 1849.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The superintendent in 1974 was [[Lyman V. Ginger.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The current superintendent for the state of Kentucky is [[Wayne Lewis]].

=== Other ===
Other positions include a Deputy Superintendent and a Secretary. There are multiple Assistant Superintendent positions focused on Instruction, Rehabilitation Services, Vocational Education, Pupil Personnel Services, Instruction, Administration, Finance, State Relations, Federal Relations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Kwanzaa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɑː|n|.|z|ə}}) is a celebration held in the United States and in other nations of the [[African diaspora]] in [[African diaspora in the Americas|the Americas]] and lasts a week. The celebration honors African heritage in [[African-American culture]] and is observed from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a feast and gift-giving.&lt;ref name="Why Kwanzaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/kwanzaa.html|publisher="[[Maulana Karenga]]"|title=Why Kwanzaa Video|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kwanzaa has seven core principles (''Nguzo Saba''). It was created by [[Maulana Karenga]] and was first celebrated in 1966–67.

==History and etymology==
American [[Black Power]] activist and [[secular humanist]] [[Maulana Karenga]], also known as [[Ronald McKinley Everett]], created Kwanzaa in 1966, as a specifically African-American holiday&lt;ref name="Kwanzaa Date"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00B1EFD395C0C738FDDAB0994DB484D81|work=[[The New York Times]]"|title=The Evening Hours|date=December 30, 1983 |accessdate=December 15, 2006 | first=Ron | last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in a spirit comparable to [[Juneteenth]]. According to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase ''matunda ya kwanza'', meaning "first fruits of the harvest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/kwanzaa1.html | title = Kwanzaa – Honoring the values of ancient African cultures | author = Holly Hartman|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more conventional translation would simply be "first fruits". The choice of Swahili, an [[East Africa]]n language, reflects its status as a symbol of [[Pan-Africanism]], especially in the 1960s, although most of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] that brought African people to America originated in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rHLyC2yHQ8C&amp;q=Mozambique#v=snippet&amp;q=Mozambique&amp;f=false |title=The Atlantic Slave Trade - Herbert S.

[[First Fruits (Southern Africa)|First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa]], celebrated in December/January with the [[December solstice|southern solstice]], and Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival [[Umkhosi Wokweshwama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGCOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|title=Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition|last=Mayes|first=Keith A.|date=2009-09-10|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135284008|location=|pages=84|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional "a" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWCOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA228|title=Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition|last=Mayes|first=Keith A.|date=2009-09-10|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135284015|location=|pages=228|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwanzaa is a celebration with its roots in the [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] movement of the 1960s. Karenga established it to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of African traditions and ''Nguzo Saba'', the "seven principles of African Heritage," which Karenga said "is a [[communitarian]] African philosophy." For Karenga, a major figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored an essential premise "you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution.The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose and direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith A. |last=Mayes |year=2009 |title=Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition | pages=63–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhgk72OGBRYC&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn= 978-0415998550  |accessdate= December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was [[Psychosis|psychotic]] and Christianity was a "White" religion that Black people should shun.&lt;ref&gt;Karenga, Maulana (1967). "Religion". In Clyde Halisi, James Mtume. The quotable Karenga. Los Angeles: University of Sankore Press. pp. 25. 23769.8.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, then stating in the 1997, ''Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture'', "Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Maulana | last=Karenga | title=Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture | page=121 | publisher=University of Sankore Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0943412214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/20/garden/in-blacks-homes-the-christmas-and-kwanzaa-spirits-meet.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=In Blacks' Homes, the Christmas and Kwanzaa Spirits Meet | first=Lena | last=Williams | date=December 20, 1990 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This section is linked from Nguzo Saba. When changing the heading name please take care to update this page as well.--&gt;
Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or ''Nguzo Saba'' (originally ''Nguzu Saba''—the seven principles of African Heritage), which Karenga said "is a [[communitarian]] [[African philosophy]]," consisting of what Karenga called "the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world." They were developed in 1965, a year before Kwanzaa itself. These seven principles comprise ''Kawaida'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning "common".  Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/NguzoSaba.shtml|title=Nguzo Saba|last=Karenga|first=Maulana|date=2008|website=The Official Kwanzaa Web Site|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Umoja'' (Unity): To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.
* ''Kujichagulia'' (Self-Determination): To define and name ourselves, as well as to create and speak for ourselves.
* ''Ujima'' (Collective Work and Responsibility): To build and maintain our community together and make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems and to solve them together.
* ''[[Ujamaa]]'' ([[Cooperative economics|Cooperative Economics]]): To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.

* ''Imani'' (Faith): To believe with all our hearts in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

Kwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (Mkeka) on which other symbols are placed: a ''[[Kinara]]'' (candle holder), ''Mishumaa Saba'' (seven candles), ''mazao'' (crops), ''Muhindi'' (corn), a ''Kikombe cha Umoja'' (unity cup) for commemorating and giving shukrani (thanks) to African Ancestors, and ''Zawadi'' (gifts).

[[File:Kwanzaa-Myers.jpg|thumb|300px|A woman lighting [[kinara]] candles for Kwanzaa.]]
Families celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth such as [[kente]], especially the wearing of [[Wrapper (clothing)|kaftans]] by women, and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. [[Libations]] are shared, generally with a common chalice, ''Kikombe cha Umoja'', passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The holiday greeting is "Joyous Kwanzaa".&lt;ref name="bush2004"&gt;{{cite web

A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the [[Pan-African colors]], a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast ([[karamu (feast)|karamu]]). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is ''Habari Gani?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/greetings_and.shtml |title=The Founder's Message 2000 |publisher=The Official Kwanzaa Web Site |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is Swahili for "How are you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/swahili.php |title=Useful Swahili phrases |website=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of ''kujichagulia'' (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/kwanzaa |title=Kwanzaa (until Jan 1) in the United States |website=Timeanddate.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, both Christmas trees and [[kinara]]s, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.

Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] featuring [[interpretive dance]], [[African dance]], song and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showEvent&amp;past=true&amp;event=RHXAP |title=The Spirit of Kwanzaa - The John F.

The [[National Retail Federation]] has sponsored a marketing survey on winter holidays since 2004, and in 2015 found that 1.9% of those polled planned to celebrate Kwanzaa – about six million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Images/Media%20Center/Holiday%20%231%202015.pdf|title=Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics™, Monthly Consumer Survey, OCT-15|last=|first=|date=October 2015|website=National Retail Federation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 speech, Maulana Karenga asserted that 28 million people celebrate Kwanzaa.

According to [[University of Minnesota]] Professor Keith Mayes, the author of ''Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition,'' the popularity within the U.S. has "leveled off" as the [[black power movement]] there has declined, and as of 2009 between 500 thousand and two million Americans celebrated Kwanzaa, or between one and five percent of African Americans. Mayes added that [[white people|white]] institutions now celebrate it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/12/kwanzaa_celebrations_continue.html|title=Kwanzaa celebrations continue, but boom is over, popularity fading|last=Scott|first=Megan K.|date=December 17, 2009|work=The Plain Dealer|access-date=December 24, 2017|agency=Associated Press|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark Card]] being sold in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/20/nyregion/the-marketing-of-kwanzaa-black-american-holiday-earns-dollars-causing-concern.html|title=The Marketing of Kwanzaa; Black American Holiday Earns Dollars, Causing Concern|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=December 20, 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 24, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been concern about this damaging the holiday's values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/commercialized-kwanzaa-worries-enthusiasts/article_5514246b-bfd0-575f-9937-f2c004850b63.html|title=Commercialized Kwanzaa worries enthusiasts|work=The Billings Gazette|access-date=December 24, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday also saw a greater public recognition as the first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by [[Synthia Saint James]], was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year [[Bill Clinton]] gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=53734|title=William J.

The holiday has also spread to Canada and is celebrated by [[Black Canadians]] in a similar fashion as in the United States.&lt;ref name="The principles of Kwanzaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/society/celebrations/clips/16226/ |title=The principles of Kwanzaa |publisher=CBC |date=December 28, 1993 |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Language Portal of Canada, "this fairly new tradition has [also] gained in popularity in France, Great Britain, Jamaica and Brazil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/bien-well/fra-eng/vocabulaire-vocabulary/clbrt-kwanzaa-eng.html |title=Celebrate Kwanzaa!  |publisher=Government of Canada |date=February 21, 2011  |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, in recent years the term Kwanzaa has been applied by a few institutions as a synonym for the festivities of the [[Black Awareness Day]], commemorated on November 20 in honor of [[Zumbi dos Palmares]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/noticias/index.php?p=5702 |title=Portal da Prefeitura da Cidade de São Paulo |website=Prefeitura.sp.gov.br |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120114114629/http://www.cultura.ba.gov.br/2011/10/20/escola-olodum-comemora-28-anos-de-luta-pela-cidadania-e-valorizacao-da-cultura-afro/]&lt;/ref&gt; having little to do with the celebration as it was originally conceived.

[[Stjepan Meštrović]], a [[sociology]] professor at the [[Texas A&amp;M University]], sees Kwanzaa as an example of [[postmodernism]]. According to Meštrović, modern society has discarded ancient traditions as [[racism|racist]], [[sexism|sexist]] or otherwise oppressive, but since living in a world where nothing is true is too terrifying to most people, "nice" and "synthetic" traditions like Kwanzaa have been created to cope with the [[nihilism|nihilistic]], [[individualism|individualistic]] modern society.&lt;ref name="http://ro.uow.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&amp;context=ltc |date=January 2000 |title=Postemotional Law |author=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2474">The '''Limited Global Quota for Upland Cotton''' is a provision of the [[Food and Agriculture Act of 1977]] (P.L. 95-113) that authorized the President to proclaim an [[import quota]] whenever the [[USDA]] determines that the [[spot market]] average price in any one month exceeds 130% of the previous 36-month average.  If triggered by such a determination, the established quota allows for imports of up to 21 days of mill consumption during a 90-day period.

The limited global quota is among several provisions authorized in the bill to keep the U.S. [[upland cotton]] spinning industry competitive. These provisions include a special import quota, a limited global import quota, and an economic adjustment assistance payment to users of upland cotton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/cotton/specialprovisions.htm Website of the federal Economic Research Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited global quota cannot overlap with the step 3 quota, one of the [[cotton competitiveness provisions]]. 

The statutory provision is [http://vlex.com/vid/special-marketing-loan-upland-cotton-19268593 7 USC 7937 - Sec. 7937]

==Provisions==

The special import quota is authorized when, for any consecutive 4-week period, the weekly average of the cheapest U.S. (Far Eastern) cotton price quotation exceeds the prevailing world market price (the average of the cheapest five Far Eastern price quotations).

The quota equals 1 week's domestic mill consumption of upland cotton at the seasonally adjusted average consumption rate during the most recent 3 months for which data are available. The quota applies to upland cotton purchased within 90 days after quota announcement and entered into the United States within 180 days after announcement.

The quantity imported under this special import quota during any [[marketing year]] (August 1-July 31) is limited to 10 week's domestic mill consumption of upland cotton as established in the first special import quota of any marketing year.

'''Nelson Mandela International Day''' (or '''Mandela Day''') is an annual international day in honour of [[Nelson Mandela]], celebrated each year on 18 July, Mandela's birthday.&lt;ref name="UN18"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/ |title=Nelson Mandela International Day, July 18, For Freedom, Justice and Democracy |first= |last= |work=un.org |year=|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was officially declared by the [[United Nations]] in November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/2009/64.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the first UN Mandela Day held on 18 July 2010. However, other groups began celebrating Mandela Day on 18 July 2009.

On 27 April 2009, the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concerts and the [[Nelson Mandela|Nelson Mandela Foundation]] invited the global community to join them in support of an official Mandela Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/the-nelson-mandela-foundation-and-46664-call-for-the-establishment-of-a-glo|title=The Nelson Mandela Foundation and 46664 call for the establishment of a global ‘Mandela Day’ – Nelson Mandela Foundation|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela Day is not meant as a public holiday, but as a day to honour the legacy of [[Nelson Mandela]], South Africa's former President, and his values, through [[volunteering]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref name=UN18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS138319+27-Apr-2009+PRN20090427 |title=46664 and the Nelson Mandela Foundation Call for Establishment of Global 'Mandela... |publisher=Reuters |date= 27 April 2009|accessdate=31 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela Day is a global call to action that celebrates the idea that each individual has the power to [[social change|transform the world]], the ability to make an impact.

The Mandela Day campaign message is:

: "Nelson Mandela has fought for [[social justice]] for 67 years. We're asking you to start with 67 minutes."&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandeladay.com/ |title=Mandela Day |publisher=Mandela Day |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"We would be honoured if such a day can serve to bring together people around the world to [[poverty reduction|fight poverty]] and promote [[peace]], [[resolution of disputes|reconciliation]] and [[cultural diversity]]," according to a statement issued on Mandela's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8021275.stm | work=BBC News | title=World urged to mark 'Mandela Day' | date=27 April 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the first global celebration of Mandela Day on 18 July 2009, Mandela's 91st birthday, a series of educational, art exhibit, fund-raising and volunteer events leading up to a concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 18 July were organised by the 46664 concerts and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mandela Day"/&gt; In November 2009, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] formally declared 18 July to be "Nelson Mandela International Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8353853.stm|title=UN gives backing to 'Mandela Day' |date=11 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Printed ℞.jpg|thumb|The prescription symbol, ℞, printed on the [[blister pack]] of a prescription drug manufactured in the [[Philippines]].]]

A '''prescription'''  is a health-care program implemented by a physician or other qualified [[health care]] practitioner in the form
of instructions that govern the plan of care for an individual patient.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The term often refers to a health care provider's written authorization for a patient to purchase a [[prescription drug]] from a [[pharmacist]].

==Format and definition==
The format of a prescription falls in to seven parts. However, with modern prescribing habits, some are no longer applicable or included on an everyday basis.

Definition: For such prescriptions to be accepted as a legal medical prescription, it needs to be filed by a qualified dentist, herbalist, nurse,  pharmacist, physician, veterinarian etc.,  which falls within their remit to prescribe such treatments. This is regardless of whether they included [[controlled substance]]s or freely available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] treatments. 

[[File:Rx symbol border.svg|160px|thumb|right|Prescription symbol {{unichar|211e|prescription take|html=}}]]
Prescriptions may be entered into an electronic medical record system and transmitted electronically to a pharmacy. Alternatively, a prescription may be [[hand (handwriting)|handwritten]] on preprinted prescription forms that have been assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a [[computer printer]] or even on plain paper according to the circumstance. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted from the physician to the pharmacist orally by telephone; this practice may increase the risk of medical error. The content of a prescription includes the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] Number in the [[United States]]).  Unique for each prescription is the name of the patient.  In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some [[jurisdiction]]s may place a time limit on the prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jwhozip23e/5.4.html|title=Guide to Good Prescribing - A Practical Manual: Part 3: Treating your patients: Chapter 9. STEP 4: Write a prescription|author=|date=|website=apps.who.int|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.

'℞' is a symbol meaning "recipe". It is sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" or just "Rx". This symbol originated in medieval manuscripts as an abbreviation of the late Latin verb ''recipere'', specifically the second person singular imperative form ''recipe'' meaning "take", thus: "take thou".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recipe |title=Recipe definition|publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally abbreviated ''Rc'', the ''c'' was simplified and finally written as a straight stroke making it look like an ''x'' in combination with the right "leg" of ''R''. Medieval prescriptions invariably began with the command to "take" certain materials and compound them in specified ways.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, articles on the letter "R" (sense 14b) and the word "recipe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk theories about the origin of the symbol '℞' note its similarity to the [[Eye of Horus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/library/glossary/symbols/bldefseyeofhorus.htm Eye of Horus, Eye of Ra (Udjat, Wedjat)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012224215/http://altreligion.about.com/library/glossary/symbols/bldefseyeofhorus.htm |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egyptphoto.ncf.ca/Egypt%20a%20Perspective13.htm |title=First recorded incidence of the pharmaceutical sign 'Rx'|publisher=Egyptphoto.ncf.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the ancient symbol for [[Zeus]] or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], ([[Astronomical symbols|♃]]), gods whose protection may have been sought in medical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Amy Beth Dukoff |url=http://www.endomail.com/articles/ad13rx.html |title=Did You Know Where Rx Came From? |publisher=Endomail.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003150926/http://www.endomail.com/articles/ad13rx.html |archivedate=2013-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "prescription", from "pre-" ("before") and "script" ("writing, written"), refers to the fact that the prescription is an order that must be written down before a compound drug can be prepared.  Those within the industry will often call prescriptions simply "scripts".

In certain states medical marijuana legislation has been drafted calling for a health care professional's written or oral "recommendation", in the belief that a written one would be legally distinguishable from a prescription, but since written advice to a patient is what a prescription is, that belief is mistaken.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Jurisdictions may adopt a statutory definition of "prescription" that applies as a term of art only to the operation of that statute (see below about prescriptions that may legally be filled with prescription-only items), but the general legal definition of the word is this broad one.

==Contents==
[[File:ValiumDAWAd.png|thumb|200px|In some countries, drug companies use direct-to-prescriber advertising in an effort to convince prescribers to dispense as written with brand-name products rather than [[generic drug]]s.]]
Many brand name drugs have cheaper [[generic drug]] substitutes that are therapeutically and biochemically equivalent.  Prescriptions will also contain instructions on whether the prescriber will allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic version of the [[drug]].  This instruction is communicated in a number of ways.

In some jurisdictions, the preprinted prescription contains two signature lines:  one line has "dispense as written" printed underneath; the other line has "substitution permitted" underneath.  Some have a preprinted box "dispense as written" for the prescriber to check off (but this is easily checked off by anyone with access to the prescription).  Other jurisdictions the protocol is for the prescriber to handwrite one of the following phrases: "dispense as written", "DAW", "brand necessary", "do not substitute", "no substitution", "medically necessary", "do not interchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/statutes_by_pharmacists.html |title=State Laws or Statutes Governing Generic Substitution by Pharmacists |publisher=: Epilepsy.com/Professionals |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions they may use completely different languages, never mind a different formula of words.  In some jurisdictions, it may be a legal requirement to include the age of child on the prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/doc/29440.htm]{{Full citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- Access restricted to residents of the UK --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For pediatric prescriptions some advise the inclusion of the age of the child if the patient is less than twelve and the age and months if less than five.  (In general, including the age on the prescription is helpful.)  Adding the weight of the child is also helpful.

Prescriptions often have a "label" box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Davis, T |url=http://www.sh.lsuhsc.edu/fammed/OutpatientManual/PrescripWriting-PDR.htm |title=Prescription Writing and the PDR |publisher=Comprehensive Care Clinic |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When checked, the pharmacist is instructed to label the medication and provide information about the prescription itself is given in addition to instructions on taking the medication. Otherwise, the patient is simply given the instructions.

Some prescribers further inform the patient and pharmacist by providing the indication for the medication; i.e. what is being treated. This assists the pharmacist in checking for errors as many common medications can be used for multiple medical conditions.

Some prescriptions will specify whether and how many "repeats" or "refills" are allowed; that is whether the patient may obtain more of the same medication without getting a new prescription from the medical practitioner. Regulations may restrict some types of drugs from being refilled.

In group practices, the preprinted portion of the prescription may contain multiple prescribers' names. Prescribers typically circle themselves to indicate who is prescribing or there may be a checkbox next to their name.

==Writing prescriptions==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=September 2017}}

===Who can write prescriptions (that may legally be filled with prescription-only items)===
National or local (i.e. state or provincial) legislation governs who can write a prescription. In the United States, physicians (either [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) have the broadest prescriptive authority. All 50 states and the District of Columbia allow licensed certified [[Physician Assistant]]s (PAs) prescription authority (with some states, limitations exist to controlled substances). All 50 states allow registered certified [[nurse practitioner]]s and other [[advanced practice registered nurse]]s (such as [[Nurse midwife|certified nurse-midwives]]) prescription power (with some states including limitations to controlled substances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Florida pharmacists can write prescriptions for a limited set of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Legibility===
Prescriptions, when handwritten, are notorious for being often illegible. In the US, illegible handwriting is at least indirectly responsible for the deaths of 7,000 people annually, according to a July 2006 report from the National Academies of Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM). {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Historically, physicians used Latin words and abbreviations to convey the entire prescription to the pharmacist. Today, many of the abbreviations are still widely used and must be understood to interpret prescriptions. At other times, even though some of the individual letters are illegible, the position of the legible letters and length of the word is sufficient to distinguish the medication based on the knowledge of the pharmacist. When in doubt, pharmacists call the medical practitioner. Some jurisdictions have legislated legible prescriptions (e.g. Florida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0400-0499/0456/Sections/0456.42.html | title = 456.42 Written prescriptions for medicinal drugs | work = Florida Statutes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have advocated the elimination of handwritten prescriptions altogether&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismp.org/Newsletters/acutecare/articles/Whitepaper.asp |title=Eliminate Handwritten Prescriptions Within 3 Years |publisher=Institute for Safe Medication Practices |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computer printer|computer printed]] prescriptions are becoming increasingly common in some places.

===Conventions for avoiding ambiguity===
Over the years, prescribers have developed many conventions for prescription-writing, with the goal of avoiding ambiguities or misinterpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/doc/29420.htm]{{Full citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- Access restricted to residents of the UK --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000709193518/http://www.healthlibrary.com/reading/rdb/april98/good.htm|title=Good prescription practice|author=|date=9 July 2000|website=archive.org|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Teichman PG, Caffee AE | title = Prescription writing to maximize patient safety

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These include:
*Careful use of decimal points to avoid ambiguity:
**Avoiding unnecessary decimal points: a prescription will be written as 5&amp;nbsp;mL instead of 5.0&amp;nbsp;mL to avoid possible misinterpretation of 5.0 as 50.
**Always using zero prefix decimals: e.g. 0.5 instead of .5 to avoid misinterpretation of .5 as 5.
**Avoiding trailing zeros on decimals:  e.g. 0.5 instead of .50 or 0.50 to avoid misinterpretation of .50 as 50.
*"[[litre|mL]]" is used instead of "[[Cubic centimetre|cc]]" or "cm{{sup|3}}" even though they are technically equivalent to avoid misinterpretation of 'c' as '0' or the common medical abbreviation for "with" (the Latin "''cum''"), which is written as a 'c' with a bar above the letter.  Further, cc could be misinterpreted as "c.c.", which is a rarely used abbreviation for "take with meals" (the Latin "''cum cibo''").
*Directions written out in full in English (although some common Latin abbreviations are listed below).
*Quantities given directly or implied by the frequency and duration of the directions.
*Where the directions are "as needed", the quantity should always be specified.
*Where possible, usage directions should specify times (7 am, 3 pm, 11 pm) rather than simply frequency (three times a day) and especially relationship to meals for orally consumed medication.
*The use of permanent ink.
*Avoiding units such as "teaspoons" or "tablespoons".
*Writing out numbers as words ''and'' numerals ("dispense #30 (thirty)") as in a [[bank draft]] or [[cheque]].
*The use of [[apothecary]]/[[avoirdupois]] units and symbols of measure – [[pint]]s ('''O'''), [[ounce]]s ('''℥'''), [[dram (unit)|drams]] ('''ℨ'''), [[Apothecaries' system|scruples]] ('''℈'''), [[grain (measure)|grains]] ('''gr'''), and [[minim (volume)|minims]] ('''♏''') – is discouraged given the potential for confusion. For example, the abbreviation for a grain ("gr") can be confused with the [[gram]], abbreviated [[gram|g]], and the symbol for minims (♏), which looks almost identical to an 'm', can be confused with [[microgram]]s or [[metre]]s.  Also, the symbols for ounce (℥) and dram (ℨ) can easily be confused with the numeral '3', and the symbol for pint (O) can be easily read as a '0'.  Given the potential for errors, [[metric system|metric]] equivalents should always be used.
*The degree symbol (°), which is commonly used as an abbreviation for hours (e.g., "q 2-4°" for every 2–4 hours), should not be used, since it can be confused with a '0' (zero). Further, the use of the degree symbol for primary, secondary, and tertiary (1°, 2°, and 3°) is discouraged, since the former could be confused with quantities (i.e. 10, 20 and 30, respectively).

===Abbreviations===
{{See also|List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions}} Many abbreviations are derived from Latin phrases.  Hospital pharmacies have more abbreviations, some specific to the hospital.  Different jurisdictions follow different conventions on what is abbreviated or not. Prescriptions that do not follow area conventions may be flagged as possible forgeries.

Some abbreviations that are ambiguous, or that in their written form might be confused with something else, are not recommended and should be avoided. These are included in a separate list in Appendix 1.{{Clarify|reason=what/where is appendix 1?|date=September 2017}} However, all abbreviations carry an increased risk for confusion and misinterpretation and should be used cautiously.

==In continental Europe==
[[File:Chambers 1907 p 1172 prescription example.png|thumb|An example of a medical prescription, published 1907.|thumb|An example prescription from 1907.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

In continental Europe, prescriptions differ from their counterparts in the [[English-speaking world]]. With the exception of patient directions, they are written out entirely in [[List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions|abbreviations]] deriving from the [[Latin language]]. Furthermore, a larger proportion of prescriptions are compounded, and appropriate abbreviations and phrases exist for this. Many medical schools require up to two years of Latin as part of the curriculum for medical doctors and pharmacists.

===Parts of a European prescription===
A continental European prescription consists of three parts:

* the ''praescriptio'' is the prescription itself; that is, directions to the [[dispensing pharmacist]] to supply [[medication]], made up of the following:
** the ''invocatio'', consisting of the abbreviation ''Rp''; this is analogous to the ''Rx'' used in the English-speaking world, and stands for ''recipe'', Latin for ''take [from the shelf]''; and
** the ''ordinatio'', also known as the ''compositio'', which consists either of the brand name, strength, and number and type of dosage units of a particular drug, or else of directions written entirely in the Latin [[accusative case]], with the exception of ingredient names, written in the [[genitive case]].  Masses are written in [[grammes]], without the unit name.  The ''compositio'' is followed by
** the ''subscriptio'', which consists of the directions according to which the medicament is to be prepared.  An important part of this is the ''signatura'', which is directed towards the patient and explains how to use the medication.  Unlike the rest of the prescription, the ''signatura'' is written in the national [[vernacular]].

===Other conventions===
Should a patient require a dosage in excess of the maximum as established by the appropriate governmental body, this is marked by an exclamation mark and the highest recommended dosage in Latin.  If this is not done, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist to contact the doctor as to dose requirements, or amend the dose to the highest recommended one.

In emergency situations, a prescription pad may not be available. In this situation, any piece of paper will do, provided it is marked ''Periculum in mora!''; that is, ''danger in delay'' (other designations, such as ''Cito!'' or ''Statim!'', are also used and understood). Such ad-hoc prescriptions have a limited period of validity; typically, this is the day after the prescription is written.

A doctor may self-prescribe, or prescribe for their family; this is done by replacing the ''signatura'' by the Latin phrase ''pro manus medici'' (for medical hands) or ''ad usum proprium'' (for own use).  This is to be done with caution; certain drugs self-prescribed will arouse suspicion, and may result in investigation by the medical board or another governmental body.

Brand-name drugs may be swapped for [[Generic drug|generics]]; if this is not wanted by the doctor, they may write ''dispense as written'' in the local language on the prescription.

==Non-prescription drug prescriptions==
Prescriptions are also used for things that are not strictly regulated as a prescription drug. Prescribers will often give non-prescription drugs out as prescriptions because drug benefit plans may reimburse the patient only if the over-the-counter medication is taken under the direction of a medical practitioner. Conversely, if a medication is available over-the-counter, prescribers may ask patients if they want it as a prescription or purchase it themselves. Pharmacists may or may not be able to price the medication competitively with over-the-counter equivalents. If the patient wants the medication not under prescription, the prescriber is usually careful to give the medication name to the patient on a blank piece of paper to avoid any confusion with a prescription.  This is applied to non-medications as well. For example, crutches, and registered massage therapy may be reimbursed under some health plans, but only if given out by a prescriber as a prescription. Some software now requires a prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferdman|first=Roberto A.|title=The world’s first prescription-only smartphone app|url=http://qz.com/163792/the-worlds-first-prescription-only-smartphone-app/|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescribers will often use blank prescriptions as general letterhead.  Legislation may define certain equipment as "prescription devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=801.109 |title=CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prescription devices can only be used under the supervision of authorized personnel and such authorization is typically documented using a prescription. Examples of prescription devices include [[dental cement]] (for affixing [[dental brace|braces]] to tooth surfaces), various prostheses, gut sutures, [[Sickle cell trait|sickle cell]] tests, cervical cap and ultrasound monitor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In some jurisdictions, [[Hypodermic syringe|hypodermic syringes]] are in a special class of their own, regulated as illicit drug use accessories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1954&amp;ChapAct=720%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B635%2F&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;ChapterName=CRIMINAL+OFFENSES&amp;ActName=Hypodermic+Syringes+and+Needles+Act%2E | title = (720 ILCS 635/) Hypodermic Syringes and Needles Act | work = Illinois Compiled Statutes}}&lt;/ref&gt; separate from regular medical legislation.  Such legislation will often specify a prescription as the means by which one may legally possess syringes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Related usage of the term ''prescription''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

'''''Prescription''''' may also be used as a short form for '''[[prescription drug]]s''' to distinguish from [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] drugs. In reference to the entire system of controlling drug distribution (as opposed to illicit drugs), "prescription" is often used as a metaphor for healthy directions from a prescribing medical practitioner. A [[green prescription]] is direction from a medical practitioner to a patient for exercise and healthy diet.

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hippocratic Oath]] --&gt;
The idea of prescriptions dates back to the beginning of history. So long as there were [[medication]]s and a [[writing system]] to capture directions for preparation and usage, there were prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacy.wsu.edu/History/history02.html |title=Pharmacy in Ancient Babylonia |work=History of Pharmacy |publisher=Washington State University College of Pharmacy |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818003836/http://www.pharmacy.wsu.edu/history/history02.html |archivedate=August 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern prescriptions are actually ''extemporaneous prescriptions'' (from the Latin ''ex tempore'' = at/from the time),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extemporaneous |title=Extemporaneous definition |publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the prescription is written on the spot for a specific patient with a specific ailment.  This is distinguished from a non-extemporaneous prescription that is a generic recipe for a general ailment.  Modern prescriptions evolved with the separation of the role of the pharmacists from that of the physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6lWNwuO-f0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=on+the+historical+origin+of+the+pharmacist&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Making Medicines: A Brief History of Pharmacy and Pharmaceuticals|first=Stuart|last=Anderson|date=26 March 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|accessdate=26 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the term ''extemporaneous prescriptions'' is reserved for ''compound prescriptions'' that requires the pharmacist to mix or ''compound'' the medication in the pharmacy for the specific needs of the patient.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Predating modern legal definitions of a prescription, a prescription traditionally is composed of four parts: a ''superscription'', ''inscription'', ''subscription'', and ''signature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = A Compend of Materia Medica, Therapeutics, and Prescription Writing
| author =Potter, Samuel O.L.

| edition = sixth
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''superscription'' section contains the date of the prescription and patient information (name, address, age, etc.).  The symbol "℞" separates the superscription from the inscriptions sections.  In this arrangement of the prescription, the "℞" is a symbol for ''recipe'' or literally the imperative "take!"  This is an exhortation to the pharmacist by the medical practitioner, "I want the patient to have the following medication"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040602083443/http://www.vnh.org/HospitalCorpsman14295/14295_ch6.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=2 June 2004|website=archive.org|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in other words, "take the following components and compound this medication for the patient."

The ''inscription'' section defines what is the medication. The inscription section is further composed of one or more of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri26chisrich#page/792/mode/2up/search/Therapeutics |title=Therapeutics |publisher=LoveToKnow Free Online Encyclopedia |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a ''basis'' or chief ingredient indended to cure (''curare'')
* an ''adjuvant'' to assist its action and make it cure quickly (''cito'')
* a ''corrective'' to prevent or lessen any undesirable effect (''tuto'')
* a ''vehicle'' or ''excipient'' to make it suitable for administration and pleasant to the patient (''jucunde'')

The ''subscription'' section contains dispensing directions to the pharmacist. This may be compounding instructions or quantities.

The ''signature'' section contains directions to the patient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/signature |title=Signature definition |publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often abbreviated "Sig."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/S0399600.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826005049/http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/S0399600.html |date=August 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Signa."&lt;ref&gt;Ansel, H. ''Pharmaceutical Calculations''. 13th edition, Philadelphia. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins. 2010. p59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also obviously contains the signature of the prescribing medical practitioner though the word ''signature'' has two distinct meanings here and the abbreviations are sometimes used to avoid confusion.

Thus sample prescriptions in modern textbooks are often presented as:
 '''℞:'''  medication
 '''Disp.:'''  dispensing instructions
 '''Sig.:''' patient instructions

==Use of technology==
{{further|Electronic prescribing}}{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}{{Globalize/US|section|date=September 2017}}

As a prescription is nothing more than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. [[Medical information system]]s in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using [[smartcard]] or the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2002/1435/06/14350156b-abs.html |title=IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT ([[NPfIT]]) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.

Within computerized pharmacies, the information on paper prescriptions is recorded into a database. Afterwards, the paper prescription is archived for storage and legal reasons.

A pharmacy chain is often linked together through corporate headquarters with [[computer networking]]. [[Walgreens]], for example, uses satellite technology to share patient information.  A person who has a prescription filled at one branch can get a refill of that prescription at any other store in the chain, as well as have their information available for new prescriptions at any branch.

Some [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]] also offer services to customers over the internet. Walgreens' web site, for example, allows customers to order refills for medicine over the internet, and allows them to specify the store that they will pick up the medicine from.  Their web site also allows consumers to look up their prescription history, and to print it out.

Many pharmacies now offer services to ship prescription refills right to the patient's home. [[CVS/pharmacy|CVS]], for example, will ship refills free of charge. They also offer mail service where you can mail in a new, original prescription and a signed document, and they will ship the filled prescription back to you.

Pharmacy information systems are a potential source of valuable information for pharmaceutical companies as it contains information about the prescriber's prescribing habits.  Prescription [[data mining]] of such data is a developing, specialized field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many prescribers lack the digitized information systems that reduce prescribing errors.&lt;ref&gt;Zwarenstein 2007&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce these errors, some investigators have developed modified prescription forms that prompt the prescriber to provide all the desired elements of a good prescription. The modified forms also contain pre-defined choices such as common quantities, units and frequencies that the prescriber may circle rather than write out. Such forms are thought to reduce errors, especially omission and handwriting errors and are actively under evaluation. (See: Kennedy AG, Littenberg B. A Modified Outpatient Prescription Form to Reduce Prescription Errors. ''Joint Commission Journal of Quality and Safety'' 2004; 30:480-487.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">The '''National Committee for West Papua''' (abbreviated '''KNPB''' or '''Komite Nasional Papua Barat''') was established on 19 November 2008 by a number of Papua NGOs. It is a [[Papuan peoples]]' organization campaigning, in a non-violent way, for a referendum for the Papuan people of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] (i.e. the [[Indonesia]]n [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] of [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]). The right to self-determination was withheld, though this the exercise of this right was provided for in the agreement between the governments of The Netherlands, Indonesia and the UN in 1962.

==Activities==
The [[International Parliamentarians for West Papua]] (IPWP) and the [[IPWP#International Lawyers for West Papua|International Lawyers for West Papua]] (ILWP) support the case of the KNPB, using legal methods to realize the right to self-determination of the Papuan people of West Papua&gt; They recognize the West Papua National Committee as the local advocate for self-determination,&lt;ref name=JP/&gt; according to Mario Pigei of the KNPB. At a KNPB rally marking the registration of the IPWP and ILWP at the [[European Union]] in [[Brussels]], coordinator Mario Pigei said  "Human rights violations continue being committed in Papua with the killings of Papuan leaders like [[Kelly Kwalik]]"&lt;ref name=JP&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/01/28/papuans-rally-gain-international-support.html Papuans rally to gain international support]; Markus Makur, [[The Jakarta Post]], Timika. 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The KNPB tries to achieve its goals through non-violent means and with dignity. KNPB cooperates with the [[International Parliamentarians for West Papua]] and the International Lawyers for West Papua (ILWP). KNPB was formed in 2008 in Jayapura by various Papuan NGOs. 

In April 2009, eight protesters were killed by police during a demonstration, organized by the KNPB,involving more than 15,000 people. A police officer was wounded by an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westpapua.ca/?q=en/comment/reply/526  Pre-Election Human Rights Report] Westpapua. 9 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, at the suggestion of the KNPB, hundreds of Papuan students in Java, Bali, Makassar and Manado made an exodus back to Papua to set up shelters in the field in Sentani, where [[Theys Eluay]] is buried. They were, however, chased from  there by the police. Several students were arrested and imprisoned.

On 22 March 2010, the KNPB organized a series of new street demonstrations. Fifteen participants were arrested after police used firearms to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etan.org/issues/wpapua/2010/1004wpap.htm West Papua Report], April 2010, Issues. [[East Timor and Indonesia Action Network]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In November 2010, the Congress of the KNPB elected Buchtar Tabuni as chairman, Augustine Trapen as Secretary, Mako Tabuni as Vice-Chairman, and Victor Yeimo as International Spokesperson. KNPB branches were established in almost all regions of West Papua. The KNPB has also representatives in Jakarta and Manado. The KNPB has a strong international network. 

Buchtar Tabuni and [http://kontinum.org/2011/08/wawancara_victor_papua/ Victor Yeimo] were both arrested and sentenced to three years' imprisonment charged with incitement and a breach of the security of the state of Indonesia. In 2011 Buchtar was again imprisoned, charged with destroying prison property, while in custody. His deputy, [[Mako Tabuni]], was assassinated on 14 June 2012 by plain cloth police officers, members of the anti terrorist unit [[Densus 88]]. Victor Yeimo succeeded Buchtar Tabuni as chairman, but went immediately in hiding as the police was also after him.

The KNPB has been successful in mobilizing thousands of people in almost all regions of West Papua. On 2 August 2011, the ILWP organized a Conference to seek legal ways to resolve the political status of West Papua. The present status is considered illegal as the population never was enabled to exercise the right to self-determination to which it was entitled according to international treaties, which were supervised by the UN.

The '''National Party South Africa''' ('''NP''') is a registered [[politics of South Africa|South African political party]], who competed for the [[Western Cape]] province in the [[South African general election, 2009|2009 provincial election]] and municipal council seats in the [[South African municipal election, 2011|2011 local government elections]].

==History==
On 5 August 2008 a new party using the National Party name was formed and registered with the [[Independent Electoral Commission (South Africa)|Independent Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref name=NP-ReturnOfTheNats&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Nats|url=http://www.nationalparty.co.za/0003.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201191607/http://www.nationalparty.co.za/0003.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 December 2008|work=National Party Press Releases|accessdate=25 April 2011|quote=The National Party (NP) regrouped and reregistered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) as a political party on all levels of government. The National Party reregistered as National Party South Africa (NP) and resurfaces as a mainstream political contender in post 1994 South African politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial leadership was held by [[David Sasman]], [[Juan-Duval Uys]], [[Abdullah Omar (South African politician)|Abdullah Omar]], (all previously with the controversial [[National People's Party (South Africa)|National People's Party]] [NPP]) and a fourth person, not immediately named, who later turned out to be [[Achmat Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Independent Democrat a National Party co-founder|url=http://www.nationalparty.co.za/0034.htm|work=National Party Press Releases|accessdate=23 May 2011|quote=Achmat Williams, a former National Party councillor, later also councillor for the Independent Democrats (ID), was appointed as our National Director Marketing and serves on the NP National Executive with David Sasman, Juan-Duval Uys and Abdullah Omar.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, a former [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party (NNP)]] politician, was a member of the [[Independent Democrats]] before co-founding the new party. Other than some low-level former members, the new party had no formal connection with the now defunct NNP. The relaunched National Party of 2008 promotes a non-racial democratic South Africa based on federal principles and the legacy of [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|FW De Klerk]].&lt;ref name=NP-ReturnOfTheNats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/return-of-the-apartheid-party-912336.html|title=Return of the apartheid party|first=Ian|last=Evans|publisher=The Independent|date=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20080824084245354C368343|title=NP is back, itching for a fight|first=Janet|last=Smith|publisher=Independent Online|date=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A press release issued by Jean-Duval Uys on the party's website, dated 22 January 2009, deals with a [[Cape High Court]] challenge against Uys by Williams and Omar on behalf of themselves and Sasman for leadership of the party&lt;ref name=NP-HighCourt&gt;{{cite web|title=Tear-in-eye remark could not save axed Nats in High Court|url=http://www.nationalparty.co.za/0080.htm|work=National Party Press Releases|accessdate=25 April 2011|quote=Axed Western Cape members under the umbrella of Abdulla Omar and Achmat Williams, today tried in vain to obtain an urgent interim High Court interdict to remove the IEC-registered NP National leader. Williams and Omar filed for a court interdict against both Juan-Duval Uys (NP National leader) and the Electoral Independent Commission (IEC).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of the [[South African general election, 2009|2009 General Election]]. Before the court case was finalised, Uys announced that he had joined the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Juan Duval Uys joins Cope|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Juan-Duval-Uys-joins-Cope-20090204|accessdate=24 May 2011|newspaper=News24|date=4 February 2009|agency=SAPA|quote=Self-appointed former leader of the recently-resurrected National Party, Juan Duval Uys has joined Cope, he announced on Wednesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams is now listed as the national leader on the party's website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18281">The '''National electronic Library for Health''' (NeLH) was a digital library service provided by the NHS for healthcare professionals and the public between 1998 and 2006. It briefly became the National Library for Health and elements of it continue to this day as [[NHS Evidence]], managed by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]], and a range of services provided by [https://hee.nhs.uk/work-programmes/library-and-knowledge-services/ Health Education England's Library and Knowledge Service Leads].

==Policy origins==
Looking back from the mid 1990s the NHS Library Adviser [https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaret-haines-7b24975 Margaret Haines] observed that during the 1980s NHS libraries had failed to capitalise on opportunities becoming available to them to advance their services and demonstrate their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haines|first1=Margaret|editor1-last=Bakker|editor1-first=Suzanne|title=Health Information Management: what strategies?

Her concerns echoed those voiced by other senior NHS librarians. Judy Palmer, head librarian for the Oxfordshire region found that 'libraries were becoming increasingly marginalised, librarians were facing competition from other providers, that there were no recognisable national strategies, that there was massive duplication, fragmentation and information hoarding'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orna|first1=Elizabeth|title=Practical information policies|date=1999|publisher=Gower|location=London|isbn=0566076934|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to such concerns the British Library organised a seminar on NHS libraries, which came to be known as the Cumberlege Seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=British Library|title=Health care information in the UK: report of a seminar held in ist July 1992 at the Kings Fund|date=1992|publisher=British Library|location=London|ref=R&amp;D Report 6089}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed a year later by a second seminar held at the Kings Fund in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=British Library|title=Managing the knowledgebase of health care|date=1994|publisher=British Library|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the role of NHS Library Adviser was established (Margaret Haines being the first incumbent, followed by Veronica Fraser). A [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100604100036/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Healthserviceguidelines/DH_4018488 Health Service Guideline on NHS libraries] was published in 1997, and a number of local initiatives took place, among them the establishment of an innovative project in Oxford to increase the use of the [[World Wide Web]] in NHS libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=Judy|last2=Chippendale|first2=Myles|title=The NHS, the Internet and Libraries: The NHS Anglia and Oxford Internet Project|journal=Ariadne|date=1997|url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue9/nhs|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an open access digital library of high quality health related information was suggested by [[Muir Gray|JA Muir Gray]] to [https://books.google.es/books?id=QqWRcnMUkLQC&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;ots=2VB6ya6Ez5&amp;dq=frank%20burns%20nhs&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=frank%20burns%20nhs&amp;f=false Frank Burns] CBE, at the time Chief Executive of Wirral NHS Trust Warrington and leading the development of [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4014469.pdf Information for Health], an IT strategy for the NHS 1998-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Sean|title=Interview with Frank Burns|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=QqWRcnMUkLQC&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;ots=2VB6ya6Ez5&amp;dq=frank%20burns%20nhs&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=frank%20burns%20nhs&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy stated:

''A National Electronic Library for Health including accredited clinical reference material will be established.''&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health (UK). ''Information for Health: An information strategy for a modern NHS 1998-2005'', September 1998 p 60 available from http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4014469.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creating The National Electronic Library for Health ==

Implementation of the NeLH began in October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toth|first1=B|last2=Muir Gray|first2=JA|last3=Fraser|first3=V|last4=Ward|first4=R|title=National electronic Library for Health: progress and prospects|journal=Health Libraries Review|date=2000|volume=17|pages=46–50|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23698428_National_electronic_Library_for_Health_progress_and_prospects}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Ward, a senior civil servant at the Department of Health, convened a meeting of interested parties in Leeds. Following from that meeting an implementation plan was developed by Ben Toth and Muir Gray and signed off by the Department of Health. A programme board was established; members included the NHS Library Adviser Veronica Fraser, a senior regional IMT Adviser Jeremy Thorp, and Bob Gann who was leading the development of [[NHS Direct|NHS Direct online]]. The NeLH programme was included in the first portfolio of the [[NHS Information Authority]]; work began on implementation in January 1999, with the appointment of a project manager, Peter Bladen, and a project assistant Carol Shanley, based in the NHSIA's temporary offices in Calthorpe Road, Birmingham. The NeLH office later transferred to Aqueous II, Birmingham. Implementation began with the development of a business case and a pilot service to test the concept of the NeLH and provide [https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/departmental/informationstudies/research/projectreports/nelh-pilot-evaluation-report6.pdf evidence for the business case].

The Pilot NeLH was launched in November 2000, based around a central website (the core collection already in development via the then NHS Regional Librarians Group) with links to commissioned websites (specialist resources). Resources included a selection of evidence-based resources, some of which were restricted to (Cochrane Library and Clinical Evidence) NHSnet users only, a limitation which would be rectified in later years, and several Specialist (or Virtual Branch) Libraries covering primary care, infectious diseases, and emergency medicine, managed by Anne Brice. Over time the number of services increased, including a specialist medicines library and a federated search engine. Core staff numbered around 6 (later growing to over 30) in the early days of the library, including recruits and secondees from NHS libraries. An early goal was the establishment of a network of librarians across the NHS to promote the library, led by Alison Turner. Nick Rosen joined the team to promote the library, and Ian McKinnell joined later as technical lead.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=A|last2=Muir Gray|first2=JA|last3=Fraser|first3=V|last4=Toth|first4=B|title=A First Class Knowledge Service: establishing the NeLH|journal=Health Information and Libraries Journal|date=2002|volume=19|pages=133–45|doi=10.1046/j.1471-1842.2002.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pilot website was run from NHSIA servers, first in Bury St Edmunds and later in Exeter. The business case was developed by staff seconded to the NHSIA from the Department of Health and HM Treasury and went on to be commended by the Blair Government's Public Sector Productivity Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=July 2000|first1=Press Release|title=Maximising Value for Money in the NHS|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Pressreleases/DH_4005063|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080306062804/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Pressreleases/DH_4005063|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 March 2008|publisher=Department of Health|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a notable use of the [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/469317/green_book_guidance_public_sector_business_cases_2015_update.pdf Treasury 5 Case model]. The business case also became the subject of a chapter in ''Making Sense of Public Sector Investments''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Courtney|last2=Flanagan|first2=Joe|title=Making Sense of Public Sector Investments|date=2001|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=1857754328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following approval of the Full Business Case, procurement began, with the full service live in 2003.

== From NeLH to NLH to NHS Evidence ==
As part of its response to the [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090811143745/http:/www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/the_report.pdf Report of the Public Inquiry into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary] the Department of Health established the [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20040927084323/nks.nhs.uk/ National Knowledge Service] in 2003, tasking it with closer integration of digital and physical library services. A programme to establish a National Library for Health was established, which included a review from TFPL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=TFPL|title=The NHS Library policy review - developing the strategic roadmap|date=April 2004|url=http://www.sconul.ac.uk/sites/default/files/TFPL_Library_Review-1.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a cost analysis by Robert Huggins Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robert Huggins Associates|title=LISU|date=May 2005|publisher=Financing NHS Library and information services: final report|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/27egx26hxkaqezf/FinancingNHSLibrariesFINALREPORT20thMay2005.doc?dl=0|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and steps towards several NHS wide shared services, including: a [https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh6rmslyka0w4sz/ilds_strategic_business_case_v3.6.5.doc?dl=0 business case for a unified NHS document delivery service] developed by Bertha Man Low and colleagues; a question answering service; an NHS resolver and underlying enterprise architecture. With the demise of the NHSIA in 2005 the NeLH transferred its staff and operations to [[Connecting for Health]], the body responsible for implementing the [[NHS National Programme for IT]]. The operational base remained in Birmingham but increasingly staff worked in the CFH main office in Leeds and also in London, first in Victoria and later at the CFH office in [http://www.bmahouse.org.uk/ BMA House] and a Department of Health office in [[Sea Containers House]] overlooking the River Thames. In 2008, with the National Programme for IT in decline, arrangements began to transfer the NeLH to [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]], where aspects of its service continues to operate, as [[NHS Evidence]] and with a range of electronic books, databases and electronic journals for use by NHS and other eligible staff procured by the HEE LKS Leads group.

== Successes and failures of the NeLH ==
The record of the NeLH shows a mixture of success, failure, and worthy experiment.

Successes include: the business case was recognized by HM Treasury as a model of its kind; the project was delivered to time and budget and became a valued service; funding was obtained to make the [[Cochrane Library]] available across the UK on a simple open basis; extra funding for [http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com/x/index.html Clinical Evidence] was secured from the Modernisation Fund; a [http://www.digitalhealth.net/news/20055/care-pathways-database-added-to-nelh care pathways database] was introduced; obstacles were overcome to make the [http://www.openathens.net/ Athens Access Management System] available to the NHS as part of the [http://nlhcms.library.nhs.uk/nlhdocs/TDAG_EABriefing02_0708.pdf NLH enterprise architecture]; [http://www.healthlanguage.com/ Health Language], a terminology service, was procured as a framework contract; the [[British National Formulary for Children|Children's BNF]] was introduced, funded by the Department of Health; [http://nicholaswilton.com/ Hitting the Headlines] and [http://zetoc.jisc.ac.uk/ Zetoc] were procured; the fee paid by the NHS to the [http://www.cla.co.uk/ Copyright Licensing Agency] was halved; co-operation with [[Jisc|JISC]] increased; the PRODIGY programme was cancelled and replaced by [http://prodigy.clarity.co.uk/ Clinical Knowledge Summaries]. Funding was found to support for the regional pharmacy information services; an [http://www.hlisd.org/ online directory of library service points] was funded; an [http://nlhcms.library.nhs.uk/nlhdocs/Link_Resolver1.pdf NHS link resolver] was implemented.

Among the failures: a [[z39.50]] federated search supplied by Fretwell Downing could not be made to work; attempts to base the [http://www.cla.co.uk/services/licences_available/nhs/ CLA licence] on actual usage foundered; work with JISC to reduce [[:wikt:double-dipping|double-dipping]] by academic publishers across HE-NHS made little progress; reform of the NHS libraries regional structure was only partly successful and the vision of a unified networked library for the NHS didn't survive; integration with CFH products and services was less than anticipated; a strategic partnership with [http://mapofmedicine.com/ Map of Medicine] fell foul of the CFH commercial directorate; a planned partnership with [https://web.archive.org/web/20160125050331/http://www.isabelhealthcare.com/home/default ISABEL] didn't survive the CFH procurement process. Plans to implement an NHS wide deal with [[Biomed Central]] were initiated but didn't progress.  Perhaps the key failures were not to embed the vision of NLH in the hearts and minds of senior stakeholders and those it was intended to serve, and to pay too little attention to sustainability.

Experiments included: a pilot of [https://www.libqual.org/home LibQual]; the development of an [http://www.hl7.org.uk/hl7ukconferencesite/GordonPaper.ppt XML standard for representing clinical guidelines]; a [[DSpace]] implementation hosted by Hewlett Packard Laboratories; an RSS feed manager developed by Microsoft as part of its [http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/cui NHS Common User Interface] project; and a browser based calendar and communication tool known as MyWorkPlace - a great idea but technically ahead of the technology available to the NHS at the time.

== Legacy ==
Seventeen years on from its conception many of the services offered by NeLH is still in place, albeit under the auspices of two different organisations: NICE for access to core digital content and Health Education England Library and Knowledge Service Leads for funding that content, undertaking overarching strategic development of healthcare library and knowledge services (LKS) as a business asset, and for developing the LKS workforce. Some elements of the NeLH infrastructure are still visible, notably [[OpenAthens]], and the single-search engine (Healthcare Databases Advanced Search (HDAS)). The vision of a unified, seamless NHS library service for all staff and service users is now championed by Health Education England's [http://hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/blogs.dir/321/files/2014/12/Knowledge-for-healthcare-framework.pdf Knowledge for Healthcare: a development framework for NHS Library and Knowledge Services in England]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/blogs.dir/321/files/2014/12/Knowledge-for-healthcare-framework.pdf|title=Knowledge for Healthcare: a development framework for NHS Library and Knowledge Services in England|last=Health Education England|first=|date=2014|website=http://hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/blogs.dir/321/files/2014/12/Knowledge-for-healthcare-framework.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320001226/http://hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/blogs.dir/321/files/2014/12/Knowledge-for-healthcare-framework.pdf|archive-date=2015-03-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Acknowledging that many issues remain including: complexity of funding (with associated uncertainty of service offer, duplication, and inefficiency); and a lack of integration across the wider NHS and social care systems, local NHS library and knowledge services continue to offer a range of vital services and resources, underpinning decision making from the boardroom to bedside.

== HEE’s proactive strategy ==
In 2016 Health Education England published a policy statement on library and knowledge services&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hee.nhs.uk/our-work/research-learning-innovation/healthcare-library-knowledge-services/our-policy|title=Library and Knowledge Service Policy|last=Health Education England|first=|date=20 September 2017|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302002722/https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/research-learning-innovation/healthcare-library-knowledge-services/our-policy|archive-date=2017-03-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaces the 1997 Health Service Guideline on Library Services HSG(97)47. The policy reminds us that: 

"The Secretary of State for Health has a duty, under the ''Health and Social Care Act 2012'', to ensure “the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research”.

HEE commits to:

· Enabling all NHS workforce members to freely access library and knowledge services so that they can use the right knowledge and evidence to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement. 

· Developing NHS librarians and knowledge specialists to use their expertise to mobilise evidence obtained from research and organisational knowledge to underpin decision-making in the National Health Service in England. 

· Developing NHS library and knowledge services into a coherent national service that is proactive and focussed on the knowledge needs of the NHS and its workforce. 

So key parts of the NeLH and NLH legacy continues into the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.

A '''national library''' is a [[library]] established by a government as a country's preeminent repository of information. Unlike [[public library|public libraries]], these rarely allow citizens to borrow books. Often, they include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. A National Library is that library which has the duty of collecting and preserving the literature of the nation within and outside the country. Thus, National Libraries are those libraries whose community is the nation at large. Examples include the [[British Library]], and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Line, Maurice B. 2011 pp. 317"&gt;Line, Maurice B.; Line, J. (2011). "Concluding notes". ''National libraries'', Aslib, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ifla.org"&gt;Lor, P. J.; Sonnekus, E. A. S. (2010). [http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm "Guidelines for Legislation for National Library Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813200532/http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm |date=13 August 2006 }}, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]]. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis to the repository character.&lt;ref name="Line, Maurice B. 2011 pp. 317"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ifla.org"/&gt;

National libraries are usually notable for their size, compared to that of other libraries in the same country. Some states which are not independent, but who wish to preserve their particular culture, have established a national library with all the attributes of such institutions, such as [[legal deposit]].

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties. National libraries of Europe participate in [[The European Library]]. This is a service of The Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

==History==

===Origins===
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|200x200px|The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is but one of the treasures collected by [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]].]]
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the [[England|English]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[John Dee]], who in 1556 presented [[Mary I of England]] with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) ''John Dee: 1527–1608''. London: Constable and Company [http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/ Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Sir [[Richard Bentley]]'s ''Proposal for Building a Royal Library'' published in 1694 stimulated renewed interest in the subject. [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]], a wealthy [[antiquarian]], amassed the richest private collection of [[manuscript]]s in the world at the time and founded the [[Cotton Library]]. After the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], many priceless and ancient manuscripts that had belonged to the monastic libraries began to be disseminated among various owners, many of whom were unaware of the cultural value of the manuscripts.  Sir Robert's genius was in finding, purchasing and preserving these ancient documents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Aikin]]. ''The Lives of John Selden, Esq., and Archbishop Usher; With Notices of the Principal English Men of Letters with Whom They Were Connected''. 1812. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death his grandson donated the library to the nation as its first national library. This transfer established the formation of the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/manuscripts/cottonmss/cottonmss.html |title=Cotton Manuscripts |publisher=[[British Library]] |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'An Act for the better settling and preserving the Library kept in the House at Westminster called Cotton House in the Name and Family of the Cottons for the Benefit of the Publick [Chapter VII.

[[File:Sir Hans Sloane, an engraving from a portrait by T. Murray.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Hans Sloane]]'s collection of books and manuscripts was bequeathed to the [[British Museum]].]]
The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the [[British Museum]].
This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], who gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html|title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum|publisher=Fathom|accessdate=4 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102202555/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html|archivedate=2 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, as well as [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also incorporated the [[Cotton library]] and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harleian library]]. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[British monarchy|British monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition galleries and [[Library|reading room]] for scholars opened on 15 January 1759,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33121&amp;amid=30262261 The British Museum Opened], History Today&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1757, King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely.

[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], seat of the [[British Museum|British Library]], founded in 1753.]]
[[Anthony Panizzi]] became the Principal Librarian at the British Museum in 1856, where he oversaw its modernization. During his tenure, the Library's holdings increased from 235,000 to 540,000 volumes, making it the largest library in the world at the time. Its famous circular [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]] was opened in 1857. Panizzi undertook the creation of a new catalogue, based on the "Ninety-One Cataloguing Rules" (1841) which he devised with his assistants.  These rules served as the basis for all subsequent [[library catalog|catalogue]] rules of the 19th and 20th centuries, and are at the origins of the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description|ISBD]] and of digital cataloguing elements such as [[Dublin Core]].

In France, the first national library was the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the [[Louvre Palace]] by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1368. At the death of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]], who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435.&lt;ref name=priebe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=National Library of France|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in 1461.&lt;ref name=staikos2012&gt;{{Citation |isbn = 978-1-58456-182-8 |publication-place = New Castle, DE |publisher= Oak Knoll Press |year= 2012 |title = History of the Library in Western Civilization: From Petrarch to Michelangelo |author = Konstantinos Staikos }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] transferred the collection in 1534 to [[Fontainebleau]] and merged it with his private library.

[[File:Jacques Auguste de Thou.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|As librarian of the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] transformed it into the largest library in the world at the time.]]
The appointment of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of [[Camille le Tellier de Louvois|Abbé Louvois]], Minister Louvois's son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the [[Jérôme Bignon|Abbé Bignon]], or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made which appeared from 1739–53 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and [[Joseph Van Praet]] it suffered no injury.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|radical phase]] of the [[French Revolution]] when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in September 1792, "the Assembly declared the ''Bibliotheque du Roi'' to be national property and the institution was renamed the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]''. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people."&lt;ref name=priebe&gt;Paul M. Priebe. "From Bibliothèque du Roi to Bibliothèque Nationale: The Creation of a State Library, 1789–1793." The Journal of Library History (1974–1987), Vol. 17, No. 4 (Fall, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the newly formed American republic, [[James Madison]] first proposed instituting a congressional library in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. ''The Library: An Illustrated History'' (New York, Skyhouse Publishing, 2012): 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] was established on April 24, 1800, when [[President of the United States|president]] [[John Adams]] signed an [[act of Congress]] providing for the transfer of the seat of government from [[Philadelphia]] to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 "for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ... and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them." Books were ordered from London and the collection, consisting of 740 books and 3 maps, was housed in the new [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].&lt;ref name="loc history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jefferson's Legacy • A Brief History of the Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html|date=March 6, 2006|accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Załuski Library]] of Poland was taken by Russia after the [[Partitions of Poland|country's partition]], and the collection formed the nucleus of the Russian [[National Library of Russia|Imperial Public Library]], established in 1795.]]
The [[National Library of Russia|Imperial Public Library]] was established in 1795 by [[Catherine the Great]], whose private collections included the domestic libraries of [[Voltaire]] and [[Diderot]], which she had purchased from their heirs. Voltaire's personal library is still one of the highlights of the collection. The plan of a Russian public library was submitted to Catherine in 1766 but the Empress did not approve the project for the imperial library until {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1795|16 May}}, eighteen months before her death.
The cornerstone of the foreign-language department came from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the form of [[Załuski's Library]] (420,000 volumes), nationalized by the Russian government at the [[Partitions of Poland|time of the partitions]].&lt;ref&gt;Малый энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона, published in the [[Imperial Russia]] in the early 1900s&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish-language books from the library (numbering some 55,000 titles) were returned to [[Poland]] by the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd. edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Germany was only constituted as a state in 1871, the first national library was set up in the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German revolutions of 1848]]. Various booksellers and publishers offered their works to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] for a parliamentary library. The library, led by Johann Heinrich Plath, was termed the ''Reichsbibliothek'' ("[[Reich]] library"). After the failure of the revolution the library was abandoned and the stock of books already in existence was stored at the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Reichsbibliothek von 1848 |title=Handbuch der historischen Buchbestände in Deutschland |editor-first=Bernhard |editor-last=Fabian |publisher=Olms Neue Medien |location=Hildesheim |year=2003 |url=http://fabian.sub.uni-goettingen.de/?Reichsbibliothek_Von_1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the town of Leipzig, seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair, the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and the Börsenverein der Deutschen Buchhändler (Association of German booksellers) agreed to found a [[German National Library]] in Leipzig. Starting January 1, 1913, all publications in German were systematically collected (including books from Austria and Switzerland).

==Legal deposit and copyright==
{{Main|Legal deposit}}
[[File:India_Education.jpg|right|thumb|[[National Library of India]], [[Kolkata]].]]

The principle of '''legal deposit''' applies in some countries.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]] restates the ''[[Copyright Act 1911]]'', that one copy of every book published there must be sent to the national library (the [[British Library]]); five other libraries (the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford University, the [[Cambridge University Library]], the [[National Library of Scotland]], the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin]], and the [[National Library of Wales]]) are entitled to request a free copy within one year of publication. The international nature of the book publishing industry ensures that all significant English language publications from elsewhere in the world are also included.

In the Republic of Ireland, the ''[[Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000]]'' specifies that one copy of every book published is to be delivered to the [[National Library of Ireland]], the Trinity College Library, Dublin, the library of the [[University of Limerick]], the library of [[Dublin City University]], and the [[British Library]]. Four copies are to be delivered to the [[National University of Ireland]] for distribution to its constituent universities. Further, on demand in writing within twelve months of publication a copy is to be delivered to the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Scotland, and the National Library of Wales.
[[File:National Library, Singapore.JPG|thumb|left|[[National Library, Singapore|National Library Building]] in Singapore.]]
In Australia, the ''[[Australian copyright law|Copyright Act 1968]]'' and other state Acts requires that a copy of every book published in Australia be deposited with the [[National Library of Australia]], the relevant State Library for the state in which the book was published, and some states other libraries such as Parliamentary and university libraries.

A similar system also exists in Canada with respect to its national library, known as [[Library and Archives Canada]].

Since 1537, all works published in France must be deposited with the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. Since 1997, it has also received deposits of digital works.

Since 1661, the [[Swedish Royal Library]] has been entitled to a copy of all works published in Sweden.

In [[Singapore]], the ''[[National Library Board Act]]'' requires all publishers in Singapore to deposit two copies of every publication to the [[National Library Board]] at their own expense within four weeks from the publication date.

Other countries, like the United States, do not follow this requirement. The United States does, however, require that any publisher submit two copies of a copyrightable work to [[United States Copyright Office]] at the [[Library of Congress]] – this is known as ''mandatory deposit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/mandatory_deposit.html |title=U.S. Copyright Office - Mandatory Deposit (FAQ) |publisher=Copyright.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but the Library is selective about which works it retains. The international nature of the book publishing industry ensures that all significant English language publications from elsewhere in the world are also included. It also has the [[Federal depository library|Federal depository libraries]], which must receive a copy of all of the publications of the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]].

In addition to having a law requiring publishers to deposit books, those countries with legal deposits usually have many other incentives for a proper and speedy deposit, such as a tie-in with laws affecting [[copyright]] of the same documents, and/or a cataloguing- in- publication service.

Approximately three million new English-language books are retained by the [[British Library]] and [[Library of Congress]] each year.

==National bibliographic control==
[[File:National Library of Venezuela building 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Library of Venezuela]] in [[Caracas]].]]
One of the main goals of a national library is fulfilling their nation's part of the common international goal of [[universal bibliographic control]], by ensuring the [[bibliographic control]] of all the books or book-like documents published in that particular country or talking about that particular country, in any way.

The first part of the goal is usually achieved through the means of legal deposit laws or (as is the case of the United States) by a host of different programs such as a cataloguing in publication service.  By this service, the Library of Congress gives a complete [[library catalog|catalogue]] entry of a book to any publisher who sends a final draft or some form of galley proof of a book currently in production.  Other national libraries offer similar services or enforce mandatory practices similar to this.

The second part of the goal is achieved by thorough acquisition programs and [[collection development]] policies which target book markets in other nations, and which foster international agreements with other countries with national libraries who have national bibliographic control as one of their goals.  Exchange and access protocols are defined permitting these countries to read each other's catalogues, and to standardize catalogue entries, thus making it easier for each national library to become aware of every possible published document which might concern their country.

==International bibliographic control==
Another one of the main goals of many a national library is the "export aspect" and the collaborative sides of the universal bibliographic control of all the books in the world.  This is done by the exchanges and accords mentioned in the previous section, and also by fostering the creation of standard conceptual tools such as [[library classification]] systems and cataloguing rules.  The most commonly used of these tools is the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] or ISBD, which has served as a basis for national and international cataloguing codes, such as [[AACR2]].

The '''Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages''' of the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] is responsible for achieving the objectives of, and promoting, Canada's [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]. Canada has two official languages: [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]].

The 1988 Official Languages Act mandates this office and its commissioner, who holds office for seven years. Its mission has three main objectives: ensuring the equality of English and French within the Government of Canada and institutions subject to the Act; preserving and developing official language communities; and ensuring the equality of English and French in Canadian society at large.

==Commissioners of Official Languages==
From 1999 to 2006, the commissioner was Dr. [[Dyane Adam]], who was born in [[Casselman, Ontario]], and holds a doctorate in clinical psychology from the [[University of Ottawa]]. After the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|federal election of January 2006]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] requested that Dr. Adam prolong her term by a few months to give him time to find a suitable replacement. On September 13, 2006, he nominated [[Graham Fraser (journalist)|Graham Fraser]] for the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20060913/CPACTUALITES/609131921/5025/CPDMINUTE Harper propose Graham Fraser comme commissaire aux langues officielles] ([[Canadian Press]], September 13, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] nominated Raymond Théberge, the President and Vice-Chancellor of [[Université de Moncton]], as the commissioner replacing Fraser. The nomination was approved in December 2017, and Théberge is the first Commissioner from [[Western Canada]] and from outside [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="raymond"&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/11/30/prime-minister-nominates-next-commissioner-official-languages| title=Prime Minister nominates the next Commissioner of Official Languages| date=November 30, 2017| website=pm.gc.ca| publisher=[[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|PMO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raymondt"&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/12/14/prime-minister-welcomes-appointment-new-commissioner-official-languages| title=Prime Minister welcomes appointment of new Commissioner of Official Languages| date=December 14, 2017| website=pm.gc.ca| publisher=[[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|PMO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award of Excellence – Promotion of Linguistic Duality ==
In 2009, Commissionner Graham Fraser created the [[Award of Excellence – Promotion of Linguistic Duality]]. The prise is given annually by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages  to an individual or organization in Canada that is not subject to the federal ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' but that makes a difference by promoting linguistic duality in Canada or abroad, or by contributing to the development of [[Languages of Canada#Official Language Minority Communities|official language minority communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/en/news/releases/2010/2010-04-29|title=TFO’s Claudette Paquin wins the Award of Excellence – Promotion of Linguistic Duality|last=Office of the Commissionner of Official Languages|date=|website=www.ocol-clo.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Sea Harmony''' is a naval operation initiated by [[Turkey]] in March 2004 in accordance with [[UN Security Council Resolution]]s [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373|1373]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540|1540]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540|1566]] aimed at deterring terrorism and asymmetric threats in the [[Black Sea]]. It is similar to the [[NATO]]-led [[Operation Active Endeavour]] in the [[Mediterranean]], and also aims at ensuring the security of the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aydın|first1=Mustafa|title=Geographical blessing versus geopolitical curse: great power security agendas for the Black Sea region and a Turkish alternative|journal=Southeast European and Black Sea Studies|date=September 2009|volume=9|issue=3|pages=271–285|doi=10.1080/14683850902934283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was originally a national operation, Black Sea Harmony has become multinational with the participation of other Black Sea [[littoral]] states. Turkey extended invitations to each littoral state to join Black Sea Harmony.&lt;ref name="Triantaphyllou"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Triantaphyllou|first1=Dimitrios|title=The Security Context in the Black Sea Region|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781317966203|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation originally was conducted in Turkey's territorial waters and in open waters in the Black Sea. In order to deter possible risks and threats in the maritime area, the [[Turkish Navy]] conducted periodic surveillance and reconnaissance operations across the whole of the Black Sea. Statistics concerning suspect ships were collected and shared with NATO and other littoral nations. In case of hailing of a suspect ship, voluntary boarding (depending on the captain's will) is conducted. 

Permanent headquarters of Operation Black Sea Harmony is located in [[Karadeniz Ereğli|Eregli]], on Turkey's Black Sea coast. Once the Operation became multinational, other littoral States were able to send Liaison Officers to Eregli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aydın|first1=Mustafa|title=Turkish Policy towards the Wider Black Sea and the EU Connection|journal=Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies|date=17 July 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=383–397|doi=10.1080/19448953.2014.928541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Russia officially joined the Black Sea Harmony initiative to address new security challenges in region. A protocol on information exchange regarding Ukraine's participation was signed in Ankara on 17 January 2007.&lt;ref name="Triantaphyllou" /&gt;

There is an increasing trend for adult passports to be valid for ten years, such as a [[United Kingdom passport]], [[United States Passport]], [[New Zealand Passport]] (after 30 November 2015)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11529775&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Australian passport]]. A five year period of validity is also common (as used to be the situation for a [[Papua New Guinean passport]] or currently for an [[Indonesian passport]]. Some countries issue adult passports for periods between five and ten years, such as the [[Cuban passport]], which is valid for six years.

Some countries allow adult applicants to choose a passport validity, usually 5 or 10 years. For an example [[Canada]], [[Hungary]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]] &lt;small&gt;(3, 6 or 10)&lt;/small&gt;, [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]] or [[South Korea]].

===Child and young adult passports===
Most countries issue passports for children and young adults for five years, under passport issuing protocols a [[child]] or [[Youth|young adult]] [[passport]] is defined as being under 16 years for a [[United States Passport]], under 19 years for a [[Japanese Passport]], under 21 years for a [[Croatian passport]], under 24 years for a [[German passport]] or under 30 years as is the case with a [[Spanish passport]].

Because children change rapidly in appearance from infancy to age five, some countries issue infant passports for two years, such as the [[Austrian passport]], or for one year in the case of the [[Republic of Korea passport]].

Established in 1994 by the [[Government of Canada]] as the '''Lester B. Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training Centre''' (more commonly the '''Pearson Peacekeeping Centre''', or simply the''' Pearson Centre''') was an independent, not-for-profit organization with its office based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  Its mandate was to support [[Canada]]'s contribution to international peace and security. Operations ceased and the Centre closed on November 28, 2013.

The Pearson Centre conducted education, training and research on all aspects of peace operations throughout the world, with the majority of its projects under way in Africa and Latin America.  Services ranged from the training of police officers in Rwanda and Nigeria to serve as peacekeepers in Darfur; through delivery of pre-deployment training for Latin American peace keepers in Brasília; to the design and delivery of complex training exercises for use in Europe and Africa.

It also raised revenue through its specialized training and management courses, which it ran for individuals, governments and organizations around the world.

While in operation, the Pearson Centre worked with the [[Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre]] in [[Ghana]]. The Centre provideed facilitation support to the [[International Network to Promote the Rule of Law]], which is a project of the [[United States Institute of Peace|USIP]].  The International Association of Peacekeeping Training Centres was founded on July 2, 1995, at the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaptc.org/ International Association of Peacekeeping Training Centres&lt;/ref&gt; The Pearson Centre also worked closely with the Canadian extractive sector to implement the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights]] and provide training strategies to ensure that their security providers adhere to these international standards.

==History==
[[File:LPB quote on Peacekeeping Monument.jpg|left|thumb|Lester B. Pearson committed Canada to peacekeeping on November 2, 1956 - from on the Ottawa Peacekeeping Monument]]

The Lester B. Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training Centre was created as an offshoot of the now-defunct Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies and became an independent organisation in its own right in 2001. Named in honour of [[Lester Bowles Pearson]], the former [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and recipient of the 1957 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his role in the inception of [[peacekeeping]], the Centre was established initially to train Canadian and foreign soldiers in the art of peacekeeping and conflict resolution for postings with [[United Nations]] Peacekeeping missions.

[[Alex Morrison (Canadian Forces officer)|Alex Morrison]] was the first president of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, which was established in 1994 by the [[Government of Canada]]. He was followed by Sandra Dunsmore, and later [[Suzanne Monaghan]]. In 2012, the presidency of the Centre was assumed by Kevin McGarr, previously head of [[CATSA]].

In 1994, [[Jean-Jacques Blais]] was appointed chair of the centre, holding that position until he retired in 2002. Chairs have included several notable Canadians.

The centre was established at [[Cornwallis Park]], in southern [[Nova Scotia]], using facilities made available by the closure of [[CFB Cornwallis]]. Offices were later opened in Montréal, Ottawa and Halifax. Headquarters of the Centre were moved to the Ottawa office in 2008 while most of the operations remained in Cornwallis Park. The Montréal office was closed in 2008 and Halifax wound down by 2010.

As financial support to the centre was progressively withdrawn by the Federal government, operations were reduced and transferred to the Ottawa office.

==The Pearson Papers==
The Pearson Papers were a Canadian peacekeeping press publications compiled by the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre for over 15 years.  They were:

*''Pearson Paper 1: Public Information Campaigns in Peacekeeping: The UN Experience in Haiti''; by Ingrid Lehmann
**In this, the first of The Pearson Papers, Ingrid Lehmann explores "the development of Public Information Campaigns [in Haiti], both civil and military, from 1994 to 1996. The main innovation of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) was the introduction of the Military Information Support Teams (MIST)." MIST operations over three different phases of the peacekeeping mission in Haiti are examined: the initial deployments to Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy; UNMIH under United States leadership; and, UNMIH under Canadian leadership.
*''Pearson Paper 2: The Level Killing Fields of Yugoslavia: An Observer Returns''; by James V. Arbuckle
**In the second of The Pearson Papers, James Arbuckle provides a lucid and personal account of the post-conflict situation in the former Yugoslavia. The author comments on the implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords and analyzes the prospects for future peace in the region, through the prism of his considerable experience in military peacekeeping.
*''Pearson Paper 3: African Peacekeepers: Partners or Proxies?''; by Eric G. Berman and Katie Sams
**In this book, the third of The Pearson Papers, Eric G. Berman and Katie E. Sams examine current efforts to develop African peacekeeping and peace enforcement capabilities. They describe various Western and African capacity-building initiatives and attempts to resolve conflicts in Africa. Drawing on numerous interviews with policy makers and practitioners, they reveal the incongruities between Western “largesse” and African needs. Berman and Sams conclude that despite current Western and African efforts, the factors resulting in inaction four years ago in Rwanda still persist.
*''Pearson Paper 4: Intelligence In Peacekeeping: The Cloak and the Blue Beret: The Limits of Intelligence-Gathering in UN Peacekeeping''; by [[Walter Dorn]] and ''Out of the Closet: Intelligence Support for Post-Modern Peacekeeping''; by David Charters
**This Pearson Paper contains two distinct chapters by two separate authors both dealing with the topic of Intelligence in Peacekeeping. Dorn looks at the United Nations’ view of “intelligence,” its reluctance to utilize and that exact terminology. Dorn explores how intelligence is an essential part of UN peacekeeping. Charters’ central argument is that post-Cold War conflicts have changed dramatically the character of peacekeeping operations, and that the change will now require peacekeepers to apply the full range of intelligence capabilities in order to bring such conflicts under control.
*''Pearson Paper 5: The Laws of War and The Rules of Peace: Why Traditional Legal Models Do Not Work''; by Thomas B. Baines
**In this the fifth of The Pearson Papers, Thomas Baines presents some operational, moral and ethical challenges that arise in the context of non-traditional military operations. As well, he proposes some institutional formalisms to help limit the potential negative consequences of dealing with these challenges. His analysis and recommendations are framed for military policy makers and field commanders, rather than policy makers and executives of the other parties that may be involved in the types of missions discussed.
*''Pearson Paper 6: Confronting Rwandan Genocide: The Military Options What Could and Should the International Community Have Done?''; by Douglas Anglin
**In this the sixth of The Pearson Papers, this essay explores promising courses of action that, given the necessary political will, would have been militarily feasible and morally justifiable. It assesses realistically their prospects of success in checking the haemorrhage in Rwandan lives and identifies the circumstances and significance of the opportunities missed. Particular attention is paid to the time frame as, with each day’s delay, thousands of additional lives were lost. As the scale of the ethnic killing became evident, demands mounted that “something must be done”. Yet, little serious thought was paid to what that “something” realistically might be. Meaningful military intervention would have proved problematic. The operational constraints on intervening rapidly and effectively in the middle of Africa in a country with limited infrastructure could not be dismissed as insignificant — or insurmountable.
*''Pearson Paper 7: The 1999 United Nations and 2000 Organizations of African Unity Formal Inquiries: A Retrospective Examination of Peacekeeping and the Rwandan Crisis of 1994''; by Terry M. Mays
**This the seventh Pearson Paper, takes a different approach in analyzing the peacekeeping related failures within Rwanda and the United Nations headquarters. In 1999, the United Nations initiated the Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the United Nations During the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda. The following year the Organization of African Unity (OAU) opted to conduct its own independent investigation and established the International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding Events. This essay utilizes these independent investigations as the foundation for a review of the peacekeeping failure in Rwanda. Several factors for failure can be identified from the UN and OAU investigations and each is explored in this study. The essay also examines whether the 2,000-member UN peacekeeping operation on the ground in Rwanda could have halted the genocide if the political will existed to accomplish the task. Five options for the future are reviewed and a postscript includes a brief discussion on the relationship of state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention as seen through the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty.
*''Pearson Paper 8: Lessons Learned on UNMIK Judiciary''; by Mark Baskin
**This study was designed to review the experience of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) with judiciary capacity building. UNMIK is significant both because Kosovo is a linchpin of Balkan politics and diplomacy, and because it provides a laboratory for deriving lessons for future efforts at post-conflict governance and administration. The goal of the study was to enable policy makers to “learn the lessons of capacity building for a judiciary as a part of the mandate of a peace support cooperation if similar work in the future is to be more effective”. A direct result of this study, Pearson Paper 8, Lessons Learned on UNMIK Judiciary describes problems at each stage of judiciary building, how they were addressed, how they could have been addressed more effectively, and what changes would facilitate such improvements. After outlining the broader context in which the development of Kosovo’s judicial system takes place, this assessment will describe chronological developments in the judiciary. It then turns to broader themes and patterns in the establishment of the judiciary by focusing on the specific challenges that most characterized the development of the judiciary at each stage and to some underlying patterns in the development of Kosovo’s judiciary and concludes with some suggestions – both for the future of Kosovo’s judiciary and in other post-conflict administrations, as well.
*''Pearson Paper 9: On Issues and Initiatives: The International Red Cross in Times of Duress and Ambiguity'' 
**This volume focuses on issues specific to the International Red Cross.
*''Pearson Paper 10: Measures of Effectiveness: Peace Operations and Beyond''; Ann Livingstone, PhD, Editor, Aleisha Arnusch, MA, Managing Editor
**This volume contains diverse approaches to measurement and even differing conceptualizations of what peace operations today consist of, including those that go ‘beyond’ the traditional notion of peacekeeping.
*''Pearson Paper 11 (spring): Challenges of Effective Cooperation and Coordination in Peace Operations''; Ann Livingstone, Ph.D., Editor, Kristine St-Pierre, M.A., Managing Editor
**This volume considers the challenges of coordinating military, police and humanitarian actors, sometimes sharing but more often, co-habiting a common space in complex peace operations. Faced with diverse perspectives, lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities, and the need to identify lessons learned, they are finding new and innovative ways to collaborate and synchronize their actions.
*''Pearson Paper 11 (fall): Opportunities for Enhancing Cooperation and Coordination in Peace Operations''; Ann Livingstone, Ph.D., Editor, Kristine St-Pierre, M.A., Managing Editor
**This volume builds on the integration described in the previous volume. It presents four ways of thinking about integration in the context of peace operations specically and peace and security generally. Beyond simply acknowledging the need for greater cooperation and coordination in peace and security, the articles present different rationales and approaches for enhancing cooperation and coordination using examples from Africa, Asia and Latin America.
*''Pearson Paper 12: Environmental Considerations for Building Peace;'' Ann Livingstone, Ph.D., Editor, Kristine St-Pierre, M.A., Managing Editor 
**This study considers not only the logistical nature of geography in disputes, but also environmental health impacts. For example, when water contains metals, such as lead, consumers are less rational in their deliberations and more violent.   

As of 2013 the papers are no longer published.

The phrase "'''power behind the throne'''" refers to a person or [[cabal|group]] that informally exercises the real power of a high-ranking office, such as a [[head of state]]. In politics, it most commonly refers to a relative, aide, or nominal subordinate of a political leader (often called a "[[figurehead]]") who serves as ''[[de facto]]'' leader, setting policy through possessing great influence and/or skillful manipulation.

The original concept of a power behind the [[throne]] was a [[Medieval]]-era figure of speech referring to the fact that the [[monarch]]'s policies could be set by a counselor not seated in the throne but standing behind it&amp;mdash;perhaps whispering in the monarch's ear&amp;mdash;out of common sight.  Among the earliest examples of such powerful advisors were the [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]] under the [[Merovingian]] kings.

==In history==
Historical examples of a "power behind the throne" include: [[Nogai Khan]], [[Mamai]] and [[Edigu]] in the [[Golden Horde]]; [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]]; [[Chancellor of Germany]] and [[Minister President of Prussia]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], with [[German Emperor]] and [[King of Prussia]] [[William I of Germany|William I]] as a de facto [[figurehead]]; [[Martin Bormann]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[Genrō]] had this role in [[Meiji period]] of Japan. Another example is the rule of [[Pol Pot]] in Cambodia from 1975–78, who led the [[Khmer Rouge]] to victory following a devastating civil war. King [[Norodom Sihanouk]] returned to reign over Cambodia, but held no executive power.  

In the United States, [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith Wilson]]—second wife of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]—took over many of the routine duties and details of the government after her husband was incapacitated by a [[stroke]]. Another modern example was [[Deng Xiaoping]] in China, who was recognized as China's [[paramount leader]] without holding the position of either [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], [[President of the People's Republic of China|head of state]] or [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|head of government]].

Earlier examples include the ''[[Magister militum|magistri militum]]'' of the later decades of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Examples of such are [[Stilicho]] the general of Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], the power behind the throne of Honorius' nephew [[Valentinian III]], [[Ricimer]] the puppet master of Emperors [[Avitus]], [[Majorian]], [[Libius Severus]], [[Anthemius|Procopius Anthemius]] and [[Olybrius]], and then finally [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Flavius Orestes]], the father of the usurper emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]], and the [[Heruli|Germanic]] chieftain [[Odoacer]], who were the masters in the West during the reigns of Emperor [[Julius Nepos]] and then Orestes' son, the aforementioned Romulus. Odoacer then deposed [[Romulus Augustulus|the figurehead Roman ruler]], captured and executed Orestes, and established his own Italian kingdom as the ''[[King of Italy|Dux Italiae]]'', only to be overthrown by the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] chieftain [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] on the behest of the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]].

In Latin America, an example was Joseph-Marie Córdoba Montoya during the Presidency of [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] (1988–1994). Córdoba Montoya, a French naturalized Mexican, was the Head of the Office of the Presidency, and was considered the second-most powerful man in Mexico at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Bussey, "Joseph Marie Córdoba Montoya" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'' vol. 1. p. 344. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example in the same region is the one of the former general [[Manuel Noriega]], who was the military leader and the ''de facto'' [[President of Panama|chief of state of Panama]] from 1983 to 1989.

Notable Middle Eastern examples include the Crown Prince of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Muhammad bin Salman]] who effectively rules the country for his {{age|1935|12|31}}-year old father [[King Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40354415&lt;/ref&gt; In Qatar, [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]] was often called the power behind the throne of [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/qatars-succession-drama&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
A related term is ''[[éminence grise]]'' (French: "gray eminence"), a powerful advisor or decision-maker who operates secretly or otherwise unofficially. This phrase originally referred to [[Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal de Richelieu]]'s right-hand man, [[François Leclerc du Tremblay]] (also known as the ''Père Joseph''), a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friar]] who wore grey robes. Because the Cardinal de Richelieu, the power behind the throne of King [[Louis XIII of France]], as a [[Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] was styled ''Son Eminence'' ("His Eminence"), his alter ego Père Joseph was called ''l'éminence grise'' (which is also the English title of his biography by [[Aldous Huxley]]). [[Martin Bormann]] was referred to as the Brown Eminence, brown referring to the brown uniform of the [[Nazi Party]].

The [[Proconsul#Modern_analogy|modern usage of the term Proconsul]], as analogy for a person from a foreign power manipulating another country's internal affairs, is also referred as the ''power behind the throne''.

{{History of Korea}}
{{History of South Korea}}

The '''Korean Provisional Government''' ('''KPG'''), formally the '''Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea''' was a partially recognized Korean [[government-in-exile]], based in [[Shanghai]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], and later in [[Chongqing|Chungking]], during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule of Korea]].

On April 11, 1919, the provisional constitution was enacted, and the national sovereignty was called "Republic of Korea" and the political system was called "Democratic Republic". Introduced the presidential system and established three separate systems of legislative, administrative and judicial separation, the KPG inherited the territory of the former [[Korean Empire]] and stated that he favored the former imperial court. It actively supported and supported the independence movement under the provisional government, and received economic and military support from the [[Kuomintang]] of China, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].

After the [[Surrender of Japan]] on August 15, 1945, figures such as [[Kim Gu]] returned. On August 15, 1948, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was dissolved. Rhee, who was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, became the first [[President of South Korea|President of the Republic of Korea]] in 1948. The [[Constitution of South Korea]], which was amended in 1987, stated that the Korean people inherited the rule of the KPG.

== History ==
The government was formed on April 13, 1919, shortly after the [[March 1st movement]] of the same year during the Imperial Japanese colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Korean Tradition'', vol. 2, ''From the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Centuries'', edited by [[Yŏngho Ch'oe]], [[Peter H. Lee]], and [[William Theodore de Bary|Wm. Theodore de Bary]], Introduction to Asian Civilizations (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000), 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Key members in its establishment included [[An Changho]] and [[Syngman Rhee]], both of which were leaders of the [[Korean National Association]] at that time. An Changho played an important part in making Shanghai the center of the liberation movement and in getting KPG operations underway. As acting premier, he would help reorganize the government from a parliamentary cabinet system to a presidential system.

The government resisted the colonial rule of Korea that lasted from 1910 to 1945. They coordinated the armed resistance against the Japanese imperial army during the 1920s and 1930s, including the [[Battle of Chingshanli]] in October 1920 and the assault on Japanese military leadership in [[Shanghai]]'s [[Hongkou Park]] in April 1932.

This struggle culminated in the formation of [[Korean Liberation Army]] in 1940, bringing together many if not all Korean resistance groups in exile. The government duly declared war against the [[Axis powers]] Japan and Germany on December 9, 1941, and the Liberation Army took part in allied action in [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]] and parts of [[Southeast Asia]].

During [[World War II]], the Korean Liberation Army was preparing an assault against the Imperial Japanese forces in Korea in conjunction with American [[Office of Strategic Services]], but the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] prevented the execution of the plan. The government's goal was achieved with Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945, but they were not approved by other governments as a member of allied nations, who signed peace treaty with Japan in San Francisco.

The sites of the Provisional Government in [[Shanghai]] and [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) have been preserved as museums.

'''Sheila Ann Martin''' (née '''Cowan'''; born July 31, 1943) is the wife of [[Paul Martin]], who served as the 21st [[Prime Minister of Canada]] from December 12, 2003 to February 6, 2006. Her father was William "Bill" Cowan, a lawyer and philanthropist from [[Windsor, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/story.html?id=27d5dab0-6c6c-4414-8a66-d35bb12c2e0d |title=Windsor lawyer, philanthropist Cowan dies |publisher=canada.com |date=August 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924143927/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/story.html?id=27d5dab0-6c6c-4414-8a66-d35bb12c2e0d |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hell or High Water: My Life in and out of Politics |first=Paul |last=Martin |page=31 |isbn=978-0771056932 |publisher=Emblem Editions |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila was raised [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="Martin 2009 33"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hell or High Water: My Life in and out of Politics |first=Paul |last=Martin |page=33 |isbn=978-0771056932 |publisher=Emblem Editions |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hell or High Water: My Life in and out of Politics |first=Paul |last=Martin |page=32 |isbn=978-0771056932 |publisher=Emblem Editions |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and Paul were neighbours and her father was law partners with Paul Martin Sr in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. They were engaged over Christmas in 1964 and married on September 11, 1965.&lt;ref name="Martin 2009 33"/&gt; They have three sons: Paul William Martin III (born September 11, 1966), Jamie Robert Martin (born June 21, 1969), and David Patrick Martin (born September 13, 1974).

A [[Canada Steamship Lines]] ship, ''Sheila Ann'', is named in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2004/leadersparties/leaders/family_martin.html CBC – Canada Votes 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her husband became the Prime Minister of Canada, Sheila Martin's work in [[Ottawa]] included serving on a committee called Politics and the Pen, and on this committee she helped give prizes and money to Canadian writers.  The job was said to fit with her "own literary tastes."&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;John Gray, ''Paul Martin:  The Power of Ambition'', Key Porter Books, 2003, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, when Paul Martin left the cabinet, he credited her as a support to him and as an advisor:
:''Third, I want to thank the many friends who called or sent messages in recent days. I'm enriched by their friendship and their support. In that respect, I want to thank above all others Sheila and my family for their patience and their advice.''&lt;ref&gt;CBC.ca, "[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/06/03/martin_address020603.html Text of Paul Martin's statement]," June 3, 2002, URL accessed December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout these years, Sheila Martin apparently had little aspirations in regards to her husband's office.  Her husband's biographer [[John Gray (Canadian author)|John Gray]] quoted her as saying, "Oh, God, I don't want to do this at all, so I just don't think about it."&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">The '''Special Field Force''' (SFF) is a [[Namibia]]n [[Namibian Police Force|Police Force]] [[paramilitary]] [[police]] unit created in 1995 by the late commissioner [[Danger Ashipala|Ruben "Danger" Ashipala]] as an auxiliary aggressive unit to complement the [[Special Reserve Force]] (SRF). It encompasses border guards, [[Very Important Person|VIP]] Protection Unit and Installation unit. Approximately half of the Namibian Police's (NAMPOL) overall complement is assigned to the SFF which is made up primarily of combatants from the former [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) and [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-11-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the population the Special Field Force is seen as the less educated and more brutal wing of the Namibian Police. They have been implicated in the intimidation, assault, torture and also murder of civilians in the [[Caprivi conflict|secessionist uprisings]] in Namibia's [[Caprivi Strip]] in 1998 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also later, under normal and calm political conditions, human rights groups accused the Special Field Force of several atrocities, e.g.:

The '''State Hydraulic Works''' ({{lang-tr|Devlet Su İşleri}}) is a [[state agency]] organized under the [[Ministry of Environment and Forestry (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forestry]] of [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/kurumsal/yonetim.htm State Hydraulic Works Organization] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for the utilization of all the country's water resources. The institution's four major functions are energy, agriculture, services and environment.

==History==
Development of water resources in Turkey began with the establishment of the "General Directorate of Public Works" ({{lang-ota|Umur-u Nafia Müdüriyet-i Umumiyesi}}) by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Government]] in 1914. The institution started to undertake continuous and systematical studies on [[irrigation]], [[water reclamation|reclamation]], [[flood control]], navigation, water storage and distribution. 

in 1925, soon after the foundation of the Turkish Republic, regional offices were opened in [[Adana]], [[Ankara]], [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]], [[Edirne]] and [[Izmir]] under the "Waters Directorate". Due to insufficient financial resources and field observations data available, water projects could not be expedited as planned. Severe drought, occurred in 1929, led to the establishment of the more comprehensive institution of "Waters General Directorate". In 1939, it was reorganized in "Water Works General Directorate". The agency conducted studies on feasibility, planning, gauging and water level recording.

Finally in 1954, the institution was named "General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works" and assigned to the Ministry of Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/english/about/tarihcee.htm DSI History]&lt;/ref&gt; State Hydraulic Works was reassigned later to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. Since not a long time, the agency reports to the minister of environment and forestry.

==Organization==
The State Hydraulic Works is organized in three levels: The management, the department offices and the regional offices. While the first two levels are located in [[Ankara]], the 25 regional offices are  dispersed throughout Turkey.

Major functions of the regional offices are primarily collection of data in the field of mapping, conducting hydrometric measurements, surveying agricultural economy, land classification, drainage, [[groundwater]] and geology, and secondly to evaluate them for the planning, construction and operation of water structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/english/about/orge.htm DSI Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Since its establishment in 1954, State Hydraulic Works has made investments in the sector of energy for US$30.0 billion, agriculture for US$39.0 billion and services for US$12.0 billion, totaling up to US$81.0 billion.

===Energy===
Of the 135 [[hydroelectric power plant]]s (HEPP) in Turkey, State Hydraulic Works operates 53, which have a total installed capacity of 10,215 [[megawatt|MW]] (29% of the country's total electric power capacity) and generated in 2003 electricity of 35,329 [[GWh]] (25.1% of the total).

State Hydraulic Works has currently 24 HEPPs throughout the country under construction with a total installed capacity of 2,722 MW and annual generation of 8,920 GWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/english/service/enerjie.htm State Hydraulic Works Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[Image:Distribution canals-GAP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Distribution canals]]
Turkey has a total of 280,000 square kilometres of agricultural area, of which  85,000&amp;nbsp;km² is economically irrigable and 49,000&amp;nbsp;km² is currently being irrigated.&lt;ref name=Darama&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unido.org/file-storage/download/?file_id=84741 |title=Water Issues and the Role of State Hydraulic Works in Water Resources Development in Turkey|author=Yakup Darama}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, an area of 28,000&amp;nbsp;km² is equipped with facilities of State Hydraulic Works's irrigation projects, making 10% of the total agricultural area and 57% of the irrigated area in Turkey.&lt;ref name=Agriculture&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsi.gov.tr/english/service/tarime.htm|title=DSI Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southeastern Anatolia Project]] ({{lang-tr|Güneydoğu Anadolu Projesi}} or GAP), a very important integrated project for the economic and social development of the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Southeastern Anatolia Region]], includes active farming with extensive irrigation systems and electricity generation. The project area covers the lower parts of the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers in the 9 provinces of the region ([[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], [[Adıyaman Province|Adıyaman]], [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Şanlıurfa Province|Şanlıurfa]], [[Diyarbakır Province|Diyarbakır]], [[Mardin Province|Mardin]], [[Siirt Province|Siirt]], [[Batman Province|Batman]], and [[Şırnak Province|Şırnak]]), where a total of 6.5 million people live as of the 2000 census.

The project is one of the biggest investments of the last century undertaken by State Hydraulic Works and contains 13 sub-projects, 7 of which are in the Euphrates Basin and 6 of which are in the Tigris Basin. Within the scope of these 13 projects, 27,000 GWh hydroelectric energy will be produced annually with 7.5 GW installed capacity and 18,200&amp;nbsp;km² of land will be irrigated with the construction of 22 dams and 19 HEPPs.&lt;ref name=Agriculture /&gt;

[[Image:Ataturk dam 1-GAP.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Atatürk Dam]]
The [[Atatürk Dam]], the largest in Turkey and among the [[List of largest dams|world's largest dams]], is the centerpiece of the project.

===Services===
State Hydraulic Works is responsible by law for the supply of domestic and industrial water to settlements having population of more than 100,000. As of the 2000 census, there are 55 cities and towns in Turkey with populations over 100,000. State Hydraulic Works supply water to 26 million people&lt;ref name=Darama /&gt; in 45 cities at different regions.

As of the beginning of 2005, State Hydraulic Works supplied annually a total of around 2.5&amp;nbsp;km³ domestic water complying with drinking water standards. This figure will reach 5.3&amp;nbsp;km³ with completion of the projects which are under construction, or at the final design and planning stages. Water supply projects developed by State Hydraulic Works meet one third of the requirements for domestic and industrial water consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/english/service/icmekulsue.htm DSI Domestic water]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
The protection of nature and wildlife is of great importance for  State Hydraulic Works. It conducts activities on development of sustainable water resources, both independently and in collaboration with other related governmental and non-governmental organizations. State Hydraulic Works also provides financial and technical support to protect archaeological and historical sites for the next generations.

One of the basic duties and responsibilities of State Hydraulic Works is building and operating protective structures against floods. It takes the necessary precautions and warns the relevant organizations in the event of flood emergencies.

State Hydraulic Works conducts afforestation work and establishes recreation areas and facilities aiming at prevention of erosion, decreasing the sediment amount deposited in dams through rivers, restoring the environment of dam basins and their catchments. Tree planted areas  also serve as picnic areas and public promenades.

State Hydraulic Works needs to obtain land properties (real estates) for its development projects of water and land resources. Up to now, around 5,200&amp;nbsp;km² of private land was expropriated. 70,000 families and 350,000 people were relocated by dam projects. It is estimated that 50,000 families and 250,000 people more will be affected in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/english/service/cevree.htm DSI Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31370">'''Trade Adjustment Assistance''' ('''TAA''') is a federal program of the [[United States government]] to act as a way to reduce the damaging impact of imports felt by certain sectors of the U.S. economy.  The current structure features four components of Trade Adjustment Assistance: for workers, firms, farmers, and communities.  Each cabinet-level department was tasked with a different sector of the overall Trade Adjustment Assistance program.  The program for workers is the largest, and administered by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]].  The program for farmers is administered by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], and the firms and communities programs are administered by the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]].

==History==
Trade Adjustment Assistance consists of four programs authorized under the [[Trade Expansion Act of 1962]] and defined further under the [[Trade Act of 1974]] (19 U.S.C. § 2341 et seq) (Trade Act).  The original idea for a trade compensation program goes back to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Charnovitz]], "Worker Adjustment: The Missing Ingredient in Trade Policy," ''California Management Review'', Winter, 1986, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was proposed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] as part of the total package to open up free trade.  President Kennedy said: "When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John F. 1963. Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, 1963. Washington: Government Printing Office.  Copy online at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8688&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification==

===For workers===
Supporters argue that free trade offers widespread benefits among consumers, workers and firms in the U.S. in terms of lower prices, higher efficiency and quality, and more jobs. They claim that gains from negotiated trade deals are large and widely distributed across sectors.  For example, in 2011 there were 9.7 million jobs supported by exports, nearly 15% more than in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. International Trade Administration (March 12, 2012). Jobs Supported by Exports: An Update, by Johnson, M. and Rasmussen, C., Office of Competition and Economics Analysis Manufacturing and Services.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benefits from free trade agreements (FTA) with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, and South Korea for the U.S. economy are estimated in $4 billion, $17 billion, $19 billion, $6 billion and $30 billion, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service (February 1, 2011). Trade Agreements: Impact on the U.S. Economy, RL31932, by J. K. Jackson.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to achieve trade benefits, however, the U.S. economy must reallocate production factors between sectors. Thus, free trade also leads to costs associated with workers displaced by import competition and offshore outsourcing. According to the Department of Labor (DOL), displaced workers are defined as "persons 20 years of age and older who lost or left jobs because their plant or company closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished".&lt;ref name="Departmentof"&gt;Department of Labor (August 24, 2012). Worker Displacement: 2009–2011, USDL-12-1719, available at www.bls.gov/cps.&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Labour Organization (ILO) states that workers bore high adjustment costs such as unemployment, lower wage during transition, obsolescence of skills, training costs, and personal costs (e.g. mental suffering). These trade costs, albeit relatively smaller than the benefits, are highly concentrated by region, industry and worker demographics.  For instance, some occupations, like teacher, have not experienced import competition while for shoe manufacturing occupations import competition has increased by 40 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization (2011). Trade and Employment: From Myths to Facts, by Jansen, M., Peters, R. and Salazar-Xirinachs, J., available at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_162297.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, manufacturing workers are most affected by import competition compare to workers in other sectors. Furthermore, while gains from trade require a long time to take full effect, costs are felt rapidly, particularly in less competitive sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Commission of the European Communities (CEC) (March 1, 2006). Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of The Council establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, Impact Assessment, SEC (2006) 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong correlation between import penetration and unemployment. Ebenstein et al. (2009) find that a 1 percentage point increase in import penetration leads to a 0.6 percentage point decrease in manufacturing employment in the U.S. resulting in a reduction of manufacturing jobs of almost 5%.&lt;ref name="Ebenstein"&gt;Ebenstein, A. et al. (2009). Estimating the Impact of Trade and Offshoring on American Workers using the Current Population Surveys, NBER Working Paper 15107.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Progressive Policy Institute, between 2007 and 2011, 1.3 million direct and indirect jobs were lost to increasing imports of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) (March 2012). Hidden Toll: Imports and Job Loss since 2007, by Mandel, M. and Carew, G., Policy Brief, available at http://progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/03.2012-Mandel_Carew_Hidden-Toll_Imports-and-Job-Loss-Since-20071.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Kletzer (2005) estimations suggest that industries facing high import competition account for 40% of manufacturing job losses.&lt;ref&gt;Kletzer, L. (2005). Globalization and Job Loss, from Manufacturing to Services, Economic Perspectives, Q II, pp. 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimates that by 2015 the overall U.S. trade deficit will correspond to the loss of additional 214,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Economic Policy Institute (EPI) (August 23, 2012). The China Toll: Growing U.S. trade deficit with China cost more than 2.7 million jobs between 2001 and 2011, with job losses in every state, EPI Briefing paper nº345, by R. Scott, at http://www.epi.org/files/2012/bp345-china-growing-trade-deficit-cost.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trade-dislocated workers are not significantly different from workers displaced by other reasons, they present some slight differences. They tend to be older, less educated, more tenured and production-oriented, have higher earnings on the lost job and fewer transferable skills, and the prevalence on women is higher than for other displaced workers. These characteristics are associated with limited labor mobility and reemployment difficulties, especially for workers with obsolete skills who do not receive additional training, no matter the reason of displacement.&lt;ref&gt;GAO (November 14, 2012). Trade Adjustment Assistance: Commerce Program has helped Manufacturing and Services Firms, but Measures, Data, and Funding Formula could be enhanced, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Government Organization, Efficiency, and Financial Management, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, by Alfredo Gomez&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, asymmetric information in absence of good job-search skills and geographic mismatch lead to prolonged unemployment.&lt;ref name="BTradeadjustment"&gt;OECD (2005b). Trade-adjustment Costs in OECD Labour Markets: A Mountain or a Molehill?, in OECD Employment Outlook (pp. 23–72)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, trade-displaced workers face longer periods to find a new job and have low reemployment rates (63% during the last two decades according to Kletzer, 2005). Reemployment is particularly challenging for older workers. The DOL (2012) reports that in 2012 reemployment rates for workers ages 55 to 64 and 65 years and over were 47 and 24% respectively while the rate for those ages 20 to 54 was about 62%.&lt;ref name="Departmentof" /&gt;

Once dislocated workers obtain a new job, they suffer significant wage reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Abbring et al. (1999). Displaced Workers in the United States and the Netherlands, this paper is part of the CILN/Uojohn project on Losing Works, Moving On: International Perspectives on Workers Displacement&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of dislocated workers have lower wages in the new job and one quarter of displaced workers from manufacturing who find a new full-time job suffer earning losses of 30% or more.&lt;ref&gt;Kletzer, L. (2005). Globalization and Job Loss, from Manufacturing to Services, Economic Perspectives, Q II, pp. 38–46&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that many workers find jobs in services sector where salaries are lower. Ebenstein et al. (2009) find that displaced workers from manufacturing who find a job in the services sector suffer a wage decline of between 6 and 22%. They conclude that a 1 percentage point increase in occupation-specific import competition is associated with a 0.25 percentage point decline in real wages.&lt;ref name="Ebenstein" /&gt;

Import competition impacts negatively not only dislocated workers but also their families and communities. Displaced workers fall behind in their mortgage payments and in providing health care to their families. Families must spend down assets to [[consumption smoothing|smooth consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, M. (2003). Job Loss Expectations, Realizations, and Household Consumption Behavior, NBER Working Paper 9508&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that displaced workers are in worse health after losing a job.&lt;ref&gt;Strully, K. (2009). Job Loss and Health in the U.S. Labor Market, Demography, 46(2), pp. 221–46.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Report by the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED), more than 46% of the jobless lack health insurance and 31% of workers without insurance do not see a doctor although sick. If the worker is able to be relocated in other job in other region the whole family is displaced and children are uprooted from their schools, increasing domestic tensions. The phenomenon of displaced workers has a broader impact because it also affects aggregate demand for goods and services and tax collections.&lt;ref&gt;CEFD (2004). Promising Practices to Assist Dislocated Workers, working paper prepared by Schweke, W. for The North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, trade leads to an unequal redistribution of costs and benefits. The adjustment process impacts not only displaced workers but also the whole society and economy. Furthermore, labor reallocation from inefficient to competitive sectors aimed at realizing the benefits of trade can be impeded by several obstacles described above, prolonging the transition period and increasing the adjustment costs. In this framework, several scholars and policy-makers have argued that trade-related adjustment costs merit a policy response.&lt;ref name="BTradeadjustment" /&gt;

Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and its Role in U.S. Trade Policy, R41922 by J. F. Hornbeck.&lt;/ref&gt; Having an assistance program targeted exclusively at trade-displaced workers enjoyed wide political support among Congressional representatives in the past because the program served to decrease political resistance to and workers' lobbying efforts against FTAs.&lt;ref name="american"&gt;Reynolds, K. and J. Palatucci (August 2008). Does Trade Adjustment Assistance Make a Difference?, American University, Department of Economics WP No. 2008-12 at http://www.american.edu/academic.depts/cas/econ/workingpapers/workpap.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; As a 2012 Report by the Joint Economic Committee states: "TAA needs to remain an integral part of trade policy because it compensates those harmed by import competition without sacrificing the larger demonstrable benefits of trade."&lt;ref&gt;Joint Economic Committee (September 19, 2011), The Importance of Trade Adjustment Assistance for America's Workers, Report by the Chairman's Staff Senator Bob Casey, at www.jec.senate.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific programs==

===Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers===
The Department of Labor [[Employment and Training Administration]] program, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, provides a variety of reemployment services including training and job-searching assistance and benefits to displaced workers who have lost their jobs or suffered a reduction of hours and wages as a result of increased imports or shifts in production outside the United States. The TAA program aims to help program participants obtain new jobs faster, ensuring they retain employment and earn wages comparable to their prior employment.  Among the main benefits are:  trade readjustment allowances (TRA) in addition to regular unemployment insurance (UI) up to 117 weeks of cash payments for all workers concurrently enrolled only in full-time training (workers must be enrolled in training 8 weeks after certification or 16 weeks after layoff, whichever is later, to receive TRA), and Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) or supplementary wages for workers age 50 and over, and earning less than $50,000 per year in reemployment. It provides a wage supplement equal to 50% of the difference between a worker's reemployment wage and wage at the worker's certified job with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over a period of up to two years (workers must be reemployed within 26 weeks). The TAA used to include a Health Coverage Tax Credit Program which will definitively expire at the end of 2013 and other tax credits related to health coverage will become available (e.g. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). The program promotes retraining since workers receive the TRAs only if they participate in a full-time TAA training (or are under a waiver).&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch"&gt;Congressional Research Service (December 17, 2012). Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, R42012 by B. Collins&lt;/ref&gt; The program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) in cooperation with the 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

The Secretary of Labor was authorized to implement Trade Readjustment Assistance (TRA) and relocation allowances through cooperating state agencies. TRA are income support payments that were, at that time, paid in addition to an individual's regular unemployment compensation. The original program had no training or reemployment component. The program was rarely used until 1974, when it was expanded as part of the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 established the training component of the program. In 1981, the program was sharply curtailed by the Congress at the request of the Reagan Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Adjustment Assistance [http://www.taacoalition.com/papers/trade%20adjustment%20assistance.pdf. TAA Coalition] {{dead link|date=December 2013}} Retrieved on 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act (TAARA) expanded the program and it was combined with the trade adjustment program provided under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).&lt;ref&gt;Hearing on Promoting U.S. Worker Competitiveness in a Globalized Economy [http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=6105 Committee on Ways and Means] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609105812/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=6105 |date=2007-06-09 }} Retrieved on 5 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The TAA has recently suffered several amendments. In 2009, the TAA program was expanded by the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act (TGAAA) of 2009, which was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These benefits were extended through February 2011 by the Omnibus Trade Act of 2010. After that, the program reverted to the pre-expansion provisions under the TAARA of 2002. In October 2011, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act (TAAEA) of 2011 was signed into law, reinstating most of the benefits included in the TGAAA of 2009. The TAA is authorized through December 31, 2014 but with some modifications. The TAA will operate under its current provisions through December 31, 2013. For the additional year until its expiration on December 31, 2014, the TAA is set to operate under the  eligibility and benefit levels established by the TAARA of 2002.&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch" /&gt;

===Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms===
The Department of Commerce program, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eda.gov/InvestmentsGrants/TAAF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827031442/https://www.eda.gov/InvestmentsGrants/TAAF |archivedate=2016-08-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; provides financial assistance to manufacturers and service firms affected by import competition. Sponsored by the Department of Commerce's [[Economic Development Administration]] (EDA), this cost-sharing federal assistance program helps pay for projects that improve firms' competitiveness.  EDA, through a national network of 11 Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers (TAACs), provides technical assistance on a cost-shared basis to U.S. manufacturing, production, and service firms in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms provides import impacted companies with professional guidance, business recovery plan development, and cost-sharing for outside consulting services.  Eligibility is established along similar lines, with companies showing that there has been a recent decrease in sales and employment, in part due to customers shifting purchases away from the applicant and to imported goods.  The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) of 2009 expanded eligibility to service firms as well as the traditional manufacturing companies that had been the sole focus of the program.  This expansion for service firms and workers was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2010, and the program would revert to the pre-ARRA structure without a vote to extend the authorization.

===Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers===
Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers, created in 2002 by wide-ranging trade legislation (P.L. 107-210, Sec. 141), authorizes the expenditure of up to $90 million per year through FY2007. Under the program, certain agricultural producers can each receive payments of up to $10,000 per year if price declines for their commodity were at least partly caused by imports. To be eligible for such assistance, such producers must be members of certified groups and meet a number of criteria specified by the law. The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture.

==Program eligibility==

===For workers===
Workers must be directly impacted by [[International trade|imports]] or by a shift in production of their firm to any country with a free trade agreement with the United States or to beneficiary countries under the Andean Trade Preference, the African Growth and Opportunity, or by certain other shifts in production. Employees of upstream suppliers are eligible if the product supplied to the primary firm consists 20% of the production or sales of the secondary workers' firm, or their employer's loss of business with the primary firm contributed significantly to the secondary workers' separation from work.

Employees of downstream producers are eligible if they perform additional, value-added production processes for articles produced by primary firms, and the primary certification was based on an increase in imports or a shift in production to [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]].

In order to receive the benefits displaced workers must fill a petition as a group to initiate the investigation to address the reasons of their layoff. Once the DOL finds that trade has contributed notably to the layoff, the group is certified but the individual worker must still apply for benefits at a local One-Stop Career Center.&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch" /&gt;

Under the current law, as modified in 2009, workers in most service jobs (call center operators, for example) are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. In 2004, a group of computer experts displaced by overseas labor tried to apply for trade adjustment assistance but were rejected because [[computer software]] was not considered an "article" by the DOL.  After a series of scathing decisions by the [[United States Court of International Trade]] criticizing the DOL's approach, the DOL revised its policies in April 2006 to extend trade adjustment assistance to more workers producing digital products such as software code.&lt;ref&gt;Outsourced Programmers Finally Get Same Benefits As Laid-Off Factory Workers--A Fair, But Costly, Development [http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2006/04/outsourced_prog.html Information Week] Retrieved on 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the program under the TAARA of 2002 starting on January 1, 2014 does not include trade-displaced workers in services sectors.&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch" /&gt;

===For farmers===
Farmers and ranchers adversely impacted by trade will be eligible to participate in a new program operated by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and are potentially eligible to receive training under TAA. They are not eligible for the Trade Readjustment Allowance.

==Program cost==

===For workers===
There are several components of the overall cost of the program. The principal spending of the program is in reemployment services which are set to the annual funding levels of the Trade Act of 2002: $220 million for state grants (plus administrative allotments equal to 15% of each state's grant). The TRA income support and RTAA wage insurance program are uncapped entitlements. In FY 2011, the cost of TRA was $234,126,500 and the cost of RTAA was $43,227,212, based on the number of participants of each program in this year (25,689 and 1,133 participants respectively).&lt;ref name="doleta"&gt;Department of Labor. Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers: Fiscal Year 2011 Report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, available at http://www.doleta.gov/tradeact/docs/AnnualReport11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program effectiveness==

===For workers===
The TAA for workers have demonstrated overall low effectiveness so far which is reflected in the controversy to reauthorize the program before the 112th Congress.

First, the program is not very effective providing support during the transition because a significant portion of workers does not receive TRA. In FY2011 there were over 196,000 TAA participants and only around 46,000 received TRA.&lt;ref name="doleta" /&gt; One reason is that the training enrollment deadline of 8/16 weeks seriously limits the ability of workers to enroll in training programs and receive the benefit. Moreover, even for those workers receiving TRA and UI, only a portion of the lost income is replaced.&lt;ref&gt;GAO (June 14, 2007). Trade Adjustment Assistance. Changes Needed to Improve States' Ability to Provide Benefits and Services to Trade-Affected Workers, Testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, GAO-07-995T, statement by S. R. Nilsen&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides health insurance coverage but in the past it has not been very effective since participation in TAA was associated with decreased coverage in the period following job loss.&lt;ref name="wdr.doleta"&gt;Mathematica Policy Research and Social Policy Research (August 2012). Estimated Impacts for Participants in the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program Under the 2002 Amendments, Final Report Prepared as Part of the Evaluation of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, at http://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/ETAOP_2013_10_Participant_Impact_Report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the program in terms of fostering reemployment is very low too. Data on post-TAA outcomes for program exiters based on DOL estimations shows that the entered employment rate was 66% in 2011.&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch" /&gt;  The Mathematica Policy Research and SPR report finds that the TAA is not effective in terms of increasing employability. There is positive effect on the reemployment rate for participants but it is not statistically different from that for non-participants.&lt;ref name="wdr.doleta" /&gt;

The effectiveness of the program in terms of mitigating earning losses in the new job is very low too as several studies report.  Reynolds and Palatucci (2008) estimate that "participating in the TAA program causes a wage loss approximately 10 percentage points greater than if the displaced worker had chosen not to participate in the program."&lt;ref name="american" /&gt; The report by Mathematica Policy Research and SPR states that TAA was estimated to have no effect on earnings and compared to a sample of UI claimants, TAA participants worked about the same number of weeks but had lower earnings.&lt;ref name="wdr.doleta" /&gt;

Moreover, a 2007 GAO report shows that in FY 2006 only 5% or less of TAA participants received wage insurance. The program is ineffective closing the earning gap because in order to be eligible for wage insurance workers must find a job within 26 weeks after being laid off, which proved to be a very short period.&lt;ref name="June"&gt;GAO (June 14, 2007). Trade Adjustment Assistance. Changes Needed to Improve States' Ability to Provide Benefits and Services to Trade-Affected Workers, Testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, GAO-07-995T, statement by S. R. Nilsen.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the program only replaces half of the losses.

Finally, the implementation of this program overlaps extensively with others such as Workforce Investment Act generating extra costs and duplicating administrative efforts.&lt;ref name="BTradeadjustment" /&gt; The process to allocate training funds is also problematic. States receive funds at the beginning of the fiscal year but it does not properly reflect the state´s demand for training services. In addition, states do not receive funds for case management and lack flexibility to use the funds for training. Thus, states face challenges in providing services to workers properly.&lt;ref name="June" /&gt;

==Policy alternatives==

===For workers===
Over last years, the TAA program has been subject to diverse critics due to its flawed performance and extremely high cost. The TAA was only extended to the end of 2014 and the last reauthorization process before the 112th Congress exposed a lack of consensus about the program.&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch_a" /&gt;
Several scholars from different institutions have proposed policy alternatives.

====Integrated Adjustment Assistance Program====
The Financial Services Forum, through its 2008 white paper "Succeeding in the Global Economy: An Adjustment Assistance Program for American Workers," proposes to combine the UI and TAA programs into a single integrated program for all displaced workers who qualify for UI no matter the reason of displacement&lt;ref&gt;Financial Services Forum (July 2008). Succeeding in the Global Economy: An Adjustment Assistance Program for American Workers – White Paper, by Aldonas G., Lawrence, R. and Slaughter, M., available at http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rlawrence/fsf_adjustment_assistance_plan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The program includes: wage insurance, portability of health insurance (under the current program COBRA), and reemployment services such as assistance with geographic relocation and retraining. The wage insurance would cushion the cost of lower wages in the new job for workers age 45 and older. The program replaces 50% of workers' lost wages for up to two years, for up to $10,000 per year, for workers that hold the previous job for at least two years. Regarding retraining, workers would be able to deduct from their gross income, for tax purposes, the full cost of education and training expenses, and there will be no limitations in terms of area of training.

The estimated annual cost of the program is $22 billion. The Financial Services Forum proposes to replace the current tax system with a flat 1.2% tax on all earning at the state level, and a flat rate of 0.12% on all earnings at the federal level to pay for the program.

====Wage insurance and subsidies for medical insurance program====
{{also|Wage insurance}}
Scholars at the Brookings Institution and the Institute for International Economics proposed a twofold program including a wage insurance and subsidy for medical insurance in addition to the UI program for eligible workers.&lt;ref name="iie"&gt;Kletzer, L. and Litan, R. (March 2001).  A Prescription to Relieve Worker Anxiety, Institute for International Economics, Policy Brief 01-2, available at http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb.cfm?researchid=70.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, the program covers workers displaced by any reason, not just trade, who suffer an earning loss after reemployment. Displaced workers defined as "workers displaced due to plant closing or relocation, elimination of position or shift, and insufficient work".&lt;ref name="Bureauof"&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics (December 2012). Extended Mass Layoffs in 2011, Report 1039.&lt;/ref&gt;

It would replace a portion between 30% and 70% of the difference between earnings on the old and new job. In order to be eligible, workers must have been employed full-time at their previous job for at least two years, and suffered a wage decrease that can be documented. The insurance would be paid only after workers found a new job and they will receive it for up to two years from the original date of job loss. Annual payments would be capped at $10,000 or $20,000 per year. The payments would be administered through state UI.&lt;ref name="iie" /&gt;

In addition, the program would also offer a health insurance subsidy for all full-time displaced workers, for up to 6 months, or until they found a new job (whichever is earlier). Workers would be limited to receiving the subsidy no more frequently than once during a certain period, probably 3 or 4 years, in order to prevent job churning.&lt;ref name="iie" /&gt;

In 2001, [[Robert Litan]] and [[Lori Kletzer]] estimated that about 20% of displaced workers reemployed full-time would have had at least 2 years' tenure on their previous job and suffered a wage loss in the new one. The program would cost from $2 to $5 billion per year. This cost is estimated with a national unemployment rate between 4.2% and 4.9%.&lt;ref name="iie" /&gt; In 2012, the average national unemployment rate was 8.9%.&lt;ref name="Bureauof" /&gt;  Consequently, the projected cost would be higher if the program would be implemented today.

{{Unreferenced|date=July 2007}}
In [[Lincoln-Douglas Debate]], the '''value criterion''' ('''criterion''', '''VC''', or '''standard''') is the means of weighing the [[value premise]]. Unlike the value premise, the value criterion is often swayed to either the affirmative or negative side. 

==Purpose==
The value criterion's main purpose is to weigh the value premise; otherwise, the impacts of the arguments in the round are left hanging.  An argument in a [[Lincoln-Douglas Debate]] generally contains an impact or the effect of that argument (why it matters).  This necessitates an objective order to determine which impacts are more important.  The value criterion provides this objective order and the round reduces to whichever side achieves the value criterion better.  Whether this is done quantifiably or qualitatively is left up to the debaters to decide.

==Argumentation==
Many times it becomes the vantage point of the debate because the values are, many times, the same in a round.  Since each side has impacts that best pertain to their own value criterion, each side must try to convince the judge to weigh the round according to their value criterion.

'''Example: Resolved: In matters of U. S. immigration policy, restrictions on the rights of non-citizens are consistent with democratic ideals.

Because "democratic ideals" is what is trying to be achieved in the resolution, most debaters would find it best and effective to use it as a value premise. Therefore, the debate turns to the value criterion. The affirmative, in this case, may use "preservation of procedure" which explains how their value premise is weighed, while the negative may opt to choose "preservation of autonomy".  In both instances, the value criteria are attainable by their respective sides and therefore, it is fair to weigh the round.  It would be left up to the debaters to determine which value criterion should be used to weigh.

'''Workers' Power''' was a [[Trotskyist]] group which formed the British section of the [[League for the Fifth International]]. The group published the magazine ''Workers Power'' and distributed the English language journal ''Fifth International''.

==Origin==
The group originated in the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (IS) as the Left Faction. The Faction argued that IS needed a fully developed programme. It also criticised the stance IS adopted on the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s paramilitary actions in 1972. In 1973, it set up a faction, then when it refused to dissolve in 1974 it was excluded from IS and formed the Workers Power Group. In 1975, it briefly joined with [[Alliance for Workers Liberty|Workers Fight]] to form the [[International-Communist League]] which split into its constituent parts soon afterward.

In 1980, Workers Power abandoned the position that the Stalinist states were [[state capitalist]], seeing this position as an error on the part of [[Tony Cliff]] who argued that the USSR was state capitalist, functioning as a giant company which competed on the world market militarily. In that year it co-published "The Degenerated Revolution" which argued that countries other than the USSR (such as those in Eastern Europe and Cuba) were "degenerate workers states" and "degenerate from birth", representing a nuance to the [[Fourth International]]'s 1948 analysis that the USSR was a [[degenerated workers state]] while the other countries were [[deformed workers' states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifthinternational.org/LFIfiles/DR.pdf The Degenerated Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity and alliances==
In the mid-1980s, Workers Power was involved in solidarity around the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners strike]], arguing for a general strike against the Tories and for picket line defence against police violence towards strikers. Workers Power was active in the anti-fascist movement against the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] and the [[British National Party]]. Towards the end of the 1990s, it was a key organiser in the Coalition Against BP in [[Colombia]], highlighting abuse or workers and environmental giant by [[British Petroleum]]. Workers Power members were involved in [[No Sweat (organisation)|No Sweat]] along with the [[Alliance for Workers Liberty]] until 2002.

In 1995, Workers Power founded a youth organisation, [[Revolution (political group)|Revolution]], which was politically independent though closely linked to the group. Revolution played an active role in the [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-capitalist]] and [[Opposition to the Iraq War|anti-war movements]].

Workers Power took part in the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]], standing a candidate in the London GLA elections in 2000 and in the general election in 2001. They subsequently withdrew in 2004 as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] prepared to drop the Socialist Alliance and launch the [[Respect Party]] coalition, which Workers Power argued was a reformist, populist and [[cross-class alliance]] which would be unstable politically. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|General Election of 2010]], Jeremy Drinkall stood as an Anticapitalist - Workers Power candidate in the [[Vauxhall (constituency)|Vauxhall]] constituency in South London. He polled 109 votes (0.3%).

Workers' Power called for a rank and file movement in the [[trade unions]], and for a new mass workers' party in Britain. The group grew in recent years through work in the student and anti-war movements. Members in the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] won support for a resolution calling for a conference to discuss the formation of a new workers party, which led to the RMT sponsored conference in London in January 2006 on the crisis of working class representation, which was attended by over 350 people. Workers Power subsequently joined the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]]-initiated [[Campaign for a New Workers' Party]], even though they were critical of some of its formulations in the original statement (arguing the need for the party to be revolutionary from the start). They left the CNWP in 2007.

Internationally Workers Power were strong advocates of the Social Forum movement, attending both the [[World Social Forum]] and [[European Social Forum]]s. Their position was that the international forums providing a basis for launching a Fifth International in the struggle against globalisation and the international institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World bank]].

Workers Power participated in the discussions on the Left after the 2009 European Elections on left unity, arguing for a conference to create a new workers' party which they argued should form in the same way as the French [[New Anticapitalist Party]] through local committees focused both around developing a programme and organising action.

In the austerity crisis in Britain after the 2008 [[credit crunch]], Workers Power was involved in the local anti-cuts groups and the student organisation National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts. Its main slogans were for the creation of a rank and file movement in the [[trade unions]], a national anti cuts federation and for a [[general strike]] against the cuts.

In 2013, Workers Power members and supports entered and formed the Class Struggle Platform in [[Left Unity (UK)|Left Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workerspower.co.uk/2013/08/platform-for-a-class-struggle-party/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Workers Power entered unity talks with [[Socialist Resistance]] and the [[International Socialist Network]] (ISN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalsocialistnetwork.org/index.php/ideas-and-arguments/organisation/left-unity/332-2014-01-18-unity-organising-meeting|title=Unity Organising Meeting|date=2014-01-18|publisher=International Socialist Network|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the ISN has since dissolved itself.

In September 2015, Workers Power dissolved, calling for all socialists to join the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workerspower.co.uk/2015/09/%E2%80%A8jeremy-corbyns-programme-a-revolutionary-socialist-assessment/&lt;/ref&gt; Former members have since formed the Red Flag Platform, describing itself as "a revolutionary socialist initiative campaigning in the Labour Party".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redflagonline.org/about/platform/&lt;/ref&gt; It published the first issue of its Red Flag newspaper in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redflagonline.org/2015/11/red-flag-newspaper-issue-001/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
===The degenerated revolution in Russia, and the degenerate workers states===

====The Soviet Union====
The League believes that the Russian revolution degenerated because of the takeover of the party by the Stalinist leadership. They agree with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s position that the young Soviet state had become "bureaucratically deformed" before it degenerated under the Stalinist leadership. The League disagrees with the [[Tony Cliff|Cliff tradition]] that the revolution was doomed without world revolution happening in the period after the [[First World War]], and who also see it as degenerating into state capitalism around 1928. The League viewed it as still having post-capitalist property relations and therefore remained a degenerated workers state (degenerated because it was once a healthy workers state, then deformed, before the Stalinist caste takeover). Before the state degenerated in the thirties, [[Leon Trotsky]] and the [[Left Opposition]] had the programmatic demand to "reform" the "bureaucratically deformed" state by revitalising the Soviets and bringing more democracy to the party. In the thirties Trotsky viewed the USSR as being unable to be reformed, and therefore needing a [[political revolution]] not a social revolution.

====Eastern Europe and states "degenerate from birth"====
The League differs from other groups in that it calls Eastern European states "degenerate from birth" rather than deformed. It also viewed [[Josip Broz Tito]] in Yugoslavia as a "disobedient Stalinist" whose actions moved Yugoslavia in a direction towards, not against, imperialism. This is against groups such as the US SWP and eventually after the [[Fourth International#Third World Congress|Third World Congress]], the [[Fourth International]], who viewed Tito as an unconscious Trotskyist and sent greetings to the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]] (YCP) asking to attend their conference in order to help them in a revolutionary path. This analysis by the Fourth International which originally came from [[Michel Pablo]] was the reason they saw the Eastern European states as having only quantitative deformations, not being qualitatively degenerate. The FI thought there was a possibility that the communist parties in Eastern Europe would break with Stalin as the YCP and Tito had done, and through this become revolutionary. The League disagrees, arguing that whilst divisions in the Stalinist bureaucracy like the Tito split were possible, these parties would remain bureaucratic, and while they could carry out a bureaucratic, top down, [[social revolution]] and create post-capitalist property relations, there would need to be a [[political revolution]] against them as they were a bureaucratic caste, like [[Joseph Stalin]]'s in the [[Soviet Union]]. Because of this these states were classed as "degenerate from birth" instead of "degenerated", although the tasks for revolutionaries in them – [[political revolution]] – remained the same. This is just a "linguistic" difference in order to show the historical circumstances these states came into existence by.

===''The Death Agony of the Fourth International'' and the need for a Fifth International===
The League believes that the Fourth International became centrist in 1951 when it adopted the position that the Stalinist parties in Eastern European countries like Yugoslavia could be reformed back to a healthy state and that the Stalinists were roughly 'blunt instruments' for carrying out the proletarian revolution. As a result, the Fourth International has started deep entryism in social democratic and Stalinist parties.

As they regard both sides of the 1953 split in the Fourth International to have affirmed this stance, which they regard as a fundamental breach with Leninism and Trotskyism, and as they believe all the major forces having emerged from the Fourth International to be implementing this false 'processist' methodology today, they call for a new Fifth International to be built by the working class forces fighting neoliberalism worldwide, including from the workers' trade unions, parties and other forces participating in the World Social Forum and analogous continental formations like the Asian and European Social Forums.

Workers Power (UK) published a book in 1983, called ''Death Agony of the Fourth International''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fifthinternational.org/index.php?id=77,418,0,0,1,0&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the group's major work on analysing the post war Trotskyist movement.

===Trade unions===
The League for the Fifth International calls for the creation of rank and file movements in the trade unions, based on the [[National Minority Movement]] formed by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in the 1920s. It is an anti-bureaucratic organisation and is critical of 'Broad Left' alliances in the unions which, they argue, act as electoral machines for left wing leader trade union [[bureaucrats]]. The Broad Left projects prevent criticism of left leaders in the unions and can act to frustrate action at certain times since it does not create a rank and file mechanism for organising strikes.  Their analysis includes differentiating between left and right wing bureaucrats but also between the union full-time apparatus and the members of the union in the branches and work places. The bureaucrats will always tend towards a compromise with the owners of industry since their role is to negotiate and act as brokers between their members and the capitalist class. The large wages and luxurious lifestyle of trade union leaders undermines their ability to represent their members interests, since they are disconnected from the living and working conditions of large parts of the union movement.

===Other theory===
The League emphasises the transitional programme and incorporates political demands in their publications. They also advocate a strategy of [[permanent revolution]] (i.e., not stageist, and in the impossibility of the bourgeois in semi-colonial countries leading revolutions). They support Lenin's analysis of imperialism as a higher stage of capitalism based on international capital concentrated in the 'developed' western world, rather than simply as militarism and war. In 2010 the League adopted the position that China had become imperialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifthinternational.org/content/class-character-china |title=On the class character of China |publisher=League for the Fifth International Sun |date=11 July 2010 |website=www.fifthinternational.org |access-date=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They see the current stage of their organisations project as being a 'fighting propaganda group'. They are critical of groups like the Socialist Workers Party and Socialist Party which they argue are not mass parties of the working class and therefore should not declare themselves as parties.

==Publications==
Workers Power published a monthly newspaper. The last edition appeared in September 2015.

Workers Power published the journal of the [[League for the Fifth International]], called [[Fifth International]]. This included a special edition entitled "The Credit Crunch – A Marxist Analysis". The last edition appeared in Autumn 2010.
 
Workers Power has also published many pamphlets and books, the two most important in terms of their tradition being Death Agony of the Fourth International and The Degenerated Revolution. Other pamphlets include "Marxism and the Trade Unions", "Women's Oppression", "Black Liberation", "LGBT Liberation", a critique of the SWP/Cliff tradition and on the crisis of Stalinism after 1989.

In 2007 they republished "The Road to Red October", a pamphlet originally released in 1987, to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].

==Splits==
In 2006 the [[League for the Fifth International]] suffered a split which particularly affected the British section. The minority, which left to form [[Permanent Revolution (group)|Permanent Revolution]], believed that the world economy was in a long upward wave (a position they adopted from [[Ernest Mandel]]) and that the possibility of a crisis of capitalism was unlikely for several more years. They criticised the majority as having an overly optimistic perspective or a pre-revolutionary period.

In 2012, two further groups split, one criticised Workers Power's position on the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO intervention in Libya]] and 16 more left to launch what the majority described as the "[[liquidationism|liquidationist]]" Anti-Capitalist Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fifthinternational.org/content/statement-resignations-british-section-league&lt;/ref&gt; the latter reducing Workers Power's membership by about a third.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpgb.org.uk/article.php?article_id=1004812&lt;/ref&gt;
