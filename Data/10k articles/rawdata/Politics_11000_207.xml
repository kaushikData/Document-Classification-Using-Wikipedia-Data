{{Politics of Cameroon}}
'''The 2008 Cameroon protests''' were a series of violent demonstrations in [[Cameroon]]'s biggest cities that took place from 25 to 29 February 2008. The protests followed on the heels of a strike by [[transport in Cameroon|transport]] workers, who were opposing high fuel prices and poor working conditions. Further political turmoil had been caused by President [[Paul Biya]]'s announcement that he wanted the [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] to be amended to remove term limits; without such an amendment, he would have to leave office at the end of his term in 2011. Large groups of youths, whom the opposition [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF) political party and the government blame one another for organising, took to the streets of [[Douala]], [[Yaound√©]], [[Bamenda]], and other major cities, looting and vandalising property. The government sent in troops to crack down on the unrest, and protesters and troops alike were killed. The official government tally is that 40 people were killed, but human rights groups claim that the total is closer to 100. Government figures place damage to property at tens of billions of [[franc CFA|francs CFA]] (15.2 million euros or US$23.4 million).

In response to the protests, President Biya reduced the cost of fuel, raised salaries of civil servants and military personnel, reduced the duties paid on cement, and suspended duties on essential goods such as cooking oil, fish, and rice. Government forces also claimed to have arrested more than 1,600 people, including government officials, and to have prosecuted 200. Human rights groups and defense attorneys, on the other hand, claimed that more than 2,000 people had been arrested in Douala alone and decried the trials as overly swift, secretive, and severe. The government has also cracked down on artists, media outlets and journalists it accuses of threatening national stability.

==Causes==
The protests grew out of a strike by the urban [[transport in Cameroon|transport]] union, which consists of bus, taxi, and lorry drivers. The union was angered over the rise in fuel prices and poor working conditions in [[Cameroon]];&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"&gt;Ghartey-Mould, Will (10 March 2008).

Retrieved 13 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Paul Biya]]'s proposal that the [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] be amended to abolish [[term limit]]s on the presidency and allow him to run in the 2011 election. Biya has been [[president of Cameroon]] since 1982.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"/&gt; On 23 February, an unauthorised protest of several hundred Cameroonians in the Douala suburb of Newtown, opposing Biya's proposed  constitutional reforms, was broken up by police who allegedly turned [[tear gas]] and [[water cannon]]s on the demonstrators, killing at least one. Conditions in Douala were peaceful the following day until that evening, when gunfire was heard near [[Douala International Airport]].&lt;ref name="IRIN 25 Feb."/&gt;

According to [[Hamidou Yaya Marafa]], Minister of State, Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation, the Cameroonian government learned in January that the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF), the main opposition to the ruling [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) political party, had formulated a plan they dubbed "Operation Kenya" to bring instability to [[Douala]], Cameroon's biggest city and chief port. In response, the government indefinitely banned street demonstrations in the [[Littoral Province (Cameroon)|Littoral Province]], where Douala is located. Undeterred, SDF leaders met at the [[Bamenda]] home of party chairman [[John Fru Ndi]] in late January, government officials claim, with the aim of organising street demonstrations across the country. Marafa says that the SDF planned to have members from both the government and civil sectors participate in the protests. Meanwhile, the SDF allegedly offered training to young people in how to stage an effective street demonstration.&lt;ref name="MAN"&gt;N., M. A. (11 March 2008). "[http://allafrica.com/stories/200803110796.html Cameroon: Startling Revelations]", ''[[Cameroon Tribune]]''. Retrieved 12 March 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Fru Ndi and the SDF have rejected the government's claims, citing several peaceful SDF-led protests in the past. Fru Ndi told the government to look at their own policies as the cause of the unrest. Fru Ndi said that he had information that implicated government officials with "[manipulating] the State apparatus and its information system" in a bid to deflect attention from their own [[political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (3 March 2008).

==Protests==
The protests began on 25 February 2008 in Douala.&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"/&gt; Because of the transport strike scheduled for that day and general fear, the streets were empty of all traffic but the transport used by government forces.&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IRIN 25 Feb."/&gt; Heavy gunfire was reported that morning, and youths burnt cars, tyres, and vegetation to block off major roads and bridges; the city was filled with plumes of smoke.&lt;ref name="IRIN 25 Feb."&gt;IRIN (25 February 2008). "[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76932 CAMEROON: Douala burns as taxi strike turns into general rioting]". UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Retrieved 13 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, groups of young people looted and vandalised property, including petrol stations and a retail store.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IRIN 25 Feb."/&gt; Reports on national radio said that a finance ministry building, a town hall, and other government structures were aflame. [[IRIN]] reported seeing a firefight between protesters and police at the airport and witnessing victims of gunshot wounds in the city. Police responded with widespread arrests.&lt;ref name="IRIN 25 Feb."/&gt;

On 26 February, the government agreed to a reduction in petrol prices of 6 [[francs CFA]] (less than 1 [[US¬¢]]) per litre, and the transport union called off its strike that night. The head of the taxi union, Jean Collins Ndefossokeng, told [[Radio France International]] that "it is no longer a good time for the strike with the current vandalism."&lt;ref name="IRIN 27 Feb."/&gt;  Nevertheless, violence had already gotten out of hand by this point and continued.&lt;ref name="BBC 28 Feb."&gt;Anonymous (28 February 2008). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7267731.stm Cameroon head blames opposition]", BBC News. Retrieved 13 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2 February, the protests had spread to other Cameroonian cities.&lt;ref name="IRIN 27 Feb."&gt;IRIN (27 February 2008). "[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76999 CAMEROON: Unrest spreads to Yaound√© even after taxi strike ends]", UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Retrieved 13 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Government figures show that the protests eventually spread to 31 municipal areas in five of Cameroon's ten provinces: the [[Centre Province (Cameroon)|Centre]], [[Littoral Province (Cameroon)|Littoral]], [[Northwest Province (Cameroon)|Northwest]], [[Southwest Province (Cameroon)|Southwest]], and [[Western Province, Cameroon|West]].&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"&gt;Nkemngu, Martin A.

Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Marafa claims that the SDF collected and transported youths between hotpoints, including [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamenda]], [[Douala]], and [[Yaound√©]]. Government forces allegedly stopped such convoys outside major cities on 25 and 27 February.&lt;ref name="MAN"/&gt;

Witnesses reported heavy gunfire in Yaound√© on 27 February. One resident reported rioters looting and burning a market.&lt;ref name="IRIN 27 Feb."/&gt; The government flooded the streets of the capital with soldiers.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt; Demonstrators threw stones and erected flaming barricades. Government forces responded with [[tear gas]].&lt;ref name="BBC 28 Feb."/&gt; Troops were stationed throughout the city and at petrol stations,&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt; and barricades were set up.&lt;ref name="BBC 29 Feb."/&gt; Similar methods were used in other cities, and troops in Douala used water cannons.&lt;ref name="BBC 28 Feb."/&gt; Meanwhile, looting and burning continued in Douala, where witnesses reported victims of gunshot wounds lining the streets.&lt;ref name="IRIN 27 Feb."/&gt;

According to a BBC reporter, troops confronted about 2,000 demonstrators on a bridge in Douala, and some 20 individuals fell into the river.&lt;ref name="BBC 28 Feb."/&gt;

In Kumba, demonstrators marched with posters demanding Biya's resignation and for the government to reduce the cost of fuel and petroleum products.&lt;ref name="IRIN 27 Feb."/&gt; In Bamenda, some reportedly targeted boarding schools, where the nation's elite send their children. The protesters, reportedly armed with bottles of petrol, rocks, and sticks, threatened to burn the school down unless the students came with them, possibly for use as [[human shield]]s against government forces. One boarding school reported that 200 teenage boys were taken by the protesters but the rest of the children were allowed to stay. Reports indicate that similar scenarios took place at other schools. Most of the children managed to escape back to the school or their parents' home.&lt;ref name="BBC 29 Feb."/&gt; Others broke into the Social Affairs Delegation and stole 4 million
francs CFA.&lt;ref name="Ngoh 17 March"/&gt; The government accused the mayor of the [[Njombe-Penja]] Council of leading a group of demonstrators in an attack on a [[gendarmerie|gendarme]] station in his town. The mayor was later suspended for this act and for alleged mismanagement of council funds.&lt;ref name="MAN"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the government reports that two Italians in Cameroon were kidnapped in Douala as part of the violence. They were brought to Bamenda, where their kidnappers demanded ransom. They were eventually let go unharmed, and no ransom was paid.&lt;ref name="MAN"/&gt; A report from [[The Associated Press]], on the other hand, says that the victims were one Croatian woman and one Italian woman and that a Croatian newspaper has stated that a ransom was indeed paid.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (6 March 2008).

The unrest continued through 29 February 2008.&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[government of Cameroon]] has held three [[press conference]]s regarding the crisis. The latest was on 10 March 2008.&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"/&gt; On 27 February, President Biya made a rare appearance on state-owned television. He accused "certain politicians", whom he dubbed "apprentice sorcerers in the shadows" with fomenting unrest and attempting to orchestrate a [[coup d'√©tat]].&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IRIN 8 March"/&gt;

On 27 February, the government reduced fuel costs. On 7 March, Biya declared a rise in pay of 15 percent for civil service employees to take effect 1 April and suspended duties paid on basic commodities such as cooking oil, fish, and rice.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News24"&gt;Anonymous (8 March 2008).

The government claimed to have arrested more than 1,600 people and to have found 200 guilty of looting and destruction of property with sentences of six months to three years.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News24"/&gt; Human rights groups assert that the actual number of arrests is much higher, with as many as 2,000 arrests in Douala alone,&lt;ref name="IRIN 8 March"/&gt; due in part to an apparent randomness to the arrests of both youths who did and did not participate in the demonstrations. As of 26 March 2008, 800 accused were reportedly being held in [[Douala Central Prison]] and the government had charged 1,000 to 1,500 citizens.&lt;ref name="Beauchemin"/&gt; Such organisations and the [[Cameroon Bar Council]] spoke out against the trials, deeming them summary and secretive, with extreme sentences.&lt;ref name="News24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musa 2"/&gt; A lawyer in Yaound√© claimed that defendants were being given no time to prepare a defence,&lt;ref name="IRIN 8 March"/&gt; and a lawyer in Douala said there was evidence the detainees had been beaten and tortured.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, Tansa (5 March 2008).

Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, the defendants are tried ''en masse'' (one trial had more than 150 defendants), and defence attorneys are not alerted beforehand whom they will be asked to represent nor given access to police reports and files.&lt;ref name="Beauchemin"/&gt;

On 5 March, [[Jean-Michel Nintcheu]], chairman of the SDF in the Littoral Province, was arrested in Douala on charges of violating the government ban on public demonstrations. On 7 March, Nintcheu announced that the SDF was calling off demonstrations in the Littoral Province due to "the recent upheavals that rocked many parts of the province, occasioning deaths and destruction of property."&lt;ref name="Pefok"&gt;Pefok, Joe Dinga (10 March 2008).

Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another SDF leader was arrested at the airport attempting to travel to Europe. He was accused of being the mastermind of the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"/&gt;

Some semblance of normalcy had returned to Cameroon's cities by 8 March, with traffic jams and people going about their daily business.&lt;ref name="IRIN 8 March"&gt;IRIN (8 March 2008).

Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cameroonians report that the government reprisals and fear of another uprising have created a "climate of terror" in the country.&lt;ref name="Beauchemin"/&gt;

International media watchdog groups have claimed that the government has heavy-handedly censored the press in Cameroon and intimidated journalists with methods that include beatings and confiscation of equipment. As of 8 March, three media outlets had been shut down by the government, which claimed the moves were in the interest of "stability and social order".&lt;ref name="IRIN 8 March"/&gt;

As of 10 March, troops were reportedly searching homes in [[Kumba]] for property stolen from [[Les Brasseries du Cameroun]], a brewery, and Transformation Reef Cameroon, a logging company. ''The Post'' newspaper, located in [[Buea]], claims that the troops "torture and arrest" anyone in possession of allegedly stolen beverages or computer equipment. If the home is clear of such items, the troops are said to destroy radio and TV equipment. Some residents accuse the soldiers of raping women and stealing money. One man reportedly committed suicide rather than face arrest after troops allegedly found 25 crates of stolen beverages in his home on 6 March.&lt;ref name="Ngoh"&gt;Ngoh, Olive Ejang Tebug (10 March 2008).

Despite the protests, the National Assembly voted to change the Constitution to remove term limits on 10 April 2008. Given the CPDM's control of the National Assembly, the change was overwhelmingly approved, with 157 votes in favor and five opposed; the 15 deputies of the SDF chose to boycott the vote in protest, denouncing it as a "constitutional coup". The change also provided for the President to enjoy immunity from prosecution for his actions as President after leaving office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?art_cle=44617 "Cameroun: adoption d'une r√©vision constitutionnelle controvers√©e"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522000318/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?art_cle=44617 |date=22 May 2011 }}, AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), 10 April 2008 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths and damages==
As of 10 March 2008, official government figures put the number of deaths at 40, which includes both government security personnel and civilians.&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"/&gt; Marafa said that total included those who had been injured and later died. He placed 30 of the deaths in Douala alone, with two dead in Yaound√© and eight in the Northwest, Southwest, and West provinces combined.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;

On 7 March, the [[Maison des Droits de L'Homme]] (House of Human Rights, MDH), a Cameroonian [[human rights]] organisation affiliated with the [[International Federation of Human Rights]], claimed the death total was "more than 100". The government denied these figures.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt; According to Madeleine Affite, an MDH member, in one incident alone, 18 people died in Douala. Government forces had protesters trapped on the [[Wouri River]] bridge, and people jumped into the river in desperation. Affite says that local fishermen who witnessed the incident have been told by government agents to keep quiet.&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt; In another incident, a reported 20 demonstrators were killed in Douala when government forces fired on them.&lt;ref name="Ghartey-Mould"/&gt; She also claimed that the government has ordered morgues not to release bodies of victims to keep the scale of the deaths caused in the protests a secret.&lt;ref name="Musa 2"&gt;Musa, Tansa (5 March 2008.

According to the government, during the demonstrations, protesters vandalised and sacked bars, bakeries, government buildings, industrial sites, 33 petrol stations, pharmacies, sales kiosks, security stations, and vehicles. The government estimates the damage caused by the protests at tens of billions of [[franc CFA|francs CFA]] (15.2 million euros or US$23.4 million).&lt;ref name="Raises death toll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"/&gt; Government spokesman Marafa claimed that Cameroon had taken a blow to both its economy and its reputation.&lt;ref name="Nkemngu"/&gt; Finance Minister Johnson Kum Ofon of [[Meme division]] estimated the damages to [[Kumba]] alone at 695 million francs CFA (US$1.7 million or 1.1 million euros), more than the total amount allotted for infrastructural improvements for 2008.&lt;ref name="Ngoh 17 March"&gt;Ngoh, Olive Ejang Tebug (17 March 2008).

On 12 April 2008, opposition SDF leader [[John Fru Ndi]] called for a [[national day of mourning]] for 21 April 2008 to commemorate those who died during the protests and the "death of democracy" in Cameroon due to the April 2008 amendments to the constitution to allow the president to run for more than two terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemessager.net/details_articles.php?code=110&amp;code_art=23241 Le Sdf appelle √† une journ√©e de deuil national.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6625">'''Administrative shares''' are hidden [[network share]]s created by [[Windows NT]] family of [[operating system]]s that allow [[system administrator]]s to have remote access to every [[Volume (computing)|disk volume]] on a network-connected system. These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled. Administrative shares cannot be accessed by users without administrative privileges.

==Share names==
Administrative shares are a collection of automatically shared resources including the following:&lt;ref name=hidden-create-delete /&gt;
* [[Volume (computing)|Disk volumes]]: Every disk volume on the system is shared as an administrative share. The name of these shares consists of the drive letters of shared volume plus a dollar sign ($). For example, a system that has volumes &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; has three administrative shares named C$, D$ or E$. ([[NetBIOS]] is not case sensitive.)  
* OS folder: The folder in which Windows is installed is shared as &lt;code&gt;admin$&lt;/code&gt;
* Fax cache: The folder in which faxed pages and cover pages are cached is shared as &lt;code&gt;fax$&lt;/code&gt;
* [[IPC share]]s: This area, which is used for [[inter-process communication]] via [[named pipes]] and is not part of the [[file system]], is shared as &lt;code&gt;ipc$&lt;/code&gt;
* Printers folder: This virtual folder, which contains object that represent installed printers is shared as &lt;code&gt;print$&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Domain controller]] shares: [[Windows Server]] family of operating system creates two domain controller-specific shares called &lt;code&gt;sysvol&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;netlogon&lt;/code&gt; which do not have dollar signs ($) appended to their names.&lt;ref name=admin-server-delete /&gt;

==Characteristics==
Administrative shares have the following characteristics:
# '''Hidden''': The "[[$#Use in computer programming|$]]" appended to the end of the share name means that it is a hidden share.  Windows will not list such shares among those it defines in typical queries by remote clients to obtain the list of shares. One needs to know the name of an administrative share in order to access it.&lt;ref name=hidden-create-delete /&gt; Not every hidden share is an administrative share; in other words, ordinary hidden shares may be created at user's discretion.&lt;ref name=hidden-create-delete /&gt;
# '''Automatically created''': Administrative shares are created by Windows, not a network administrator. If deleted, they will be automatically recreated.&lt;ref name=admin-server-delete /&gt;

Administrative shares are not created by [[Windows XP Home Edition]].&lt;ref name=hidden-create-delete /&gt;

==Management==
The administrative shares can be deleted just as any other network share, only to be recreated automatically at the next reboot.&lt;ref name=hidden-create-delete&gt;{{cite web|title=How to create and delete hidden or administrative shares on client computers|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314984|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, possible to disable administrative shares.&lt;ref name=admin-server-delete&gt;{{cite web|title=How to remove administrative shares in Windows Server 2008|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954422/en-us|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disabling administrative shares is not without caveats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of problems that may occur when administrative shares are missing|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/842715/en-us|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Previous Versions]] for local files, a feature of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], requires administrative shares to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karp|first=David A.|title=Windows 7 Annoyances Tips, Secrets, and Solutions.|year=2010|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|location=[[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]]|isbn=9781449390655|page=607|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karp|first=David A.|title=Windows Vista annoyances|year=2008|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastopol, CA|isbn=9780596527624|page=507|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions==
[[Windows XP]] implements "simple file sharing" (also known as "ForceGuest"), a feature that can be enabled on computers that are not part of a Windows domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Security Advisory (906574): Clarification of Simple File Sharing and ForceGuest|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/906574|work=Security TechCenter|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=23 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; When enabled, it authenticates all incoming access requests to network shares as "Guest", a [[user account]] with very limited access rights in Windows. This effectively disables access to administrative shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to use the Simple File Sharing feature to share files in Windows XP|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304040/en-us|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By default, [[Windows Vista]] and later use [[User Account Control]] (UAC) to enforce security. One of UAC's features denies administrative rights to a user who accesses network shares on the local computer over a network, unless the accessing user is registered on a [[Windows domain]] or using the built in Administrator account. If not in a [[Windows domain]] it is possible to allow administrative share access to all accounts with administrative permissions by adding the [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947232 LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy value] to the registry.

'''Allan C. Carlson''' (born [[Des Moines, Iowa]], 1949) is a scholar and professor of history at [[Hillsdale College]] in [[Hillsdale, Michigan]]. He is the president of the [[Howard Center for Family, Religion and Society]], a director of the [[Family in America Studies Center]], the International Secretary of the [[World Congress of Families]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profam.org/press/wcf.pr.070416.htm World Congress of Families Responds to Attack by Certain Members of European Parliament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428032140/http://www.profam.org/press/wcf.pr.070416.htm |date=2007-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and editor of the ''[[Family in America]]'' newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profam.org/THC/Speakers/xthc_spk_br_acc.htm Dr. Allan C.

==Biography==
Carlson earned his B. A. from [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]] and his Ph.D. in European History from [[The Ohio State University]].  He served as a member of the [[Lutheran Council in America]]'s Government Affairs Office from 1975‚Äì1978.  In 1979, he became a lecturer and assistant-to-the-president at [[Gettysburg College]].  He joined [[The Rockford Institute]] in 1981, where he remained until he joined with [[John A. Howard]] in splitting off from that organization and forming the Howard Center in 1997. He was appointed to the [[National Commission on Children]] in 1988 by [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald Reagan: Appointment of Allan C. Carlson as a Member of the National Commission on Children|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=36025|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Carlson served on the faculty of [[Oriel College, Oxford]].

His articles and treatises have addressed the underlying causes of [[population decline]], the effects of taxation and regulation on the size and well-being of the family, as well as historical efforts to implement a [[family wage]] in the United States. He has observed that the post-[[World War II]] [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] in the United States was largely a "Catholic phenomenon." &lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Allan. [http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_dectnf.htm "Why Things Went Wrong: The Decline of the Natural Family"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911035252/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_dectnf.htm |date=2012-09-11 }}. Speech given at the Pope John Center, Dallas, TX, January 31 ‚Äì February 4, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he 1945‚Äì1964 era produced a 'heroic' flowering of Catholic family life in America. Although fertility rose for all American religious groups, it rose far more rapidly and stayed high longer among Catholics.... The total marital fertility rate for non-Catholics averaged 3.15 children born per woman in the early 1950s and 3.14 in the early 1960s. For Catholics, the respective figures were 3.54 and 4.25."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Allan. [http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=19-01-023-f "The Family Factors"], ''[[Touchstone Magazine|Touchstone]]'', January/February, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson has also criticized the impact of [[feminism]] on women's roles in society as disastrous and continuing to take its toll on the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5519">In [[macroeconomics]], '''automatic stabilizers''' are features of the structure of modern [[government budget]]s, particularly [[income tax]]es and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare spending]], that act to dampen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = O'Sullivan

The size of the [[government budget deficit]] tends to increase when a country enters a [[recession]], which tends to keep national income higher by maintaining [[aggregate demand]]. There may also be a [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]]. This effect happens automatically depending on GDP and household income, without any explicit policy action by the government, and acts to reduce the severity of recessions.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Similarly, the budget deficit tends to decrease during booms, which pulls back on aggregate demand. Therefore, automatic stabilizers tend to reduce the size of the fluctuations in a country's GDP.

==Induced taxes==
Tax revenues generally depend on household income and the pace of economic activity. Household incomes fall and the economy slows down during a recession, and government [[tax revenue]]s fall as well. This change in tax revenue occurs because of the way modern tax systems are generally constructed.
*[[Income tax]]es are generally at least somewhat [[progressive taxation|progressive]]. This means that as household incomes fall during a recession, households pay lower rates on their incomes as income tax. Therefore, income tax revenue tends to fall faster than the fall in household income.
*[[Corporate tax]] is generally based on [[profit (economics)|profits]], rather than [[revenue]]. In a recession profits tend to fall much faster than revenue. Therefore, a company pays much less tax while having slightly less economic activity.
*[[Sales tax]] depends on the dollar volume of sales, which tends to fall during recessions.

If national income rises, by contrast, then tax revenues will rise. During an economic boom, tax revenue is higher and in a recession tax revenue is lower, not only in absolute terms but as a proportion of national income.

Some other forms of taxation do not exhibit these effects, if they bear no relation to income (e.g. [[Tax per head|poll taxes]], export [[tariff]]s or [[property tax]]es).

===Transfer payments===
Most governments also pay [[unemployment]] and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare benefits]]. Generally speaking, the number of unemployed people and those on low incomes who are entitled to other benefits increases in a recession and decreases in a boom.

As a result, government expenditure increases automatically in recessions and decreases automatically in booms in absolute terms. Since output increases in booms and decreases in recessions, expenditure is expected to increase as a share of income in recessions and decrease as a share of income in booms.

==Incorporated into the expenditure multiplier==
This section incorporates automatic stabilization into a broadly [[Keynesian]] [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] model.

&lt;math&gt;Multiplier=\frac{1}{1-[MPC(1-T)-MPI]}&lt;/math&gt;
*'''MPC''' = [[Marginal propensity to consume]] (fraction of incremental income spent on domestic consumption)
*'''T''' = Marginal (induced) tax rate (fraction of incremental income that is paid in taxes)
*'''MPI''' = Marginal Propensity to Import (fraction of incremental income spent on imports)

Holding all other things constant, [[ceteris paribus]], the greater the level of taxes, or the greater the MPI then the value of this multiplier will drop. For example, lets assume that:

:‚Üí ''MPC'' = 0.8

:‚Üí ''T'' = 0

:‚Üí ''MPI'' = 0.2

Here we have an economy with zero marginal taxes and zero transfer payments. If these figures were substituted into the multiplier formula, the resulting figure would be '''2.5'''. This figure would give us the instance where a (for instance) $1 billion change in expenditure would lead to a $2.5 billion change in equilibrium real GDP.

Lets now take an economy where there are positive taxes (an increase from 0 to 0.2), while the MPC and MPI remain the same:

:‚Üí ''MPC'' = 0.8

:‚Üí ''T'' = 0.2

:‚Üí ''MPI'' = 0.2

If these figures were now substituted into the multiplier formula, the resulting figure would be '''1.79'''. This figure would give us the instance where, again, a $1 billion change in expenditure would now lead to only a $1.79 billion change in equilibrium real GDP.

This example shows us how the multiplier is lessened by the existence of an automatic stabilizer, and thus helping to lessen the fluctuations in real GDP as a result from changes in expenditure. Not only does this example work with changes in '''T''', it would also work by changing the '''MPI''' while holding '''MPC''' and '''T''' constant as well.

There is broad consensus among economists that the automatic stabilizers often exist and function in the short term.

Additionally, [[imports]] often tend to decrease in a recession, meaning more of the national income is spent at home rather than abroad. This also helps stabilize the economy.

'''Common chicory''', ''[[Cichorium]] intybus'',&lt;ref name="ecocrop.fao.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=694 |title=Cichorium intybus |publisher=FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a somewhat woody, [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant]] of the dandelion family [[Asteraceae]], usually with bright blue [[flower]]s, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for [[salad leaves]], chicons ([[blanching (horticulture)|blanched]] buds), or roots (var. ''sativum''), which are baked, ground, and used as a [[coffee substitute]] and [[food additive]]. In the 21st century, [[inulin]], an [[extract]] from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a [[sweetener]] and source of [[dietary fiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21198631|year=2011|author1=Raninen|first1=K|title=Dietary fiber type reflects physiological functionality: Comparison of grain fiber, inulin, and polydextrose|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=69|issue=1|pages=9‚Äì21|last2=Lappi|first2=J|last3=Mykk√§nen|first3=H|last4=Poutanen|first4=K|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Common chicory is also known as '''blue daisy''', '''blue dandelion''', '''blue sailors''', '''blue weed''', '''bunk''', '''coffeeweed''', '''cornflower''', '''hendibeh''', '''horseweed''', '''ragged sailors''', '''succory''', '''wild bachelor's buttons''', and '''wild endive'''.&lt;ref name=oardc.ohio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oardc.ohio-state.edu/weedguide/singlerecord.asp?id=920 |author1=John Cardina |author2=Cathy Herms |author3=Tim Koch |author4=Ted Webster |title=Chickory ''Cichorium intybus'' |publisher=Ohio State University OARDC Extension |work=Ohio Perennial &amp; Biennial Weed Guide| accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: "Cornflower" is commonly applied to ''[[cornflower|Centaurea cyanus]]''.)  Common names for varieties of var. ''foliosum'' include [[endive]], [[radicchio]], [[radichetta]], Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf, and witloof (or witlof).

==Description==

When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from {{Convert|30|to|100|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} tall.  The leaves are stalked, [[lanceolate]] and unlobed.  The flower heads are 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;cm ({{frac|1|4}} to {{frac|1|1|2}} inches) wide, and usually light purple or lavender (see picture) and it has been described as light blue, rarely white or pink.  Of the two rows of [[involucral bract]]s, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.  The [[achenes]] have no [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.&lt;ref name="The Wild Flower Key"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Rose  |title=The Wild Flower Key |year=1981 |publisher=Frederick Warne &amp; Co|isbn=978-0-7232-2419-8 |pages=390‚Äì391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culinary uses==
Root chicory (''Cichorium intybus'' var. ''sativum'') has been cultivated in Europe as a [[coffee substitute]].&lt;ref name="Neverman4"&gt;{{cite web|author="Laurie Neverman"|url=https://commonsensehome.com/chicory/|title=Chicory - The "Coffee Root" Plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in [[Indian filter coffee]], and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and southern United States, particularly in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as [[Ricor√©]]. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and during [[World War II]] in Continental Europe. Chicory, with [[sugar beet]] and [[rye]], was used as an ingredient of the [[East Germany|East German]] ''Mischkaffee'' (mixed coffee), introduced during the "[[History of East Germany#Coffee crisis.2C 1976.E2.80.9379|East German coffee crisis]]" of 1976-79. It is also added to coffee in [[Spain|Spanish]],  [[Greece|Greek]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Syria]]n, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] cuisines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turkish-cuisine.org/english/pages.php?ParentID=5&amp;FirstLevel=53&amp;SecondLevel=61 |author=Tijen ƒ∞naltong |title=Wild Herbs of Turkey |publisher=Turkish Cultural Foundation |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116115552/http://www.turkish-cuisine.org/english/pages.php?ParentID=5&amp;FirstLevel=53&amp;SecondLevel=61 |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to [[stout]]s (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavour). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the [[hops]], making a ''witlofbier'', from the Dutch name for the plant.

===Leaf chicory===

====Wild====
Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]] is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the [[Liguria]]n and [[Apulia]]n regions of [[Italy]] and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of ''[[preboggion]]'' and in Greek cuisine of ''[[horta (food)|horta]]''; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with [[fava]] bean puree in the traditional local dish ''fave e cicorie selvatiche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kyle Phillips |url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/chickpeaslentils/r/blr1898.htm |title=Fava Bean Puree with Wild Chicory Recipe - Fave e Cicorie Selvatiche |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115192015/http://italianfood.about.com/od/chickpeaslentils/r/blr1898.htm |archive-date=2013-11-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Albania]], the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of ''[[byrek]]''.

By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be [[Saut√©ing|saut√©ed]] with garlic, [[anchovies]], and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with [[pasta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dolcevitadiaries.co.uk/2009/05/19/wild-chicory-spaghetti |title=Wild Chicory Spaghetti |publisher=Nudo Italia |work=Dolce Vita Diaries |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113155934/http://dolcevitadiaries.co.uk/2009/05/19/wild-chicory-spaghetti/ |archive-date=2011-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or accompany meat dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Jaume F√†brega, ''El gust d'un poble: els plats m√©s famosos de la cuina catalana''. Llomillo fregit amb xicoires&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultivated====
Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as [[salad leaves]]. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gardenzone.info/crops/index.php?crop=chicory|publisher=Gardenzone.info|year=2004|first1=Frann|last1=Leach|title=

* '''[[Radicchio]]''' usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from [[Treviso]] (known as ''radicchio rosso di Treviso''),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.radicchioditreviso.it/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=22|publisher=Consorzio Tutela Radicchio Rosso di Treviso e Variegato di Castelfranco IGP|title=Radicchio Rosso di Treviso IGP - Tardivo (Red Radicchio of Treviso - Late harvest)|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-08-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204043947/http://www.radicchioditreviso.it/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=22|archivedate=2014-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://italianfood.about.com/library/rec/blr0094.htm|title=Radicchio Rosso: The Marvel from Treviso|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Verona]] (''radicchio di Verona''), and [[Chioggia]] (''radicchio di Chioggia''), which are classified as an [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|IGP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= http://www.trevenezie.it/it/radicchio-di-verona-igp/|title=Radicchio di Verona IGP (Radicchio of Verona IGP)|language=Italian|publisher=TreVenezie|date=2 February 2009|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common in Greece.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*'''Sugarloaf''' looks rather like [[cos lettuce]], with tightly packed leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://wefs.co.nz/crops/sugarloaf-chicory|title=Sugarloaf Chicory|publisher = Wairarapa Eco Farms|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Witlof en wortel.jpg|250px|thumb|Witloof, Belgian endive]]
*'''Belgian endive''' is known in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''witloof'' or ''witlof'' ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/witloof|title=witloof|publisher=vocabulary.com|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''indivia'' in Italy, ''endivias'' in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, ''endive'' in France, and ''chicon'' in parts of northern France, in [[Wallonia]] and (in French) in [[Luxembourg]]. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up ([[etiolation]]). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports ''chicon/witloof'' to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanched]] endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html |title=Belgian endive- Cichorium intybus |publisher=The Food Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729081033/http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html |archivedate=2005-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today France is the largest producer of endive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.frenchvegetables.com/about|publisher=Frenchvegetables.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116115552/http://www.frenchvegetables.com/about/|archivedate=2013-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[puntarelle|Catalogna chicory]]''' (''Cichorium intybus var. foliosum''), also known as ''puntarelle'', includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from [[radicchio]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| publisher= PROJECTFOODLAB| date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=2013-08-25|title = Cicoria Asparago o Catalogna - Long-stemmed Italian Chicory| url =http://projectfoodlab.typepad.com/projectfoodlab-italy/2011/03/cicoria-asparago-o-catalogna-long-stemmed-italian-chicory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; of chicory and used throughout [[Italy]].

Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true [[endive]] (''Cichorium endivia'') is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

===Chicory root and inulin===

Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% [[inulin]], a [[polysaccharide]] similar to [[starch]]. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family [[Asteraceae]] as a storage carbohydrate (for example [[Jerusalem artichoke]], [[dahlia]], [[yacon]], etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joseph O'Neill |url=http://www.functionalingredientsmag.com/article/Formulations/using-inulin-and-oligofructose-with-high-intensity-sweeteners.aspx |title=Using inulin and oligofructose with high-intensity sweeteners |publisher=Penton |work=New Hope 360 |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731112515/http://www.functionalingredientsmag.com/article/Formulations/using-inulin-and-oligofructose-with-high-intensity-sweeteners.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes added to yogurts as a [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]]. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble [[dietary fiber]] and [[functional food]].&lt;ref&gt;Madrigal L. Sangronis E. "Inulin and derivates as key ingredients in functional foods. [Review]" [Spanish]  ''Archivos Latinoamericanos de Nutricion''. 57(4):387-96, 2007 Dec.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicory root extract is a [[dietary supplement]] or [[food additive]] produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the [[insoluble]] fraction by [[filtration]] and [[centrifugation]].   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of [[soluble fiber]].  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% [[inulin]], 14% [[sucrose]], 5% [[cellulose]], 6% [[protein]], 4% [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]], and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.&lt;ref name="Kim96"&gt;

== Agents responsible for bitterness ==

The bitter substances are primarily the two [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactone]]s [[lactucin]] and [[lactucopicrin]]. Other ingredients are [[aesculetin]], [[aesculin]], [[cichoriin]], [[umbelliferone]], [[scopoletin]], 6,7-dihydro[[coumarin]], and further sesquiterpene lactones and their [[glycoside]]s.&lt;ref name="Bais&amp;Ravishankar"&gt;Harsh Pal Bais, GA Ravishankar (2001) Cichorium intybus L ‚Äì cultivation, processing, utility, value addition and biotechnology, with an emphasis on current status and future prospects.

===Forage chicory varieties===
*Puna (Grasslands Puna)
: Developed in New Zealand, Grasslands Puna is well adapted to different climates, being grown from [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], to [[New Mexico]] and [[Florida]]. It is resistant to bolting, which leads to high nutrient levels in the leaves in spring. It also has high resistance to grazing.
*Forage Feast
: A variety from France used for human consumption and also for wildlife plots,{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} it is very cold-hardy, and being lower in tannins than other forage varieties, is suitable for human consumption.
*Choice
: Choice has been bred for high winter and early-spring growth activity, and lower amounts of lactucin and lactone, which are believed to taint milk. It is also use for seeding deer wildlife plots.
*Oasis
: Oasis was bred for increased lactone rates for the forage industry, and for higher resistance to fungal diseases such as ''[[Sclerotinia]]''.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}
*Puna II
: This variety is more winter-active than most others, which leads to greater persistence and longevity.
*Grouse
: A New Zealand variety, it is  used as a planting companion for forage [[brassica]]s. More prone to early flowering than other varieties, it has higher crowns more susceptible to overbrowsing.
*Six Point
: A United States variety, it is very similar to Puna.

==History==

The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. [[Horace]] mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "''Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me [[malva]]e''" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Odes 31, ver 15'', ca 30 BC&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, [[Frederick the Great]] banned the importation of coffee into [[Prussia]], leading to the development of a coffee substitute by [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] innkeeper Christian Gottlieb F√∂rster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and [[Berlin]]. By 1795, 22 to 24 factories of this type were in Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Thomas Hengartner |editor2=Christoph Maria Merki |title=Genu√ümittel|publisher=Campus Verlag |location= Frankfurt a.

In [[Napoleonic Era]] France, chicory frequently appeared as an [[adulterant]] in coffee, or as a [[coffee substitute]].&lt;ref name="DGS"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the [[American Civil War]], and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the [[World War II|Second World War]], where [[Camp Coffee]], a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.

The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.

In the United States, chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;(a) Delaney, John H. "New York (State). Dept. of Efficiency and Economy Annual Report". Albany New York, 1915, p. 673.

A common meal in [[Rome]],'' [[puntarelle]]'', is made with chicory sprouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rome.info/food/ |title=Rome food and cuisine |publisher=Rome.info |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FAO|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports that chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.&lt;ref name="ecocrop.fao.org"/&gt;

Chicory is also mentioned in certain [[sericulture|silk-growing]] texts. The primary caretaker of the [[silkworms]], the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the [[Blue Flower]] (e.g. in German language ''Blauwarte'' ‚âà blue lookout by the wayside). It could open locked doors, according to European [[folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael. ''Traditional Folk Remedies'' (Century, 1987), p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clocolan''', established in 1906, is a small town in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] Province of [[South Africa]]. The [[Basotho]] called the place Hlohlolwane (Hlohla-o-lwane, "get up and fight"). New inhabitants mispronounced the name and called it Clocolan.

==History==
The first to inhabit the area were the ancient Kwena people from Botswana. Soon the Basotho followed. The town developed as surrounding communities needed a school, a church and business facilities . The Bakwena, a Sotho tribe, gave Clocolan its name in 1800. The Bakwena Chief Motebang lived in the Northern part of Clocolan, in an area known as ‚ÄòBetang‚Äô, todaya private farm. Motebang invited the neighbouring Baphuthi Zulu clan to assist his people stacking corn baskets after a successful harvest. An argument erupted when one Bakwenaelder charged at the Baphuti's. The argument brought forth the slogan ‚ÄòHlohla-u-loane‚Äô or ‚ÄòHlohloloane‚Äô, that translates as ‚ÄúGet/stand up and fight‚Äù and this may explain how the town earned its name. Settlers in the early 1800s drove the Basotho out of town, forming a township still known as Hlolholoane.

==Geography==
The town is in the Thabo Mofutsanyana region of the [[Free State Province]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.free-state-info.co.za/provinces/town/452/clocolan|title=Clocolan Travel Information|website=www.free-state-info.co.za|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located along the [[Maloti, Eastern Cape|Maloti]] route main road, 20 kilometers from the [[Caledon River|Caledon]] river, alongside the Lesotho border. Due to its location, the town trades with [[Lesotho]], Southern parts of the [[Free State]], [[Kwa-Zulu Natal]] and the [[Cape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.setsoto.info/town-history/|title=Town History {{!}} Setsoto Local Municipality|website=www2.setsoto.info|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Clocolan is situated along the R26 about 34km from [[Ficksburg]] to the northeast and just under 70km from [[Maseru]] to the south over the [[Lesotho]] border. The name is derived from the Hlohlolwane mountain which stands 1 820km above sea level. Hlohlolwane means ‚Äústand-up-and-fight‚Äù which refers to an altercation between the [[Koena tribe]] and Baphuthini over a maize harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsfs/clocolan.php |title=Clocolan: Thabo Mofutsanyana|date=|publisher=South Africa explored|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town was established in 1906 on the farms of Reinzi and Herold. The town grew out of the need for schools, churches and business services for the surrounding farming community. It obtained municipal status on 18 July 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.setsoto.info/town-history|title=Town History|date=|publisher=Setsoto Municipality|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern [[Free State]] cherry industry originated in the Clocolan district where the first trees were planted by Henry Pickstone in 1904 on the farm Platkop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Touring in South Africa|last1=Olivier|first1=Willie|last2=Olivier|first2=Sandra|publisher=Struik Publishers|place=Cape Town|year=2001|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides cherry orchards, farming in the area predominantly consists of asparagus, wheat, maize, potatoes and cattle. Clocolan has one industrial area, situated in the eastern side of the town close to the railway line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.setsoto.info/town-history|title=Town History|date=|publisher=Setsoto Municipality|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farming==
The area is known for the cultivation of [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[cherries]], large cattle and sheep herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoversouthafrica.co.za/leisure/clocolan-tourism/|title=Clocolan Tourism - Things do to in Clocolan - Discover South Africa|website=www.discoversouthafrica.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourists can visit the following places:
*Deemsters Asparagus Factory to learn about the history of this local crop
*Nebo and Die Hoek where visitors can view San rock art paintings
* Tandjiesberg rock shelter has rock paintings and was declared a National Monument on 30 October 1992. It was one of 12 rock art National Monuments in South Africa at the time and is now a Provincial Heritage Site. The rock art painting includes one of an elephant with a small human figure on its trunk. There are also paintings of animals associated with rainmaking and images of a medicine dance. Archaeological excavations established that [[San people|Bushmen]] lived here for at least 1 000 years. It is believed that the mountain above the rock shelter was a place of spiritual significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= South Africa‚Äôs top sites: Family|last1=Philip|first1=Harrison|last2=Heese|first2=Sue|publisher=Spearhead|place=Kenilworth|year=2006|page=127|isbn=9780864865830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/sahris/sites/923080001|title=Shelter with Rock Paintings, Tandjiesberg, Clocolan District|last=|first=|date=|website=SAHRIS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vintage Tractor and Engine Fair===
The Vintage Tractor and Engine Fair is an annual fair that has taken place in Clocolan since 1989. The fair started with only 29 tractors and has grown in recent years to 153 . Tractors are paraded through the small farming community. Some of its attractions are a 1902 threshold machine, the Annual National Ploughing Championships and a hand plowing with magnificent Nguni bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sa-venues.com/events/freestate/vintage-tractor-fair/|title=Vintage Tractor Fair|website=www.sa-venues.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Antonius Maria "Dries" van Agt''' ({{IPA-nl|Ààdris f…ën Àà…ëxt|lang|NL-nl Dries van Agt.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;''van'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|v…ën|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; born 2 February 1931) is a retired Dutch politician, judge, diplomat and activist who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 19 December 1977 until 4 November 1982.

A [[jurist]] by occupation, Van Agt worked as a [[lawyer]] for the [[law firm]] Van der Putt, Nijst, Van Sandick en Depla from 1956 until 1958 when he became a [[Civil service|civil servant]] working for the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality|Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries]] and the [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Ministry of Justice]] until 1968. Van Agt became a professor of [[criminal procedure]] at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] in 1968. In 1971 he was appointed as a [[judge]] at the court of [[Arnhem]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 1971|election of 1971]], he was asked by the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) to become [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice]] in the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]]. Van Agt accepted and resigned as a professor and judge the same day he took office as the new [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice]] on 6 July 1971. Van Agt remained [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice]] in the [[Den Uyl cabinet]] following the [[Dutch general election, 1972|election of 1972]] and also became [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]] on 11 May 1973. On 10 December 1976 Van Agt was selected as the first [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] and became the ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate) for the [[Dutch general election, 1977|election of 1977]]. He resigned as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice]] to become the first [[parliamentary leader]] of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] and a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] taking office on 8 June 1977. Following the election the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] became the second largest party in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]].

After a failed cabinet formation with the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], Van Agt struck a deal with the [[Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] [[Hans Wiegel]] that resulted in the formation of the [[First Van Agt cabinet]], also known as Van Agt‚ÄìWiegel cabinet, with Van Agt becoming [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] taking office on 19 December 1977. With the following [[Dutch general election, 1981|election of 1981]], Van Agt again as ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' lost one seat and a coalition formation with the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and the [[Democrats 66]] (D66) resulted in the [[second Van Agt cabinet]]. On 29 May 1982 the [[Second Van Agt cabinet]] collapsed after the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] retracted their support. A third cabinet was formed with Van Agt also serving as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]; the [[Third Van Agt cabinet]] stayed in office until the [[Dutch general election, 1982|election of 1982]]. Van Agt again as ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' lost three seats and the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] became the second largest party. A cabinet formation with the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) was formed but Van Agt unexpectedly announced his retirement from national politics and stood down as [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] on 25 October 1982. Van Agt remained [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] until the [[First Lubbers cabinet]] was installed on 4 November 1982.

After his premiership, Van Agt remained in active politics and became the [[List of King's and Queen's Commissioners of North Brabant|Queen's Commissioner of North Brabant]] taking office on 1 June 1983. On 22 April 1987 Van Agt resigned as [[List of King's and Queen's Commissioners of North Brabant|Queen's Commissioner]] because of criticism on his cooperation with the [[States-Provincial]]. Van Agt he became a [[diplomat]] for the [[European Communities]] and served as [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|Ambassador of the European Union to Japan]] from 1 April 1987 until 1 January 1990 when he became [[Delegation of the European Union to the United States|Ambassador of the European Union to the United States]] serving until 1 April 1995 when he retired from politics at the age of sixty-four. Following the end of his active political career, Van Agt occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards on international non-governmental organizations ([[InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government|InterAction Council]], [[Green Cross International]] and the [[Edmund Burke Foundation]]). Van Agt served as a visiting professor of [[international relations]] at the [[Ritsumeikan University]], the [[United Nations University]] and the [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] from 1995 until 2004.

Van Agt is known for his abilities as a [[Negotiation|negotiator]] and [[debate]]r. During his premiership, his [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinets]] were responsible for reforming the [[public sector]] and [[civil service]] and the struggle with the [[Early 1980s recession|recession in the 1980s]]. He holds the distinction of being the first [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]. Van Agt also has been active as an [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[human rights]] activist and as an advocate in promoting the [[Two-state solution]] for the [[Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict]]. Van Agt continues to comment on political affairs as a statesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.absolutefacts.nl/politiek/data/agtdriesvan1931.htm Dries van Agt (1931)], Absolutefacts.nl, 10 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; With the death of [[Piet de Jong]] in July 2016, he became the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands by age|oldest living former Dutch Prime Minister]].

==Early life==
Andreas Antonius Maria van Agt was born on 2 February 1931 in [[Geldrop]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Netherlands Province]] of [[North Brabant]] in a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family. After receiving his diploma Gymnasium-A at the [[Scholengemeenschap Augustinianum|Augustinianum]] he studied at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Catholic University of Nijmegen]], where he received his Doctorate in Law in 1955. After graduating, he practiced law in Eindhoven until 1957, after which he worked in the office of legal and business affairs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries until 1962. From 1962 to 1968, he worked for the Ministry of Justice.

==Politics==
===Minister and Deputy Prime Minister===
[[File:Dries van Agt (1971).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dries van Agt as [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice]] in 1971.]]
Van Agt entered politics as a member of the [[Catholic People's Party]], which merged with the other two major Christian Democratic parties in 1980 to form the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA). From 1968 to 1971, Van Agt was Professor of Criminal Law at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. From 1971 to 1973, he was Minister of Justice in the government of [[Barend Biesheuvel]]. He caused outrage when he tried to pardon [[Willy Lages|the last three Nazi war criminals still in Dutch prisons]] in 1972. From 1973 to 1977 he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in the government of [[Joop den Uyl]].

===Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal===
In 1976, Van Agt was elected the first [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]], then still a federation of the three religious parties [[Christian Historical Union]], [[Catholic People's Party]] and [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]], which first ran in 1977 with a united list (the merger followed in 1980). With Van Agt as top candidate, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] reversed in 1977 years of decline to return to power.

===Prime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt I===
In the parliamentary elections of May 1977 the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] obtained their largest number of seats, so a second Den Uyl coalition looked likely. However, the tension between the [[Catholic People's Party]] and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] in the last reign, combined with the fact that a coalition between [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] was possible, the talks failed after a period of seven months. Eventually Van Agt negotiated a deal with [[Hans Wiegel]], leader of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]. From 19 December 1977 to 11 September 1981 Van Agt was Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs in the Cabinet Van Agt I.

===Prime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt II===

In 1981, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] lost parliamentary seats, so a continuation of a [[Christian Democratic Appeal]]-[[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] coalition was not possible. Van Agt, leader of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], was forced to go in coalition with the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]. Also [[Democrats 66]] (which, under Jan Terlouw gained a significant number of seats) participated in the coalition talks, after 3 months of difficult negotiations that resulted in the Cabinet Van Agt II (11 September 1981 ‚Äì 29 May 1982). In this composition Van Agt worked with Joop den Uyl again as Den Uyl was made Deputy Prime Minister and "super minister" of Social Affairs and Employment. The characterological and political differences led to several divisions, and in May 1982 the government fell.

The personal strife between Van Agt and Den Uyl were so deteriorated that when Den Uyl died from a [[brain tumor]] in 1987, Van Agt was not invited to the memorial by the family. Den Uyl's wife Liesbeth argued that Van Agt had prevented the second Den Uyl coalition from forming in 1977.

===Prime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt III===
The caretaker government went through as a minority cabinet, with only ministers from the parties [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and [[Democrats 66]], in the Cabinet Van Agt III. For replacing the six [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] ministers, five new [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and [[Democrats 66]] ministers were in place, while van Agt in the cabinet, as well as being Prime Minister was also Minister of Foreign Affairs.

New parliamentary elections were organized for September 1982. Although Van Agt, by this point was worn out, he was persuaded again to be [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] but shortly after the election he withdrew as a candidate for prime minister and was succeeded by Ruud Lubbers.

===Queen's Commissioner===

==After politics==
[[File:Mark Rutte en Dries van Agt in het Torentje.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Dries van Agt and [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] [[Mark Rutte]] in 2011.]]

===Diplomat===
Dries van Agt served as [[Ambassador]] of the [[European Community]] to [[Japan]] from 1987 to 1990 and to the [[United States]] from 1990 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, he was a Visiting Professor of International Relations at the [[University of Kyoto]].

===Professor===
He is currently Prime Counsellor for the [[International Forum for Justice and Peace]], a foundation under Dutch law, registered at the Chamber of Commerce in [[Amsterdam]]. Chaired by retired international businessman [[Ben Smoes]], they are currently focused on justice and peace in regard to  the Israel/Palestine conflict

===Activist===
Van Agt lectured in May 2006 in Cairo at the invitation of the Egyptian electronic magazine [[Arab-West Report]] about great changes in the cultural climate of north-western Europe in the past decades, becoming more hostile to religion, including Islam. Muslims, he argued, need to understand those changes in order to be able to respond better to European criticism on Islam and the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;For the full text of his lecture, entitled, "Cultures between Clash and Reconciliation: The Role of the Media and Academia," see AWR, 2006, week 53, art. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Agt has also spoken against the Council of State in Egypt for continuous delay in granting the [[Center for Arab-West Understanding]] (CAWU) the NGO status. He met with prominent figures in Egypt to persuade them to do so. The Egyptian Council of State, after van Agt's visit to Cairo in 2006, ruled on 18 February 2007 that the Center should be recognized as an NGO under Egyptian law, ending its three-year struggle to obtain this status. Egypt is known for its reluctance in granting NGO status in order to discourage political participation. [[Cornelis Hulsman]], a Dutch sociologist, the editor-in-chief of Arab-West Report, and the head of CAWU, stated that van Agt's effort significantly impacted the realization of their goals, which usually requires a lengthy amount of time and scrutiny in its political purposes.

For some years he has taken an outspoken stance regarding the Middle East, resulting in a fierce criticism of the policies undertaken by the government of Israel with regard to the Palestinians. When in office, van Agt was a staunch supporter of Israel, but after he stepped down in 1982 he changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/former-dutch-pm-champions-palestinian-cause "Former Dutch PM champions Palestinian cause"], ''[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]'' (10 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own words an important turning point was a visit at the late nineties at [[Bethlehem University]] on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.driesvanagt.nl/p_mijnpublicaties009.pdf "De bekering van Dries van Agt"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019203328/http://www.driesvanagt.nl/p_mijnpublicaties009.pdf |date=19 October 2013 }}, HP|DE TIJD, 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://archief.nrc.nl/?modus=l&amp;text=Ik+kan+het+wel+uitschreeuwen&amp;hit=7&amp;set=2&amp;check=Y "Ik kan het wel uitschreeuwen"], interview oud-premier Dries van Agt, NRC Handelsblad, 22 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He has accused Israel of "[[state terrorism]]" and turning the Palestinian Authority territories into "[[bantustan]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Cnaan Liphshiz, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/dutch-jimmy-carter-accuses-israel-of-terrorism-in-new-book-1.248633 'Dutch Jimmy Carter' accuses Israel of terrorism in new book] ''[[Haaretz]]'' (27 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Van Agt said that Jews should have a state in Germany instead of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/former-dutch-pm-jews-shouldve-had-a-state-in-germany Former Dutch PM: Jews should have had a state in Germany], ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' (11 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, in reference to the visit of [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netenyahu]] to the Netherlands, van Agt argued that the ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the building of [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] there constituted a [[war crime]] under the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] and suggested that Netenyahu should have been sent to the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/former-dutch-pm-dries-van-agt-benjamin-netanyahu-war-criminal-tried-the-hague-a7228566.html |title=Former Dutch PM calls Benjamin Netanyahu a ‚Äòwar criminal‚Äô who should be tried in The Hague |last1=Cockburn |first1=Harry |date=6 September 2016 |website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Agt is known for his use of archaic language and complicated phrasing, as well as for his love for [[cycling]]. He married his wife Eugenie Krekelberg in 1958, and they've had three children and seven grandchildren. In 2012, he joined the Advisory Board of the [[International Museum for Family History]].

The '''Edelstam Prize''', named after [[Harald Edelstam]], is awarded annually by the Harald Edelstam Foundation. 
The Edelstam Prize is awarded for outstanding contributions and exceptional courage in standing up for one‚Äôs beliefs in the defense of Human Rights. The Edelstam Prize is named after, and awarded in memory of, the Swedish diplomat and ambassador Harald Edelstam (1913-1989). Harald Edelstam distinguished himself as diplomat by his professional competence, his bravery and his civic courage in the fight for Human Rights. He was an early proponent and symbol of what is today known as "Responsibility to Protect", and his memorable acts contributed to saving more than a thousand lives.

The winner of the Edelstam Prize can be a private person or a person who serves in government, international or national organisations. The winner shall be an individual who has acted in Ambassador Harald Edelstam‚Äôs spirit in a country/countries where Human Rights, according to international law, have been violated.

The laureate must have shown outstanding capabilities in analysing and handling complex situations and in finding ways, even unconventional and creative ones, to defend Human Rights. The candidate has, presumably in a complex situation, been able to take a decisive role in helping threatened people or directly saving human lives. Civic courage is a central parameter in the selection of the successful candidate.

== The Jury ==
An international jury selects the winners from a list of nominated candidates. The jury is chaired by Harald Edelstam's granddaughter [[Caroline Edelstam]], co-founder of the [[Edelstam Foundation]].

== Edelstam Prize Laureate 2012 ==
The Edelstam Prize Jury‚Äôs motivation to give Mrs. [[Bahareh Hedayat]] the Edelstam Prize is: "Mrs. Bahareh Hedayat has through her outstanding courage and commitment to justice actively worked against Human Rights violations in Iran. In spite of serious warnings and threats from the regime‚Äôs security and intelligence forces, she has repeatedly risked her own life and freedom when defending Human Rights. She has been arrested upon several occasions, and is imprisoned right now for these reasons. The Harald Edelstam Foundation considers her a prisoner of conscience, and in consequence respectfully asks the authorities of the Republic of Iran to set her free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/2012/03/imprisoned-iranian-woman-activist-awarded-edelstam-prize/|title=Imprisoned Iranian woman activist awarded Edelstam prize|work=nobelwomensinitiative.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412062937/http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/2012/03/imprisoned-iranian-woman-activist-awarded-edelstam-prize/|archivedate=2016-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2012/03/07/sweden-prize-iran-woman-prisoner/|title=SWEDEN: Edelstam prize brings honor and award to Iran woman prisoner|work=wnn interviews global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Edelstam Prize Laureate 2014 ==
The Edelstam Prize Jury‚Äôs motivation to give Mr. Benjamin Manuel Jer√≥nimo the Edelstam Prize is: "Benjam√≠n Manuel Jer√≥nimo is a Mayan from Guatemala. Mayan communities, in spite of being the majority of the population, have been exploited, discriminated against, and victimized in their own homeland for centuries. The worst period came between 1960 and 1996: egregious abuses of human rights were perpetrated in Guatemala during the internal armed conflict. According to the CEH (UN backed Truth Commission) 200,000 civilians were murdered and 50,000 were forcibly disappeared. Most of them, 83% (93% of the abuses caused by the State), were defenseless indigenous Mayans. After the signature of the Peace Agreements, nobody was made accountable for these heinous crimes.
Benjam√≠n considered that those responsible for the crimes should be brought to justice. It was not an easy task, since discrimination, threats, retaliations and violence persist in Guatemala, and the rate of violent deaths today is double that during the war. Benjam√≠n represents the voice of the victims; has courageous and tirelessly worked for decades in defense of human rights, truth and justice for the indigenous communities in his country, despite repeated threats against his life. His endeavor and commitment are an example and reminder every day to the international community than most of the perpetrators in Guatemala remain unpunished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panampost.com/adriana-peralta/2014/11/12/swedish-human-rights-advocates-honor-guatemalan-activist/|title=Swedish Human-Rights Advocates Honor Guatemalan Activist|author=Adriana Peralta|work=PanAm Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/photos/photo-of-the-day-slideshow-slideshow/benjamin-manuel-jeronimo-guatemala-smiles-being-awarded-edelstam-photo-185957445.html|title=Benjamin Manuel Jeronimo of Guatemala awarded The Edelstam Prize 2014 |date=18 November 2015|work=Photo of the Day - Yahoo News India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/tag/benjamin-manuel-jeronimo|title=Benjam√≠n Manuel Jer√≥nimo - La Prensa Noticias|work=laprensa.com.ni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Despeje.png|thumb|400px|Map of El Cagu√°n DMZ]]

The '''El Cagu√°n DMZ''' ({{lang-es|Zona de Distensi√≥n, zona de despeje de San Vicente del Cagu√°n}}) was a [[demilitarized zone]] of 42,000&amp;nbsp;km¬≤ in southern [[Colombia]] authorized by the government of President [[Andres Pastrana Arango|Andr√©s Pastrana]] to negotiate a [[FARC-Government peace process (1999-2002)|peace process]] with the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC-EP). It existed for three years, from 1999 until 2002.

On October 8, 1998, then presidential candidate Andr√©s Pastrana agreed with FARC commanders to create a [[demilitarized zone]] in the region of El Cagu√°n river basin, a jungle region in south central Colombia made up by the municipalities of [[Vista Hermosa, Meta|Vista Hermosa]], [[La Macarena, Meta|La Macarena]], [[La Uribe]] and [[Mesetas]] in [[Meta Department]], and [[San Vicente del Cagu√°n]] in [[Caquet√° Department]] to negotiate a possible peace process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''El Comit√©''', or '''MINP''', was a 1960s militant organization that sought independence for [[Puerto Rico]] from the [[United States]]. Together with several other organizations, it formed the nucleus of the [[Movimiento Pro-Independencia]] that formed at a time when the United States was coming under increasing international criticism for holding onto one of the world's last colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Sharon Ann, and Mejia, Armando Xavier, '''Latino Americans and Political Participation''' Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2004. {{ISBN|1-85109-523-3}}. page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
El Comit√© was born on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] around 1970.  It slowly began to spread to other cities, originally as a militant, community-based organization protesting so-called urban renewal programs that were replacing low income housing with high-rise developments &lt;ref&gt;Jennings, James and Monte Rivera, eds. 1984. '''Puerto Rican Politics in Urban America.''' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; El Comit√© filled the vacuum left by the decline of the [[Young Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Sharon Ann, and Mejia, Armando Xavier, '''Latino Americans and Political Participation''' Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2004. {{ISBN|1-85109-523-3}}. page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975 El Comite was renamed MINP, Movimiento para la Independencia Nacional Puertorrique√±a (Movement for Puerto Rican National Independence).&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Sharon Ann, and Mejia, Armando Xavier, '''Latino Americans and Political Participation''' Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2004. {{ISBN|1-85109-523-3}}. page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Operational Model ==
El Comit√© sought to be a multi-issue organization, offering a comprehensive program for the community.  Besides its community roles, the group collaborated with a student sector, the Puerto Rican Student Union (PRSU), and a workers organization, and initiated a process that eventually led to the formation of the Latin Women's Collective.  Through its publication ''Unidad Latina'',   it addressed the gamut of issues affecting the community, linking local issues to international forces.&lt;ref&gt;Velazquez, Jose.

A '''facilitation board''' is a proposed economic institution conceived by economists [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]] which act in systems of [[economic democracy]] as agencies that facilitate information exchange and processing for collective consumption proposals and for large-scale investment projects, workers requests for changing places of employment, and individuals and families seeking to find membership in living units and neighborhoods, among other functions.

The proposed boards form part of the process of ''participatory planning'' within Albert and Hahnel's economic system of [[participatory economics]] and [[Participism]]. If adopted, they would serve to manage and coordinate proposals by workers and consumers in place of a central [[Sovereign state|state]] or [[markets]].

==Description==

Iteration Facilitation Boards (IFBs) act as management bodies in [[participatory economics]] and perhaps other similar systems for local [[workers' council|consumer and worker councils]] and are the mechanism via which economic [[Asset allocation|allocation]] is decided upon and ultimately implemented in an economy without a state or markets; although the kind of participatory planning found in [[parecon]] could also possibly be combined with an [[artificial market]] (arket) for certain commercial goods and services.

===Participatory planning===
[[File:Nested council.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|A diagram of the nested council structure.]]
Democratic participatory planning is an economic practice used to determine the production, consumption, and allocation of resources, goods, and services in a given economy and recommended as a solution to the problems seen in both statist [[central planning]] within [[state-socialism]] and [[privatism|privatist]] markets within capitalism. Facilitation boards are used to guide this process effectively.

Through participatory planning, workers and consumers decide democratically which and how many goods to produce, decide construction plans, determine how vital resources are managed and all other economic issues at various levels through a system of confederated "nested councils" or assemblies with local economic issues being determined at the local level, and administrative issues on a wider level being determined by city, regional, provincial, and country councils with [[delegates]] sent successively to each level to communicate the decisions made by the nested council below them.

Local decisions like the construction of a playground might be made in the ward or city council, probably interacting with both city and countrywide councils through rotating delegates. Countrywide decisions, like the construction of a high-speed mass transportation system, would be discussed by the country council, possibly interacting with a city council in the city where the materials are produced, or countrywide or international councils.

===Role in economic planning===
During an event known as a planning procedure, which could be an annual, bi-annual or quarterly event, facilitation boards first announce a set of indicative prices which workers and consumers use, individually and through their councils at each level, when deciding on their production and consumption proposals. Proposals could be done either collectively through a local consumer council, or individually on a computer; or any combination of the two. When the proposals are all in, the IFBs aggregate all the production and consumption proposals for the different categories of goods and services ‚Äì inputs into all the production processes as well as consumer goods ‚Äì to see if proposed supply and demand are equal. If they are not equal for every good and service the IFB revises the set of indicative prices and the process is repeated through successive rounds until a consistent set of production and consumption proposals is arrived at.

The facilitation board would work with the citizen(s) that originated the proposal to work it into a manageable proposition. Around the time of the planning procedure, interested parties within the region affected by the collective consumption proposal would be able to view the collective consumption proposals and vote them up or down. This could be done at large meetings or via computer. At the same time, worker's councils and producers councils would respond with production proposals outlining the outputs they propose to produce and the inputs they believe are required to produce them. Individual workers would indicate their proposed hours of work, and workers will be able to propose upgrades and innovations for their workplace, aided by a facilitation board.

Facilitation boards would then calculate excess proposed [[supply and demand]] based on the proposals, adjusting the indicative price for each final good or service according to its impact on society and the environment so that the social opportunity cost is reflected. Using the new indicative prices, consumer and workers' councils would revise and resubmit their proposals, as some goods would be more expensive, and others less expensive. Proposals deemed excessive by other parties would become very expensive, creating a disincentive to pursue them.

Iterations would continue according to some predefined method which is likely to converge within an acceptable time delay. For instance, proposals would only be changeable by a minimum percentage for the second round, and a lesser percentage for the third round, and so on, forcing convergence of a feasible plan.

The facilitation boards then implement these final proposals by setting new prices and organizing production plans. These prices would represent the estimated marginal social [[opportunity cost]] for all goods and services. During the planning procedure, not only do the prices reflect proposed supply and demand, but also the social and ecological cost of producing the good. For instance a product that produces pollution in its manufacture, or is especially dangerous for workers to produce, would have its price automatically inflated to discourage excess consumption. Thus

:Final retail price = [[supply and demand]] + [[opportunity cost]]

In the event of unforeseen circumstances occurring in between planning procedures, the IFBs would adjust prices or production quotas accordingly within established guidelines.

The facilitation boards should function according to a maximum level of radical transparency and only have very limited powers of mediation, subject to the discretion of the participating councils. The real decisions regarding the formulation and implementation of the plan are to be made in the consumers' and producers' councils.

==Criticism==
Facilitation board members would do very important economic work running the economy, and thus one might think they would gradually take over in any system that would adopt them. Its proponents argue that this could be prevented by requiring board members never to handle proposals that pertain to their own region and making any IFB meeting transparent to the public. Political economist [[Pat Devine]] has suggested that if implemented in a society with advanced technology, the IFB could itself merely be a highly advanced computer system.

It has been debated whether systems using only participatory planning would be able to change prices as demand changes and other factors modify the results of the participatory planning procedure. Albert and Hahnel have argued that this would be done efficiently. Facilitation boards could continually modify prices as time goes on, finding reasons for production shortfalls, production overruns, changes in demand, environmental disasters, etc. and the facilitation boards could adjust prices accordingly. One proposed way to do this would be to adjust prices within council guidelines on a monthly basis as events unfold.

Hahnel and Albert note that markets themselves hardly adjust prices instantaneously and contend that an economy using universal participatory planning should be able to do just as well, or better. Although not recommended by either Albert or Hahnel, participatory planning could potentially be combined with an [[artificial market]] for [[microeconomic]] matters so as to take some of the potential strain off consumers and make the planning procedure less complex by retaining it exclusively for [[macroeconomic]] matters. Facilitation boards could then be used to regulate the artificial market as well as helping implement macro economic decisions.

==Fictional accounts==
An institution with the functions of a facilitation board appears as the Resource Review Board in Chris Carlsson's post-revolutionary San Francisco in the novel ''After the Deluge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Full Enjoyment Books | isbn = 978-0-926664-07-4 | last = Carlsson | first = Chris | title = After the deluge | date = January 2004| pages = 11‚Äì12, 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernwood Publishing''' is an independent Canadian [[publisher]] that publishes non-fiction books dealing with [[social justice]] and issues of social, political and economic importance.

Fernwood was founded in 1991 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, publishing its first books in the spring of 1992. The Halifax office was moved to Black Point, Nova Scotia and, in 1994, a second office was opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookpublishers.mb.ca/index.php/member-publishers/associate-members/fernwood-publishing-co/ Profile - Association of Manitoba Book Publishers]
&lt;/ref&gt; In eighteen seasons, Fernwood has published over 300 titles.&lt;ref&gt;fernwood Publishing, [http://www.fernwoodpublishing.ca/page/About-Us "About-Us "]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Fernwood acquired Roseway Publishing, which is now their fiction imprint.

Fernwood offers an alternative Canadian perspective on issues that many major book publishers do not.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;Hillary Lindsay, [http://canadiandimension.com/articles/1926 "Keeping a Body of Critical Literature Alive"], ''Canadian Dimension Magazine'', May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Founder and co-publisher Errol Sharpe has been quoted as saying, "In an era when the restructuring of capitalism seems to be threatening to erase many of the gains that have been made by the oppressed in society, we think that our books have a part to play in bucking the trend."&lt;ref name=Lindsay/&gt;

'''GayLib''' is an LGBT conservative and centre-right political faction formerly affiliated with the French political party [[Union for a Popular Movement]] from its inception in 2002 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Jardin, ''Dictionnaire de la Droite'', Paris: [[√âditions Larousse|Larousse]], 2007, p. 138 [https://books.google.com/books?id=du-IAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22GayLib%22&amp;dq=%22GayLib%22&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Its president is Emmanuel Blanc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaylib.org/gaylib/le-bureau Le bureau de GayLib]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of GayLib was supported by [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], [[Alain Jupp√©]], and [[Fran√ßois Baroin]].&lt;ref name="historique"&gt;[http://www.gaylib.org/pages/presentation.php#histo Historique]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, its members took part in the pride parade in Paris for the first time.&lt;ref name="historique"/&gt;

Since 2007, they have been waylaid by [[The Pink Panthers]],&lt;ref&gt;C√©dric Douzant, 'Gay pride: entre les Panth√®res roses et Gaylib, la guerre continue', , in ''[[T√™tu]]'', 29 June 2009 [http://www.tetu.com/actualites/france/gay-pride-entre-les-pantheres-roses-et-gaylib-la-guerre-continue-14996/10]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Act Up]] and [[AIDES]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Endeweld, 'Marche des fiert√©s: le char de GayLib bloqu√© pendant une heure', in ''[[T√™tu]]'', 30 June 2008 [http://www.tetu.com/actualites/france/Marche-des-fiertes-le-char-de-GayLib-bloque-pendant-une-heure-13202]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the UMP's repudiation of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="T√™tu"&gt;C√©dric Douzant, 'Gaylib √† la gay pride: le char qui d√©range', in ''[[T√™tu]]'', 25 June 2009 [http://www.tetu.com/actualites/france/gaylib-a-la-gay-pride-le-char-qui-derange-14965/10]&lt;/ref&gt; However, GayLib says that the UMP helped toughen up hate-crime laws, improved the [[Pacte civil de solidarit√©|PACS]], created the [[High authority for the struggle against discrimination and for equality|HALDE]], and had a foreign-policy stance against homosexuality crimilazation through [[Rama Yade]]'s appeal to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="T√™tu"/&gt;

In January 2013, it left the UMP because of the party‚Äôs opposition to same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2013/01/12/97001-20130112FILWWW00406-gaylib-quitte-l-ump.php Gaylib quitte l'UMP ], ''Le Figaro'', 12/01/2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently seeking to affiliate with the [[Union of Democrats and Independents]], whose president, [[Jean-Louis Borloo]], endorses same-sex marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11921">The '''Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone''' ('''GDELT'''), created by [[Kalev Leetaru]] of [[Yahoo!]] and [[Georgetown University]], along with Philip Schrodt and others, describes itself as "an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what's happening around the world, what its context is and who's involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdeltproject.org/about.html|title = About GDELT: The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone|accessdate = June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fpm-canonical&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/22/mapped_what_every_protest_in_the_last_34_years_looks_like|title = Mapped: Every Protest on the Planet Since 1979|publisher = ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]''|accessdate = June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datahub.io/de/dataset/gdelt|title = Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone |publisher = datahub.io|accessdate = June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early explorations leading up to the creation of GDELT were described by co-creator [[Philip Schrodt]] in a conference paper in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pcglobal/conferences/methods/papers/schrodt.pdf|title = Automated Production of High-Volume, Near-Real-Time Political Event Data|last = Schrodt|first = Philip|date = January 20, 2011|accessdate = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dataset is available on [[Google Cloud Platform]].&lt;ref name=googlecloud/&gt;

==Data==

GDELT includes data from 1979 to the present. The data is available as zip files in tab-separated value format using a [[comma-separated values|CSV extension]] for easy import into [[Microsoft Excel]] or similar spreadsheet software.&lt;ref name=rawdata&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdeltproject.org/data.html#rawdatafiles|title = Raw data files|publisher = Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 1979 to 2005 is available in the form of one zip file per year, with the file size gradually increased from 14.3 MB in 1979 to 125.9 MB in 2005, reflecting the increase in the number of news media and the frequency and comprehensiveness of event recording.&lt;ref name=rawdata-files&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/index.html|title = All GDELT Event Files|accessdate = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data files from January 2006 to March 2013 are available at monthly granularity, with the zipped file size rising from 11 MB in January 2006 to 103.2 MB in March 2013. Data files from April 1, 2013 onward are available at a daily granularity. The data file for each date is made available by 6 AM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] the next day. As of June 2014, the size of the daily zipped file is about 5-12 MB.&lt;ref name=rawdata/&gt;&lt;ref name=rawdata-files/&gt; The data files use [[Conflict and Mediation Event Observations]] (CAMEO) coding for recording events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdeltproject.org/data.html#documentation|title = Documentation|publisher = Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a blog post for ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', co-creator [[Kalev Leetaru]] attempted to use GDELT data to answer the question of whether the [[Arab Spring]] sparked protests worldwide, using the quotient of the number of protest-related events to the total number of events recorded as a measure of ''protest intensity'' for which the time trend was then studied.&lt;ref name=arab-spring/&gt; Political scientist and data science/forecasting expert [[Jay Ulfelder]] critiqued the post on his personal blog, saying that Leetaru's normalization method may not have adequately accounted for the change in the nature and composition of media coverage.&lt;ref name=ulfelder-limitations/&gt;

The dataset is also available on [[Google Cloud Platform]] and can be accessed using [[Google BigQuery]].&lt;ref name=googlecloud/&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic reception===

GDELT has been cited and used in a number of academic studies, such as a study of visual and predictive analytics of [[Singapore]] news (along with [[Wikipedia]] and the [[Straits Times Index]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1404.1996|title = Visual and Predictive Analytics on Singapore News: Experiments on GDELT, Wikipedia, and ^STI|last = Phua|first = Clifton|last2 = Feng|first2 = Yuzhang|last3 = Ji|first3 = Junyao|last4 = Soh|first4 = Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study of political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/76/3576507.html|title = A nuanced study of political conflict using the Global Datasets of Events Location and Tone (GDELT) dataset|last = Yonamine|first = James E.|accessdate = June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Global Warming Policy Foundation''' ('''GWPF''') is a climate change denial lobby group in the [[United Kingdom]], whose stated aims are to challenge "extremely damaging and harmful policies" envisaged by governments to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate]] [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8398103.stm | title=Ed Miliband clashes with Lord Lawson on global warming | date=6 December 2009 | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[news.bbc.co.uk]] | accessdate=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{Cite press release | title=Launched today! | publisher=The Global Warming Policy Foundation | date=23 November 2009 | url=http://www.thegwpf.org/launched-today/ | accessdate=25 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While their position is that the science of global warming or climate change is "not yet settled," the GWPF claims that its membership comes from a broad spectrum ranging from "the IPCC position through agnosticism to outright scepticism."&lt;ref name=who /&gt; The GWPF as well as some of its prominent members have been characterized as promoting [[climate change denial]].&lt;ref name="IJ denial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WherryEditor2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick F. Wherry|author2=Juliet B. Schor, Consulting Editor|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Economics and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByWDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1020|date=December 8, 2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-5063-4617-5|page=1020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, when the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] ruled that the GWPF had breached rules on impartiality, a non-charitable organisation called the "Global Warming Policy Forum" or "GWPF" was created as a wholly owned subsidiary, to do lobbying that a charity could not. 
The GWPF website carries an array of articles "sceptical" of scientific findings of anthropogenic global warming and its impacts.

==History==
The foundation was established in November 2009, shortly after the start of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], with its headquarters in a room at the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining]], subsequently moved to 55 [[Tufton Street]], London SW1P 3QL. Its director is [[Benny Peiser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Davies | first =Caroline  | last2 = Goldenberg  | first2 =Suzanne | title = The voices of climate change sceptics : Environment | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/24/voices-of-climate-change-denial?INTCMP=SRCH | publisher = The Guardian | date = 24 November 2009 | accessdate = 6 January 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contact ifnfo"&gt;{{cite web | title=Contact | website=The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) | date=17 April 2012 | url=http://www.thegwpf.org/contact-2/ | accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an expert on the social and economic aspects of [[physical exercise]], and it is chaired by former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Nigel Lawson]].&lt;ref name=eweek&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/news-security/climate-change-deniers-quote-hacked-university-data-2539 | title=Climate Change Deniers Quote Hacked University Data | last=Judge | first=Peter | work=[[eWeek|eWEEK Europe UK]] | publisher=techweekeurope.co.uk | date=23 November 2009| accessdate=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GWPF states that it is "deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated" to address [[climate change]] and that it aims to "bring reason, integrity and balance to a debate that has become seriously unbalanced, irrationally alarmist, and all too often depressingly intolerant".&lt;ref name=press/&gt;&lt;ref name=sundaytimes&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6936289.ece | title=The great climate change science scandal | last=Leake | first=Jonathan | date=29 November 2009 | work=[[The Sunday Times]] | publisher=timesonline.co.uk | accessdate=22 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Call for an independent inquiry into Climate Research Unit e-mails===
The GWPF's first act was to call for a high-level, independent inquiry into the hacked e-mails from the [[University of East Anglia]]'s [[Climatic Research Unit]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6927598.ece | title=Copenhagen will fail ‚Äì and quite right too | last=Lawson | first=Nigel | authorlink=Nigel Lawson | date=24 November 2009 | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=timesonline.co.uk | accessdate=22 December 2009 | quote = Last week an apparent hacker obtained access to their computers and published in the blogosphere part of their internal e-mail traffic. And the CRU has conceded that the at least some of the published e-mails are genuine. | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquiry&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6941168.ece | title=Climate change sceptics: Phil Jones inquiry must be 'independent and transparent' | last=Ramnarayan | first=Abhinav | date=2 December 2009 | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=timesonline.co.uk | accessdate=22 December 2009 | quote = The inquiry into the leaked-emails controversy at the University of East Anglia must be independent and transparent for the sake of science, a prominent climate change sceptic group said today. [...] The investigation comes after e-mails between scientists at the CRU were hacked and posted online by climate change sceptics, | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spokesman for the [[Met Office]], a government agency which works with the Climate Research Unit in providing global temperature information, dismissed this call.  "If you look at the emails, there isn't any evidence that the data was falsified and there's no evidence that climate change is a hoax. It's a shame that some of the sceptics have had to take this rather shallow attempt to discredit robust science undertaken by some of the world's most respected scientists. The bottom line is that temperatures continue to rise and humans are responsible for it. We have every confidence in the science and the various datasets we use. The peer-review process is as robust as it could possibly be."&lt;ref name="hickman-robust"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/23/climate-sceptics-bob-ward-nigel-lawson | title=Climate change champion and sceptic both call for inquiry into leaked emails | last=Hickman | first=Leo | authorlink=Leo Hickman | date=23 November 2009 | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] | accessdate=25 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson suggested that the e-mails from the University of East Anglia "called into question" the integrity of the scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article6928868.ece | title=Strip away the figleaf and reveal naysayers | last=Aaronovitch | first=David | authorlink=David Aaronovitch | date=24 November 2009 | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=timesonline.co.uk | accessdate=24 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy|Subsequent investigations]] did not support this view. GWPF Director Benny Peiser said that the organisation did not doubt the science and wasn‚Äôt going to discuss it, but want an open, frank debate about what policies should be adopted.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

===Funding sources===
Because it is registered as a charity, the GWPF is not legally required to report its sources of funding,&lt;ref name=Huhne/&gt; and Peiser has declined to reveal its funding sources, citing privacy concerns. Peiser said GWPF does not receive funding "from people with links to energy companies or from the companies themselves."&lt;ref name=graph/&gt; The foundation has rejected [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|freedom of information]] (FoI) requests to disclose its funding sources on at least four different occasions. The judge ruling on the latest FoI request, Alison McKenna, said that the GWPF was not sufficiently influential to merit forcing them to disclose the source of the ¬£50,000 that was originally provided to establish the organization.&lt;ref name=Black2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Robert|title=Confessions of a climate gate-opener|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17126699|accessdate=8 June 2014|work=BBC|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]], the policy and communications director at the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] at  the [[London School of Economics]],  commented:

:"These [FoI] documents expose once again the double standards promoted by&amp;nbsp;... the GWPF, who demand absolute transparency from everybody except themselves&amp;nbsp;... The GWPF was the most strident critic during the 'Climategate' row of the standards of transparency practised by the University of East Anglia, yet it simply refuses to disclose basic information about its own secretive operations, including the identity of its funders." &lt;ref name=Huhne&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/22/chris-huhne-lawson-think-tank | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Damian | last=Carrington | title=Chris Huhne blasts Lord Lawson's climate sceptic thinktank | date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a press release on the organization's website, GWPF "is funded entirely by voluntary donations from a number of private individuals and charitable trusts. In order to make clear its complete independence, it does not accept gifts from either energy companies or anyone with a significant interest in an energy company."&lt;ref name=press /&gt; Annual membership contributions are "a minimum of ¬£100".&lt;ref name=member&gt;[http://thegwpf.org/gwpf-member/ GWPF, "Become a GWPF member".] Accessed: Feb 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In accounts filed at the beginning of 2011 with the Charities Commission and at Companies House, it was revealed that only ¬£8,168 of the ¬£503,302 the Foundation received as income, from its founding in November 2009 until the end of July 2010, came from membership contributions.&lt;ref name=hickman /&gt; In response to the accounts, Bob Ward commented that "Its income suggests that it only has about 80 members, which means that it is a fringe group promoting the interests of a very small number of politically motivated campaigners."&lt;ref name=hickman&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/20/global-warming-policy-foundation-donors | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Leo | last=Hickman | title=Global Warming Policy Foundation donor funding levels revealed | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, based on membership fees reported for the year ending 31 July 2012, it appears that GWPF had no more than 120 members at that time.&lt;ref name=Ward2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Bob|title=Secret funding of climate sceptics is not restricted to the US|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/15/secret-funding-climate-sceptics-not-restricted-us|accessdate=8 June 2014|work=The Guardian|date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that it had uncovered emails in which [[Michael Hintze]], founder of the [[hedge fund]] CQS and a major donor to the UK Conservative Party, disclosed having donated to GWPF; the previous October, Hintze had been at the center of a funding scandal that led to the resignation of then-[[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Liam Fox]] and the dismissal of Hintze's then-charity adviser, Oliver Hylton.&lt;ref name=Readfearn2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Readfearn|first1=Graham|title=Michael Hintze revealed as funder of Lord Lawson's climate thinktank|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/27/tory-donor-climate-sceptic-thinktank|accessdate=8 June 2014|work=The Guardian|date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Huhne]], former UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change attacked Lord Lawson's influential climate sceptic think-tank.&lt;ref name="Huhne"/&gt;

===Charitable status===

In June 2013 [[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]] filed a formal complaint to the Charity Commission, alleging that the GWPF had "persistently disseminated inaccurate and misleading information about climate change as part of its campaign against climate policies in the UK and overseas", and that this was an abuse of their charitable status.

In 2014 the Charity Commission ruled that the GWPF had breached rules on impartiality in its climate change coverage, blurred fact and comment and demonstrated a clear bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lord-lawson-and-his-climate-change-sceptics-broke-charity-bias-rules-9765908.html|title=Lord Lawson and his climate change sceptics broke charity bias rules|publisher=The Independent |first=Tom |last=Bawden |date=1 October 2014 |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/432482/ocr_the_global_warming_policy_foundation.pdf Operational Case Report: The Global Warming Policy Foundation (1131448)"], The Charity Commission, 30 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the GWPF agreed to establish a non-charitable organisation to do the lobbying, alongside the existing organisation, to be called the "Global Warming Policy Forum" or "GWPF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegwpf.org/global-warming-policy-foundation-launches-campaigning-arm/|title=Global Warming Policy Foundation Launches Campaigning Arm |publisher=Global Warming Policy Foundation |date=1 September 2014 |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GWP Forum is a wholly owned subsidiary of the GWP Foundation.

===Temperature graph===
When the GWPF's website was launched in November 2009, a [[Information graphics|graph]] used in the [[logo]] graphic on each page of the website of '21st Century global mean temperatures' showed a slow decline over the selected period from 2001 to 2008. Hannah Devlin of ''[[The Times]]'' found an error for 2003 and noted that if the period from 2000 to 2009 had been chosen, then a rise in temperature would have been shown rather than a fall.&lt;ref name=hannah&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/science/2009/12/climate-sceptics-get-it-wrong-1.html |title=Climate sceptics get it wrong |last=Devlin |first=Hannah |date=1 December 2009 |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=timesonline.typepad.com |accessdate=25 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223022853/http://timesonline.typepad.com/science/2009/12/climate-sceptics-get-it-wrong-1.html |archivedate=December 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]] said that the graph was contrary to the true measurements, and that by leaving out the temperature trend during the 20th century, the graph obscured the fact that 8 of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred this century.

In April 2015 the GWP Foundation announced it was "launching a major inquiry into the integrity of the official global surface temperature records",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegwpf.org/inquiry-launched-into-global-temperature-data-integrity/|title=Inquiry Launched Into Global Temperature Data Integrity|publisher=The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) |date=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempdatareview.org/|title=About|publisher=The International Temperature Data Review Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the chairmanship of [[Terence Kealey]], a member of their advisory council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegwpf.org/who-we-are/academic-advisory-council/|title=Academic Advisory Council  -  The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submissions were invited, all of which would be published. In July 2015 the review announced that it had decided that its principal output will be peer-reviewed papers rather than a report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempdatareview.org/news|title=International Temperature Data panel: status update|publisher=The International Temperature Data Review Project |date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, the project's website lists no submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempdatareview.org/all|title=Submissions|publisher=The International Temperature Data Review Project |access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
In May 2014, the GWPF listed [[Benny Peiser]], a [[Social anthropology|social anthropologist]], as the director,&lt;ref name=press/&gt; and a board of trustees consisting of [[Nigel Lawson|Lord Lawson]] (Chairman), [[Lord Donoughue]], [[Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes|Lord Fellowes]], [[Peter R.

[[Andrew William Montford]] has been appointed to run an inquiry into the three British [[Climategate]]-inquiries for the ''Global Warming Policy Foundation''.&lt;ref name="Foster_2010-07-09_FP"&gt;Foster, Peter, "[http://opinion.financialpost.com/2010/07/09/checking-the-hockey-team/ Peter Foster: Checking the hockey team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713101752/http://opinion.financialpost.com/2010/07/09/checking-the-hockey-team/ |date=2010-07-13 }}", ''[[National Post]]'', July 9, 2010. "The third British investigation into the Climategate scandal -- led by former civil servant Sir Muir Russell -- amounts, at best, to a greywash. [...] The U.K.-based Global Warming Policy Foundation, an influential skeptical institution, has now appointed Mr. Montford to run an inquiry into the three British inquiries. There will be no whitewash here, "&lt;/ref&gt; His report  ''The Climategate Inquiries'' was published in September 2010, and is sharply critical of the previous inquiries.&lt;ref name="GWPF1" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thegwpf.org/damning-new-investigation-into-climategate-inquiries/ | title = Damning New Investigation Into Climategate Inquiries | accessdate = 2014-05-25 | last = Andrew | first = Montford | date = 2010-09-14 | publisher = Global Warming Policy Foundation | quote = The report The Climategate Inquiries, written by Andrew Montford and with a foreword by [[Andrew Turnbull, Baron Turnbull|Lord (Andrew) Turnbull]], finds that the inquiries into the conduct and integrity of scientists at the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia were rushed and seriously inadequate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Randerson&gt;Randerson, James, "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/14/climategate-inquiries-lawson-report 'Climategate' inquiries were 'highly defective', report for sceptic thinktank rules]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Foundation's trustees, [[Graham Stringer]] MP, a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] politician, sits on the [[House of Commons]]' [[Science and Technology Select Committee|Science and Technology Committee]], &lt;ref name="HCSTC-2017-09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science and Technology Committee (Commons)|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=12 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary select committee]] which scrutinises government actions in relation to topics including climate change.

==Media reception==
[[David Aaronovitch]] noted the GWPF's launch in ''[[The Times]]'', writing "Lord Lawson‚Äôs acceptance of the science turns out, on close scrutiny, to be considerably less than half-hearted. Thus he speaks of 'the (present) majority scientific view', hinting rather slyly at the near possibility of a future, entirely different scientific view. (...) 'Sceptic' (...) is simply a misnomer. People such as Lord Lawson are not sceptical, for if one major peer-reviewed piece of scientific research were ever to be published casting doubt on climate change theory, you just know they‚Äôd have it up in neon at Piccadilly Circus. They are only sceptical about what they don‚Äôt want to be true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Strip away the figleaf and reveal naysayers |author= David Aaronovitch |newspaper= The Times |date= November 24, 2009 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article6928868.ece |accessdate=January 23, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' quoted [[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]]  as saying "some of those names are straight from the Who's Who of current climate change sceptics ... It's just going to be a way of pumping material into the debate that hasn't been through scrutiny". ''The Guardian'' article cast doubt on the idea that an upsurge in scepticism was underway, noting that "in (the US) Congress, even the most determined opponents of climate change legislation now frame their arguments in economic terms rather than on the science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The voices of climate change sceptics |author= Caroline Davies |author2= Suzanne Goldenberg |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/24/voices-of-climate-change-denial | newspaper= The Guardian | location= London/Manchester |date= November 24, 2009 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate= January 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fred Pearce]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the three inquiries GWPF looked into were all badly flawed, and that ''The Climategate Inquiries'' report ably dissects their  failures. He writes that "for all its sharp‚Äîand in many cases justified‚Äîrejoinders to the official inquiries its report is likely to be ignored in some quarters for its brazen hypocrisy." Pearce argues that one of the criticisms of the three inquiries was that no climate sceptics were on the inquiry teams, and now the critics themselves have produced a review of the reviews that included no one not already supportive of the sceptical position. But, Pearce wrote, Montford "has landed some good blows here." &lt;ref name=Pearce &gt;Pearce, Fred.

'''Human shield''' is a military and political term describing the deliberate placement of [[non-combatant]]s in or around combat targets to deter the enemy from attacking these combat targets. It may also refer to the use of persons to literally shield [[combatant]]s during attacks, by forcing them to march in front of the combatants.

Using this tactic is considered a [[war crime]] by nations that are parties to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], the 1977 [[Protocol I|Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions]], and the 1998 [[Rome Statute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule97 |title=Practice Relating to Rule 97.

===World War II===
After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], it was claimed by [[Germany|German]] [[SS]] general [[Gottlob Berger]] that there was a plan, proposed by the [[Luftwaffe]] and approved by [[Adolf Hitler]], to set up special [[POW camp]]s for captured [[airmen]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in large German cities, to act as human shields against their [[bombing raid]]s. Berger realized that this would contravene the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention]] and argued that there was not enough barbed wire‚Äîas a result, this plan was not implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Berger statement to Allied intelligence officers, Nuremberg, 19 October 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141003887,00.html |title=The Last Escape |work=Penguin Books UK |accessdate=1 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220065054/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0%2C%2C9780141003887%2C00.html |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wehrmacht]] and later SS forces extensively used Polish civilians as human shields during [[Warsaw Uprising]] when attacking the insurgents' positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Adam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie. Zarys dzia≈Ça≈Ñ natury wojskowej. Warszawa: Instytut wydawniczy PAX, 1969, p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoni Przygo≈Ñski: Powstanie warszawskie w sierpniu 1944 r. T. I. Warszawa: PWN, 1980, p. 242. {{ISBN|83-01-00293-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Wola massacre]] in Poland on 7 August 1944, the Nazis forced civilian women onto the armored vehicles as human shields to enhance their effectiveness. In Belgium in May 1940, at least 86 civilians were killed by the German [[Wehrmacht]] known as the [[Vinkt Massacre]], when the Germans took 140 civilians and used them as shields to cross a bridge while under fire.

During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], Japanese soldiers often used civilians as human shields against American troops.

When the Japanese were concerned about the incoming Allied air raids on their home islands as they were losing their controlled Pacific islands one by one to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the [[Pacific War]], they scattered major [[military installations]] and [[factory|factories]] throughout [[urban area]]s, therefore, historians argued that Japan was using its civilians as human shields to protect their [[legitimate military target]]s against Allied [[bombardment]]. As a result, the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) was unable to strike purely military targets due to the limitations of their [[bombsight]], the mixing of military installations and factories with urban areas, and the widespread of [[cottage industry]] in Japan's cities. This led the USAAF in early 1945 to switch from [[precision bombing]] to [[carpet bombing]] which destroyed [[Air Raids on Japan|67 Japanese cities]] with [[incendiary bombs]] and the use of [[atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=26 |title=Rockets from Gaza: Harm to Civilians from Palestinian Armed Groups' Rocket Attacks |author=Bill Van Esveld |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=August 17, 2009 |isbn=1-56432-523-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=335 |title=The Library of Congress World War II Companion |author=[[Library of Congress]] |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |date=October 2, 2007 |isbn=0-7432-5219-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=817 |title=History of World War II: Victory and Aftermath |publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish Corporation]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-7614-7482-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=72 |title=The Law of Air Warfare - Contemporary Issues |publisher=Eleven International Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=90-77596-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 Lebanon War===
During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the Palestinian refugee camp of [[Ain al-Hilweh]] was surrounded by Israeli forces as the last stronghold of Palestinian militants in southern Lebanon, but "Soldiers of Allah" militants commanded by the Muslim fundamentalist Haj Ibrahim refused to surrender: Their motto was "Victory or death!" Over a two-day period, Israeli forces under the leadership of Brigadier General [[Yitzhak Mordechai]] repeatedly announced "Whoever does not bear arms will not be harmed" and urged civilians in the camp to evacuate, but few did. Three delegations of prominent [[Sidon]] figures were sent to persuade Haj Ibrahim's fighters that "their cause was hopeless, and whoever was willing to lay down his arms would be allowed to leave the camp unharmed." None of the delegations were successful; the first was prevented from approaching the fighters by "a spray of bullets," while the third "returned with the most harrowing tale of all": "Militiamen were shooting civilians who tried to escape. In one particularly grisly incident, three children had been riddled with bullets before their parents' eyes because their father had dared to suggest calling an end to the fighting." After a delegation of Palestinian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]‚Äî"headed by a [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] officer who was prepared to give the defenders his professional assessment of Ein Hilweh's grave military situation"‚Äîand an offer by Mordechai to "meet personally with" Haj Ibrahim were also rebuffed, "a team of psychologists&amp;nbsp;... was flown to Sidon to advise the command on how to deal with such irrational behavior." However, "the best advice the psychologists could offer was to organize yet another but considerably larger delegation comprising some forty or so people and including women and children"; Haj Ibrahim responded to the fifth delegation with "exactly the same three words"‚Äîtriggering a bloody battle in which Israeli troops finally took the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Ze'ev Schiff|last1=Schiff|first1=Ze'ev|authorlink2=Ehud Yaari|last2=Ya'ari|first2=Ehud|title=Israel's Lebanon War|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1984|isbn=0-671-47991-1|pp=144‚Äì150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Blue Star===
[[Operation Blue Star]] was an Indian military operation carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984, ordered by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] to remove militant religious leader [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] and his armed followers from the buildings of the [[Harmandir Sahib]] complex in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. Bhindranwale and large number of his militants were killed in the operation. There was a high civilian casualty (Total 493 including militants) also in the operation, since the militants had been using the [[pilgrim]]s that had been trapped inside the temple as Human shields.&lt;ref name="Kiss_Khalistan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiss |first1=Peter A. |title=Winning Wars amongst the People: Case Studies in Asymmetric Conflict |date=2014 |publisher=Potomac Books |isbn=9781612347004 |page=100 |edition=Illustrated |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uIY6AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=khalistani%20currency%20bhindranwale&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=khalistani%20currency%20bhindranwale&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715235735/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uIY6AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=khalistani%20currency%20bhindranwale&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=khalistani%20currency%20bhindranwale&amp;f=false |archive-date=15 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrims were not allowed by the militants to escape from the temple premises in spite of relaxation in the curfew hours by the security forces.&lt;ref name=ms_curfew&gt;{{cite book | last = Mark Tully | first = Satish Jacob | title = Amritsar; Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle | url = https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bxhuAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume | year = 1985 | location = London | edition = e-book | access-date = 2018-07-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180706191120/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bxhuAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume | archive-date = 2018-07-06 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The militants had hoped that the presence of thousands of pilgrims inside the temple premises would have prevented the action by army.&lt;ref name="hindus_Karim"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karim |first1=Afsir |title=Counter Terrorism, the Pakistan Factor |date=1991 |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=9788170621270 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QoqwQb38SQEC |accessdate=15 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715235814/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QoqwQb38SQEC |archive-date=15 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian Gulf War===
One of the most famous uses of human shields occurred in [[History of Iraq under Ba'athist rule|Iraq]] in 1990, following the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion]] of [[Kuwait]] that precipitated the [[Gulf War|Gulf War of 1990-1991]]. [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government detained hundreds of citizens of [[Western world|Western]] countries who were in Iraq for use as human shields in an attempt to deter nations from participating in military operations against the country. A number of these [[hostage]]s were filmed meeting Hussein, and kept with him to deter any targeted attacks, whilst others were held in or near military and industrial targets.&lt;ref name="BBCOTD"&gt;BBC News. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/23/newsid_2512000/2512289.stm 1990: Outrage at Iraqi TV hostage show] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201022736/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/23/newsid_2512000/2512289.stm |date=2008-02-01 }}". Retrieved 2 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, during the operations in the Gulf War, the U.S. submitted a report to the [[UN Security Council]] denouncing Iraq for having ‚Äúintentionally placed civilians at risk through its behavior‚Äù. The report cited the following examples of such behavior:

*(a) The Iraqi Government moved significant amounts of military weapons and equipment into civilian areas with the deliberate purpose of using innocent civilians and their homes as shields against attacks on legitimate military targets;
*(b) Iraqi fighter and bomber aircraft were dispersed into villages near the military airfields where they were parked between civilian houses and even placed immediately adjacent to important archaeological sites and historic treasures;
*(c) Coalition aircraft were fired upon by anti-aircraft weapons in residential neighborhoods in various cities. In Baghdad, anti-aircraft sites were located on hotel roofs;
*(d) In one case, military engineering equipment used to traverse rivers, including mobile bridge sections, was located in several villages near an important crossing point. The Iraqis parked each vehicle adjacent to a civilian house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule23 |title=United States of America Practice Relating to Rule 23.

=== Bosnian war ===
Shortly after the cease-fire between Croat and Serb forces, the [[Bosnian Serbs]] launched an assault against the safe area of [[Gora≈æde]], heavily shelling the town and surrounding villages. Protests and exhortations from the [[UN Security Council]] turned out to be ineffective, and on 10 and 11 April 1994, [[NATO]] launched air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. In retaliation, Bosnian Serb forces captured many UN personnel, using them as human shields at sites expected to be bombed. In a similar situation to what had happened in [[Sarajevo]], an ultimatum was issued, and by the 24th, most of the Serb troops had complied.

===Israeli-Palestinian conflict===

==== Israel ====
{{See also|Criticism of Israel#"Neighbor Procedure"}}
According to [[B'tselem]], Israel repeatedly used Palestinians as human shields since the outset of the military occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967. This practice became military policy during the [[Al-Aqsa intifada|second Intifada]], and was only dropped when [[Adalah]] challenged the practice before Israel‚Äôs High Court of Justice in 2002. though the IDF persisted in using Palestinians in its 'neighbor procedure', whereby people picked at random were made to approach the houses of suspects and persuade them to surrender, a practice which arguably placed the former's lives in danger. The court ruled in October 2005 'that any use of Palestinian civilians during military actions is forbidden, including the ‚Äúprior warning procedure‚Äù.' According to B'tselem, reports indicate that the practice has continued nonetheless, in military operations like [[Operation Cast Lead]], and [[Operation Protective Edge]], and the 'vast majority of these reports were never investigated, and those that did resulted in no further action.' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.btselem.org/human_shields 'Human Shields'] [[B'tselem]] 11 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli writer Amos Harel in [[Haaretz]] alleged that during the [[Second Intifada]] (2000‚Äì2005) Palestinian gunmen routinely used civilians and children as human shields and further alleges that there is photographic evidence.&lt;ref name="Harel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/analysis-stoking-an-appetite-for-revenge-1.116136 | title=Analysis / Stoking an appetite for revenge | publisher=[[Haaretz]] | date=August 3, 2004 | accessdate=September 30, 2011 | author=Harel, Amos | quote=The photographs from recent operations show that the armed Palestinians use the many civilians in the area, including children, as a "human shield".

On 22 November 2006, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused  Muhammad Wail Baroud, a military commander in the Popular Resistance Committee, of using civilians for shielding homes against military attacks but later stated that they erred. There was no evidence that the house was being used for military purposes at the time of the planned attack, nor did the IDF explain what military objective it could have had. They considered the destruction in light of Israel's longstanding policy of [[House demolition in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict|destroying homes]] as punitive measures instead of as legitimate military targets. HRW acknowledged they did not consider the motives of the civilians, such as whether they willingly assembled or not, and emphasized that it did not want to criticize non-violent resistance or any other form of peaceful protest, including civilians defending their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/12/15/human-rights-watch-statement-our-november-22-press-release ''Human Rights Watch Statement on our November 22 Press Release''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007101734/http://www.hrw.org/news/2006/12/15/human-rights-watch-statement-our-november-22-press-release |date=2012-10-07 }}.

=====During the 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza War=====

The [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict]] ("UNFFMG") that took place in 2008-2009 accepted the possibility that Hamas launched mortar attacks from the vicinity of a school and from residential homes, sometimes by threat of force against residents.  The UN Mission found evidence that "rocket units of the Palestinian armed groups operated from within populated areas" and used threats of force to enter residential yards, including one instance where a resident said that "his father had previously been shot in the leg by a member of such an armed group when he had tried to prevent them from using his land as a rocket launching site."  Similarly, the report found evidence that Palestinian militants "fir[ed] a rocket from a courtyard of a Government school in Gaza City at a time when the schools were closed."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=A/HRC/12/48&amp;Lang=E]''Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict Paragraph 444, 447&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was unable to find specific evidence that civilians whose homes were used for rocket launches were "forced to remain in their houses" but the report repeatedly noted that Gaza residents were "reluctant" to discuss the conduct of Palestinian armed forces due to fear of reprisals.  Some witnesses stated that they had stayed in their homes because they "did not think they would be at risk as long as they remained indoors or because they had no safe place to go."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=A/HRC/12/48&amp;Lang=E]''Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict Paragraph 35, 438, 453, 475&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an [[Amnesty International]] report in 2009 criticized [[Hamas]] for human rights violations including launching missiles from homes, but found no evidence that Palestinian fighters "directed civilians to shield military objectives from attacks" or "forced them" to stay in buildings used by militants.

A review article in ''Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law'' stated that Israel warned residents to leave by using warnings such as [[roof knocking]] and phone calls, and that "Israel asserted that Palestinian civilians who did not abide by the warnings were acting as 'voluntary human shields,' and were thus taking part in hostilities and could be targeted as combatants." The article determined this assertion to be unsupportable in international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sterio|first1=Milena|title=The Gaza Strip: Israel, its Foreign Policy and the Goldstone Report|journal=Case Western Journal of International Law|date=2010|volume=229|pages=244‚Äì245|url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=fac_articles|access-date=2015-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121203041/http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=fac_articles|archive-date=2015-11-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Syrian civil war}}
During the [[Syrian civil war]], the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] and loyalists were accused by [[Human Rights Watch]] of using residents of towns as human shields when advancing on opposition held areas, forcing them to march in front of the army. Witness from different towns across the country said that the army had kidnapped people and forced them to march in front of them when attacking towns and villages. The purpose of this was to protect the army from attack. HRW said "The Syrian army should immediately stop this abhorrent practice." Witnesses stated that the army forcibly used children and elderly people as well to deter anyone from firing on the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-watch/syria-local-residents-use_b_1380609.html|title=Syria: Local Residents Used as Human Shields|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=1 April 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DH48nTsp?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-watch/syria-local-residents-use_b_1380609.html|archive-date=29 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loss of rights due to criminal conviction''' refers to the practice in some countries of reducing the rights of individuals who have been convicted of a criminal offence.  The restrictions are in addition to other penalties such as incarceration or fines.  In addition to restrictions imposed directly upon conviction, there can also be [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral civil consequences]] resulting from a criminal conviction, but which are not imposed directly by the courts as a result of the conviction.

==Canada==

In Canada, criminal law is a federal matter, set out in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  Restrictions can be placed on certain activities following a conviction involving: (1) the use of weapons in the commission of a criminal offence;  (2) driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs; (3) electoral corruption.

===Weapon prohibitions===
When a person is convicted of an offence in which the person used a weapon, or threatened to use a weapon, the sentencing court has the power to prohibit the person from possessing a weapon for a certain period of time.  In the case of certain offences, the prohibition on possession is mandatory.&lt;ref name = "CC109"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-109.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 109.]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the court has discretion whether to impose a prohibition on possession.&lt;ref name = "CC110"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-110.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 110.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For first offences, the court can set the prohibition period as any time up to ten years.&lt;ref name = "CC109"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CC110"/&gt;  For subsequent offences, the convicted person is prohibited from possessing a weapon for life.&lt;ref name = "CC109"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CC110"/&gt;  However, even for first offences, the court  can impose a lifetime prohibition if the convicted person used a weapon against the convicted person's intimate partner, the convicted person's children, or any person living with the convicted person.&lt;ref name = "CC110"/&gt;  As well, there is a lifetime prohibition on possessing [[Gun laws in Canada#Classification of firearms|prohibited firearms or weapons]] (such as fully automatic firearms), and [[Gun laws in Canada#Classification of firearms|restricted firearms]] (such as handguns).&lt;ref name = "CC109"/&gt;

===Driving prohibitions===
The ''Criminal Code'' contains several offences related to driving a motor vehicle, including driving while impaired or with a blood alcohol count greater than eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood (".08"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-253.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 253.]&lt;/ref&gt; impaired or .08 driving causing bodily harm or death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-255.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255.]&lt;/ref&gt; dangerous driving (including dangerous driving causing bodily harm or death),&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-249.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 249.]&lt;/ref&gt; and street racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-249.2.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c c-46, s 249.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  A person convicted of one of these offences can be subject to a prohibition on driving a motor vehicle for a certain period of time.

For convictions for impaired driving or driving over .08, the court must impose a mandatory driving prohibition of at least one year and not more than three years for a first offence.  The length of the mandatory driving prohibitions increase with second and subsequent offences.  If the convicted person participates in an interlock program, the length of the prohibition may be reduced, but must be at least three months.  Similar mandatory prohibition orders are imposed for offences involving a motor vehicle which cause bodily harm or death and for street racing.&lt;ref name = "CC259"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-60.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 259.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For offences other than impaired driving/.08 or street racing, or not involving bodily harm or death, the sentencing court has discretion to impose driving prohibitions.&lt;ref name = "CC259"/&gt;

In addition to the driving prohibitions under the ''Criminal Code'', there may be [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral civil consequences]].  For example, driver licences are issued under provincial law.  All provinces will cancel the driver licence of a person convicted of certain driving offences under the ''Criminal Code''.

===Electoral corruption===
 
The ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' guarantees that all Canadian citizens have the [[Section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|right to vote in federal and provincial elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', s 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court of Canada has held that even if a Canadian citizen has committed a criminal offence and is incarcerated, they retain the constitutional right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2010/index.do ''Sauv√© v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)'', [2002&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 519, 2002 SCC 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2015 federal election, more than 22,000 inmates in federal correctional institutes were eligible to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-prisoners-voting-1.3202010 CBC News, August 25, 2015:  "More than 22,000 federal inmates eligible to vote."]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There is one exception to this general principle.  The Supreme Court has held that if a person is convicted of corrupt electoral practices, they can be evicted from the legislature, barred from being nominated for election for a set period, and denied the right to vote for a set period.  These restrictions are acceptable because they are a sanction aimed at the very offence committed by the individual, rather than being a general disenfranchisement.  The restrictions are aimed at healing the corrupted electoral process, which itself is a constitutional value, and therefore can be justified for limited periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1413/index.do ''Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General)'', [1996&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2 SCR 876.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Within the United Kingdom, criminal law is primarily a matter of the [[Countries of the UK|four constituent countries]].  After a conviction, an offender can, in some cases, lose:
*the ability to keep or obtain a [[UK driving licence|licence to drive a motor vehicle]] (particularly after a conviction for causing death by [[Death by dangerous driving|dangerous]] or [[impaired driving]])
*the ability to work with children (particularly after a conviction that requires the offender to [[Sex offender registry#United Kingdom|register as a sex offender]])
*the ability (if a non-citizen) to live in the United Kingdom (even if, before being convicted, he or she had the ability to vote in general elections under [[indefinite leave to remain]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal Immigration Rules Part 9:  Grounds for Refusal.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*while imprisoned, [[Felony disenfranchisement#United Kingdom|the right to vote]].

==United States==

In the United States, loss of rights due to criminal conviction can take several forms, including  [[felony disenfranchisement in the United States|voting disenfranchisement]], exclusion from [[jury duty]], and loss of the [[Right to keep and bear arms#United States|right to possess firearms]]

===Disenfranchisement===
{{main|Felony disenfranchisement}}

Every state with the exception of [[Maine]] and [[Vermont]] prohibits felons from voting while in prison.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States|publisher=The Sentencing Project|date=September 2008|url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_bs_fdlawsinusMarch2010.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following the completion of their probation or parole. However, the severity of each state's disenfranchisement varies. 1 in 43 adults were disenfranchised as of 2006.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Disenfranchisement of Ex-Felons|last = Hull|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 1439904413|location = |page = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of disenfranchisement gained awareness in 2000 after the "excruciatingly close" [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential election]], wherein 2% of the voting-age population was prohibited from participating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In that election, George W. Bush won Florida by 537 votes, however 31% of black Floridians were denied the vote due to disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Florida's legacy of voter disenfranchisement - World Socialist Web Site|url = https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/04/flor-a09.html|website = www.wsws.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that African American voters are typically Democratic voters, it was argued at the time that their exclusion "decisively" changed the outcome of the election.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In ''Reynolds v. Sims'', the Court ruled that the right to vote is a "fundamental right," establishing a strict scrutiny test. Further, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees "equal protection of the laws" to all persons. However, Section 2 of this Amendment allows states to remove voting privileges from anyone who has participated in "rebellion or other crime."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1972 Supreme Court ruling found that this article applied to disenfranchisement of ex-felons. The Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act, allowing for ex-felons to vote, has been introduced at the beginning of every legislative session since 1994, but has never made it to the floor of Congress.

Two states, [[Kentucky]] and [[Florida]] (Gov. [[Rick Scott]] reverted to the old policy in 2010 that had been changed by Gov. [[Charlie Crist]]), continue to impose a lifelong denial of the right to vote to all citizens with a felony record, in the absence of a restoration of civil rights by the [[Governor]] or, where allowed, [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;  Florida law is somewhat unusual, in that the individual must be pardoned by the Governor and a majority of the publicly elected State Cabinet (with the Governor's vote being the tiebreaker, if necessary).

===Felon jury exclusion===
The lifetime exclusion of felons from jury service is the majority rule in the United States, used in 31 states and in federal courts. The result is that over 6% of the adult population is excluded, including about 30% of black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Exclusion of Felons from Jury Service|ssrn=420840|author=Kalt, Brian C.|publisher=American University Law Review|volume=53|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felon jury exclusion is less visible than felony disenfranchisement, and few socio-legal scholars have challenged the statutes that withhold a convicted felon's opportunity to sit on a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A jury of none: an essay on the last acceptable form of civic banishment|publisher=Dialectical Anthropology|issn=0304-4092|date=March 20, 2010|author=Binnall, James Michael|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t2532u57l15h134p/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While constitutional challenges to felon jury exclusion almost always originate from interested litigants, some scholars contend that "it is the interests of the excluded felons that are most directly implicated."

Yet attacks on these blanket prohibitions levied by excluded felon jurors have failed consistently. The [[United States Supreme Court]] does not recognize the right to sit on a jury as fundamental.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=17+Va.+J.+Soc.+Pol%27y+%26+L.+1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=9f8b750e1dfdc27bb7a0a2dcadfab296|title=Sixteen Million Angry Men|author=Binnall James M.|publisher=Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law|date=Fall 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that, although lawmakers assert that felon jury exclusion measures protect the integrity of the adjudicative process, as felons "lack the requisite probity" to serve on a jury and are "inherently biased," many of the states subscribing to this practice allow felons to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/7/6/7/1/p376711_index.html|author=Binnall, James|title=The Lawyer and the Juror: Critically Examining the Rationales for Felon Jury Exclusion|date=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that is a double-standard only if it is presumed that those who judge the arguments of both sides in a case are allowed to be as biased as those arguing for each side.

===Loss of right to possess firearms===
Since 1968,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1213-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; felons are regarded by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and most US states, as being "prohibited persons" under US law ({{uscsub|18|922|g}}). It is a [[Classes of offenses under United States federal law|class C felony]] punishable by up to 10 years in prison under this subsection "to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce." This has been litigated before the Supreme Court. However, the Court upheld the regulation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">The '''Laws of 18 and 19 July 1845''', commonly known as '''Mackau Law''' (French: ''Lois Mackau'') are a set of laws which paved the way towards the [[abolition of slavery]] in France. They were instigated by [[Ange Ren√© Armand, baron de Mackau|Ange de Mackau]], then [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of the Navy and of Colonies]]. Effective abolition was enacted with the [[Decree abolishing Slavery of 27 April 1848]].

== Text ==
The Mackau laws constituted the last wave of legislation to enhance the status of slaves in France before outright abolition. They mandated a minimal duration for education of slaves, made it illegal to inflict over 15 lashes without a court order, and married slaves belonging to different masters obtained a right to [[family reunification]].

In July 1846, [[Louis Philippe I]] abolished slavery in the Royal domains of [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], and the newly purchased [[Mayotte]]. However, [[Fran√ßois Guizot]] stalled further progress.

== Implementation ==
Previous dispositions had been implemented with various degrees of good faith in the colonies, a point of recrimination for abolitionists. For instance, the mayors of towns where new schools were opened instituted a student selection procedures obviously intended to exclude slaves.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;''Abolitionnistes de l'esclavage et r√©formateurs des colonies: 1820-1851: analyse et documents'', Nelly Schmidt - pp. 330 et 331., p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]] and [[Ag√©nor de Gasparin]], notably, opposed the new Mackau laws on the ground that further legislation, adding to a pile of laws that were not effectively implemented, were useless.&lt;ref name="Schmidt" /&gt;

'''Manuela Beltr√°n''' was a [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Neogranadine]] woman who organized a peasant revolt against excess taxation in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, John Leddy: "El pueblo y el rey. La revoluci√≥n comunera en Colombia, 1781". Bogot√°: Carlos Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General settings==
The information concerning the biography of Manuela Beltran is scarce and fragmented.  It is believed she was of peasant origin, was born around 1750, and lived most of her life in  Villa del [[Socorro, Santander]], where she ran her own small grocery store, at the main square of Socorro; at the time, in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], it was very uncommon for a woman to own her own business. Besides, Beltran was one of the few people in the region that could read and write, given the virtually complete illiteracy of the population due to the absence of education facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_historia/04_las_fundaciones_y_poblamiento/0010_revuelta_comuneros.html ESTALLA LA REVUELTA DE LOS COMUNEROS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014003527/http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_historia/04_las_fundaciones_y_poblamiento/0010_revuelta_comuneros.html |date=2007-10-14 }} Revolt of the Comuneros (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The taxation==
During the first half of the 18th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] was focused on the improvement of its military force, especially the [[Infanteria de Marina]], since the main economic interests of the empire depended of the complete control of its American colonies. By 1717, the ''Cuerpo de Batallones de Marina'' was definitively settled and organized, reaching its full strength of twelve battalions. The first ones were named: Armada, Bajeles, Marina, Oceano, Mediterr√°neo and Barlovento. Their mission was to form the "Main body of landing columns and ship's soldiers tasks" in a time when boarding was still a critical part of battle at sea.

The major actions they took part in during this period were: [[Sardinia]], 1717; [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]], 1732; Defense of [[Havana]], 1762; Algiers expedition, 1775; [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)|Pensacola]] and [[Siege of Toulon]].

These military actions demanded a large amount of money and resources, which resulted in larger taxations for the people living in the colonies.  The new harsh taxation regimen (implemented and promoted by General Visitor Juan Francisco Guti√©rrez de Pi√±eres, and ratified by the Viceroy and [[Archbishop]] [[Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora]]) included the raise on the [[Alcabala]], taxes over the consumption of [[Aguardiente]] and [[Tobacco]], taxes over the entry of merchandises, and a sales tax.

==The revolt==
{{main|Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)}}
The edict of the new taxation regimen was placed in the main square of Socorro on March 16, 1781.  Since Beltran could read, she informed the crowd about the dispositions, which was greeted with general outrage.  She tore apart the document and led the [[strike action]] which extended to over sixty cities and towns in the [[Andean Region of Colombia]] and [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Los Llanos]].  The revolt eventually ended with a fake negotiation offered by the Viceroy, followed by the capture and execution of most of the revolt leaders including [[Jos√© Antonio Gal√°n]]. Whether or not Manuela Beltran was also executed remains unclear.

The '''Midday Meal Scheme''' is a [[school meal]] programme of the [[Government of India]] designed to better the [[nutrition]]al standing of school-age  children  nationwide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp207424.pdf|title = India: A Desk Review of the Mid-Day Meals Programme|date=July 2007|last=Chettiparambil-Rajan |first=Angelique|format=PDF|accessdate = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternate innovative education centres, ''[[Madarsa]]'' and ''Maqtabs'' supported under [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]], and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdm.nic.in/Files/Right%20to%20information/Frequently_Asked_Questions_on_MDM.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Mid Day Meal Scheme |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is the largest of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdm.nic.in/aboutus.html |title=About the Mid Day Meal Scheme |publisher=Mdm.nic.in |date= |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme has undergone many changes since its launch in 1995. The Midday Meal Scheme is covered by the [[National Food Security Act, 2013]]. The legal backing to the Indian school meal programme is akin to the legal backing provided in the US through the [[National School Lunch Act]].

==           History          ==

=== Pre-independence and post-independence initiatives ===
The roots of the programme can be traced back to the pre-independence era, when a mid day meal programme was introduced in 1925 in [[Madras Corporation]] by the British administration.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A mid day meal programme was introduced in the Union Territory of [[Puducherry]] by the French administration in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/PAB/PAB-2011-12/AWP-Write%20up/Puducherry.pdf|title = National Programme of Mid-Day Meals in Schools Annual Work Plan and Budget 2011‚Äì12|publisher=Union Territory of Puducherry|accessdate = 28 July 2013|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives by state governments to children began with their launch of a mid day meal programme in primary schools in the  1962‚Äì63 school year. [[Tamil Nadu]] is a pioneer in introducing mid day meal programmes in India to increase the number of kids coming to school; Thiru [[K. Kamaraj]], then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, introduced it first in Chennai and later extended it to all districts of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihfw.org/NationalHealthProgramme/MID_DAYMEAL.html |title=Mid-Day Meal Programme |publisher=National Institute of Health &amp; Family Welfare |date=2009 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1982, July 1st onwards, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Thiru. [[M. G. Ramachandran]] upgraded the existing Mid-day meal scheme in the state to 'Nutritious food scheme' keeping in the mind that 68 lakh children suffer malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mgr-midday-nutritious-meal-scheme-a-shrewd-political-move/1/392281.html |title=Tamil Nadu: Midday Manna |publisher=India Today Archive |date=15 November 1982 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gujarat]] was the second state to introduce an MDM scheme in 1984, but it was later discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/PAB/PAB%202010-11/STATE%20PPTS/Gujarat%20gajarat.pdf|title = Annual Work Plan &amp; Budget 2010‚Äì11, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Gujarat State|format=PDF|publisher=Government of Gujarat|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A midday meal scheme was introduced in  [[Kerala]] in 1984, and was gradually expanded to include more schools and grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/PAB/PAB2013-14/Kerala/Appraisal_Note-Kerala.pdf|title = Appraisal Note: State: Kerala | publisher = Government of India Ministry of Human Resource Development |format=PDF|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990‚Äì91, twelve states were funding the scheme to all or most of the students in their area: [[Goa]], [[Gujarat]], [[Kerala]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]], [[Sikkim]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Tripura]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. [[Karnataka]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and West Bengal received international aid to help with implementation of the programme, and in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]] the programme was funded entirely using foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pibmumbai.gov.in/English/PDF/E0000_H12.PDF|title = Mid Day Meal|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |format=PDF|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karnataka]], [[Children's LoveCastles Trust]] started to provide mid-day meals in 1997. A total of eight schools were adopted and a [[food bank]] programme and an Angganwasi milk Programme were started. The food-bank programme was replaced by the State Government midday meal scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-neighbourhood/lessons-outside-the-classroom/article483116.ece|title = Lessons Outside the Classroom |work=The Hindu |accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives by the central government===
The government of India initiated the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) on 15 August 1995.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The objective of the scheme is to help improve the effectiveness of primary education by improving the nutritional status of primary school children. Initially, the scheme was implemented in 2,408 blocks of the country to provide food to students in classes one through five of government, government-aided and local body run schools. By 1997‚Äì98, the scheme had been implemented across the country. Under this programme, a cooked mid day meal with 300 calories and 12 grams of protein is provided to all children enrolled in classes one to five. In October 2007, the scheme included students in upper primary classes of six to eight in 3,479 educationally backward blocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mid-Day Meal for the Poor, Privatised Education for the Non-Poor|date = 27 July 2013|url = http://www.epw.in/special-articles/mid-day-meal-poor-privatised-education-non-poor.html|first = Manisha |last=Garg |first2=Kalyan Sankar |last2=Mandal|journal = Economic and Political Weekly|accessdate = 28 July 2013|volume = 48|issue = 30|page = 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name was changed from National Programme for Nutrition Support to Primary Education to National Programme of Mid Day Meals in Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mdm.nic.in/Files/Monitoring/NSCMC/Agenda_Note_for_NSMC_meeting_21_12_12.pdf|title = Agenda note of 5th meeting of National Steering and Moitoring Committee meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though cooked food was to be provided, most states (apart from those already providing cooked food) chose to provide "dry rations" to students. "Dry rations" refers to the provision of uncooked 3&amp;nbsp;kg of wheat or rice to children with 80% attendance.

=== Supreme court order ===
In April 2001, the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties|People‚Äôs Union for Civil Liberties]] (PUCL) initiated the [[Public-interest litigation (India)|public interest litigation]] (Civil) No. 196/2001, People‚Äôs Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India &amp; Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sccommissioners.org/Reports/Reports/SCC6_1005.pdf|title = Sixth Report Of the Commissioners|last = Dr. N.C. Saxena}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì popularly known as the "right to food" case. The PUCL argued that [[s:Constitution of India/Part III#Article 21 .7BProtection of life and personal liberty.7D|article 21]] ‚Äì "right to life" of the Indian constitution when read together with articles [[s:Constitution of India/Part IV#Article 39 .7BCertain principles of policy to be followed by the State.7D|39]](a) and [[s:Constitution of India/Part IV#Article 47 .7BDuty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health.7D|47]], makes the right to food a derived [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental right]] which is enforceable by virtue of the constitutional remedy provided under [[s:Constitution of India/Part III#Article 32 .7BRemedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.7D|article 32]] of the constitution. The PUCL argued that excess food stocks with the [[Food Corporation of India]] should be fed to hungry citizens. This included providing mid day meals in primary schools. The scheme came into force with the supreme court order dated 28 November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.righttofoodindia.org/mdm/mdm_scorders.html |title=Right to Food Campaign: Mid Day Meals |publisher=Righttofoodindia.org |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide cooked midday meals.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sccommissioners.org/FoodSchemes/Documents/mdm_primer.pdf|title = Mid Day Meals: A Primer|accessdate = 28 July 2013|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
The central and state governments share the cost of the Midday Meal Scheme, with the centre providing 60 percent and the states 40 percent.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Press Information bureau|first=HRD, Govt of India|date=22 December 2015|title=Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Nutrition and Corporate Capital|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=133797|journal=Press Information|publisher=Ministry of Human Resource Development|issue=30|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government provides grains and financing for other food.

=== Implementation models ===

==== Decentralised model ====
This is the most widespread practice. In the decentralised model, meals are cooked on-site by local cooks and helpers or [[self-help groups]]. This system has the advantage of being able to serve local cuisine, providing jobs in the area, and minimising waste. It also allows for better monitoring (e.g., by parents and teachers).

In the absence of adequate infrastructure (such as kitchen sheds, utensils etc.), it can lead to accidents and maintaining hygiene can be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://centreforequitystudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Best-practices-Mid-day-meal.pdf|title = Interrogating 'best practices' for the Implementation of School Nutrition Programmes in Urban India|accessdate = 28 July 2013|format = PDF|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129050252/http://centreforequitystudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Best-practices-Mid-day-meal.pdf|archivedate = 29 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, 87 children died when the thatched roof of a classroom was ignited by sparks from a cooking fire,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 87 children die in school fire|date = 17 July 2004|url = http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/17/stories/2004071707570100.htm|accessdate = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a child died after succumbing to burn injuries she sustained after accidentally falling into a cooking vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'Gravy' mistake: 8-yr-old girl falls in hot sambar, dies|date = 17 December 2011|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-gravy-mistake-8-yr-old-girl-falls-in-hot-sambar-dies-1626938|accessdate = 28 July 2013|newspaper = DNA India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Centralised model ====
In the centralised model, an external organisation cooks and delivers the meal to schools, mostly through [[public-private partnership]]s. Centralised kitchens are seen more in urban areas, where density of schools is high so that transporting food is a financially viable option. Advantages of centralised kitchens include ensuring better hygienic as large scale cooking is done through largely automated processes. Various [[NGO]]s such as the [[Akshaya Patra Foundation]], Ekta Shakti Foundation, Naandi Foundation, and Jay Gee Humanitarian Society &amp; People's Forum provides mid-day meals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A study of centralised kitchens in Delhi in 2007 found that even with centralised kitchens, the quality of food needed to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Towards more advantages from Mid-Day Meals http://www.cordindia.com/images/Midday.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that when the food arrives and is of inadequate quality, even teachers feel helpless and do not know whom to complain to.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development reported that 95% of tested meal samples prepared by NGOs in Delhi did not meet nutritional standards in 2010‚Äì12. In response, the ministry withheld 50% of the payment for the deficient meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/capitals-mcd-schools-mid-day-meal-scheme-fails-nutrition-test_6357.html |title=Capital's MCD schools mid-day meal scheme fails nutrition test! |publisher=Zeenews. india.com |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International assistance ====
International voluntary and charity organisations have assisted. [[Church World Service]] has provided milk powder to Delhi and Madras Municipal Corporation; [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] has provided corn soya meal, Bulgar wheat, and vegetable oils; and [[UNICEF]] has provided high proteins foods and educational support.&lt;ref name="teindia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teindia.nic.in/mhrd/50yrsedu/r/2V/7B/2V7B0301.htm |title=Historical Background |work=Nutrition Support to Education: Report of the Committee on Mid-Day Meals | date = May 1995|publisher=Department of School Education and Literacy, Government of India |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, 'Food for Learning' was launched with assistance from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). Initially the programme was aimed at scheduled caste and scheduled tribe girls.&lt;ref name="teindia1" /&gt; In 1983, the federal Department of Education prepared a scheme under the auspices of the [[World Food Programme]] to supply meals to 13.6 million scheduled caste girls and 10.09 million scheduled tribe girls in classes one to five in 15 states and three union territories. The value of the food itself was $163.27 million per year.&lt;ref name="teindia1" /&gt; Labour, facilities, and transportation costs were to be paid by the state governments. The reaction among the states and union territories was mixed. Many states were interested, but some were concerned about their ability to afford it if the FAO support were to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Evaluation of the scheme ==

The MDM scheme has many potential benefits: attracting children from disadvantaged sections (especially girls, [[Dalits]] and [[Adivasis]]) to school, improving regularity, nutritional benefits, socialisation benefits and benefits to women are some that have been highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;Future of Mid-Day Meals http://www.epw.in/special-articles/future-mid-day-meals.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epw.in/perspectives/mid-day-meals-primary-schools.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by economists show that some of these benefits have indeed been realised. The positive effect on enrollment of disadvantaged children (Dreze and Kingdon), on attendance (by Chakraborty, Jayaraman, Pande),&lt;ref&gt;see also http://indiatogether.org/mmassam-education&lt;/ref&gt; on learning effort (by Booruah, Afridi and Somanathan), on improving nutritional inputs (Afridi), on improving nutritional outcomes (by Singh, Dercon and Parker), and so on.

Caste based discrimination continues to occur in the serving of food, though the government seems unwilling to acknowledge this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = Caste and Gender Based Discrimination Under MDMS|url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=90730|date = 14 December 2012|accessdate = 2 August 2013|quote = The teams did not come across any discrimination except in one school in district Boudh in Odisha.|publisher = Press Information Bureau, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2018}} Sukhdeo Thorat and Joel Lee found in their 2005 study that caste discrimination was occurring in conjunction with the Mid Day Meals programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Caste Discrimination and Food Security Programmes|date = 24 September 2005|first1 = Joel|last1= Lee|first2= Sukhdeo|last2= Thorat|journal = Economic and Political Weekly|jstor=4417187|volume = 40 |issue= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports also document the positive effect of the programme for women, especially working women&lt;ref&gt;see http://indiatogether.org/mdmukhand-poverty&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity among parents, children and teachers alike. Media reports have also highlighted several implementation issues, including irregularity, corruption, hygiene, caste discrimination, etc. A few such incidents are listed below:

- In December 2005, Delhi police seized eight trucks laden with 2,760 sacks of rice meant for primary school children. The rice was being transported from Food Corporation of India godowns [[Bulandshahr district]] to North Delhi. The police stopped the trucks and investigators later discovered that the rice was being stolen by an NGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Lid off massive scam in Mid-Day Meal Scheme: 2,760 sacks of rice seized| url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060121/delhi.htm| publisher=The Tribune, Delhi| date=20 January 2006| accessdate=2 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In November 2006, the residents of Pembong village (30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Darjeeling]]) accused a group of teachers of embezzling midday meals.

== Criticism ==
Despite the success of the program, child hunger as a problem persists in India. According to current statistics, 42.5% of the children under 5 are underweight. Some simple health measures such as using iodised salt and getting vaccinations are uncommon in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, Somini. (12 March 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/asia/13malnutrition.html Malnutrition of children in India continues]. Nytimes.com. Retrieved on 18 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "India is home to the world's largest food insecure population, with more than 500 million people who are hungry", India State Hunger Index (ISHI) said. Many children don't get enough to eat, which has far-reaching implications for the performance of the country as a whole. "Its rates of child malnutrition is higher than most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa," it noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Rni3kmxsj03rJ4rjTTqeaI/Madhya-Pradesh-tops-India-State-Hunger-list-of-17.html | title=Madhya Pradesh tops India State Hunger list of 17|publisher=LiveMint|date=14 October 2008|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 [[Global Hunger Index]] ranked India at 65 out of 84 countries. More than 200 million went hungry in India that year, more than any other country in the world.

The '''Ministry of Agrarian Development''' ({{lang-pt|Minist√©rio do Desenvolvimento Agr√°rio}}, abbreviated '''MDA''') is a [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]]-level [[federal government of Brazil|federal]] [[list of federal institutions of Brazil|ministry]] in [[Federative Republic of Brazil|Brazil]]. The current Minister of Agrarian Development is [[Osmar Terra]].

The MDA was established in 1999 to oversee [[land reform]] in Brazil and promote sustainable practices. The agency oversees the [[N√∫cleo de Estudos Agr√°rios e Desenvolvimento Rural|Center for Agrarian Studies and Rural Development]] (NEAD) and the [[Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria|National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform]] (Incra).&lt;ref&gt;The [https://www.daad.de/en/index.html German Academic Exchange Service].

A '''minority government''', or '''minority cabinet''' or '''minority parliament''', is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] formed in a [[parliamentary system]] when a political party or [[Coalition government|coalition]] of parties does not have a majority of overall seats in the [[parliament]]. It is sworn into office, with or without the formal support of other parties, to enable a government to be formed. Under such a government, legislation can only be passed with the support of enough other members of the legislature to provide a majority, encouraging multi-partisanship. In [[Bicameralism|bicameral parliament]]s, the term relates to the situation in chamber whose confidence is considered most crucial to the continuance in office of the government (generally, the [[lower house]]).

A minority government tends to be much less stable than a [[majority government]] because if they can unite for the purpose, opposing parliamentary members have the numbers to vote against legislation, or even bring down the government with a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]].

== Coalitions and alliances ==
To deal with situations in parliamentary systems where no clear majority to support a government exists, two or more parties may establish a formal coalition government, commanding a clear majority of the parliamentary members, or a party might enter into less formal alliances or agreements with other parties, or individual members, to allow the minority government to stay in office.

A common situation is governance with "jumping majorities": the cabinet stays as long as it can negotiate support from a majority in the parliament, even though that majority may be differently formed from issue to issue or from bill to bill. On occasion the legislature may permit a minority cabinet to continue in office despite having been defeated on a given vote, and a minority government might even bring on a [[confidence vote]] and threaten to resign should the legislature vote against it.

An alternative arrangement is a looser alliance of parties, exemplified by Sweden. There the long-governing Social Democrats have ruled with more or less formal support from other parties ‚Äì in the mid-20th century from Agrarians, after 1968 from Communists, and more recently from Greens and ex-Communists ‚Äì and have thus been able to retain executive power and (in practice) legislative initiative. This is also common in Canada, where nine [[elections in Canada|elections]] from 1921 to 2005 effectively produced [[minority governments in Canada|minority federal governments]]. The parties can rarely cooperate enough to establish a formal coalition, but operate under a loose agreement instead.

Occasionally a [[confidence and supply]] agreement may be formed. This is a more formal pact which still falls short of creating a coalition government. In the Canadian province of [[Ontario]], the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] formed a minority government from 1985 to 1987 on the basis of a formal accord with the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP): the NDP agreed to support the Liberals for two years on all [[motion of no confidence|confidence motion]]s and budgetary legislation, in exchange for the passage of certain legislative measures proposed by the NDP. This was not a formal coalition, because the NDP remained an opposition party and was not given seats in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. In this case the Liberals did not even have a plurality of seats: the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] were the largest single party with 52 seats, but the Liberals had 48 and the NDP had 25.

New Zealand's [[48th New Zealand Parliament|48th Parliament]] operated with both a coalition and a looser agreement: the government was a coalition between the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressives]], while [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] and [[New Zealand First]] had an agreement to support the government on confidence matters, while the [[New Zealand Green Party|Green Party]] abstained.

=== Simple plurality system ===
In most [[Westminster system]] nations, each constituency elects one member of parliament by simple plurality voting. This system heavily biases the vote towards increasing the number of seats of the top two parties and reducing the seats of smaller parties, a principle known in political science as [[Duverger's law]], and thus minority governments are relatively uncommon. Advocates of this system see this as one of its advantages. A party with less than 40% of the popular vote can often win an outright majority of the seats. (For instance, in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK General Election]], the governing Labour party won by a majority of 66 seats in the House of Commons with only 35.2% of the popular vote.) If support for some parties is regionally concentrated, however, then Duverger's law applies separately to each region, and so it is quite possible for no party to be sufficiently dominant in each region so as to receive a majority of the seats. This was the situation in Canada in the [[Canadian Federal Election, 2004|2004]], [[Canadian Federal Election, 2006|2006]], and [[Canadian Federal Election, 2008|2008]] federal elections, with no party obtaining a majority due in part to the dominance of the [[Bloc Qu√©b√©cois]] in the province of [[Quebec]].

In Westminster systems, in minority situations, the incumbent government usually has the first opportunity to attempt to win the confidence of the House. This is so even if the incumbents have fewer seats ‚Äì the incumbent prime minister still holds his or her commission for the duration of the writ period and immediately following an election. If (s)he cannot form a government that commands the confidence of the House then it is expected that (s)he will resign that commission voluntarily ‚Äì it is not considered acceptable for the Sovereign (or her representative) to revoke said commission unless the prime minister was acting in serious breach of constitutional protocol. Nevertheless, usually an incumbent government that loses its plurality in the House simply resigns, especially if the main opposition party is only a few seats short of having a majority or if it feels it has no chance of winning the support of enough members of smaller parties to win an initial confidence vote.

Nevertheless, the now-common practice of the party with the most seats forming the government has led to a widespread misconception among voters that a convention exists whereby the party with the most seats always gets to form the government. In fact, the most compelling reason for this practice is that the party with the most seats can survive confidence votes so long as the smaller party (or parties) simply [[abstention|abstain]] from confidence votes, whereas a governing party without a plurality in the House needs at least one other party to vote with it at all times (assuming the largest party will always vote no confidence, but that is almost certain to occur when they are denied the opportunity to govern). This means that in most situations, the party with the most seats has the best chance and the least complicated route to winning a confidence vote, regardless of its place on the political spectrum. At the Canadian federal level, in the four most recent of the five occasions a governing party lost the plurality without another winning a majority (1957, 1963, 1979, and 2006) the incumbent governments resigned rather than attempt to stay in power.

Whatever party forms the government must either form a coalition with one or more other parties, or they must win some form of support from the other parties or independents so as to avoid no-confidence motions. Because of no-confidence motions, minority governments are frequently short-lived or fall before their term is expired. The leader of a minority government will also often call an election in hopes of winning a stronger mandate from the electorate. In Canada, for instance, federal minority governments last an average of 18 months.

=== United Kingdom ===
There have been few occasions since 1900 when a single party has not commanded a parliamentary majority. The 2010&amp;ndash;2015 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]/[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[coalition government]] was the first of its type in Britain since the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] between 1931 and 1945.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Harold Wilson]], formed a minority government for seven months after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|General Election of February 1974]]. That situation lasted until the prime minister called another election in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October that year]], following which the Labour Government obtained a tiny majority of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge74oct.shtml | title =BBC Politics 97 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following administration also became a minority government after the collapse of the [[Lib‚ÄìLab pact]] in 1977, and the then [[British Prime Minister]] [[James Callaghan|James Callaghan's]] Government fell in March 1979 as the result of a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of no confidence]] which was carried by a single vote.

A minority Government held power in the UK  between December 1996 and [[United Kingdom general election 1997|the general election in May 1997]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[John Major]], had won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]] with an absolute majority of 21 seats over all other parties. That majority was progressively whittled away through defections and by-elections defeats, the most notable of the latter including those in [[Newbury by-election, 1993|Newbury]], [[South East Staffordshire by-election, 1996|South East Staffordshire]] and [[Wirral South by-election, 1997|Wirral South]], resulting in the eventual loss of the Major government's majority in Parliament. However, the Conservatives maintained support from [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] and the British media tend to perceive minority governments as unstable and ineffective, possibly because recent examples of minority governments (Callaghan and Major) occurred as the result of governments in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work : Hung Parliaments and the challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], the Conservatives won the most seats and votes, but only a minority of seats in parliament. There was some discussion after the election of the possibility of creating a Conservative minority government and, because the then Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] had the first opportunity to form a government, there were also talks about creating some sort of alliance between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and other smaller parties. However Brown waived his right, acknowledging that because the Conservative Party had won the largest number of seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], it should have the first opportunity to form a government. Further discussions then led to the establishment of a formal coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, which enabled the formation of a [[majority government]], because it was thought that would ensure more stability.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 General Election]], the Conservatives won the most seats and votes, but lost their majority in the House of Commons. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Theresa May]], formed a minority government, with 317 seats, on 9 June 2017. On 10 June, the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister.27s Office|Prime Minister's Office]] announced a deal with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] which would see the DUP support the Conservative government on a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malnick|first1=Edward|title=DUP to support minority government after 'confidence and supply' deal reached|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/10/dup-support-minority-government-confidence-supply-deal-reached/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the DUP later announced that no such deal had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=Michael|last2=McDonald|first2=Henry|title=Theresa May‚Äôs plan to govern with DUP support thrown into confusion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/theresa-may-dup-deal-snag-tory-rebellion|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remained the case until 26 June 2017, when [[Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement|a deal]] was agreed and announced between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/26/tories-and-the-dup-reach-deal-to-prop-up-minority-government|title=Theresa May faces backlash from Scotland and Wales over ¬£1bn Tory-DUP deal|first1=Anushka|last1=Asthana|first2=Henry|last2=McDonald|first3=Severin|last3=Carrell|date=26 June 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Scotland====
{{further|Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament}}
After the 2007 [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|parliamentary elections]], the [[Scottish National Party]] led by [[Alex Salmond]] constituted a minority government in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. This was because the SNP gained 47 seats out of 129 in the election, which was some way short of achieving an [[absolute majority]] of seats in the [[Scottish Parliament]], but more than any other single party gained. The SNP were unable to negotiate a majority [[coalition government]] with any other [[political party|party]], but as no other combination of parties were able to agree a deal, the SNP chose to form a one-party minority government, with [[confidence and supply]] support from the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the Scottish Conservative Party.

====Wales====
After the 2007 Assembly elections, the [[Welsh Labour Party]] led by [[Rhodri Morgan]] initially formed a minority government in the [[Welsh Assembly]].  This was because they gained 26 seats in the election, which was short of an [[absolute majority]] of seats in the Assembly.  Whilst Labour were initially unable to form a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], a 'Rainbow Coalition' of the [[Conservative Party (UK)]], Liberal Democrats and [[Plaid Cymru]] failed to come to fruition. However, on 6 July 2007, Welsh Labour Party members voted for a coalition with Plaid, which was followed by a similar result from [[Plaid Cymru]] members the next day. As a result, the Welsh Assembly was controlled by the Labour-Plaid alliance with Rhodri Morgan as First Minister (up until his retirement in 2009 and subsequent replacement by [[Carwyn Jones]] as First Minister) and Plaid Leader [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]] as his deputy. After the 2011 Welsh General Election, Welsh Labour won 30 seats and entered into a new government, with a minority of 0. In 2016 Welsh Labour returned with 29 seats out of 30 and formed a minority government of 0 with the one remaining Liberal Democrat AM.

===Canada===
{{Main|Federal minority governments in Canada}}
During the history of Canadian politics there have been twelve minority governments on the federal level, in eleven separate minority parliaments (there were two minority governments during the life of 15th Parliament).  One of these minorities, the 14th Parliament, was only a minority for half of its duration owing to [[crossing the floor|floor-crossings]] and by-elections. The tenth and eleventh were elected twice in Canadian federal elections of [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006]] and again in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]]. There have also been numerous minority governments in provincial legislatures, particularly in provinces such as [[Ontario]] where there are strong third parties.

At the federal level, the party which has won the most seats in a general election has formed the government in all but the [[15th Canadian Parliament|15th Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadaonline.about.com/od/elections/g/minority.htm|title=Minority Government|publisher=www.canadaonline.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been instances of parties which did not win a plurality forming the government at the provincial level (notably under [[David Peterson]]). For information about minority governments at both the federal and provincial levels see [[Minority governments in Canada]].

===Denmark===
Since 1982 most of the coalition government in [[Denmark]] are in minority, that the minority government coalition need to make deals and reach support with the opposition parties.

===Estonia===
[[Estonia]] has had several minority governments. A minority cabinet can occur:

# when the governing coalition loses support due to a coalition member leaving the governing coalition (V√§hi II and Ansip II cabinets);
# when MPs leave party factions (Ratas cabinet);
# when a minority government is appointed with additional parliamentary support (T√µnisson IV, V√§hi Interim, Siimann and Kallas cabinets); or
# when the government is voted into office with a plurality and some MPs abstain from voting (Birk, T√µnisson II, Piip and Akel cabinets). 

Additional support is possible also because MPs leaving a party faction are not allowed to officially join another faction until the next elections. A government can be a minority government either throughout its term or just a part of its term, usually the later part. A list of minority cabinets:

* [[Ado Birk|A. Birk cabinet]] ([[Estonian Constituent Assembly|1920]])
* [[Jaan T√µnisson|J. T√µnisson II cabinet]] ([[Estonian Constituent Assembly|1920]])
* [[Ants Piip|A. Piip cabinet]] ([[Estonian Constituent Assembly|1920‚Äì1921]])
* [[Friedrich Karl Akel|F. K. Akel cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 1923|1924]])
* [[Jaan T√µnisson|J. T√µnisson IV cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 1932|1933]])
* [[Tiit V√§hi|T. V√§hi Interim cabinet]] ([[Estonian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|1992]])
* [[Tiit V√§hi|T. V√§hi II cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 1995|1996‚Äì1997]])
* [[Mart Siimann|M. Siimann cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 1995|1997‚Äì1999]])
* [[Siim Kallas|S. Kallas cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 1999|2002‚Äì2003]])
* [[Andrus Ansip's second cabinet|A. Ansip II cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 2007|2009‚Äì2011]])
* [[J√ºri Ratas' cabinet|J. Ratas cabinet]] ([[Estonian parliamentary election, 2015|2018‚Äì]])

===Netherlands===
Coalitions in the Netherlands are formed with the support from parliamentary parties, elected by proportional representation. Although very rare, minority governments can be formed during the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|formation]] period of a [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]], if an election result makes a majority coalition impossible. More often, a minority government is formed when one of the cabinet's coalition partners withdraws its support, or when all ministers of a given parliamentary party resign. In these cases, the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] offers the full cabinet's resignation to the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Monarch]].

At this point, the Monarch may choose to dissolve Parliament and hold a general election. The cabinet continues to serve as ''[[Demissionary cabinet|demissionary]]''. A demissionary cabinet is not a minority government but a form of [[caretaker government]], enjoying only limited powers until the new Parliament assembles.

If the Monarch does not dissolve Parliament, the remaining cabinet continues as a minority cabinet, in full possession of its powers. It can finish any legislation already before underpreparation, if Parliament passes it by majority vote; this necessitates the support of parties outside the government. Theoretically, early general elections need not be held, but they are often necessary in practice, since the [[coalition agreement]] no longer has parliamentary support.

A third option is available to the Monarch: the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|formation of a new cabinet]] of different Parliamentary parties (which may include the defecting coalition partner). Elections are then held as scheduled at the end of the parliamentary term, since the Monarch does not dissolve parliament if an ''[[informateur]]'' has been able to negotiate a new [[coalition agreement]].

The Netherlands had a minority government in 2010‚Äì2012: the [[First Rutte cabinet]]. The [[Second Rutte cabinet]] (2012‚Äì2017) consisted of the conservative liberal [[VVD]] and the social-democratic [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] and had a majority in the ''[[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]'', but a plurality in the ''[[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]]''. On 11 October 2013, the cabinet reached a budgetary agreement with the social-liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]] and the smaller Christian parties [[ChristanUnion|CU]] and [[Reformed Political Party|SGP]]. This provided the VVD/PvdA cabinet a single-seat majority in the ''Senate'' (''see also'': [[Purple (government)]]).

===Republic of Ireland===
The [[Politics in the Republic of Ireland|Irish parliamentary system]] broadly works on a simple majority system, where the [[Taoiseach]] is elected by the [[D√°il]] when they achieve 50% + 1 of the votes in favour of their nomination. The Taoiseach then appoints his or her own [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Until the 1980s, Irish politics was dominated by two parties, either of whom could achieve a simple majority of seats in the D√°il and therefore elect their party leader as Taoiseach. Since the 1980s, the popularity of other parties has increased such that coalition governments are now typical and expected, with one of the two major parties being the "Senior" partner, and with one or more "Junior" partners ensuring that the coalition retains a majority in the D√°il.

A minority government is formed when a party (or a coalition) secures agreement from one or more other parties or independents to support their nomination for Taoiseach and achieve majority support, but without any formal coalition agreement with the parties who supported the nomination. Support for bills and other items requiring a D√°il majority vote is then negotiated on a bill-by-bill basis.

In the event that no agreement can be reached to nominate an individual to lead a minority government, the previous Taoiseach (acting in a [[Caretaker government|caretaker]] capacity) can then seek dissolution of the D√°il and call a new general election. However, this scenario has not yet occurred.

The last D√°il with a single-party simple majority government was in [[Members of the 21st D√°il|1977]]. Minority governments have been relatively common in the short history of the D√°il, making up 14 of the 32 governments (44%) formed since the D√°il was founded, most were formed by the [[Fianna F√°il]].

* [[Irish general election, 1987|1987]] (Fianna F√°il)
* [[Irish general election, 2016|2016]] (Fine Gael)

The period of 1987‚Äì2016 (29 years) is the longest that there has not been a minority government in charge.

===Sweden===
Sweden had several minority governments in history, most of the time led by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], with the support of the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Socialist Left Party]]. [[Centre-right politics|Centre-right]] [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]] which led by [[Moderate Party]] formed a minority coalition government from 2010 to 2014. The recent minority government is led by the Social Democrats and Greens, which only have one-third of seats.

'''Navdanya''' is an [[India]]n-based [[non-governmental organisation]] which promotes [[Conservation movement|biodiversity conservation]], [[biodiversity]], [[organic farming]], the rights of farmers, and the process of [[seed saving]]. One of Navdanya's founders, and outspoken members, is [[Vandana Shiva]], an environmental [[activist]], [[physicist]], and [[author]]. Navdanya began in 1984 as a program of the Research Foundation for science, Technology and Ecology (RFSTE), a participatory research initiative founded by the scientist and environmentalist Dr. Vandana Shiva, to provide direction and support to environmental activism.&lt;ref name=Navdanya&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Navdanya|url=http://www.navdanya.org/about-us|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Navdanya" means "nine crops" that represent India's collective source of [[food security]].&lt;ref name="Navdanya"/&gt;

[[File:Dr. Vandana Shiva DS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vandana Shiva]], one of the founders of Navdanya (2014)]]
Navdanya is a member of the [[Terra Madre|Terra Madre slow food movement]].
Navdanya is a network of seed keepers and organic producers spread across 16 states in India.

Navdanya has helped set up 54 community [[seedbank|seed bank]]s across the country, trained over 500,000 farmers in "[[food sovereignty]]" and [[sustainable agriculture]] over the past two decades, and helped set up the largest [[direct marketing]], [[fair trade]] organic network in the country. Navdanya has also set up a learning center, Bija Vidyapeeth (School of the Seed) on its biodiversity conservation and organic farm in [[Doon Valley]], [[Uttranchal]], north India.

It has criticised [[genetic engineering]]. Navdanya claims to be a women centred movement for the protection of [[biodiversity|biological]] and [[cultural diversity]].

==Save a Seed==

20th Century farming revolutionised  traditional food production methods by using cheap (but [[Hubbert peak theory|non renewable]]) hydrocarbon fuels and  agricultural chemical products which make  a major contribution to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, blamed for causing climate change.  These new methods together with cheap transport and fuel led to the optimisation and industrialization of food production.

Navdanya's Seeds of Freedom campaign is intended to provide a source or exchange of diverse naturally occurring crop-seed.

==GMO free campaign==
Since 1991 they have been campaigning against GM crops and food in India. Working with citizens' movements, [[grassroots|grassroot]] organisations, NGOs and governments, they have made significant contributions to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the Biosafety Protocol.

During the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] Hong Kong Ministerial, Navdanya joined 740 other organisations in presenting their opposition to the WTO's stance on GMOs.

==Biopiracy==
RFSTE/ Navdanya started the campaign against biopiracy with the Neem Campaign in 1994 and mobilised 1,00,000 signatures against neem patents and filed a legal opposition against the USDA and WR Grace patent on the fungicidal properties of [[neem]] (no. 436257 B1) in the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) at Munich, Germany.

Along with RFSTE, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) of Germany and Ms. [[Magda Alvoet]], former Green Member of the European Parliament were party to the challenge. The patent on Neem was revoked in May 2000 and it was reconfirmed on 8 March 2005 when the EPO revoked in entirety the controversial patent, and adjudged that there was "no inventive step" involved in the fungicide patent, thus confirming the 'prior art' of the use of Neem.

The next victory against "biopiracy" for Navdanya came in October 2004 when the European Patent Office in Munich revoked Monsanto's patent on the Indian variety of wheat "Nap Hal". This was the third consecutive victory on the IPR front after Neem and Basmati. Monsanto was assigned a patent (EP 0445929 B1) on wheat on 21 May 2003 by the [[European Patent Office]] in Munich under the simple title "plants". On January 27, 2004 Research Foundation for Science Technology and Ecology  (RFSTE) along with Greenpeace and Bharat Krishak Samaj BKS) filed a petition at the European Patent Office (EPO), Munich, challenging the patent rights given to Monsanto on Indian Landrace of wheat, Nap Hal. The patent was  revoked in October 2004.&lt;ref name="Biopiracy Campaign"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biopiracy Campaign|url=http://navdanya.org/campaigns/biopiracy|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Technology Fund''' ('''OTF''') is a [[U.S. Government]] funded program created in 2012 at [[Radio Free Asia]] to support global [[Internet freedom]] technologies. Its mission is to "[utilize] available funds to support projects that develop open and accessible technologies to circumvent [[censorship]] and [[surveillance]], and thus promote [[human rights]] and open societies".&lt;ref name="about-the-program"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the program|url=https://www.opentech.fund/about/program|publisher=Open Technology Fund|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Open Technology Fund was created in 2012.&lt;ref name="about-the-program"/&gt; According to US journalist [[Eli Lake]], the idea for the creation of the Open Technology Fund was the result of a policy advocated by [[Hillary Clinton]] when she was the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="Lake-2015-09-18"/&gt; Lake has written that Clinton's policy was "heavily influenced by the [[Internet activism]] that helped organize the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|green revolution in Iran in 2009]] and other [[Arab Spring|revolutions in the Arab world in 2010 and 2011]]".&lt;ref name="Lake-2015-09-18"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lake|first1=Eli|title=Government Is Fighting Itself on Encryption|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-18/government-is-fighting-itself-on-encryption|website=Bloomberg View|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|type=Column|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=18 September 2015}} Note: The author uses "Open Whisper" when referring to [[Open Whisper Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the Open Technology Fund worked with [[Google]] and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] to create an organization called Simply Secure to help improve the usability of privacy tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushe|first1=Dominic|title=Google and Dropbox launch Simply Secure to improve online security|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/18/google-dropbox-simply-secure-security-tech|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=14 February 2016|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and funding==
The Open Technology Fund reports to Radio Free Asia's president, who in turn reports to the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG).&lt;ref name="about-the-program"/&gt; The OTF is sustained by annual grants from the BBG, which originate from yearly U.S. Congressional appropriations for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.&lt;ref name="about-the-program"/&gt; According to the OTF, it works together with other publicly funded programs to fulfill a U.S. Congressional mandate to sustain and increase global [[freedom of information]] on the Internet with public funds.&lt;ref name="about-the-program"/&gt;

==Projects==
{{As of|2016|02}}, the Open Technology Fund supports 83 projects, consisting of over 2&amp;nbsp;700 developers, technologists, and translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results|url=https://www.opentech.fund/results|publisher=Open Technology Fund|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable projects that the OTF has supported include [[The Tor Project, Inc|The Tor Project]], [[Open Whisper Systems]], [[Cryptocat]], [[GlobaLeaks]], [[Tor2web]], [[The Guardian Project (software)|The Guardian Project]], [[Citizen Lab]], [[Commotion Wireless]], [[Lantern (software)|Lantern]], [[Serval Project]], [[Briar (software)|Briar]], [[NoScript]], [[Qubes OS]], and [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=https://www.opentech.fund/projects|publisher=Open Technology Fund|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OTF funds third party [[Information technology security audit|audits]] for all of the [[source code|code]] related projects that it supports.&lt;ref name="code-audits"/&gt; It has also offered to fund audits of "non-OTF supported projects that are in use by individuals and organizations under threat of censorship/surveillance".&lt;ref name="code-audits"/&gt; Notable projects whose audits the OTF has sponsored include Cryptocat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alban|last1=Diquet|first2=David|last2=Thiel|first3=Scott|last3=Stender|title=Open Technology Fund CryptoCat iOS Application Penetration Test|url=https://isecpartners.github.io/publications/iSEC_Cryptocat_iOS.pdf|publisher=iSEC Partners|accessdate=13 February 2016|format=PDF|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commotion Wireless,&lt;ref name="isecpartners-2013"/&gt; [[TextSecure]],&lt;ref name="isecpartners-2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Working with the Open Technology Fund |url=https://isecpartners.github.io/2013/10/14/open-tech-fund-report-release.html |first1=Tom |last1=Ritter |publisher=iSEC Partners |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobaLeaks,&lt;ref name="isecpartners-2013"/&gt; [[MediaWiki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steipp|first1=Chris|title=Improving the security of our users on Wikimedia sites|url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/04/20/improving-security-for-our-users/|website=Wikimedia Blog|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenPGP.js,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heiderich|first1=Mario|last2=Kotowicz|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Magazinius|first3=Jonas|last4=Antesberger|first4=Franz|title=Pentest-Report OpenPGP.js 02.2014|url=https://cure53.de/pentest-report_openpgpjs.pdf|publisher=Cure53|accessdate=14 February 2016|format=PDF|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrokey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=McDevitt|first1=Dan|title = Nitrokey Storage Firmware and Hardware Security Audits|url = https://www.opentech.fund/article/nitrokey-storage-firmware-and-hardware-security-audits|publisher = Open Technology Fund|accessdate =15 February 2016|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ricochet (software)|Ricochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Joseph|title='Ricochet', the Messenger That Beats Metadata, Passes Security Audit|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/ricochet-encrypted-messenger-tackles-metadata-problem-head-on|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice Media LLC|accessdate=17 February 2016|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTF also matched donations that were made toward the auditing of [[TrueCrypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Kenneth|last2=Green|first2=Matthew|title=IsTrueCryptAuditedYet?|url=http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/|publisher=Open Crypto Audit Project|accessdate=14 February 2016|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the OTF reported that it had funded more than 30 technology code audits over the past three years, identifying 185 privacy and security vulnerabilities in both OTF and non-OTF-funded projects.&lt;ref name="code-audits"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurley|first1=Chad|title=Code Audits are Good.

In [[politics]], the '''opposition''' comprises one or more [[Political party|political parties]] or other organized groups that are opposed, primarily [[ideologically]], to the [[government]] (or, in [[American English]], the [[Administration (government)#United States|administration]]), party or group in [[political power|political control]] of a [[city]], [[region]], [[state (polity)|state]] or [[country]]. The degree of opposition varies according to political conditions ‚Äì for example, across [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] systems where opposition may be either repressed or desired respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blondel|first=J|year=1997|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119945400/abstract|title=Political opposition in the contemporary world|journal=Government and opposition|volume=32|issue=4|pages=462‚Äì486|doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.1997.tb00441.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the Palace Office as is may not have been established until the 1980s there is evidence that British advisors had begun the work of setting the office up as early as 1972. Certainly influential characters such as Brigadier Sir [[Timothy Landon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMBASSADOR JOHN R. COUNTRYMAN, Page 111|url=http://adst.org/OH%20TOCs/Countryman,%20John%20R.toc.pdf|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheilagh Bailey were critical in developing the early functionality of what would become the Palace Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheilagh Bailey Collection|url=https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/mec/MEChandlists/GB165-0564-Sheilagh-Bailey-Collection.pdf|publisher=St Anthony's College Oxford|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly important that the small nucleus of trusted advisors made arrangements to secure the ruler of Oman in the 1970s and establish contacts with neighboring states to ensure their cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorril|first1=Stephen|title=MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service|date=2002|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743217781|page=733|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_bV5ncXNke4C&amp;pg=PA733&amp;lpg=PA733&amp;dq=%22Palace+Office%22+Oman+role+function&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hApx1imoYz&amp;sig=CfkVEmEyelTf0r1bMV-vitn0Dos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj37dvZl9zVAhVoB8AKHYiLDNcQ6AEITzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Palace%20Office%22%20Oman%20role%20function&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National security challenges==
It seems certain that the main National Security Challenges affecting Oman are internal rather than external and an attempted [[coup d'etat]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omanis Handed Jail Terms for Coup Plot|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/266303|website=Arab News|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en|date=3 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was easily quashed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC NEWS World Middle East Oman pardons 31 coup plotters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4078138.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and street unrest in the spring of 2011 and later in 2012, all point to a simmering unrest with the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valeri|first1=Marc|title=Simmering Unrest and Succession Challenges in Oman|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/01/28/simmering-unrest-and-succession-challenges-in-oman-pub-58843|website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early March 2011 HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said decided to replace two key ministers who were seen by many as not keeping in touch with young Omanis not benefiting from Oman's national advances. The long-standing favorite advisor of the Sultan General Ali bin Majid al Maamari was replaced by the relatively unknown and younger General Sultan bin Mohammed al Nua'mani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oman sultan sacks two ministers after protests|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/03/05/140303.html|publisher=Al Arabiyah|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Minister's remit appears unchanged.

The Sultanate has also experienced challenges in maintaining its neutrality in the conflict in neighboring [[Yemen]]. It has been accused by its [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] partners of not being genuinely neutral and favoring the [[Houthis|Houthi]] rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just how neutral is Oman in Yemen war?|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/tr/contents/articles/originals/2016/10/oman-neutral-saudi-war-iran-houthis.html|website=Al-Monitor|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=tr|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panarchy''' (from [[:wikt:pan-|pan]] and [[:wikt:-archy|archy]]), coined by [[Paul Emile de Puydt]] in 1860, is a form of governance that would encompass all others.&lt;ref name="dePuydt"&gt;P. E. de Puydt, [http://www.panarchy.org/depuydt/1860.eng.html Panarchy], first published in French in the Revue Trimestrielle, Bruxelles, July 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists the noun as "chiefly poetic" with the meaning "a universal realm," citing an 1848 attestation by [[Philip James Bailey]], "the starry panarchy of space". The adjective ''panarchic'' "all-ruling" has earlier attestations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Jonson]], ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' II.v.15: '' Ars sacra, Or chrysopoeia, or spagyrica, Or the pamphysic, or panarchic knowledge'' [viz., [[alchemy]] ]&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century the term was re-coined separately by scholars in [[international relations]] to describe the notion of [[global governance]] and then by [[systems theory|systems theorists]] to describe non-hierarchical organizing theories.

==Freely choosing government==

In his 1860 article "Panarchy" de Puydt, who also expressed support for [[laissez-faire economics]], applied the concept to the individual's right to choose any form of government without being forced to move from their current locale. This is sometimes described as "extra-territorial" (or "exterritorial") since governments often would serve non-contiguous parcels of land. De Puydt wrote:

{{quote|The truth is that there is not enough of the right kind of freedom, the fundamental freedom to choose to be free or not to be free, according to one's preference....Thus I demand, for each and every member of human society, freedom of association according to inclination and of activity according to aptitude. In other words, the absolute right to choose the political surroundings in which to live, and to ask for nothing else.|&lt;ref name="dePuydt"/&gt;}}

De Puydt described how such a system would be administered:

{{quote|In each community a new office is opened, a "Bureau of Political Membership". This office would send every responsible citizen a declaration form to fill in, just as for the income tax or dog registration: Question: What form of government would you desire? Quite freely you would answer, monarchy, or democracy, or any other... and once registered, unless you withdrew your declaration, respecting the legal forms and delays, you would thereby become either a royal subject or citizen of the republic. Thereafter you are in no way involved with anyone else's government‚Äîno more than a Prussian subject is with Belgian authorities.|&lt;ref name="dePuydt"/&gt;}}

De Puydt‚Äôs definition of panarchy was expanded into a political philosophy of [[panarchism]]. It has been espoused by [[anarchist]] or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-leaning individuals, including especially [[Max Nettlau]] in 1909&lt;ref&gt;Max Nettlau, [http://www.panarchy.org/nettlau/1909.eng.html Panarchy, A Forgotten Idea of 1860], 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Zube]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Howard J. 1996. Reinventing Anarchy, Again. AK Press. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Zube, [http://www.panarchy.org/zube/gospel.1986.html The Gospel of Panarchy], 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Grand E. Day and others have used the phrase "multigovernment" to describe a similar system.&lt;ref&gt;Le Grand E. Day, [http://www.panarchy.org/day/multigovernment.1977.html The Theory of Multigovernment],
1969-1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another similar idea is [[FOCJ|Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions (FOCJ)]] promoted by Swiss economists Bruno Frey and Reiner Eichenberger.

In a 1982 research, scholar David Hart argued that it is very possible that De Puydt was a reader of the work of the Belgian economist [[Gustave de Molinari]] who had already raised in 1849 the idea of "government competence" in policeand judges services through [[private defense agencies]].&lt;ref name="molinari"&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/jls/6_1/6_1_5.pdf Gustave de Molinari and the Anti-statist Liberal Tradition Part I11]. [[Stanford University]] 1982. Published in the [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/production-security-0 The Production of Security]. Gustave de Molinari. 1849.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global society==
James P. Sewell and Mark B. Salter in their 1995 article "Panarchy and Other Norms for Global Governance‚Äù define panarchy as ‚Äúan inclusive, universal system of governance in which all may participate meaningfully." They romanticize the term by mentioning the ‚Äúplayful Greek god Pan of sylvan and pastoral tranquillity, overseer of forests, shepherd of shepherds and their flocks. It thus connotes an archetypal steward of biospheric well-being."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p2pfoundation.net/Panarchy_Etymology Etymology of Panarchy on P2pFoundation.Net] quoting from James P. Sewell and Mark B. Salter, "Panarchy and Other Norms for Global Governance: Boutros-Ghali, Rosenau, and Beyond", Global Governance, vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 373-382, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ronfeldt and John Arquilla, in their work on [[Netwar]], which they describe as an emergent form of low intensity conflict, crime, and activism, that: "The design is a [[heterarchy]], but also what might be termed a 'panarchy.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ronfeldt and Arquilla, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR880/ In Athena‚Äôs Camp:  Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age], Rand Institute, p.280, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul B. Hartzog writes in "Panarchy: Governance in the Network Age": ‚ÄúPanarchy is a transdisciplinary investigation into the political and cultural philosophy of ‚Äònetwork culture.‚Äô The primary fields of relevance for panarchy are world politics (international relations), political philosophy/theory, and information technology. Panarchy also draws on insights from information/communications theory, economics, sociology, networks, and complex systems."&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Hartzog, [http://panarchy.com/Members/PaulBHartzog/Papers/Panarchy%20-%20Governance%20in%20the%20Network%20Age.pdf "Panarchy: Governance in the Network Age"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104543/http://panarchy.com/Members/PaulBHartzog/Papers/Panarchy%20-%20Governance%20in%20the%20Network%20Age.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }}, Master's Essay, University of Utah at Panarchy.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paul B. Hartzog's work, the term "panarchy" emerges at the intersection of three core concepts: 1) ecology and complex systems, 2) technology, and 3) politics.  The "pan" of ecological thinking draws on the Greek-god Pan as a symbol for wild and unpredictable nature.  The "pan" of technology refers to the Personal Area Network
(a [[personal area network]] is the interconnection of information technology devices within the range of an individual person) that merges human beings into an interconnected global social web.  The "pan" of politics refers to the "inside/outside" distinction, and how, in an era of global challenges and global governance, the frame-of-reference for a global social has no outside.

==Systems theory==
[[Systems theory]] is an interdisciplinary field of science which studies the nature and processes of complex systems of the physical and social sciences, as well as in [[information technology]].  Lance Gunderson and [[C. S. Holling]], in their book ''Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Systems of Humans and Nature'' coopted the term, saying:

{{quote|The term [panarchy] was coined as an antithesis to the word hierarchy (literally, sacred rules). Our view is that panarchy is a framework of nature's rules, hinted at by the name of the Greek god of nature, Pan.|&lt;ref&gt;Lance Gunderson and C. S. Holling, ''Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Systems of Humans and Nature,'' Island Press, p.21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The publisher describes the book's theory thus:

{{quote|Panarchy, a term devised to describe evolving hierarchical systems with multiple interrelated elements, offers an important new framework for understanding and resolving this dilemma. Panarchy is the structure in which systems, including those of nature (e.g., forests) and of humans (e.g., capitalism), as well as combined human-natural systems (e.g., institutions that govern natural resource use such as the Forest Service), are interlinked in continual adaptive cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and renewal.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.com/books/detail.html?SKU=1-55963-857-5&amp;cart=%5Bcart%5D Island Press Bookstore description of Gunderson and Holling's ''Panarchy:Understanding Transformations in Systems of Humans and Nature''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Panarchy'' Gunderson and Holling write:

{{quote|The cross-scale, interdisciplinary, and dynamic nature of the theory has led us to coin the term panarchy for it. Its essential focus is to rationalize the interplay between change and persistence, between the predictable and unpredictable.|&lt;ref&gt;Gunderson and Holling, [http://www.resalliance.org/593.php ''Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Systems of Humans and Nature''], Chapter 1,  p.5, reproduced at Resalliance.org.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9745">'''The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) played a major role in the [[Abolitionism|abolition movement]] against slavery''' in both the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. Quakers were among the first white people to denounce slavery in the American colonies and Europe, and the Society of Friends became the first organization to take a collective stand against both slavery and the [[slave trade]], later spearheading the international and [[ecumenicalism|ecumenical]] campaigns against slavery.

==Beginnings==
Quaker colonists began questioning slavery in [[Barbados]] in the 1670s, but first openly denounced it in 1688. In that year, four German settlers (the [[Lutheran]] [[Francis Daniel Pastorius]] and three Quakers) issued a protest from [[Colonial Germantown Historic District|Germantown]], close to [[Philadelphia]] in the newly founded American colony of [[Pennsylvania]]. This action, although seemingly overlooked at the time, ushered in almost a century of active debate among Pennsylvanian Quakers about the morality of slavery which saw energetic anti-slavery writing and [[direct action]] from several Quakers, including [[William Southeby]], [[John Hepburn (Quaker)|John Hepburn]], [[Ralph Sandiford]], and [[Benjamin Lay]].

During the 1740s and 50s, anti-slavery sentiment took a firmer hold. A new generation of Quakers, including [[John Woolman]] and [[Anthony Benezet]], protested against slavery, and demanded that Quaker society cut ties with the slave trade. They were able to carry popular Quaker sentiment with them and, in the 1750s, Pennsylvanian Quakers tightened their rules, by 1758 making it effectively an act of misconduct to engage in slave trading. The [[London Yearly Meeting]] soon followed, issuing a ‚Äòstrong minute‚Äô against slave trading in 1761. On paper at least, global politics would intervene. The [[American Revolution]] would divide Quakers across the Atlantic.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, Quakers would be foremost in the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1787 which, with some setbacks, would be responsible for forcing the end of the British slave trade in 1807 and the end of slavery throughout the [[British Empire]] by 1838. 

==United States==
In the United States, Quakers would be less successful. In many cases, it was easier for Quakers to oppose the slave trade and slave ownership in the abstract than to directly oppose the institution of slavery itself, as it manifested itself in their local communities. While many individual Quakers spoke out against slavery after United States independence, local Quaker meetings were often divided on how to respond to slavery; outspoken Quaker abolitionists were sometimes sharply criticized by other Quakers.

Nevertheless, there were local successes for Quaker anti-slavery in the United States during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. For example, the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]], first founded in 1775,  consisted primarily of Quakers; seven of the ten original white members were Quakers and 17 of the 24 who attended the four meetings held by the Society were Quakers. Throughout the nineteenth century, Quakers increasingly became associated with antislavery activism and antislavery literature: not least through the work of abolitionist Quaker poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]. North Carolina's Quakers often [[Quaker trusteeship|trusted their slaves to local meetings]] in order to de-facto free their slaves while the state's laws prohibited slaveowners from legally freeing their slaves; this practice ran from 1808 to 1829, after which trusteeship declined and many Quakers left the state to free their slaves in "free states". 

Quakers were also prominently involved with the [[Underground Railroad]]. For example, [[Levi Coffin]] started helping runaway slaves as a child in [[North Carolina]]. Later in his life, Coffin moved to the Ohio-Indiana area, where he became known as the President of the Underground Railroad. [[Elias Hicks]] penned the '[http://antislavery.eserver.org/tracts/hicksobservations/ Observations on the Slavery of the Africans]' in 1811 (2nd ed. 1814), urging the boycott of the products of slave labor. Many families assisted slaves in their travels through the Underground Railroad. Henry Stubbs and his sons helped runaway slaves get across Indiana. The Bundy family operated a station that transported groups of slaves from [[Belmont, Ohio|Belmont]] to [[Salem, Ohio]].

Quaker anti-slavery activism could come at some social cost. In the nineteenth-century United States, some Quakers were persecuted by slave owners and were forced to move to the west of the country in an attempt to avoid persecution. Nevertheless, in the main, Quakers have been noted and, very often, praised for their early and continued antislavery activity.

Colorful Quaker and slave trader [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] defended slavery benevolently practiced. He advocated, and personally practiced, the mixing of the black and the white "races" through marriage, which he claimed was hygienic, productive of healthy and attractive children, and a step towards integration of blacks and whitss. He also was strongly in favor of allowing free blacks, who, he claimed, strenthened a country. These views were tolerated in [[Spanish Florida]], where he was a planter, but after Florida became [[Florida Territory|a U.S. territory]] in 1821, Kingsley found it necessary to leave Florida for a plantation he purchased in Haiti (today in the Dominican Republic).

'''''Regents of the University of California v. Bakke''''', 438 U.S. 265 (1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke|volume=438|page=265|year=1978}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. It upheld [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]], allowing race to be one of several factors in [[College admissions in the United States#Race and ethnicity|college admission policy]]. However, the court ruled that specific [[racial quota]]s, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the [[University of California, Davis School of Medicine]], were impermissible.

Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved.  Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'' (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds.

Allan P. Bakke ({{IPAc-en|'|b|…ë:|k|i:}}), an engineer and former [[United States Marine Corps]] officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission by several due in part to his age. Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, and therefore considered too old by at least two institutions. After twice being rejected by the [[University of California, Davis]], he brought suit in state court.  The [[California Supreme Court]] struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted.  The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention.

The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]]; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion.  Finding diversity in the classroom to be a [[compelling state interest]], Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].  Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted.  The practical effect of ''Bakke'' was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the ''Bakke'' case was merely a [[plurality opinion]] or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]''.

== Background ==

=== State of the law ===
{{Main article|School integration in the United States}}

In ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled segregation by race in public schools to be unconstitutional. In the following fifteen years, the court issued landmark rulings in cases involving race and civil liberties, but left supervision of the desegregation of Southern schools mostly to lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other progressive legislation, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Title VI of which forbids racial discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, integration of public schools was well advanced. In that year, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of school desegregation in ''[[Green v. County School Board]]'', ruling that it was not enough to eliminate racially discriminatory practices; state governments were under an obligation to actively work to desegregate schools.&lt;ref name = "scase" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Green v. County School Board]]'', 391 U.S. 430 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; The school board in ''Green'' had allowed children to attend any school, but few chose to attend those dominated by another race.&lt;ref&gt;''Green'', 391 U.S. at 441.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1970, in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'', the Supreme Court upheld an order for [[Desegregation busing|busing]] of students to desegregate a school system.&lt;ref name = "scase"&gt;Schwartz, pp. 28‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'', 402 U.S. 1 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although public universities were integrated by court decree, selective colleges and graduate programs, and the professions which stemmed from them, remained almost all white.  Many African-Americans had attended inferior schools and were ill-prepared to compete in the admissions process.  This was unsatisfactory to many activists of the late 1960s, who protested that given the African-American's history of discrimination and poverty, some preference should be given to minorities.  This became a commonly held liberal position, and large numbers of public and private universities began [[affirmative action]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 3‚Äì10.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were the [[University of California, Davis School of Medicine]] (UC Davis or "the university"), which was founded in 1968 and had an all-white inaugural class.  The faculty was concerned by this, and the school began a special admissions program "to compensate victims of unjust societal discrimination".&lt;ref name = "s4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 238 U.S. at 272‚Äì275.&lt;/ref&gt; The application form contained a question asking if the student wished to be considered disadvantaged, and, if so, these candidates were screened by a special committee, on which more than half the members were from minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 238 U.S. at 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the entering class was 50 students, and eight seats were put aside for minorities; when the class size doubled in 1971, there were 16 seats which were to be filled by candidates recommended by the special committee.&lt;ref&gt;Bakke, 438 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt; While nominally open to whites, no one of that race was admitted under the program, which was unusual in that a specific number of seats were to be filled by candidates through this program.&lt;ref name = "s4"&gt;Schwartz, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case taken by the Supreme Court on the subject of the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education was ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name = "balld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'', 416 U.S. 312 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Marco DeFunis, a white man, had twice been denied admission to the [[University of Washington School of Law]].  The law school maintained an affirmative action program, and DeFunis had been given a higher rating by admissions office staff than some admitted minority candidates.  The Washington state trial court ordered DeFunis admitted, and he attended law school while the case was pending. The [[Washington Supreme Court]] reversed the trial court, but the order was stayed, and DeFunis remained in school. The U.S. Supreme Court granted review and the case was briefed and argued, but by then, DeFunis was within months of graduation. The law school stated in its briefs that even if it won, it would not dismiss him.&lt;ref name ="balld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''DeFunis'', 416 U.S. at 314‚Äì317.&lt;/ref&gt;  After further briefing on the question of [[mootness]], the Supreme Court dismissed the case, 5-4, holding that as DeFunis had almost completed his studies, there was no longer a [[Case or Controversy Clause|case or controversy]] to decide.&lt;ref name = "balld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''DeFunis'', 416 U.S. at 319‚Äì320.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], in an opinion joined by the other three members of the minority, accused the court of "sidestepping" the issues, which "must inevitably return to the federal courts and ultimately again to this court".&lt;ref name = "balld"&gt;Ball, pp. 22‚Äì45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''DeFunis'', 416 U.S. at 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakke applied late to UC Davis in 1973 because his mother-in-law was ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19780629&amp;id=o8pRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6957,4320532|title=Bakke: A man driven to become a doctor|first=Robert|last=Lindsey |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]'' via ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 29, 1978|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santa Clara Law Review, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  This delay may well have cost him admission: although his credentials were outstanding even among applicants not part of the special program, by the time his candidacy was considered under the school's [[rolling admission]]s process, there were few seats left.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; His application reflected his anxiety about his age, referring to his years of sacrifice for his country as a cause of his interest in medicine.&lt;ref name=Joel-Dreyfuss-book/&gt;

Bakke received 468 points out of a possible 500 on the admissions committee‚Äôs rating scale in 1973.  Earlier in the year, a rating of 470 had won automatic admission with some promising applicants being admitted with lower scores.  Bakke had a science GPA of 3.44 and an overall GPA of 3.46 after taking science courses at night to qualify for medical school.  On the [[Medical College Admissions Test]] (MCAT), Bakke scored in the 97th percentile in scientific knowledge, the 96th percentile in verbal ability, the 94th percentile in quantitative analysis, and the 72nd percentile in general knowledge.&lt;ref name=Bakke-&amp;-The-Politics-Of-Equility-1985/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bk276"&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakke's MCAT score overall was 72; the average applicant to UC Davis scored a 69 and the average applicant under the special program a 33.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1973, Bakke was invited to UC Davis for an interview. Dr. Theodore West, who met with him, described Bakke as ‚Äúa well-qualified candidate for admission whose main hardship is the unavoidable fact that he is now 33.&amp;nbsp;‚Ä¶ On the grounds of motivation, academic records, potential promise, endorsement by persons capable of reasonable judgments, personal appearance and decorum, maturity, and probable contribution to balance in the class, I believe Mr. Bakke must be considered as a very desirable applicant and I shall so recommend him.‚Äù&lt;ref name = "bk276" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "west"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and Politics|first=Bruce J.|last=Schulman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOBduPX1bUMC|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0306811265|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About two months later in May 1973, Bakke received notice of his rejection.&lt;ref name=Bakke-&amp;-The-Politics-Of-Equility-1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joel-Dreyfuss-book/&gt;

Bakke complained to Dr. George Lowrey, chairman of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program.  At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply.  If he was not accepted the second time, "he could then research the legal question.  He had been a good candidate.  I thought he'd be accepted and that would end the matter."&lt;ref name=Carol-Benfell-1977&gt;Benfell, pp. 17, 52‚Äì54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action.&lt;ref name=Bakke-&amp;-The-Politics-Of-Equility-1985/&gt; The general counsel for the University of California said, "I don't think Storandt meant to injure the university.  It's simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters."&lt;ref name=Carol-Benfell-1977/&gt;  Storandt stated, "I simply gave Allan the response you'd give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger.  I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn't know this would be the case."&lt;ref name=Carol-Benfell-1977/&gt; Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the ''Bakke'' case, Storandt was fired.&lt;ref name=Carol-Benfell-1977/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 6‚Äì7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Bakke applied to UC Davis medical school again in 1974.&lt;ref name=Joel-Dreyfuss-book/&gt; He was interviewed twice: once by a student interviewer, who recommended his admission, and once by Dr. Lowrey, who in his report stated that Bakke "had very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than on a study of the whole problem&amp;nbsp;‚Ä¶ He was very unsympathetic to the concept of recruiting minority students."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp.  7‚Äì8.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowrey gave Bakke a poor evaluation, the only part of his application on which he did not have a high score.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He was rejected again, although minorities were admitted in both years with significantly lower academic scores through the special program. Not all minority applicants whose admission was recommended under the program gained entry‚Äîsome were rejected by the admissions committee.  This, however, did not affect the number of minority students to be admitted, sixteen.&lt;ref name=Joel-Dreyfuss-book/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bk277" /&gt; Although 272 [[white people]] between 1971 and 1974 had applied under this program, none had been successful;&lt;ref name=Bakke-&amp;-The-Politics-Of-Equility-1985/&gt; in 1974 the special admissions committee summarily rejected all white students who asked for admission under the program. Only one black student and six [[Latino]]s were admitted under the regular admissions program in that time period, though significant numbers of [[Asian Americans|Asian]] students were given entry.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 275‚Äì276.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1976 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article, the dean of the medical school sometimes intervened on behalf of daughters and sons of the university's "special friends" in order to improve their chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical Dean Aids 'Special Interest' Applicants|last=Trombley|first =William|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 5, 1976|pages=C1, C4|accessdate=August 16, 2013|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/158083544.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+5%2C+1976&amp;author=Trombley%2C+William&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1923-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Medical+Dean+Aids+%27Special+Interest%27+Applicants}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who benefitted by Dean C. John Tupper's interventions (about five per year) was the son of an influential state assemblyman, who had not even filed an application.  The special picks were ended by order of University of California President [[David S. Saxon]] in 1976.  Bakke's lawyer deemed it impossible to tell if these picks caused Bakke not to be admitted, but according to an attorney who filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief on behalf of the [[National Urban League]] in support of affirmative action, the practice of dean's picks made the university reluctant to go into detail about its admission practices at trial, affecting its case negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bakke passed over for white VIPs|last=Nesbitt|first=Tim|newspaper=The East Bay Voice|date=October 1977|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=1, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lower court history ===

On June 20, 1974,&lt;ref name = "ccr7"&gt;''Complete Case Record'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; following his second rejection from UC Davis, Bakke brought suit against [[UC Regents|the university's governing board]] in the [[Superior Court of California]],&lt;ref name = "bk277"&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 277.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yolo County]]. He sought an order admitting him on the ground that the special admission programs for minorities violated the U.S. and California constitutions, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. UC Davis's counsel filed a request that the judge, F. Leslie Manker, find that the special program was constitutional and legal, and argued that Bakke would not have been admitted even if there had been no seats set aside for minorities.  On November 20, 1974, Judge Manker found the program unconstitutional and in violation of Title VI, "no race or ethnic group should ever be granted privileges or immunities not given to every other race."&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 56‚Äì57.&lt;/ref&gt; Manker ordered the medical school to disregard race as a factor, and to reconsider Bakke's application under a race-free system.&lt;ref name = "b58" /&gt;  After Manker entered final judgment in the case on March 7, 1975,&lt;ref name = "ccr7" /&gt; both parties appealed, the university on March 20 because the program was struck down, and Bakke on April 17 because he was not ordered admitted.&lt;ref name = "ccr7" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "b58"&gt;Ball, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the important issues presented, the [[Supreme Court of California]] on June 26, 1975 ordered the appeal transferred to it, bypassing the intermediate appeals court.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 18‚Äì19.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 1976, the case was argued before the state supreme court.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine ''amicus curiae'' briefs were filed by various organizations, the majority in support of the university's position.&lt;ref name = "playbill" /&gt;  The California Supreme Court was considered one of the most liberal appellate courts, and it was widely expected that it would find the program to be legal.  Nevertheless, on September 16, 1976, the court, in an opinion by Justice [[Stanley Mosk]], upheld the lower-court ruling, 6‚Äì1.&lt;ref name = "ccr7" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "playbill"&gt;Ball, pp. 58‚Äì60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke v. Regents of the University of California'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5269915948665529282 18 Cal. 3d 34, 132 Cal. Rptr. 680, 553 P.2d 1152] (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Mosk wrote that "no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard to race".&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 279‚Äì280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 18 Cal. 3d at 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Matthew O. Tobriner]] dissented, stating that Mosk's suggestion that the state open more medical schools to accommodate both white and minority was unrealistic due to cost: "It is a cruel hoax to deny minorities participation in the medical profession on the basis of such fanciful speculation."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 18 Cal. 3d at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The court barred the university from using race in the admissions process and ordered it to provide evidence that Bakke would not have been admitted under a race-neutral program. When the university conceded its inability to do so in a petition for rehearing, the court on October 28, 1976 amended its ruling to order Bakke's admission and denied the petition.&lt;ref name = "ccr7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 18 Cal. 3d at 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The university requested that the U.S. Supreme Court stay the order requiring Bakke's admission pending its filing a petition asking for review. U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]], as [[circuit justice]] for the [[Ninth Circuit]] (which includes California) granted the stay for the court in November 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''Regents of the University of California v. Bakke'', 429 U.S. 953 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., as circuit justice, granting stay).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "b61"&gt;Ball, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The university filed a petition for writ of [[certiorari]] in December 1976.&lt;ref name = "b61" /&gt; The papers of some of the justices who participated in the ''Bakke'' case reveal that the case was three times considered by the court in January and February 1977.  Four votes were needed for the court to grant certiorari, and it had at least that number each time, but was twice put over for reconsideration at the request of one of the justices. A number of civil rights organizations filed a joint brief as ''amicus curiae'', urging the court to deny review, on the grounds that the ''Bakke'' trial had failed to fully develop the issues‚Äîthe university had not introduced evidence of past discrimination, or of bias in the MCAT.  Nevertheless, on February 22, the court granted certiorari, with the case to be argued in its October 1977 term.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 64‚Äì67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein &amp; Knight, pp. 346‚Äì347.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties duly filed their briefs.  The university's legal team was now headed by former [[Solicitor General of the United States|U.S. Solicitor General]] and [[Watergate]] special prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]], who had argued many cases before the Supreme Court.  Cox wrote much of the brief, and contended in it that "the outcome of this controversy will decide for future generations whether blacks, Chicanos and other insular minorities are to have meaningful access to higher education and real opportunities to enter the learned professions".&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 68‚Äì69.&lt;/ref&gt; The university also took the position that Bakke had been rejected because he was unqualified.&lt;ref name = "barring"&gt;Robert C. Barring, "Introduction to the ''Bakke'' case" in ''Complete Case Record'' at xxi‚Äìxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynold Colvin, for Bakke, argued that his client's rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to equal protection of the laws had been violated by the special admission program.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 69‚Äì70.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-eight ''amicus curiae'' briefs were filed, establishing a record for the Supreme Court that would stand until broken in the 1989 abortion case ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]''. Future justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] signed the [[ACLU]]'s brief; Marco deFunis, the petitioner in the 1974 case dismissed for mootness, wrote the brief for [[Young Americans for Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 76‚Äì83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the various other ''amici'', the United States filed a brief through the Solicitor General, as it may without leave of court under the [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's rules]].  When consideration of  ''Bakke'' began in the new [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|administration of President Jimmy Carter]], early drafts of the brief both supported affirmative action and indicated that the program should be struck down and Bakke admitted. This stance reflected the mixed support of affirmative action at that time by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Minorities and others in that party complained, and in late July 1977, Carter announced that the government's brief would firmly support affirmative action.  That document, filed October 3, 1977 (nine days before oral argument), stated that the government supported programs tailored to make up for past discrimination, but opposed rigid set-asides.&lt;ref name = "enraged" /&gt;  The United States urged the court to remand the case to allow for further fact-finding (a position also taken by civil rights groups in their ''amicus'' briefs).&lt;ref name = "enraged"&gt;Ball, pp. 74‚Äì77.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the case was awaiting argument, another white student, Rita Clancy, sued for admission to UC Davis Medical School on the same grounds as Bakke had. In September 1977, she was ordered admitted pending the outcome of the ''Bakke'' case.  After ''Bakke'' was decided, the university dropped efforts to oust her, stating that as she had successfully completed one year of medical school, she should remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School drops attempt to bar white student|date=July 5, 1978|newspaper=The Bulletin|location=Bend, Oregon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1PtXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yvYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5300%2C6322623|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argument and deliberation ===

Oral argument in ''Bakke'' took place on October 12, 1977. There was intense public interest in the case; prospective attendees began to line up the afternoon before. The court session took two hours, with Cox arguing for the university, Colvin for Bakke, and Solicitor General [[Wade H. McCree]] for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 47‚Äì52.&lt;/ref&gt; Colvin was admonished by Justice [[Byron White]] for arguing the facts, rather than the Constitution.&lt;ref name = "times argument"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weaver Jr.|first=Warren|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/10/13/75688830.pdf|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Justices hear ''Bakke'' arguments but give little hint on decision|pages=A1, B12|date=October 13, 1977|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}(registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; Cox provided one of the few moments of levity during the argument when Justice [[Harry A. Blackmun]] wondered whether the set-aside seats could be compared to athletic scholarships.  Cox was willing to agree, but noted that he was a Harvard graduate, and as for sporting success, "I don't know whether it's our aim, but we don't do very well."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thurgood Marshall on Bakke p 1.jpg|left|Thurgood Marshall on ''Bakke''|thumb]]
Beginning the day after the argument, the justices lobbied each other through written memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein &amp; Knight, pp. 347‚Äì349.&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference held among justices on October 15, 1977, they decided to request further briefing from the parties on the applicability of Title VI.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 103‚Äì104.&lt;/ref&gt;  The supplemental brief for the university was filed on November 16, and argued that Title VI was a statutory version of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment and did not allow private plaintiffs, such as Bakke, to pursue a claim under it.  Bakke's brief arrived the following day.  Colvin submitted that Bakke did have a private right of action, and that his client did not want the university to suffer the remedy prescribed under Title VI for discriminatory institutions‚Äîloss of federal funding‚Äîbut wanted to be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 105‚Äì106.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Justice Blackmun left Washington to have prostate surgery at the [[Mayo Clinic]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmun's absence did not stem the flow of memos, notably one on November 22 from Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]], analyzing the minority admissions program under the [[strict scrutiny]] standard often applied when government treats some citizens differently from others based on a [[suspect classification]] such as race.  Concluding that the program did not meet the standard, and must be struck down, Powell's memorandum stated that affirmative action was permissible under some circumstances, and eventually formed much of his released opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 81‚Äì85.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the justices' December 9 conference, with Blackmun still absent, they considered the case. Counting heads, four justices (Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] and Justices [[Potter Stewart]], Rehnquist, and [[John Paul Stevens]]) favored affirming the California Supreme Court's decision.  Three (Justices Brennan, White, and [[Thurgood Marshall]]) wanted to uphold the program.  Justice Blackmun had not yet weighed in.  Powell stated his views, after which Brennan, hoping to cobble together a five-justice majority to support the program, or at least to support the general principle of affirmative action, suggested to Powell that applying Powell's standard meant that the lower court decision would be affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Powell agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 98‚Äì107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when Blackmun returned in early 1978, he was slow to make his position on ''Bakke'' known.  It was not until May 1 that he circulated a memorandum to his colleagues's chambers, indicating that he would join Brennan's bloc, in support of affirmative action and the university's program.  This meant that Powell was essential to either side being part of a majority.  Over the following eight weeks, Powell fine-tuned his opinion to secure the willingness of each group to join part of it.  The other justices began work on opinions that would set forth their views.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 120‚Äì141.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision ===

[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell - 1976 official portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice [[Lewis F. Powell]]|alt=monochrome photographic portrait of a white man in late middle age in judicial robes.  He wears glasses and has thinning hair.]]
The Supreme Court's decision in ''Bakke'' was announced on June 28, 1978.  The justices penned six opinions; none of them, in full, had the support of a majority of the court. In a [[plurality opinion]],{{efn|Under Supreme Court precedent, a plurality opinion, for purposes of precedent, is to be "viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.‚Äù ''[[Marks v. United States]]'', 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).}}  Justice Powell delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Burger, Stewart, Rehnquist, and Stevens) joined with him to strike down the minority admissions program and admit Bakke.  The other four justices (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun) dissented from that portion of the decision, but joined with Powell to find affirmative action permissible under some circumstances, though subject to an intermediate scrutiny standard of analysis. They also joined with Powell to reverse that portion of the judgment of the California Supreme Court that forbade the university to consider race in the admissions process.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 265‚Äì272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Powell's opinion ====
Justice Powell, after setting forth the facts of the case, discussed and found it unnecessary to decide whether Bakke had a private right of action under Title VI, assuming that was so for purposes of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 272‚Äì284.&lt;/ref&gt; He then discussed the scope of Title VI, opining that it barred only those racial classifications forbidden by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 284‚Äì287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning to the program itself, Powell determined that it was not simply a goal, as the university had contended, but a racial qualification‚Äîassuming that UC Davis could find sixteen minimally qualified minority students, there were only 84 seats in the freshman class open to white students, whereas minorities could compete for any spot in the 100-member class.  He traced the history of the jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause, and concluded that it protected all, not merely African Americans or only minorities. Only if it served a [[compelling state interest|compelling interest]] could the government treat members of different races differently.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 287‚Äì299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell noted that the university, in its briefs, had cited decisions where there had been race-conscious remedies, such as in the school desegregation cases, but found them inapposite as there was no history of racial discrimination at the University of California-Davis Medical School to remedy.  He cited precedent that when an individual was entirely foreclosed from opportunities or benefits provided by the government and enjoyed by those of a different background or race, this was a [[suspect classification]].  Such discrimination was only justifiable when necessary to a compelling governmental interest.  He rejected assertions by the university that government had a compelling interest in boosting the number of minority doctors, and deemed too nebulous the argument that the special admissions program would help bring doctors to underserved parts of California‚Äîafter all, that purpose would also be served by admitting white applicants interested in practicing in minority communities. Nevertheless, Powell opined that government had a compelling interest in a racially diverse student body.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 300‚Äì315.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a part of the opinion concurred in by Chief Justice Burger and his allies, Powell found that the program, with its set-aside of a specific number of seats for minorities, did discriminate against Bakke, as less restrictive programs, such as making race one of several factors in admission, would serve the same purpose. Powell offered the example (set out in an appendix) of the admissions program at Harvard University as one he believed would pass constitutional muster‚Äîthat institution did not set rigid quotas for minorities, but actively recruited them and sought to include them as more than a token part of a racially and culturally diverse student body. Although a white student might still lose out to a minority with lesser academic qualifications, both white and minority students might gain from non-objective factors such as the ability to play sports or a musical instrument.  Accordingly, there was no constitutional violation in using race as one of several factors.&lt;ref name = "ball1"&gt;Ball, pp. 137‚Äì139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 300‚Äì320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell opined that because the university had admitted that it could not prove that Bakke would not have been admitted even had there been no special admissions program, the portion of the California Supreme Court's decision ordering Bakke's admission was proper, and was upheld.  Nevertheless, the state was entitled to consider race as one of several factors, and the portion of the California court's judgment which had ordered the contrary was overruled.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 320‚Äì321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other opinions ====

Brennan delivered the joint statement of four justices: Marshall, White, Blackmun and himself. In verbally introducing their opinion in the Supreme Court courtroom, Brennan stated that the "central meaning" of the ''Bakke'' decision was that there was a majority of the court in favor of the continuation of affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 146‚Äì147.&lt;/ref&gt; In the joint opinion, those four justices wrote, "government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice".&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 325.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that any admissions program with the intention of remedying past race discrimination would be constitutional, whether that involved adding bonus points for race, or setting aside a specific number of places for them.&lt;ref name="Bakke"&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

White issued an opinion expressing his view that there was not a private right of action under Title VI.&lt;ref name = "b140"&gt;Ball, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Thurgood Marshall also wrote separately, recounting at length the history of discrimination against African-Americans, and concluding, "I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible."&lt;ref name="Bakke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 139‚Äì140.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun subscribed to the idea of [[Color Consciousness|color consciousness]], declaring that, "in order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot‚Äîwe dare not‚Äîlet the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial superiority."&lt;ref name = "b140" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Stevens, joined by Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in part in the judgment, found it unnecessary to determine whether a racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution.  A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 409‚Äì411.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate."&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 411.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stevens, "[t]he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program".&lt;ref name = "opinions"&gt;{{cite news|title=Excerpts from opinions by Supreme Court justices in the ''Allan P.

To the extent that it purports to do anything else, I respectfully dissent."&lt;ref&gt;''Bakke'', 438 U.S. at 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==

Newspapers stressed different aspects of ''Bakke'', often reflecting their political ideology. The conservative ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' bannered Bakke's admission in its headline, while noting that the court had permitted affirmative action under some circumstances. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', a liberal newspaper, began its headline in larger-than-normal type, "Affirmative Action Upheld" before going on to note that the court had admitted Bakke and curbed quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 140‚Äì141.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', in a headline, deemed ''Bakke'' "The Decision Everybody Won".&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 151‚Äì152.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence [[Ronald Dworkin]], the court's decision "was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it seemed to want most".&lt;ref name = "dworkin"&gt;[[Ronald Dworkin]], "The ''Bakke'' decision: did it decide anything?" in ''Complete Case Record'' at xxv‚Äìxxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- on p. xxv --&gt;

Attorney General [[Griffin Bell]], after speaking with President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated, "my general view is that affirmative action has been enhanced", and that such programs in the federal government would continue as planned.&lt;ref name="b142"/&gt; [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] Chair [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] told the media "that the ''Bakke'' case has not left me with any duty to instruct the EEOC staff to do anything different".&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 142‚Äì143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Laurence Tribe]] wrote in 1979, "the Court thus upheld the kind of affirmative action plan used by most American colleges and universities, and disallowed only the unusually mechanical‚Äîsome would say unusually candid, others would say unusually impolitic‚Äîapproach taken by the Medical School" of UC Davis.&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, p. 864.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. O'Neil]] wrote in the ''[[California Law Review]]'' the same year that only rigid quotas were foreclosed to admissions officers and even "relatively subtle changes in the process by which applications were reviewed, or in the resulting minority representation, could well produce a different alignment [of justices]".&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor and future judge [[Robert Bork]] wrote in the pages of ''The Wall Street Journal'' that the justices who had voted to uphold affirmative action were "hard-core racists of reverse discrimination".&lt;ref name = "b142"&gt;Ball, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Bakke had given few interviews during the pendency of the case, and on the day it was decided, went to work as usual in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].&lt;ref name = "barring" /&gt;&lt;!-- on page xxi --&gt; He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall.&lt;ref name="Ball, p. 143"&gt;Ball, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would have to deal with the aftermath of ''Bakke'' doubted the decision would change very much.  The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue.&lt;ref name = "herb"&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbers|first=John|title=A plateau for minorities|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/06/29/110879540.pdf|accessdate=August 15, 2013|pages=A1, A22|date=June 29, 1978}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of ''Bakke'', the Supreme Court's decision "permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences‚Äîprovided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat 'quota' provided at Davis".&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Allan Bakke, "America's best known freshman", enrolled at the UC Davis medical school on September 25, 1978.&lt;ref name = "kush" /&gt;  Seemingly oblivious to the questions of the press and the shouts of protesters, he stated only "I am happy to be here" before entering to register.&lt;ref name = "kush"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kushman|first=Rick|title=Bakke enters UC Davis Medical School|newspaper=[[The California Aggie]]|location=Davis, California|date=September 27, 1978|pages=1, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the university declined to pay his legal fees, Bakke went to court, and on January 15, 1980, was awarded $183,089.&lt;ref name="Ball, p. 143"/&gt; Graduating from the UC Davis medical school in 1982 at age 42, he went on to a career as an anesthesiologist at the [[Mayo Clinic]] and at the Olmsted Medical Group in [[Rochester, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name = "b46"&gt;Ball, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diamond|first=S.J.|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 30, 1992|title=Where are they now? : A drifter, a deadbeat and an intensely private doctor|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-30/news/vw-8207_1_legal-decisions|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Californians [[initiatives and referendums in the United States|by initiative]] banned the state's use of race as a factor to consider in public schools' admission policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/U-S-appeals-court-hears-challenge-to-Prop-209-3312625.php|title=U.S. appeals court hears challenge to Prop. 209|first=Bob|last=Egelko|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{efn|California's [[California Proposition 209 (1996)|Proposition 209]] mandates that "the state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of Proposition 209 |url=http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/209text.htm |publisher=California Secretary of State |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610224849/http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/209text.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The university's [[University of California Regents|Board of Regents]], led by [[Ward Connerly]], voted to end race as a factor in admissions.

Dworkin warned in 1978 that "Powell's opinion suffers from fundamental weaknesses, and if the Court is to arrive at a coherent position, far more judicial work remains to be done than a relieved public yet realizes".&lt;ref name = "dworkin" /&gt; The Supreme Court has continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education.  In the 2003 case of ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in ''Bakke'' in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that ''Bakke'' might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a [[plurality opinion]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', 539 U.S. [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/539/306.html 306] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision in the 2013 case of ''[[Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)|Fisher v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31217">The '''right to property''' or '''right to own property''' (cf. [[ownership]]) is often classified as a [[human right]] for [[natural person]]s regarding their possessions. A general recognition of a right to [[private property]] is found more rarely and is typically heavily constrained insofar as property is owned by [[legal person]]s (i.e. [[corporations]]) and where it is used for production rather than consumption.&lt;ref&gt;See generally AA Berle, 'Property, Production and Revolution' (1965) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1120512 65 Columbia Law Review 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A right to property is recognised in Article 17 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], but it is not recognised in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] or the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doebbler|first=Curtis|title=Introduction to International Human Rights Law|publisher=CD Publishing|year=2006|pages=141‚Äì142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GECdq=%22right+to+property%22+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=978-0-9743570-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], in [[Protocol 1, article 1]] acknowledges a right for natural and legal persons to "peaceful enjoyment of his possessions", subject to the "general interest or to secure the payment of taxes".

==Definition==
The right to property is one of the most controversial human rights, both in terms of its existence and interpretation. The controversy about the definition of the right meant that it was not included in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] or the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name="Doebbler-p141-142"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Doebbler |first=Curtis |title=Introduction to International Human Rights Law |publisher=CD Publishing |year=2006 |pages=141‚Äì142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ61oCPJ1GEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-9743570-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy centres upon who is deemed to have property rights protected (e.g. human beings or also corporations), the type of property which is protected (property used for the purpose of consumption or production) and the reasons for which property can be restricted (for instance, for regulations, taxation or nationalisation in the public interest). In all human rights instruments, either implicit or express restrictions exist on the extent to which property is protected. Article 17 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) enshrines the right to property as follows: {{Cquote|(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.
(2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=United Nations |pages=Article 17 |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The object of the right to property as it is usually understood nowadays consists of property already owned or possessed, or of property acquired or to be acquired by a person through lawful means. Not in opposition but in contrast to this, some proposals also defend a universal right to private property, in the sense of a right of every person to effectively receive a certain amount of property, grounded in a claim to Earth's natural resources or other theories of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/13859497/La_Biblia_el_papa_Francisco_y_el_derecho_universal_a_la_propiedad_privada |title=La Biblia, Laudato Si y el derecho universal a la propiedad privada |date= |access-date=2 February 2016 |website= |publisher=El Dial ‚Äì Biblioteca Jur√≠dica online |last=Stilman |first=Gabriel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
{{see also|African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights}}
The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) protects the right to property most explicitly in Article 14,&lt;ref name="Alfredsson-p372"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: {{Cquote|The right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights |publisher=Organisation of African Unity |pages=Article 14 |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/009.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Property rights are furthermore recognised in Article 13 of the ACHPR, which states that every citizen has the right to participate freely in the government of his country, the right to equal access to public services and "the right of access to public property and services in strict equality of all persons before the law". Article 21 of the ACHPR recognises the right of all peoples to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources and that this right shall be exercised in the exclusive interest of the people, who may not be deprived of this right. Article 21 also provides that "in case of spoliation the dispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its property as well as to adequate compensation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights |publisher=Organisation of African Unity |pages=Article 13 and 21 |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/009.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
{{see also|American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man|American Convention on Human Rights}}
When the text of the UDHR was negotiated, other states in the Americas argued that the right to property should be limited to the protection of private property necessary for [[subsistence]]. Their suggestion was opposed, but was enshrined in the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]], which was negotiated at the same time and adopted one year before the UDHR in 1948.&lt;ref name="Alfredsson-p370"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=370 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 23 of the declaration states: {{Cquote|Every Person has the right to own such private property as meets the essential needs of decent living and helps to maintain the dignity of the individual and of the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man |publisher=Ninth International Conference of American States |pages=Article 23 |url=http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/law/oashr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the right to property is heavily influenced by Western concepts of property rights, but because property rights vary considerably in different legal systems it has not been possible to establish international standards on property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=359‚Äì360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional human rights instruments of Europe, Africa and the Americas recognise the right to protection of property to varying degrees.&lt;ref name="Alfredsson-p365"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (ACHR) recognises the right to protection of property, including the right to "just compensation". The ACHR also prohibits usury and other exploitation, which is unique amongst human rights instruments.&lt;ref name="Alfredsson-p370"/&gt; Article 21 of the ACHR states: {{Cquote|(1) Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use and enjoyment to the interest of society.
(2) No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of public utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.
(3) Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=American Convention on Human Rights |publisher=Organization of American States |pages=Article 21 |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/009.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Europe===
{{main article|European Convention on Human Rights}}
After failed attempts to include the right to protection of property in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), European states enshrined the right to protection of property in Article 1 of Protocol I to the ECHR as the "right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the right to protection of property is defined as such: {{Cquote|(1) Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.
(2) The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Protocol I to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms |publisher=Council of Europe |pages=Protocol 1 Article 1 |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/009.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Therefore European human rights law recognises the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, makes deprivation of possessions subject to certain conditions and recognises that states can balance the right to peaceful possession of property against the public interest. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has interpreted "possessions" to include not only tangible property, but also economic interests, contractual agreements with economic value, compensation claims against the state and public law related claims such as [[pensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Court of Human Rights has held that the right to property is not absolute and states have a wide degree of discretion to limit the rights. As such, the right to property is regarded as a more flexible right than other human rights. States' degree of discretion is defined in ''Handyside v. United Kingdom'', heard by the European Court of Human Rights in 1976. Notable cases where the European Court of Human Rights has found the right to property having been violated include ''Sporrong and Lonnroth v. Sweden'', heard in 1982, where Swedish law kept property under the threat of expropriation for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="Doebbler-p141-142" /&gt; The highest economic compensation following a judgment of the Strasbourg Court on this matter was given (1,3 million euro) in case ''Beyeler v. Italy''.&lt;ref&gt;The handling of the affair by the Italian authorities has never been the most mirrored, although it is clear that, in the case Beyeler, the right and wrong was not all on one side: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=Il contribuente paga il conto dell'adeguamento ai principi di legalit√† e buona amministrazione |journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002 |url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89333348}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International conventions===
Property rights are also recognised in the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] which states in Article 5 that everyone has the [[right to equality before the law]] without distinction as to race, colour and national or ethnic origin, including the "right to own property alone as well as in association with others" and "the right to inherit". The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] recognises the property rights in Article 16, which establishes the same right for both spouses to ownership, acquisition, management, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property and Article 15, which establishes women‚Äôs' right to conclude contracts.&lt;ref name="Alfredsson-p372"/&gt;

Property rights are also enshrined in the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the [[Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]]. These international human rights instruments for minorities do not establish a separate right to property, but prohibit discrimination in relation to property rights where such rights are guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=373 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other rights==
The right to private property was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality and against feudal control of property. Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and it was only property owners which were initially granted [[civil and political rights]], such as the [[right to vote]]. Because not everybody is a property owner, the [[right to work]] was enshrined to allow everybody to attain an adequate standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=533 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, discrimination on the basis of property ownership is commonly seen as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in [[international human rights instruments]] frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited (see the [[right to equality before the law]]).&lt;ref name="Alfredsson-p372" /&gt; The protection of private property may come into conflict with [[economic, social and cultural rights]] and [[civil and political rights]], such as the right to [[freedom of expression]]. To mitigate this the right to property is commonly limited to protect the public interest. Many states also maintain systems of communal and collective ownership. Property rights have frequently been regarded as preventing the realisation of human rights for all, through for example slavery and the exploitation of others. Unequal distribution of wealth often follows line of sex, race and minorities, therefore property rights may appear to be part of the problem, rather than as an interest that merits protection. Property rights have been at the centre of recent human rights debates on land reform, the return of cultural artifacts by collectors and museums to indigenous peoples and the popular sovereignty of peoples over natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alfredsson |first=Gudmundur |author2=Eide, Asbjorn |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1999 |pages=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In Europe, the notion of private property and property rights emerged in the [[Renaissance]]{{cn|date=August 2018}} as [[international trade]] by [[merchants]] gave rise to [[mercantilist]] ideas. In 16th-century Europe, [[Lutheranism]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] advanced property rights using biblical terminology. The [[Protestant work ethic]] and views on man's destiny came to underline social views in emerging capitalist economies in [[early modern Europe]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} The right to private property emerged as a radical demand for [[human rights]] ''vis-a-vis'' the state in 17th-century revolutionary Europe, but in the 18th and 19th centuries the right to property as a human right became subject of intense controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book |last= Ishay |first= Micheline |title= The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalized Era |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages= 91 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;dq=right+to+property+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-0-520-25641-5 | quote = New forms of mercantilist activities that emerged during the Renaissance rekindled efforts to define the individual's right to private property. [...] With the advance of Lutheranism and the Reformation, the fight for property rights was initially couched in the terminology of revelation. [...] The work ethic of the emerging capitalist age was consistent with the Protestant vision of man's providential destiny on earth, Max Weber later explained in his ''Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism''. [...] Regarded as a radical human rights affirmation in the seventeenth century, the right to property would become a major source of contention in nineteenth- and twentieth-century human rights discourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English Civil War===
{{see also|English Civil War}}
The arguments advanced by the [[Levellers]] during the [[English Civil War]] on [[property]] and [[civil and political rights]], such as the [[right to vote]], informed subsequent debates in other countries.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The Levellers emerged as a political movement in mid-17th century England in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation. They believed that property which had been earned as the fruit of one's labour was sacred under the Bible's [[Ten Commandments|commandment]] "thou shall not steal". As such, they believed that the right to acquire property from one's work was sacred. Levellers' views on the right to property and the right not to be deprived of property as a civil and political right were developed by the [[pamphleteer]] [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]].&lt;ref name="Ishay-p91-94"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ishay |first= Micheline |title= The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalized Era |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages= 91‚Äì94 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;dq=right+to+property+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-0-520-25641-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "An Arrow against all Tyrants" (1646), Overton argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;To every individual in nature is given an individual property by nature not to be invaded or usurped by any. For everyone, as he is himself , so he has a self propertiety, else he could not be himself; and of this no second may presume to deprive of without manifest violation and affront to the very principles of nature of the rules of equity and justice between man and man. Mine and thine cannot be, except this. No man has power over my rights and liberties, and I over no man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ishay |first= Micheline |title= The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalized Era |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages= 92 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;dq=right+to+property+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-0-520-25641-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The views of the Levellers, who enjoyed support amongst small-scale property-owners and craftsmen, were not shared by all revolutionary parties of the English Civil War. At the 1647 General Council, [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Henry Ireton]] argued against equating the [[right to life]] with the right to property. They argued that doing so would establish the right to take anything that one may want, irrespective of the rights of others. The Leveller [[Thomas Rainborough]] responded, relying on Overton's arguments, that the Levellers required respect for others' [[natural rights]]. The definition of property and whether it was acquired as the fruit of one's labour and as such a natural right was subject to intense debate because the right to vote depended on property ownership. Political freedom was at the time associated with property ownership and individual independence. Cromwell and Ireton maintained that only property in [[Freehold (law)|freehold land]] or [[Chartered company| chartered trading rights]] gave a man the right to vote. They argued that this type of property ownership constituted a "take in society", which entitles men to political power. In contrast, Levellers argued that all men who are not servants, alms-recipients or beggars should be considered as property owners and be given voting rights. They believed that political freedom could only be secured by individuals, such as craftsmen, engaging in independent economic activity.&lt;ref name="Ishay-p91-94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossides-p54"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rossides |first= Daniel W. |title= Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year= 1998 |pages= 54 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TTYAGD7aKBkC&amp;dq=levellers+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-1-882289-50-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levellers were primarily concerned with the civil and political rights of small-scale property owners and workers, whereas the [[Diggers]], a smaller revolutionary group led by [[Gerard Winstanley]], focused on the rights of the rural poor who worked on [[landed property]]. The Diggers argued that private property was not consistent with justice and that the land that had been confiscated from the Crown and Church should be turned into communal land to be cultivated by the poor. According to the Diggers, the right to vote should be extended to all and everybody had the [[right to an adequate standard of living]]. With the [[Restoration (England) | Restoration of the English monarchy]] in 1660, all confiscated land returned to the Crown and Church. Some property rights were recognised and limited voting rights were established. The ideas of the Levellers on property and civil and political rights remained influential and were advanced in the subsequent 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]],&lt;ref name="Ishay-p91-94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossides-p54" /&gt; but restrictions on the right to vote based on property meant that only a fraction of the British population had the suffrage. In 1780 only 214,000 property-owning men were entitled to vote in England and Wales, less than 3 percent of the population of 8 million. The [[Reform Act 1832]] restricted the right to vote to men who owned property with an annual value of ¬£10, giving approximately 4 percent of the adult male population the right to vote. The reforms of 1867 extended the right to vote to approximately 8 percent. The working class (which increased dramatically with the Industrial Revolution) and industrialists remained effectively excluded from the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Robinson |first= Eric W. |title= Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 2004 |pages= 302 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jug6crxEImIC&amp;dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-0-631-23394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= The Struggle for democracy ‚Äì Getting the vote |publisher= National archives |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |accessdate= 15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Locke and the American and French Revolutions===
[[File:Locke treatises of government page.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Locke]]'s 1689 ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' in which Locke calls "lives, liberties and estates" the "property" of individuals]]
The English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632‚Äì1704) developed the ideas of property, civil and political rights further. In his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' (1689), Locke proclaimed that "everyman has a property in his person; this nobody has a right to but himself. The labor of his body and the work of his hand, we may say, are properly his".&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise of Civil Government, ¬ß&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that property ownership derives from one's labor, though those who do not own property and only have their labor to sell should not be given the same political power as those who owned property. Labourers, small-scale property owners and large-scale property owners should have civil and political rights in proportion to the property they owned. According to Locke, the right to property and the right to life were inalienable rights and that it was the duty of the state to secure these rights for individuals. Locke argued that the safeguarding of natural rights, such as the right to property, along with the separation of powers and other checks and balances, would help to curtail political abuses by the state.&lt;ref name="Ishay-p91-94" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rossides |first= Daniel W. |title= Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year= 1998 |pages= 52‚Äì54 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TTYAGD7aKBkC&amp;dq=levellers+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-1-882289-50-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's [[labor theory of property]] and the separation of powers greatly influenced the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]]. The entitlement to civil and political rights, such as the right to vote, was tied to the question of property in both revolutions. American revolutionaries, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], opposed universal suffrage, advocating votes only for those who owned a "stake" in society. [[James Madison]] argued that extending the right to vote to all could lead in the right to property and justice being "overruled by a majority without property". While it was initially suggested{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} to establish the right to vote for all men, eventually the right to vote in the nascent United States was extended to white men who owned a specified amount of real estate and personal property. French revolutionaries recognised property rights in Article 17 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1791), which stated that no one "may be deprived of property rights unless a legally established public necessity required it and upon condition of a just and previous indemnity". Articles 3 and 6 declared that "all citizens have the right to contribute personally or through their representatives" in the political system and that "all citizens being equal before [the law], are equally admissible to all public offices, positions and employment according to their capacity, and without other distinction than that of virtues and talents". However, in practice the French revolutionaries did not extend civil and political rights to all, although the property qualification required for such rights was lower than that established by the American revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ishay |first= Micheline |title= The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalized Era |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages= 94‚Äì97 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;dq=right+to+property+human+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-0-520-25641-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the French revolutionary [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s|Abb√© Siey√®s]], "all the inhabitants of a country should enjoy the right of a passive citizen... but those alone who contribute to the public establishment are like the true shareholders in the great social enterprise. They alone are the true active citizens, the true members of the association". Three months after the Declaration had been adopted, [[Domestic worker| domestic servants]], women and those who did not pay taxes equal to three days of labor were declared "passive citizens". Sieyes wanted to see the rapid expansion of commercial activities and favoured the unrestricted accumulation of property. In contrast, [[Maximilien Robespierre]] warned that the free accumulation of wealth ought to be limited and that the right to property should not be permitted to violate the rights of others, particularly poorer citizens, including the working poor and peasants. Robespierre's views were eventually excluded from the [[French Constitution of 1793]] and a property qualification for civil and political rights was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">The '''[[Russian language]] in [[Belarus]]''' is one of the two [[official language]]s (the other being [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). Being dominant in the media, education and other areas of public life, Russian is ''de facto'' the main language of the country.

==After 1995==
In 1995, according to the results of the [[1995 Belarusian Referendum]], the Russian language was declared the second official language. According to the [[Belarus Census (2009)]],  41.5% of the Belarusian population declared Russian as their [[mother language]] and 70.2% declared Russian "the language spoken at home" (the second language-related question of the Census).

'''Rudolphus Franciscus Marie "Ruud" Lubbers''' ({{IPA-nl|Ààryt Ààl èb…ôrs|-|Nl-Ruud Lubbers.ogg}}; 7 May 1939 ‚Äì 14 February 2018) was a Dutch politician and diplomat who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 4 November 1982 to 22 August 1994 and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/feb/15/longest-serving-dutch-prime-minister-ruud-lubbers-dies-1773445.html |title=Longest-serving Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers dies |date=15 February 2018 |work=[[Agence France Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers was a member of the [[board of directors]] of Hollandia Corporate for 10 years before being asked to be the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Environment (Netherlands)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] in the [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]] of [[Joop den Uyl]]; he took office on 11 May 1973. After the [[Dutch general election, 1977|1977 election]], he was elected as to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], serving from 8 June 1977 until 8 September 1977 and again from 22 December 1977 until 4 November 1982. On 7 November 1978, Lubbers was selected to serve as [[parliamentary leader]] for the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], serving from 7 November 1978 until 10 June 1981 and again from 24 August 1981 until 4 November 1982. After the [[Dutch general election, 1982|1982 election]], Prime Minister [[Dries van Agt]] unexpectedly announced his retirement from national politics and stood down as [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] on 13 October 1982, with Lubbers elected to succeed him on 25 October 1982, becoming the youngest Prime Minister in Dutch history.

The [[First Lubbers cabinet]] was formed by a coalition with the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), with Lubbers taking office as Prime Minister on 4 November 1982. With the following [[Dutch general election, 1986|1986 election]], Lubbers, as ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate), won nine more seats, the coalition retained its majority, and a cabinet formation resulted in a continuation of the policies with the [[Second Lubbers cabinet]]. For the [[Dutch general election, 1989|1989 election]], Lubbers, once more as Lijsttrekker, won the same number of seats as the previous election, and a coalition formation with the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) was formed that resulted in the [[Third Lubbers cabinet]]. On 29 January 1994, Lubbers announced his retirement from national politics and resigned as Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal. Lubbers remained Prime Minister until the [[First Kok cabinet]] was installed on 22 August 1994; he had served for nearly 12 years.

After his premiership, Lubbers semi-retired from active politics and served as a visiting professor at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Tilburg University]] from 1995 until 2001. Lubbers served as the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005, and finally retired from active politics at the age of sixty-five. Following the end of his active political career, Lubbers occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards on international non-governmental organisations ([[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Earth Charter Initiative]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands]]).

Lubbers was known for his abilities as a [[team leader]] and [[Consensus decision-making|consensus builder]]. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for rebuilding the [[Economy of the Netherlands|Dutch economy]] after the [[Early 1980s recession|recession in the 1980s]], stimulating [[sustainable development]], reforming [[social security]], and reducing the [[Government budget balance|deficit]]. Lubbers was also active as a [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] activist and as an advocate in promoting sustainable development. He continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman. On 31 January 1995, he was granted the honorary title of [[Minister of State (Netherlands)|Minister of State]]. He remains the youngest and longest-serving Prime Minister of the Netherlands.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rudolphus Franciscus Marie Lubbers was born on 7 May 1939 in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Province]] of [[South Holland]]. He studied economics at the [[Erasmus Universiteit|Erasmus University Rotterdam]], and was a student of the first [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]] laureate [[Jan Tinbergen]]. As suggested by the title of his 1962 thesis ‚Äì "The influence of differing productivity trends in various countries on the current account of the balance of payments" ‚Äì his main interest was in monetary affairs. He originally planned an academic career, but was compelled by family circumstances to join the management of Lubbers' Construction Workshops and Machinery Fabricators Hollandia B.V.

===Politics===
[[File:Ruud Lubbers (1973).jpg|thumb|left|Ruud Lubbers as [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Environment (Netherlands)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] in 1973]]

From 11 May 1973 to 19 December 1977, Ruud Lubbers was Minister of Economic Affairs in the [[Joop den Uyl|Den Uyl]]-government and a member of the Catholic People's Party (KVP). He was an effective, if sometimes somewhat bad-tempered minister. He chose to return to Parliament on the formation of the Van Agt-government in 1977, becoming senior deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the alliance between the KVP and the other two main Christian parties. His career got an unexpected boost when the leader of the parliamentary faction of the CDA, [[Willem Aantjes]], had to resign in 1978 because accusations that he had served in the [[Germanic-SS]] during the [[Second World War]]. Lubbers succeeded him and suddenly found himself in a powerful political position.

In 1982, after the general election won by Prime Minister [[Dries van Agt]], a similar thing happened when Van Agt suddenly announced he would not serve for a third term. Lubbers took over the post. He was the youngest prime minister in Dutch history; he had turned 43 only six months earlier. Major aspects of his time in office included extensive cutbacks in public spending, the launch of far-reaching [[deregulation]] and [[privatization|privatisation]] programs, and a massive demonstration in [[The Hague]] (1983) against the planned installation in the Netherlands of nuclear-armed U.S. [[cruise missile]]s (which was cancelled after all due to arms reduction talks between the US and the Soviet Union).

After leaving office in 1994, Lubbers was put forward as a candidate for the head of [[NATO]], but the U.S. vetoed his appointment. He was on the advisory board of the [[David Marsh (financial specialist)|Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum]] (OMFIF), where he was regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.

Lubbers was regarded by many during his time in office as an ideological heir to [[Margaret Thatcher]]. One of his campaign slogans was: "Meer markt, minder overheid" (more market, less government).

===Ecological activities===
In the follow-up of the [[Earth Summit]] in 1992, Lubbers engaged with the [[Earth Charter Initiative]] in cooperation with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Maurice Strong]]. The [[Earth Charter]] document was launched in the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague in June 2000. Lubbers was an active member of the international Earth Charter Commission and reached out, especially to youth in the Netherland, with the message of the Earth Charter for a sustainable and peaceful world.

===Academic===
From 1995 to 2000, he taught Globalization Studies at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States. He was also vice-chairman of the Independent World Commission on the Oceans and chair of Globus, the Institute for Globalization and Development based in [[Tilburg]].

===UN High Commissioner for Refugees===
At the end of the year 2000, Lubbers was appointed by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]] to succeed [[Sadako Ogata]] as UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

From 1 January 2001, Lubbers headed the UNHCR, which comprised over 5,000 employees who work across the globe, and which was concerned with an estimated 21 million refugees and internally displaced in over 120 countries worldwide. During his tenure, the number of refugees worldwide decreased by almost 22%, from 21.8 million in 2001 to close to 17.1 million at the beginning of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2004/2/403b2afa4/lubbers-welcomes-drop-asylum-numbers-industrialised-countries.html |title=Lubbers welcomes drop in asylum numbers in industrialised countries |last=Colville |first=Rupert |date=24 February 2004 |work=United Nations High Commission on Human Rights |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers also favoured a generous refugee policy for the Netherlands, and he was critical of the Foreign Citizens Law (Vreemdelingenwet). He also stabilised the UNHCR's financial situation and greatly increased the financial means for the sheltering of refugees.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

He annually donated some $300,000 to the refugee agency since he assumed his post in 2001, thereby covering his own $167,000 annual salary and travel expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2003/10/81422-general-assembly-extends-term-un-high-commissioner-refugees |title=General Assembly extends term of UN High Commissioner for Refugees |date=6 October 2003 |website=[[United Nations]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual harassment complaint====
In May 2004, Lubbers was accused by Cynthia Brzak, an American UNHCR employee, of [[sexual harassment]] following a meeting in his office that was attended by two other UNHCR staff members. The complaint was reported in the media,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DB153FF93BA25756C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/L/Lubbers,%20Ruud New York Times 18 May 2004]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Lubbers to inform UNHCR staff about the accusation. On this occasion, he  denied any wrongdoing and rejected the allegation against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article200054229.html |title=Longest-serving Dutch premier, Ruud Lubbers, dies at 78 |last=Corder |first=Mike |date=14 February 2018 |work=News &amp; Observer |access-date=14 February 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143601/https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article200054229.html |archivedate=15 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2004, the [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS), which was tasked with investigating the accusation, sent its report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/Onderzoeksrapport.pdf|title=OIOS Investigation report|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Annex 1 p.35"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iowatch.org/supremecourtcase.pdf |title=Supreme Court Annex 1 p.35 |access-date=2008-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131839/http://www.iowatch.org/supremecourtcase.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its public annual report to the UN Secretary-General (presented to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]), the OIOS reported concerning the case that it had "submitted a report to the Secretary-General supporting the allegations and recommended that appropriate actions be taken accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/508/29/PDF/N0450829.pdf?OpenElement  A/59/359*  Report of the Office Internal Oversight Services to the UN General Assembly, p. 31]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers responded to the OIOS report in a letter setting out to (a) deny acts of sexual harassment or abuse took place; (b) establish that such evidence of the alleged misconduct as is said to exist is insufficient and flawed; and (c) conclude that the report itself would appear to be based on an irregular statutory basis and also flawed by errors of law and reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%201.pdf Lubbers memo pp 2‚Äì4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131850/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%201.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}  [http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%202.pdf Lubbers Memo pp 5‚Äì8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131925/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%202.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf Lubbers Memo p 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131916/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubbers asked [[Max van der Stoel]], former [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]], to comment on the confidential report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2005/db050222.doc.htm|title=DAILY PRESS BRIEFING BY THE OFFICE OF THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "the OIOS report is deficient in objectivity and impartiality." He added "that the only two other persons in the room did not provide evidence confirming the version given by the complainant." Furthermore, he accused UN officials of leaking information to the press and recommended that an investigation of the leaks be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf  van der Stoel memo p 1 (after  Lubbers p. 9)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131916/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%203.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}[http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%204.pdf van der Stoel memo pp 2‚Äì4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529131838/http://www.novatv.nl/uploaded/FILES/lubbers%204.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary-General reviewed the report and the responses of the High Commissioner and the senior manager to the report, and decided that the complaint could not be substantiated by the evidence and therefore closed the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0DE153AF935A25754C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times+Topics/People/L/Lubbers,+Ruud|title=Annan Clears Refugee Chief Of Harassment Accusations|first=Fiona Fleck and Warren|last=Hoge|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also reported to have consulted with [[Stephen Schwebel]], an American judge and former President of the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2005/04/16/het-geheime-dossier-van-ruud-lubbers-10470736-a653659 |title=Het geheime dossier van Ruud Lubbers (The secret dossier of Ruud Lubbers) |last=de Guyter |first=Caroline |date=16 April 2005 |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |access-date=14 February 2018 |last2=van de Roer |first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary-General failed to order an investigation of the deliberate leaking by OIOS itself to the media as recommended by Max van der Stoel.

====Resignation====
In February 2005, the case was in the news again when the British daily newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' obtained a copy of the OIOS report and, accompanied by an article by [[Kate Holt]], published its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/harassment-intimidation-and-secrecy--un-chief-engulfed-in-sex-scandal-483851.html|title=Harassment, intimidation and secrecy - UN chief engulfed in sex|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the report stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;the allegation against Lubbers is substantiated in that Lubbers did engage in unwanted physical contact with the complainant, a subordinate female staff member. New allegations that came to OIOS's attention during the investigation, were also examined and indicate a pattern of sexual harassment by Lubbers, OIOS is also of the view that Lubbers abused his authority as High Commissioner by his intense, pervasive and intimidating attempts to influence the outcome of this Investigation.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Annex 1 p.35"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lubbers met with the Secretary-General on 18 February 2005, and resigned as High Commissioner on Sunday, 20 February 2005, stating to the press: "For more than four years I gave all my energy to UNHCR. To be frank, despite all my loyalty, insult has now been added to injury and therefore I resign as High Commissioner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/un-refugee-chief-resigns-over-sexual-harassment-scandal/ |title=U.N. refugee chief resigns over sexual harassment scandal |last=Higgins |first=Alexander G. |date=20 February 2005 |work=[[Seattle Times]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruud-lubbers-long-serving-dutch-prime-minister-who-trimmed-welfare-state-dies-at-78/2018/02/14/fa148600-11b0-11e8-9065-e55346f6de81_story.html |title=Ruud Lubbers, long-serving Dutch prime minister who trimmed welfare state, dies at 78 |last=Corder |first=Mike |date=14 February 2018 |work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary-General's office issued a statement the same day which stated that the High Commissioner's resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39901-2005Feb20.html|title=U.N.

During a farewell meeting for Lubbers as High Commissioner for Refugees, he received from Acting High Commissioner [[Wendy Chamberlin]] the first annual UNHCR Achievement Award for exceptional services to UNHCR and for the world's refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhcr.org.ua/unhcr_bel/news.php?in=1&amp;news_id=68%20High%20Commissioner%20Lubbers%20departs%20UNHCR UNHCR News 25 February 2005 High Commissioner Lubbers departs UNHCR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831220612/http://unhcr.org.ua/unhcr_bel/news.php?in=1&amp;news_id=68%20High%20Commissioner%20Lubbers%20departs%20UNHCR |date=31 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a formal statement, Netherlands Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] called the departure of Lubbers "bitter", since the complaint against him had been dismissed as unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/balkenende-wrang-dat-lubbers-opstapt~a662401/ |title=Balkenende: wrang dat Lubbers opstapt |date=20 February 2005 |work=[[De Volkskrant]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 report on sexual exploitation in the aid sector in West Africa'''

Three years prior to the controversy over the sexual harassment case, Ruud Lubbers was criticised for his mis-handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 which uncovered the widespread sexual exploitation of refugee children by aid workers and peacekeepers in three West African countries (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone). The study team which had encountered these findings unexpectedly whilst conducting a broader assessment documented 67 allegations implicating 40 aid agencies and several peacekeeping battalions, and often involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers exchanging meagre aid supplies (biscuits, soap, plastic sheeting) for sex with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/uk/partners/partners/3c7cf89a4/note-implementing-operational-partners-unhcr-save-children-uk-sexual-violence.html|title=Note for Implementing and Operational Partners by UNHCR and Save the Children-UK on Sexual Violence &amp; Exploitation: The Experience of Refugee Children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/global/reports/health-and-nutrition/sexual_violence_and_exploitation_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Ruud Lubbers' response was to deny these findings, discredit the authors and excuse these behaviours; for example in a CNN interview on 8 May 2002, Lubbers was heard to deny the problem in the face of CNN's own research which confirmed the problem existed and was taken to task by the interviewer for dismissing these exploitative relationships ''inter alia'' as 'romances'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/08/i_ins.01.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was roundly criticised by his own staff for that interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://odihpn.org/magazine/the-west-africa-sex-scandal/|title=The West Africa sex scandal - ODI HPN|website=odihpn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite repeated attempts by Lubbers to lead a negative campaign against the report, the international community and governments in particular, took the allegations seriously and passed a UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/57/306, 'Investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees by aid workers in West Africa' in May 2003, requiring the UN to take action at the highest level to tackle such abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/561/73/PDF/N0256173.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|first=ODS|last=Team|website=documents-dds-ny.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Bulletin, 'Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse' in October 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/focal-points/documents-public/secretary-general-s-bulleting-special-measures-protection-sexual|title=Secretary-General‚Äôs Bulletin: Special measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, 2003 - IASC|website=interagencystandingcommittee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an endorsement of the Inter-agency standing Committee's working group on sexual abuse and exploitation which had already been set up a year earlier in June 2002 in response to the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/product-categories/protection-sexual-abuse-and-exploitation|title=Protection from Sexual Abuse and Exploitation - IASC|website=interagencystandingcommittee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informateur===

After the fall of the [[Second Balkenende cabinet]], Lubbers became the ''informateur'' for the formation of the [[Demissionary cabinet|demissionary]] interim [[Third Balkenende cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/informateur-lubbers-komt-even-meedenken~a759748/ |title=Informateur Lubbers komt even meedenken |last=du Pr√© |first=Raoul |date=3 July 2006 |work=[[De Volkskrant]] |access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanford Berman''' (born  October 6, 1933) is a [[librarian]] (specifically, a [[Cataloging|cataloger]]).

He worked for the U.S. Army Special Services Libraries, [[West Germany]] (1962‚Äì1966) where he helped edit an [[underground press]] GI magazine entitled, 'Yin/Yang', Schiller College, Kleiningersheim, West Germany (1966‚Äì1967); University of California at Los Angeles Research Library (1967‚Äì1968), where he rescued back runs of [[I.

==Alternative subject headings==
Berman has been a leading critic of biased headings in the Library of Congress Subject Headings. His 1971 publication, ''Prejudices and Antipathies: A Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People''&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{Citation
    |publisher = Scarecrow Press
    |isbn = 081080431X
    |publication-place = Metuchen, NJ

    |author = Sanford Berman

    |id = 081080431X
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a movement to correct biased subject headings. Berman listed 225 headings with proposed alterations, additions, or deletions and cross-references to "more accurately reflect the language used in addressing these topics, to rectify errors of bias, and to better guide librarians and readers to material of interest".&lt;ref name=knowlton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knowlton|first=Steven A.|title=Three Decades Since Prejudices and Antipathies: A Study of Changes in the Library of Congress Subject Headings|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=40|issue=2|pages=123‚Äì145|doi=10.1300/J104v40n02_08|url=http://www.sanfordberman.org/biblinks/knowlton.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman stated, "The fact that a number of meanings may be assigned to a given word explains why messages are subject to misinterpretation and why our communication is open to misunderstandings." {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He asserted that messages and therefore subject headings must convey an idea in a fashion free from prejudice. Berman realized the continued use of biased subject headings would significantly limit the ability of a patron to access materials in the collection. Berman also thought the use of language in headings should be clear, concise, and reflect the current use of everyday people rather than only scientific or technical terms. Overall, the use of common language in subject headings would enable prompt retrieval of materials by the end user.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Berman also openly criticized centrally performed cataloging and standard cataloging tools that supported bias in subject headings. He stated, "[O]ur national cataloging products and services can't be completely trusted and should not be accepted automatically nor uncritically by anyone who genuinely believes that cataloging should make material more rather than less accessible and retrievable." {{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Cataloging that was outrightly erroneous or inadequate, rendered material inaccessible even though it was in the collection. Berman thought poor cataloging was a serious form of censorship. Libraries were supposed to oppose censorship and provide the widest possible spectrum of cultural, social, economic, political, religious, and sexual information. With this in mind, Berman indicated local libraries should make a conscious effort to describe accurately all materials in the catalog for a patron. A considerable amount of conscious effort meant including "public notes" to clarify unfamiliar concepts for patrons. The public notes would let a patron know whether or not an item would suit the information needs. Furthermore, Berman opposed the practice of not cataloging all important aspects of works. Patrons cannot access materials when they have not been fully catalogued.

The spark of Berman's cataloging revolution was the inclusion in [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH) of the term ''[[Kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]'', which he came across while working in Zambia: "Berman was told by offended [[black]] fellow-workers that calling someone a kafir was similar to being called a [[Nigger (word)|''nigger'']] in [[United States|America]]" (Pendergrast{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}).&lt;ref name="congress"/&gt; This motivated him to systematically address subject heading bias in his work at [[Hennepin County]] Library and in writing ''Prejudices and Antipathies: a Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People''.&lt;ref name="congress"/&gt; The work, published in two editions, examines [[racism]], [[sexism]], Christocentrism, and other biases inherent in the LCSH. Berman also is known for his role in encouraging the Library of Congress to drop such archaic headings as "Water Closet" in favor of contemporary terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berman|first1=Sanford|title=Prejudices and antipathies: A tract on the LC subject heads concerning people.|date=1971|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Metuchen, N. J.|isbn=081080431X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With other Minnesota [[librarians]], as well as those nationally and internationally, Berman is known for promoting activist librarianship in which personal ideals entailing social justice are part and parcel of professional work. Thanks to this advocacy the [[American Library Association]]'s official policy recognizes key role of librarians in addressing social ills. 

With librarian [[James P. Danky]], Berman has been the editor of ''Alternative Library Literature'', (1982‚Äì2001) a biennial compilation of alternative essays on librarianship from a wide variety of other sources. Berman's other titles include ''The Joy of Cataloging'' and ''Worth Noting''. He is the original radical librarian; his followers refer to themselves as "Sandynistas" or guerrilla cataloguers. He was a founding member of a group known as the "Revolting Librarians", who published a manifesto about library-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Jean Weihs|title = Radical Cataloging: Essays at the Front|quote = |publisher = Feliciter|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of the American Library Association's Hunger, Homelessness, and Poverty Task Force, a division of The Social Responsibilities Round Table, which he also co-founded. During recent years he has written and lectured on the failure of ALA and American libraries to help the poor and homeless. In June 2005 he gave the [[Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture]] at the annual ALA conference, dedicated to the founder of OLOS.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

During the last six months of 2005, working with the assistance of Steve Fesenmaier, Berman convinced the Library of Congress to create many new subject headings, including: "[[American Dream]]", "[[Plutocracy]]", "[[West Virginia Mine Wars]], 1897-1921", "The [[Battle of Blair Mountain]], 1921", and several others. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

{{nihongo|'''Satoyama'''|ÈáåÂ±±}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term applied to the border zone or area between mountain [[foothills]] and arable flat land. Literally, ''sato'' ({{linktext|Èáå}}) means village, and ''yama'' ({{linktext|Â±±}}) means hill or mountain. Satoyama have been developed through centuries of small scale agricultural and [[forestry]] use.

The concept of satoyama has several definitions. The first definition is the management of forests through local agricultural communities, using [[coppicing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Takeuchi |first1=K. |last2=Brown |first2=R.D. |last3=Washitani |first3=I. |last4=Tsunekawa |first4=A. |last5=Yokohari |first5=M. |date=18 December 2008 |title=Satoyama: The Traditional Rural Landscape of Japan |url= |location= |publisher=Springer Japan |page= |isbn=9784431000075 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Edo]] era, young and fallen leaves were gathered from community forests to use as [[fertilizer]] in wet rice paddy fields.  Villagers also used wood for construction, cooking and heating. More recently, satoyama has been defined not only as mixed community forests, but also as entire landscapes that are used for agriculture. According to this definition, satoyama contains a mosaic of mixed forests, [[paddy field|rice paddy fields]], dry rice fields, grasslands, streams, ponds, and reservoirs for irrigation. Farmers use the grasslands to feed horses and cattle. Streams, ponds, and reservoirs play an important role in adjusting water levels of paddy fields and farming fish as a food source.&lt;ref name="AMBIO-satoyama"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ambio.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1639%2F0044-7447(2003)032%5B0307%3APCAFST%5D2.0.CO%3B2&amp;ct=1 |title=Participatory Conservation Approaches for Satoyama, the Traditional Forest and Agricultural Landscape of Japan |accessdate= |author=Hiromi Kobori |author2=Richard B.

== Population, ownership, and land use ==
[[File:Tony satoyama .jpg|thumb|Satoyama in [[Kuma, Ehime|Kuma k≈çgen town]], [[Ehime]]]]

Population decline in villages has been a significant driving factor in the disappearance of satoyama from the Japanese landscape. Economic growth from 1955 to 1975 created significant social and economic gaps between cities and villages and led to the depopulation of mountain villages, where life was made difficult by natural conditions such as steep slopes, landslides, and snowfall.  Ownership patterns have also been a factor. Shared ownership of satoyama forests near villages has been common since the beginning of the 19th century. These forests were logged for economic considerations and the construction of houses. Because forests near villages have been cut down, old-growth forests today (including beech forests at high elevations) are often located far from villages. Inhabitants use wood from their private forests and conifer plantations for fuel. By the 1960s, satoyama were utilized as [[rice fields]], plowed fields, [[shifting cultivation]], [[grasslands]], [[thatch]] fields, [[secondary forest]]s for fuel, and giant [[bamboo]] forests.&lt;ref&gt;Fukamachi Katsue, Oku Hirokazu, and Nakashizuka Tohru (2001) The change of a satoyama landscape and its causality in Kamiseyama, [[Kyoto]] Prefecture, Japan between 1970 and 1995. Landscape Ecology 16: 703-71&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
[[File:Satoyama, utilize plant layer.jpg|thumb|Satoyama, utilizing a plant layer, from bottom, [[Field (agriculture)|agriculture field]], ''[[Prunus mume]]'' tree for [[umeboshi]], [[bamboo]] woods and [[thicket]] in [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] Japan.]]

Various habitat types for wildlife have been provided by mixed satoyama landscape as a result of the [[agriculture in Japan|Japanese traditional agricultural system]] that also facilitates the movement of wildlife between a variety of habitats. The migration of wild animals can occur between ponds, rice paddies, grasslands, forests, and also from one village to another.  Ponds, reservoirs, and streams in particular play a significant role in the survival of water dependent species such as [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and [[firefly|fireflies]]. In the early stages of their life cycle, they spend most of their time in water. Deciduous oaks such as ''[[Quercus acutissima]]'' and ''[[Quercus serrata]]'' are planted by farmers to maintain deciduous broad-leaf trees.&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi, Kazuhiko, and R. D. Brown (2003). ''Satoyama: The Traditional Rural Landscape of Japan''. Springer-Verlag Tokyo. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Succession to dense and dark laurel forest is prevented by farmers that cut down these trees for firewood and charcoal every 15 to 20 years. Many plant and animal species are able to live in these deciduous forests because of traditional management practices.

== Causalities of disappearance ==
[[File:Golfsatoyama.jpg|thumb|A number of [[golf course]]s are developed in Satoyama throughout Japan.]]

Satoyama have been disappearing due to the drastic shift in natural resources from charcoal and firewood to oil and the change from compost to chemical fertilizer. Also, the problem of aging in Japanese society can cause the disappearance of satoyama because there are fewer people who can work in satoyama which are considered as [[Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis|intermediate disturbance]] on forests such as coppicing and harvesting trees for [[timber]] and [[charcoal]], cutting shrubs for [[firewood]] and collecting [[litter]] as [[compost]]. These human impacts can help the success of the forest occur. As the final causality of the disappearing of satoyama, pine dominated secondary forests in satoyama were increasingly destroyed since pine wilt disease devastated pine forests in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Morimoto Junko and Yoshida Hironobu (2003) Dynamic changes of native Rhododendron colonies in the urban fringe of Kyoto city in Japan: detecting the long-term dynamism for conservation of secondary nature. Landscape and Urban Planning 70: 195‚Äì204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satoyama. Takeuchi K, Brown R.D., Washitani I., Tsunekawa A., Yokohari M. (2003) The traditional rural landscape of Japan. Landscape and Urban Planning. 229 pp., {{ISBN|4-431-00007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappearance of satoyama has led to threats in many wildlife that inhabit these areas. For example, the species ''Niphanda fusca'', a butterfly that can be found in satoyama landscapes, has become endangered partly due to the degradation of this ecosystem. This butterfly inhabits early stages of succession, so the progression of these ecosystems into later stages has caused the loss of a habitat for the butterflies. ''N. fusca''&amp;nbsp;is listed in the Japan Red List as endangered&amp;nbsp;‚Äì there has been around a 39% decrease in their records in prefectures.&lt;ref&gt;Yasuhiro Nakamura (2011). Conservation of butterflies in Japan: status, actions, and strategy. Journal of Insect Conservation. Vol 15(1-2), 5-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi, T., Takahashi, J., Kiyoshi, T. et al (2015). Genetic differentiation in the endangered myrmecophilous butterfly Niphanda fusca: a comparison of natural and secondary habitats. Conservation Genetics Vol 16(4): 979.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
Throughout the 80s and 90s, the satoyama conservation movement was implemented in Japan.  As of 2001, there are more than 500 environmental groups that work for the conservation of satoyama. Because of their efforts, satoyama has become more prevalent in Japanese landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi Kazuhiko, Wahitani Izumi and Tsunekawa Atsushi (2001). Satoyama: The Traditional Rural Landscape of Japan. University Tokyo Press 133‚Äì135 {{ISBN|4-13-060301-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Satoyama Initiative]] was established at [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris in 2009 as a global effort to realize "societies in harmony with nature" through the recognition and promotion of satoyama landscapes and similar landscapes around the world as a good model for conservation of biodiversity and human well-being. In 2010, the Satoyama Initiative was recognized in Decision X/32 of the Conference of the Parties to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD COP) as "a potentially useful tool to better understand and support human-influenced natural environments for the benefit of biodiversity and human well-being" and "consistent and in harmony with the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-10/cop-10-dec-32-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative]] was also launched at the same CBD COP meeting and taken note of in the Decision as " one mechanism to carry out activities identified by the Satoyama Initiative including collecting and analysing case-studies, distilling lessons, and promoting research on different practices of sustainable use of biological resources, as well as increasing awareness and supporting on-the-ground projects and activities in human-influenced natural environments".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-10/cop-10-dec-32-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The satoyama of [[Saitama Prefecture]] have been illustrated in anime with great precision and artistic attention to detail in the very popular film, ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', by [[Studio Ghibli]], under the direction of the studio's head and founder, [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. The prominence of the satoyama as environment for the story has stirred popular interest in the regions, and encouraged conservation efforts in recent times, in large part thanks to this film.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

[[David Attenborough]] also narrated a one-hour program called ''Satoyama'' for NHK in 2004.

The [[Japanese idol]] company [[Hello! Project]] Launched a new show called Hello! SATOYAMA Life. Hello! SATOYAMA Life is a TV show showcasing the members of Hello! Project, including [[Morning Musume]], [[Berryz Koubou]], [[‚ÑÉ-ute]], [[Mano Erina]], [[S/mileage]], and [[Mitsui Aika]]. Hello! SATOYAMA Life is based on agriculture and nature. Different girls are selected to take a camera around and film various topics about agriculture and nature. The show is aired on [[TV Tokyo]].

The Japanese culture and lifestyle television show ''[[Begin Japanology]]'' aired on [[NHK World]] featured a full episode on Satoyama in 2009.

Beneficiaries (technically [[referent]]s) of security may be persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems, and any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by its environment.

Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example, as the absence of harm (e.g. [[freedom from want]]); as the presence of an essential good (e.g. [[food security]]); as [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); as secrecy (e.g. a [[Telephone tapping|secure telephone line]]); as containment (e.g. a secure room or [[Prison cell|cell]]); and as a state of mind (e.g. [[emotional security]]).

The term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security: (e.g. [[security forces]]; [[security guard]]; [[Computer security|cyber security systems]]; [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras;]] [[remote guarding]]).

== Etymology ==
The word 'secure' entered the English language in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is derived from Latin ''securus'', meaning freedom from anxiety: ''se'' (without) + ''cura'' (care, anxiety).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/secure|title=Origin and meaning of secure|last=Online Etymology Dictionary|first=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

==='Referent' ===
A security [[referent]] is the focus of a security policy or discourse; for example, a referent may be a potential beneficiary (or victim) of a security policy or system.

Security referents may be persons or social groups, objects, institutions, ecosystems, or any other phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by the forces of its environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Barry Buzan, Ole W√¶ver, and Jaap de Wilde, ''Security: A New Framework for Analysis'' (Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The referent in question may combine many referents, in the same way that, for example, a nation state is composed of many individual citizens.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rethinkingsecurityorguk.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rethinking-security-a-discussion-paper.pdf|title=Rethinking Security: A discussion paper|last=Gee|first=D|date=2016|website=rethinkingsecurity.org.uk|publisher=Ammerdown Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Context ===
The security context is the relationships between a security referent and its environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From this perspective, security and insecurity depend first on whether the environment is beneficial or hostile to the referent, and also how capable is the referent of responding to its/their environment in order to survive and thrive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Capabilities ===
The means by which a referent provides for security (or is provided for) vary widely. They include, for example:
* ''Coercive capabilities'', including the capacity to project coercive power into the environment (e.g. [[aircraft carrier]], [[handgun]]);
* ''Protective systems'' (e.g. lock, fence, [[antivirus software]], [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence system]])
* ''Warning systems'' (e.g. alarm, [[radar]])
* ''Diplomatic and social action'' intended to prevent insecurity from developing (e.g. [[Conflict transformation|conflict prevention and transformation]] strategies); and
* ''Policy'' intended to develop the lasting economic, physical, ecological and other conditions of security (e.g. [[Economics|economic]] reform, [[Ecology|ecological]] protection, [[Demilitarisation|progressive demilitarization]]).

=== Effects ===
Any action intended to provide security may have multiple effects. For example, an action may have wide benefit, enhancing security for several or all security referents in the context; alternatively, the action may be effective only temporarily, or benefit one referent at the expense of another, or be entirely ineffective or counterproductive.

=== Contested approaches ===
Approaches to security are contested and the subject of debate. For example, in debate about [[National security|national security strategies]], some argue that security depends principally on developing protective and coercive capabilities in order to protect the security referent in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of [[Full-spectrum dominance|strategic supremacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45289|title=Joint Vision 2020 Emphasizes Full-spectrum Dominance|last=US, Department of Defense|first=|date=2000|website=archive.defense.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmdfence/512/51202.htm|title=Re-thinking defence to meet new threats|last=House of Commons Defence Committee|first=|date=2015|website=publications.parliament.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/building-a-british-military-fit-for-future-challenges-rather-than-past-conflicts|title=Building a British military fit for future challenges rather than past conflicts|last=General Sir Nicholas Houghton|first=|date=2015|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcnl.org/updates/peace-through-shared-security-79|title=Peace Through Shared Security|last=FCNL|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/658007519|title=Losing control : global security in the twenty-first century|last=Rogers|first=P|date=2010|publisher=Pluto Press|year=|isbn=9780745329376|edition=3rd|location=London|pages=|oclc=658007519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-end}}The range of security contexts is illustrated by the following examples (in alphabetical order):

===Computer security===
{{Main|Computer security}}
[[Computer security]], also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as [[computer]]s and smartphones, as well as [[computer network]]s such as private and public networks, and the [[Internet access|Internet]]. The field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], May 07, 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed. The means of computer security include the [[physical security]] of systems and [[information security|security of information]] held on them.

=== Corporate security ===
{{Main|Corporate security}}
Corporate security refers to the resilience of [[corporation]]s against [[espionage]], theft, damage, and other threats. The security of corporations has become more complex as reliance on IT systems has increased, and their physical presence has become more highly distributed across several countries, including environments that are, or may rapidly become, hostile to them.[[File:Delta World HQ - entrance with security station.JPG|thumb|Security checkpoint at the entrance to the [[Delta Air Lines]] [[corporate headquarters]] in [[Atlanta]]]]

[[File:Mall culture jakarta94.jpg|thumb|Security checkpoint at the entrance to a [[shopping mall]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]

=== Ecological security ===
{{Main|Environmental security}}
Ecological security, also known as environmental security, refers to the integrity of [[ecosystem]]s and the [[biosphere]], particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a [[Biodiversity|diversity of life-forms]] (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/161|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2010|last=United Nations General Assembly|first=|date=2010|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Graffiti about environmental security.jpg|thumb|[[Graffiti]] about [[Environmental security|ecological security]], [[Belarus]], 2016]]

=== Food security ===
{{Main|Food security}}
Food security refers to the ready supply of, and access to, safe and [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security|last=United Nations|first=|date=|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food security is gaining in importance as the world's population has grown and productive land has diminished through overuse and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/209369/icode/|title=Greater focus on soil health needed to feed a hungry planet|last=Food and Agriculture Organizatoin|first=|date=2013|website=www.fao.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/|title=Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues|last=Arsenault|first=C|date=2014|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GLOBAL WARMING AFFECTING GLOBAL AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY.pdf|thumb|[[Climate change]] is affecting global [[agriculture]] and [[food security]]]]

=== Home security ===
{{Main|Home security}}
Home security normally refers to the security systems used on a property used as a dwelling (commonly including doors, locks, alarm systems, lighting, fencing); and personal security practices (such as ensuring doors are locked, alarms activated, windows closed etc.)[[File:Security spikes 1.jpg|thumb|Security spikes protect a [[gated community]] in the [[East End of London]].]]

=== Human security ===
{{Main|Human security}}
[[File:War in Gaza 018 - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Boys play among the bombed-out ruins of [[Gaza City]], 2009]]
Human security is the name of an emerging [[paradigm]] which, in response to traditional emphasis on the right of nation states to protect themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html|title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter VII|last=United Nations|first=|date=1945|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has focused on the primacy of the security of people (individuals and communities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/humansecurity/|title=UN Trust Fund for Human Security|last=United Nations|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is supported by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which has stressed "the right of people to live in [[freedom]] and [[dignity]]" and recognized "that all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are entitled to [[freedom from fear]] and [[freedom from want]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/idrl/I520EN.pdf|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly 60/1: World Summit Outcome|last=United Nations General Assembly|first=|date=2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National security ===
{{Main|National security}}
National security refers to the security of a [[nation state]], including its people, economy, and institutions. In practice, state governments rely on a wide range of means, including [[diplomacy]], [[economic power]], and [[Military|military capabilities]].

== Perceptions of security ==
Since it is not possible to know with precision the extent to which something is 'secure' (and a measure of vulnerability is unavoidable), perceptions of security vary, often greatly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, a fear of death by earthquake is common in the United States (US), but slipping on the bathroom floor kills more people;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bruce Schneier, ''Beyond Fear: Thinking about Security in an Uncertain World'', Copernicus Books, pages 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; and in France, the United Kingdom and the US there are far fewer deaths caused by [[terrorism]] than there are women killed by their partners in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/report-terrorism-acts-2011.pdf|title=The Terrorism Acts in 2011|last=David Anderson QC|first=|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womensaid.org.uk/what-is-femicide/|title=What is femicide?|last=Womens Aid|first=|date=|work=Womens Aid|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upworthy.com/dont-believe-in-the-war-on-women-would-a-body-count-change-your-mind|title=Don't Believe In The War On Women? Would A Body Count Change Your Mind?|work=Upworthy|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2015/06/11/violences-conjugales-118-femmes-tuees-en-2014_1327822|title=Violences conjugales: 118 femmes tu√©es en 2014|work=Lib√©ration.fr|access-date=2017-12-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem of perception is the common assumption that the mere presence of a security system (such as [[Military|armed forces]], or [[antivirus software]]) implies security. For example, two [[computer security]] programs installed on the same device can prevent each other from working properly, while the user assumes that he or she benefits from twice the protection that only one program would afford.

[[Security theater]] is a critical term for measures that change perceptions of security without necessarily affecting security itself. For example, visual signs of security protections, such as a home that advertises its alarm system, may deter an [[Trespasser|intruder]], whether or not the system functions properly. Similarly, the [[Security increase|increased presence of military personnel]] on the streets of a city after a [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]] may help to reassure the public, whether or not it diminishes the risk of further attacks.

==Security concepts (examples)==
Certain concepts recur throughout different fields of security:
* [[Access control]] - the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource.
* [[Assurance services|Assurance]] - an expression of confidence that a security measure will perform as expected.
* [[Authorization]] - the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.
* [[Countermeasure]] - a means of preventing an act or system from having its intended effect.
* [[Defense in depth]] - a school of thought holding that a wider range of security measures will enhance security.
* [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploit]] (noun) - a means of capitalising on a vulnerability in a security system (usually a cybersecurity system).
* [[Identity management]] - enables the right individuals to access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons.
* [[Resilience (organizational)|Resilience]] - the degree to which a person, community, nation or system is able to resist adverse external forces.
* [[Risk]] - a possible event which could lead to damage, harm, or loss.
* [[Security management]] - identification of an organization's assets (including people, buildings, machines, systems and information assets), followed by the development, documentation, and implementation of policies and procedures for protecting these assets.
* [[Threat]] - a potential source of harm.
* [[Vulnerability]] - the degree to which something may be changed (usually in an unwanted manner) by external forces.

The '''Social Creed''' originated to express [[Methodism|Methodism's]] outrage over the miserable lives of the millions of workers in factories, mines, mills, tenements and company towns.&lt;ref name="UMC - Our Faith"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=16&amp;mid=5425| title = What is the creed of The United Methodist Church? |publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], the first [[Christian denomination|denomination]] in [[Christendom]] to adopt an official ''Social Creed''. As a part of [[United Methodist]] social principles,&lt;ref name="UMC"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1836| title = Our Social Creed |publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United Methodist congregations are encouraged to regularly reflect upon the creed and use it in [[service of worship|worship services]].&lt;ref name="UMC"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1836| title = Our Social Creed |publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

Influenced by the [[Social Gospel]] movement and the Progressive politics of early 20th century America, the Church wrote and adopted the creed in 1908. It has been altered through the years, and still appears in ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'', following the ''Social Principles'' section.&lt;ref name="UMC - Our Faith"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=16&amp;mid=5425| title = What is the creed of The United Methodist Church? |publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Creed ==

{{quote|We believe in God, Creator of the world; and in Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of creation. We believe in the Holy Spirit, through whom we acknowledge God‚Äôs gifts, and we repent of our sin in misusing these gifts to idolatrous ends.

We affirm the natural world as God's handiwork and dedicate ourselves to its preservation, enhancement, and faithful use by humankind.

We joyfully receive for ourselves and others the blessings of community, sexuality, marriage, and the family.

We commit ourselves to the rights of men, women, children, youth, young adults, the aging, and people with disabilities; to improvement of the quality of life; and to the rights and dignity of all persons.

We believe in the right and duty of persons to work for the glory of God and the good of themselves and others and in the protection of their welfare in so doing; in the rights to property as a trust from God, collective bargaining, and responsible consumption; and in the elimination of economic and social distress.

We dedicate ourselves to peace throughout the world, to the rule of justice and law among nations, and to individual freedom for all people of the world.

We believe in the present and final triumph of God‚Äôs Word in human affairs and gladly accept our commission to manifest the life of the gospel in the world. Amen.}}

The current Social Creed as it appears in the 2008 Book of Discipline, ¬∂ 166.

== 1908 Methodist Social Creed ==
The Methodist Episcopal Church stands: 

{{quote|For equal rights and complete justice for all men in all stations of life.

For the principles of conciliation and arbitration in industrial dissensions.

For the protection of the worker from [[Occupational safety and health|dangerous machinery, occupational diseases, injuries and mortality]].

For the abolition of [[child labor]].

For such regulation of the conditions of labor for women as shall safeguard the physical and moral health of the community.

For the suppression of the "[[sweating system]]."

For the gradual and reasonable reduction of the [[Eight-hour day|hours of labor]] to the lowest practical point, with work for all; and for that degree of leisure for all which is the condition of the highest human life.

For a release for [from] employment [[Christian Sabbath|one day in seven]].

For a [[living wage]] in every industry.

For the highest wage that each industry can afford, and for the most equitable division of the products of industry that can ultimately be devised.

For the recognition of the [[Golden Rule]] and the mind of Christ as the supreme law of society and the sure remedy for all social ills.


When the Federal Council of Churches adopted the social creed in December 1908, they added the following phrase at the end: 

To the toilers of America and to those who by organized effort are seeking to lift the crushing burdens of the poor, and to reduce the hardships and uphold the [[dignity of labor]], this Council sends the greeting of human brotherhood and the pledge of sympathy and of help in a cause which belongs to all who follow Christ.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalcouncilofchurches.us/common-witness/1908/social-creed.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sch√ºtz, Durkheim, and Spencer==

The problem of social reality has been treated exhaustively by philosophers in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition, particularly [[Alfred Sch√ºtz]], who used the term "social world" to designate this distinct level of reality. Within the social world, Sch√ºtz distinguished between social reality that could be experienced directly (''umwelt'') and a social reality beyond the immediate horizon, which could yet be experienced if sought out.&lt;ref&gt;George Walsh, "Introduction", Alfred Sch√ºtz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1997)p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, [[ethnomethodology]] explored further the unarticulated structure of our everyday competence and ability with social reality.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the subject had been addressed in [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines. For example, [[√âmile Durkheim]] stressed the distinct nature of "the social kingdom. Here more than anywhere else the idea is the reality".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. van der Eyden, ''Public Management of Society'' (2003) p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]] had coined the term ''[[superorganism|super-organic]]'' to distinguish the social level of reality above the biological and psychological.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Spencer, ''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 1. "The Data of Sociology"(1876)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searle==

[[John Searle]] has used the theory of [[speech act]]s to explore the nature of social/institutional reality, so as to describe such aspects of social reality which he instances under the rubrics of "marriage, property, hiring, firing, war, revolutions, cocktail parties, governments, meetings, unions, parliaments, corporations, laws, restaurants, vacations, lawyers, professors, doctors, medieval knights, and taxes, for example".&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (Penguin 1996) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle argued that such institutional realities interact with each other in what he called "systematic relationships (e.g., governments, marriages, corporations, universities, armies, churches)"&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; to create a multi-layered social reality.

For Searle, language was the key to the formation of social reality because "language is precisely designed to be a self-identifying category of institutional facts"; i.e., a system of publicly and widely accepted symbols which "persist through time independently of the urges and inclinations of the participants."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 73 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective/subjective==

There is a debate in [[social theory]] about whether social reality exists independently of people's involvement with it, or whether (as in [[social constructionism]]) it is only created by the human process of ongoing interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Giddens, ''Sociology'' (2006) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Peter L. Berger]] argued for a new concern with the basic process of the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Berger stated that the social construction of reality was a process made up of three steps: externalization, objectivation and internalization. In similar fashion, post-[[Sartre|Sartrians]] like [[R. D. Laing]] stress that, "once certain fundamental structures of experience are shared, they come to be experienced as objective entities...they take on the force and character of partial autonomous realities, with their own way of life".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the same time, Laing insisted that such a socially real grouping "can be nothing else than the multiplicity of the points of view and actions of its members...even where, through the interiorization of this multiplicity as synthesized by each, this synthesized multiplicity becomes ubiquitous in space and enduring in time".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a social reality independent of individuals or the ecology would seem at odds with the views of [[perceptual psychology]], including those of [[J. J. Gibson]], and those of most [[ecological economics]] theories.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scholars such as John Searle argue on the one hand that "a socially constructed reality presupposes a reality independent of all social constructions".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he accepts that social realities are humanly created, and that "the secret to understanding the continued existence of institutional facts is simply that the individuals directly involved and a sufficient number of members of the relevant communities must continue to recognize and accept the existence of such facts".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 190 and p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialisation and the Capital Other==

[[Freud]] saw a child's induction into social reality as consolidated with the passing of the [[Oedipus complex]] and the internalisation of the parents: "the same figures who continue to operate in the [[super-ego]] as the agency we know as conscience...also belong to the real external world. It is from there that they were drawn; their power, behind which lie hidden all the influences of the past and of tradition, was one of the most strongly-felt manifestations of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] clarified the point by stressing that this was "a highly significant moment in the transfer of powers from the subject to the Other, what I call the Capital Other...the field of the Other ‚Äì which, strictly speaking, is the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 129 and p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considered that "the Oedipus complex...superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of nature",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''√âcrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the child into [[The Symbolic|the Symbolic Order]].

Within that order, [[Lacanianism|Lacanians]] consider that "institutions, as ''signifying practices'', are much more extensive structures than romantic notions allow and they thus implicate us in ways which narrower definitions cannot recognize...exceed any intersubjective intention or effect".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Copjec, in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, Searle asserts that "institutional power ‚Äì massive, pervasive, and typically invisible ‚Äì permeates every nook and cranny of our social lives...the invisible structure of social reality".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 94 and p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring trust==

If one accepts the validity of the idea of social reality, scientifically, it must be amenable to measurement, something which has been explored particularly in relation to [[trust (social sciences)|trust]]. "Trust is...part of a community's [[social capital]], as [[Francis Fukuyama]] argues, and has deep historical and cultural roots".&lt;ref&gt;Will Hutton, ''The State to Come'' (London 1997) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of the measurement of trust in the sociological community are usually called theories of social capital, to emphasize the connection to [[economics]], and the ability to measure outputs in the same manner.

==Propaganda==

One aspect of social reality is the principle of the "[[big lie]]", which states that an outrageous untruth is easier to convince people of than a less outrageous truth. Many examples from [[politics]] and [[theology]] (e.g., the claim that the [[Roman Emperor]] was in fact a "god") demonstrate that this principle was known by effective [[Propaganda|propagandists]] from early times, and continues to be applied to this day. The [[propaganda model]] of [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] supports the "big lie" thesis with more specifics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">An '''undervote''' occurs when the number of choices selected by a voter in a contest is less than the minimum number allowed for that contest or when no selection is made for a single choice contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eac.gov/voting%20systems/docs/vvsgvolumei.pdf/attachment_download/file/ 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613012027/http://www.eac.gov/voting%20systems/docs/vvsgvolumei.pdf/attachment_download/file |date=2008-06-13 }}, pA-18 [[Election Assistance Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contested election, an undervote can be construed as active voter disaffection; a voter engaged enough to cast a vote without the willingness to give the vote to any candidate. An undervote can be intentional for purposes including [[protest vote]]s, [[tactical voting]], or [[abstention]]. Alternately undervotes can be unintentional and caused by many factors including poor [[Ballot design#Design|ballot design]].

Undervotes combined with [[overvote]]s (known as [[residual vote]]s) can be an academic indicator in evaluating the accuracy of a voting system when recording [[voter]] intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Voter invitations.jpg|thumb|350 px|right|Voter invitation cards of the USSR and Russia from various years (obverse)]]
A '''voter invitation card''', or '''voter notification card''', or '''notice of election card''', is an informational leaflet, usually of the size of a [[postcard]], which requests voters to attend the [[elections]] and which generally contains information regarding elections, place and time of voting, contact details of the [[Election management body|electoral commission]].  Having certain artistic and undoubtedly historic merits, invitations to vote are [[collectibles]].

== By country ==
=== INDIA ===
{{Emptysection|date=February 2013}}

=== USSR ===
The [[USSR]] voter cards are often called "All come to vote" cards ({{lang-ru|"–æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∫–∏ ¬´–í—Å–µ –Ω–∞ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä—ã¬ª"}}) because during the Soviet Union period they inevitably carried an inscription, a slogan "All come to vote". One side of such voter invitation cards usually was artistically illustrated, while the other (reverse) side contained information. The text on such voter cards during the Soviet time carried invariable components: words "Dear comrade _____________. Please be reminded that on Sunday ‚Ä¶"; and an appeal to come and vote for candidates of the electoral bloc of communists and independents. Voter invitation cards were sent on behalf of "trustee persons of the constituency election campaign conference of workers' representatives", campaign team, and were always characterized by electoral campaign propaganda, requesting to vote for the candidates of the electoral bloc of communists and independents.

=== Russian Federation ===
In Russia voter invitation cards are no longer electoral campaign propaganda. Their function is only to inform of elections, time of voting and location of the polling station, and more often than not contain only text without any images.
